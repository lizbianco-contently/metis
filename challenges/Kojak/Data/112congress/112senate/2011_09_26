Mr. President, 2 weeks ago the Senate passed a bipartisan \nbill to fund the Federal Emergency Management Agency, known as FEMA. \nFor 2 weeks House Republicans have been sitting on that bill and taking \nno action. The House of Representatives has refused to act on a \nbipartisan bill to fund FEMA for the next year. Not only have they not \nmoved that bill in any way but they left town. The House of \nRepresentatives, as we speak, on the eve of the government shutting \ndown next Saturday, just a few days from now, and with FEMA on the \nverge of having no money, left. They are gone. They are not in \nWashington. It is hard to negotiate with people who are not here. It is \nhard to do legislation when one part of our bicameral legislature is \nnot here.\n  Democrats are not giving up on funding FEMA and keeping our \ngovernment open. We are here. The Senate is in session. The House \nRepublican bill that would have killed 45,000 American jobs did not \nhave the votes last week to pass the Senate. It was not even close. \nThere were 36 votes, but that does not mean we have to shut down the \ngovernment or abandon Americans in need. Democrats have made a good-\nfaith effort to compromise.\n  Today the Senate will consider compromise legislation to fund FEMA \nand keep the government open without killing jobs. Our compromise \nincludes a clean continuing resolution, a bill to fund the government \nfor the next few weeks. Republicans in both Chambers have already \nagreed to and voted for the funding levels in this continuing \nresolution, so this should not be a controversial vote for them; they \nhave already voted for it.\n  The legislation also includes $3.65 billion in funding for FEMA, \nwhich will give American communities ravaged by floods, wildfires, \ntornadoes, and other disasters the help they need. We know House \nRepublicans support that funding level as well since they voted for it \nlast week. Democrats would have given FEMA more, as we did with our \nvote last week.\n  It is interesting; President Obama has declared disasters in 48 of \nthe 50 States this year. Unfortunately, though, this bill will force us \nto revisit this issue in a few weeks when FEMA funds will be depleted \nagain. But this compromise legislation will cure FEMA's immediate \nneeds. I urge my colleagues to do what is right and support this good-\nfaith compromise to help disaster victims now. In effect, we are \nwaiting for the House to take action on the bill that funds everything \nfor a year, which they should do. But in the meantime, we have the \nopportunity here to vote today on legislation that takes the level that \nhas already passed the House. I do not know how much\n\n[[Page S5962]]\n\nmore we could compromise or how much more fair we could be. I urge my \ncolleagues to do what is right and support this good-faith compromise \nto help disaster victims and help them now.\n  The folks on the ground in States that have been hard hit by \ndisasters, people who have seen the devastation firsthand, are all \nsaying the same thing: There is no more time to waste. The U.S. \nConference of Mayors has begged us to act, a bipartisan group of \nGovernors has pleaded with us to act, and tens of thousands of \nAmericans in every State in the Union are demanding we act. Republicans \nmust not continue to block FEMA, blocking them from getting the \nresources it needs to help disaster victims.\n  This compromise legislation should satisfy House Republicans and \nincludes their own much lower FEMA funding number. It satisfies \nDemocrats because it does not include a $1.5 billion cut that would \nkill jobs. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of \nManufacturers have warned us that this cut would kill 45,000 jobs at a \ntime when our economy and our country can least afford it.\n  Here is what the Chamber of Commerce has said. The Chamber of \nCommerce is not a lapdog for Democrats. I appreciate the work they do. \nBut certainly we need to listen to what they are saying, and my \nRepublican colleagues need listen to what they are saying. This is a \ndirect quote:\n\n       This loan program promotes manufacturing in the U.S. and is \n     an important component of America's energy security.\n\n  Promotes manufacturing.\n  Here is what the National Association of Manufacturers said, also \ncertainly not out there promoting Democrats all the time. They try to \nbe fair. The National Association of Manufacturers:\n\n       Defunding [this program] would hurt manufacturers and their \n     employees.\n\n  How much more direct could it be? Putting this offset in here is \nabsolutely wrong. Democrats believe and American auto producers agree \nyou should not have to choose between saying no to disaster victims and \nkilling American jobs.\n  As you can see, this legislation is fair to both sides. It will get \ndisaster victims the help they need without killing jobs. It is a \ncommonsense solution that should pass both Chambers with bipartisan \nsupport. We will vote on it shortly. I am cautiously optimistic that my \nRepublican colleagues here in the Senate will not force a government \nshutdown. By not voting for our bill, that is what it is.\n\n  Earlier this month when the Senate passed bipartisan legislation \nfunding FEMA, which I talked about earlier, 10 Republicans joined \nDemocrats in voting for the bill. It would have given FEMA nearly twice \nthe funding this compromise legislation gives FEMA. At a time when \nthose 10 Republicans said they believed disaster relief should be \nimmune from partisan politics, they believe their constituents should \nnot wait a moment longer for help, I can only assume those Republicans \nare as angry as I am over the delays by their Republican colleagues in \nthe House. In the week since that vote--it has not been long, a very \nshort period of time, a matter of days--the disasters have not gone \naway in the home States of Missouri, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maine, \nNevada, North Dakota, Alaska, Florida, Pennsylvania. These are the \nStates where Republican Senators voted for this bill, and rightfully \nso. Roads and bridges, homes, schools, in those States and many others \nmust still be repaired and replaced. In fact, millions of dollars of \nthis restoration work--most of it--has been stopped in those 10 States. \nWork on nearly $\\1/2\\ billion worth of reconstruction nationwide has \nbeen delayed because FEMA is out of money.\n  Even with construction projects at risk in communities that were only \njust beginning to get back on their feet, FEMA's disaster fund will \nstill run out of money this week. As to what date, that is debatable. \nFEMA has devoted every penny in its coffers to pay for food and shelter \nfor families who lost their homes in major disasters in the last few \nmonths. There is not a dime left for anything else. Even now that money \nis going to run dry if we do not do something quickly. That is why I am \nhopeful Republicans will do the right thing today.\n  We must remember that we are not talking about zeros on a budget \nspreadsheet. FEMA takes care of people who have lost their moms and \ndads, sons and daughters, spouses and friends and others. Without \nadditional funding, thousands of people who have lost literally \neverything they have owned will be forced to go without food and \nshelter. The reconstruction will be delayed in communities where homes, \nschools, roads have been wiped off the map by tragedy so terrible it is \ndifficult to comprehend.\n  I brought a chart here to show some of the devastation. The upper \nlefthand corner is a picture of part of Joplin, MO. There is some of it \nthat is wiped out. You see a few structures and cars left in the \nrubble. The fire is still burning. This picture was taken just hours \nafter that storm hit.\n  I have talked on the floor about the windstorm, the winds of almost \n300 miles an hour--I said, winds of 300 miles an hour, not almost. One \nof my Senator friends came to me and said, that could not be true; I do \nnot think that is true. I knew I was right because in the last week or \n10 days I went to a briefing with the National Science Foundation. They \nput forward some of the new things they have invented and are now \ndeveloping, and one of those is to gauge how hard the wind blows. It is \ninteresting to note that we have a number of recorded storms blowing \nmore than 300 miles an hour. On this one they do not have the exact \nnumber down, but probably that. This is one of the worst storms to ever \nhit our country.\n  Here is a picture of Nags Head, NC. This is Hurricane Irene. It not \nonly washed homes out to sea, it washed other facilities out to sea and \ndevastated homes underwater. You can see the picture of the two people \nsitting on those steps. That was probably one of the seaside homes. It \ncould have been a structure right on the coast, but it is gone. The \nhome has been washed into the sea. It is not only in North Carolina but \nother places.\n  You can see here in the lower righthand corner a small picture of the \nfires in Texas. The fires in Texas burned more than 2,000 homes. They \nhave had thousands of fires in Texas. Look at it. You can see in the \nbackground there are homes burning. It is hard to comprehend the \ndestruction that took place there.\n  Cairo, IL, is a unique place because it is spelled like Cairo, but \nthey pronounce it ``Kay-row.'' That is a picture of Cairo, IL. It is a \ngood-sized city. The Mississippi River has overflowed its banks. It \nswept away everything in its path. This is more important than \npolitics. Tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, floods are just some of the \ndevastation that has affected our citizens.\n  Here we are, having passed a bill and sent it to the House. They have \ndone nothing with it. We have overwhelming bipartisan support here, and \nthey are gone. They had that 2 weeks ago, and they are gone. What we \nare doing here should be more important than partisan posturing for \nevery Member of the Republican Party--and, frankly, every Member of the \nDemocratic Party. I know it is to me.\n  President Truman once said:\n\n       America was built on courage, on imagination and an \n     unbeatable determination to do the job at hand.\n\n  If there were ever a time when we have the obligation to do the job \nat hand, it is here. And to think that work in Joplin, MO, has \nbasically come to a standstill or work in Nags Head, NC, has come to a \nstandstill or in Cairo, IL, and, of course, all through Texas--only a \nfew of the projects as a result of Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm \nLee are being worked on now.\n  So I don't think anyone can understand the devastation unless one has \nbeen there. I know I can't. No amount of money can ever replace what \nthe people of Joplin or Cairo have lost. When I say ``unless a person \nhas been there,'' I am trying to be as empathetic as I can, but I have \nnever been involved in a flood such as that, anywhere near that, and \ncertainly not the fires we have seen, not a tornado, not a tropical \nstorm. So no amount of money can ever replace what the people of these \ndevastated areas have lost, but at least we can help them get back on \ntheir feet. We can help them start over. That is what FEMA does. That \nis what FEMA's job is. So it is up to us to get the funds to FEMA so \nthey can do their job.\n\n[[Page S5963]]\n\n  Would the Chair announce the business for the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/26/senate-section/article/S5963-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to follow up on the remarks of \nLeader Reid by reminding everyone how unfortunate but in some ways \nnecessary this situation is.\n  This whole debate, in my view, is worth having. It is unfortunate it \nis so close to the end of the year because the Senate actually offered \na bill, as the Presiding Officer may remember, earlier in September to \ntry to avoid getting to this last minute. But this whole controversy \nstarted just a few days after Hurricane Irene had raked the east coast \nand wreaked havoc from North Carolina, through Connecticut, into \nVermont and New Hampshire, and people are still reeling. The way this \ncontroversy started was Representative Cantor said: Before we can \nprovide help, we need to find an offset in the budget. In other words, \nbefore we can help the victims of Irene--the thousands of homes that \nwere flooded, the electrical wires on the ground, the businesses \nflooded out--we have to go to Washington and find a program to cut. I \nstrongly objected then, and I have objected every day since then to \nthat Cantor doctrine. So this is an argument and a debate worth having.\n  This could have been completely avoided if, the day after, \nRepresentative Cantor, with all the outcry from his own district and \nnewspapers around the country, many of which editorialized against that \nposition, would have just said: I am sorry, I made a mistake. And I \nhave had to say that in my political career: I am sorry, I made a \nmistake. But instead of saying that, he doubled down, and he doubled \ndown on the backs of people from Pennsylvania, to New York, and \nactually to Louisiana and Mississippi because it is our projects that \nhave been stopped for the last 6 weeks. FEMA, as far as Louisiana is \nconcerned, was out of money 6 weeks ago.\n  This is what the Cantor doctrine looks like to a very clever \ncartoonist. I am going to put this up in my office and keep it forever. \nIt says:\n\n       Welcome to the Republican disaster relief hotline. At the \n     tone, please tell us the emergency and how you plan to offset \n     the cost of your rescue.\n\n  Here is Grandmother sitting on the roof, with her little cat on the \nchimney, with her television and her cane, calling FEMA.\n  I am the appropriations chair of this committee, as my colleagues \nknow. It is a good thing I am chairing this appropriations committee \nbecause I happen to know a lot about disaster relief, having to lead \nthe effort for the gulf coast in the wake of Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and \nIke. This is not a little matter, as some of the press reported over \nthe weekend. I have read most of the editorials from coast to coast. \nSome have written: Why is Congress arguing? This is such a minor \nmatter. I don't think the $40 billion it took to rebuild the gulf coast \nis a minor matter, and I don't think any taxpayer in America would \nthink $40 billion is a minor matter.\n  This Cantor doctrine must be rejected. I am not the only one who \nbelieves this. There are wonderful articles and editorials in papers \nall across the country. I am going to read some of them today. I am so \nglad people were working through the weekend and focusing on this \ndebate.\n  From Colorado, the Denver Post writes:\n\n     . . . and some Members of Congress are so bent on budget \n     cutting--\n\n  They are referring to the Republicans, of course--\n\n     that they happily seize the opportunity to demand \n     concessions, despite the larger impact on our struggling \n     economy. In this case, it is demanding that money for the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide emergency \n     disaster assistance to communities hit by flood, fire, and \n     other manner of natural disasters, be offset by comparable \n     cuts to the Federal budget. Demanding such offsets is \n     unprecedented in terms of emergency relief, and it has again \n     manufactured the prospects of a shutdown. To be clear, we are \n     not supporting a blank check--\n\n  And neither am I. I have been an appropriator since I was 23 years \nold. I am 56. I understand balanced budgets and debt limits and curbing \ngovernment spending. I have been a part of those efforts. The last time \nwe had a balanced budget, a Democrat was in the White House--Bill \nClinton--as the Presiding Officer knows. We understand there is no such \nthing as a free lunch or a blank check, and we are going to pay for \nthese disasters, but we don't have to pay for them while Grandmother is \non the roof. We can figure out how to pay for it later and send help to \nher now.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n     . . . but we think any near-term spending cuts are best dealt \n     with by the super committee as opposed to a symbolic standoff \n     that sends ripple effects beyond Washington.\n\n  This is the Brattleboro Vermont Reformer:\n\n       Though individuals eligible for Federal disaster aid and \n     State and city governments recouping emergency response costs \n     are still receiving funds, projects dating back as far as \n     Hurricane Katrina are once again waiting for money. How did \n     House majority leader Eric Cantor of Virginia respond? He \n     said: ``Change like this is hard.''\n\n  The paper goes on to say:\n\n       However, not as hard as waiting for power lines to get \n     restrung along the Auger Hole Road, wondering when, if ever, \n     you will be able to move back into your waterlogged home or \n     when your road might become passable again. Though Congress \n     has about a week to get everything ironed out, we can expect \n     this argument to go down to the last minute.\n\n  I wish we weren't here at the last minute. I wish to remind everyone \nthat the Senate passed--with a bipartisan response to this, which \nprovided the money FEMA needed without the offset--it was passed \nbipartisanly with 10 Republicans and all the Democrats and sent to the \nHouse. They could have passed that bill, and we would all be gone now, \nwith FEMA replenished, set up for the next year, and the jobs program, \nwhich is really a private sector effort to create jobs in America, \nwould be untouched and would be moving forward.\n  This argument started when Representative Cantor came up with a new \ntea party agenda, which is for flood victims to let FEMA know what \noffset can be required before they are rescued.\n  Other newspapers throughout the country, including Pennsylvania, say:\n\n       Much of northeast Pennsylvania needs Federal assistance to \n     recover from flooding, but two of the region's \n     representatives--\n\n  In this case, both Republican Representatives--\n\n     offered an unacceptable condition.\n\n  They go on to say--they list the Members.\n  They say:\n\n       The problem isn't the Senate, which earlier had passed a \n     bill by a positive vote that included 10 Republicans to \n     appropriate more than $7 billion for FEMA that handles \n     disaster relief. That fund could run dry. The House responded \n     with a bill that would provide $3.7 billion, but only if two \n     loan programs for energy development projects were rescinded.\n\n  Senator Harry Reid, they say, ``goes on to offer a compromise with \nthe House.'' But I guess we are in the time of no compromise and take \nwhatever hostages you can. In this case, the tea party Republicans want \nto take hostage the Grandma who is on her roof asking for help.\n  Even the New York newspapers:\n\n       Congress shouldn't allow disaster aid for people devastated \n     by Tropical Storm Irene to be stalled by a fight over how \n     much is enough and how to cover the tab.\n\n  We are willing to negotiate with the House over how much. We believe \nour number of $6.1 billion is not enough for the year, and I think the \nrecords will show as we move forward that I am accurate. But given the \nsituation we are in, we don't need to fight over that\n\n[[Page S5964]]\n\namount because if $6.1 billion isn't enough, most certainly $3.5 \nbillion that the House has offered isn't enough, and we can work that \nout later on and that is what Leader Reid has offered. But requiring an \noffset, particularly an offset from a program that Republicans \nthemselves supported, that was signed into law by President Bush, and \nthat is supported by the chamber of commerce, the National \nManufacturers Association, the League of Cities, the National \nConference of Mayors, and an offset that has created 40,000 jobs, that \nis a road I don't think we should go down.\n  If it is a manufacturing program today that the new Cantor doctrine \nrequires, as one of these great articles this weekend said, maybe next \ntime we have a disaster, we will have to offer up education programs; \nand the next time we have a disaster, we will have to offer up a fourth \nof our transportation budget; and the next time we have a disaster, we \nwill have to offer up aid to Israel; or maybe the next time we have a \ndisaster, we will have to offer up something else. When does the \noffering up stop?\n  The worst time to negotiate how to find funding after a disaster is \nwhen emotions are high, when people are really at their sort of \nemotional limit, particularly the disaster victims themselves. We want \nto argue and debate these things when cool heads prevail and once we \nget the estimates. It is hard, within a week or two or three of an \nemergency, to even know what those estimates are. We have to wait for \nthe insurance adjusters to go out, for the FEMA adjusters to go out, \nfor people to even get back to their communities to assess the damage.\n  Believe me, I have been through this. It was months after the \naftermath of Katrina before people in my city of New Orleans and in \nparts of my State could even get back into their neighborhoods--months. \nNot days, not weeks, months. I remember people along the gulf coast \nhaving to come in on foot with chainsaws to try to get back. It took \nthem days.\n\n  That is another reason why we do not want to have to find an offset \nto fund disasters. We want to do a couple things. We want to budget as \ncarefully as we can in advance. I want to answer this argument that: \nOh, well, the reason Congress is in this pickle is because they did not \nbudget for disasters. I am going to put up a chart in a minute--if \nstaff will grab that one for me--to show that we have budgeted for \ndisasters. We have not budgeted as adequately as we should. This has \nbeen a problem for Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents.\n  But I have to say, as chair of this committee, I have doubled the \namount of money--more than doubled the amount of money--in anticipation \nof disasters to try to get in front of it. But no one--unless they had \na crystal ball--could have predicted that 48 out of 50 States would \nhave had disasters this year in America. It is unprecedented. We would \nhave had to have a crystal ball that was always right and never, ever \nwrong to be able to predict we would have had that many disasters.\n  What can we do in the future? I have offered to my colleagues--\nSenator Blunt, Senator Snowe, and others--that I will work with them in \nthe future to get a bill that mandates that Democratic and Republican \nPresidents, regardless of party, would have to send to us--budgeted and \npaid for--at least a 10-year average of previous disasters.\n  But I have to say, even if we would have had that law in place--which \nis the best we can all collectively think of; and universities or \nbusinesses would recommend the same--we still would have underestimated \nthis last year, and we still would have underestimated Katrina and \nRita. That is why I am on the floor making this argument.\n  I know it is inconvenient for Members to have to come back this week. \nI know people wanted to be away this week to work in their districts. \nBut this is an argument and a debate worth having. I hope our side will \nprevail, but if not, at least we put up the fight that I think is \nnecessary to make the argument to the American people.\n  But even if we had a crystal ball and even if we had budgeted more \nthan the $1.8 billion we budget every year, approximately, out of \nHomeland Security, look what happened when Katrina and Rita and Wilma \nhit. This went up to $45 billion--Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. Wilma, you \nwill remember, was one of the storms that hit Florida. In the year \nbefore, Florida had four storms. Dennis, Ivan, Frances, and Charley hit \nFlorida in 1 year.\n  I believe that is why Senator Rubio and Senator Nelson understand the \nhollowness and the danger of the Cantor doctrine. Because had this \ndoctrine been in effect when these four hurricanes hit Florida back in \n2004, the people of Florida would have had to come to Congress, and \nbefore we could spend one dime to help them, we would have had to find \na $3 billion offset. Mr. President, maybe we would have gone to your \nState and taken the money out of your transportation program or gone to \nmy State or gone somewhere to find $3 billion, but we did not. We sent \nFlorida their $3 billion, and we will pay for it over time.\n  I do not know what we would have done on the gulf coast had the \npeople of the United States enforced the Cantor doctrine, which was to \nfind $45 billion like that--like that--before we could have sent money \nto Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana or Texas. I could go on and on and \non.\n  One of the more disappointing positions Republicans are holding, \nparticularly Representative Cantor, which is very disappointing, is \nthat we have to scramble to find offsets for Americans who are in \ntrouble, but we can just send free money to Iraq and Afghanistan. We do \nnot have to send an offset to rebuild Iraq. We do not have to find an \noffset to rebuild Afghanistan. But we have to scramble around here and \nfind an offset to help the people of our country.\n  Third point. Some of the House Members have stood and said: Senator \nLandrieu is wrong. We have offset emergency funding in the past. That \nis correct. We have offset emergency funding, but emergency funding is \ndifferent than FEMA funding. We have emergencies such as dams break and \nlevees break and the Corps of Engineers needs extra money. Over the \ncourse of time, we have, occasionally--because we want to be \nresponsible with the budget when we can, and when we have time to \nfigure it out, we most certainly can find offsets in programs that are \nnot working as well. So we can eliminate that and push some of that \nmoney to emergency funding. We have done it in the military. We have \ndone it for the Corps of Engineers. But if we do this, this will be the \nfirst time we have required an offset for FEMA funding in the history \nof our country.\n  I think it is a road we do not want to go down, and it can be \navoided. We do not have to walk down this road. We can eliminate the \noffset completely. FEMA may--under the last 24 to 48 hours--be able to \nstretch their money through Friday. We can even accept the House \nnumber, which is the lower number. It is not going to be adequate. We \nare going to be back here literally in 8 weeks having the same debate. \nBut they are hardheaded and insistent that they want to continue to \nhave this debate week after week after week. But at least the $3 \nbillion will jump-start all our programs that are stalled and many of \nthem are in my State, which is why I am spending a lot of time on this, \nbut I am also concerned about everybody else's State. It will give us \nenough money to get through Thanksgiving, maybe the first of the year. \nIt is not going to be enough for all next year.\n  That is a reasonable compromise. On the side of that compromise is \nthe Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, \nfour Governors of disaster-hit States--two Republicans and two \nDemocrats--the National League of Cities, and the National Conference \nof Mayors. That is just to name a few.\n  There are editorials across the country from Pennsylvania to New \nYork, to Louisiana. The Times-Picayune, my own newspaper, of which I am \nvery proud, editorialized for this position that to require an offset \nbefore one can be rescued is not the American way. We do not require it \nwhen we declare war or disaster. We go ahead and send the troops, and \nwe fund them later. I do not believe we want to go down this road.\n  So Leader Reid has brought us back to try to work through it. Again, \nthe Senate, earlier in September, passed a bipartisan resolution. The \nHouse rejected it for their own reason, insisting\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\nthat we have an offset. We are back saying that is a wrong policy to \nadopt. This is not the right time in America to adopt it. If we were \ngoing to adopt it, this is definitely the wrong program to eliminate. \nThis program has created, with the private sector--this is not \ngovernment jobs. These are private sector jobs that have been created. \nRepublican leaders in the House--and I am going to read those letters \nfor the Record this afternoon again--supported the program, wrote \nletters to the Secretary asking for this funding to be spent in their \ndistricts, and then they turn around and offer this as an offset when \nit is unnecessary, unprecedented, and absolutely wrongheaded.\n  For the legislators, the Congress men and women along the gulf coast, \nit is particularly disturbing. After receiving $45 billion--\nMississippi, Louisiana, and Texas--after Katrina and Rita and not one \npenny offset while it was going on--we are all going to be paying for \nit for many years to come in our regular budgeting process--to then \nturn around and say, when the east coast needs help: Oh, no, we need to \nfind an offset today.\n  That is how this argument started. I do not like to fight. I like to \ncooperate. I am one of nine siblings. I have two children myself. I \nhave been happily married to my husband for 23 years. We resolve things \nby talking and negotiating in our home. We do not like to fight in our \nfamily.\n  But I have learned one thing: Some things are worth fighting for, win \nor lose. I have led this effort. I have been proud to lead it. I am so \ngrateful to my colleagues on the Democratic side, both in the House and \nthe Senate, who have spoken on this point, who have changed their \nschedules to support this. Win or lose, it is right to stand against \nthe Cantor doctrine and the tea party agenda.\n\n  I guess this is where this comes from. We have never seen this \nbefore. Never have we offset a dime of FEMA funding. We have offset \nemergency funding, we have offset defense emergencies, Corps of \nEngineers emergencies, HUD community development block grant money we \nhave offset but not FEMA.\n  But the Republican caucus in the House has run us right down to the \nwire, not willing to negotiate, not willing to even recognize the \nbipartisan bill we sent over there. Sometimes we say ``bipartisan'' \naround here if we have one Republican and all the Democrats. We kind of \nbrag because we have bipartisanship. This was 10--10--Republican \nSenators. That is a big number today. We broke a Republican filibuster \non this with 10 Republican Senators who said Eric Cantor was wrong. Now \nis not the time. We do not have to find an offset. Let's negotiate. \nLet's work through this. They were right. I hope they will stand \nstrong. I hope the leadership can work this out. But, again, if we \ncannot, it was worth, in my view, the fight over this to say: The \nCantor doctrine is dangerous for the country.\n  Let me just remind everyone--because I have spoken about the gulf \ncoast--these are 48 States represented that have been hit by disasters. \nThe only States that have been spared a natural disaster are Michigan \nand West Virginia. But as the Senators from Michigan will tell us, they \nhave been experiencing their own economic disaster now for almost 6 \nyears, an economic meltdown in Michigan. Because of the crash of the \nauto industry and the foreclosure disaster and the crash of some of the \nWall Street banks and other banks, Michigan has been very hard hit. \nWest Virginia is always one of our poorer States, with great assets, \nbut they struggle all the time. So we can honestly say all 50 States \nare in need of help.\n  Why don't we help them? We have a supercommittee set up. Many of us \nare working hard on closing the deficit gap. We have already cut \ntrillions, literally trillions, of dollars from this budget over the \nlast 2 years. We have trillions more to cut and we have revenues to \nraise. But this time we have to find money in this budget--in this case \nfor something that is wholly unprecedented and unnecessary--they \nrecommend a program that is actually helping to turn around a very weak \njob outlook. It is creating jobs. It has created 40,000. It could \ncreate more public-private partnerships, promoting loans to auto \ncompanies that are creating new and different kinds of automobiles so \nwe can minimize our dependence on foreign oil, we can start building \nagain in America, we can start manufacturing again in America.\n  Again, it is a program--some of the newspapers reported it--Democrats \nsupport. This is a program George Bush signed into law. This is a \nprogram that Republicans and Democrats have supported. This is a \nprogram that actually works to put Americans back to work. Why would \nthey pick this one? Why would they pick any one? But why would they \npick this one? Because they wanted to pick a fight, and they knew we \nwere not just going to say: OK, fine. So we did not pick this fight. I \ndid not pick this fight. Representative Cantor started it when he \ndecided on a Cantor doctrine that would make disaster victims have to \nfind an offset before they could be helped.\n  I am going to close with where I started, with this cartoon that says \nit all:\n\n       Welcome to the Republican disaster relief hotline. At the \n     tone, please tell us the emergency and how you plan to offset \n     the cost of your rescue. . . .\n\n  This is not America. We have gone too far. If this kind of government \nis on the tea party agenda, I suggest they remove that item for \nconsideration. This is not the way we operate our government in the \nUnited States. We are there for people in their time of need.\n  We do not ask them to find an offset. We will pay for this. We are \nworking to have our budget balanced. But we do not put this kind of \npressure on tax-paying Americans, who hardly ask us for anything. But \nwhen their home is washed away, when their business is destroyed, they \nexpect FEMA to be there and they do not have to scramble around with \ntheir congressional delegation or their mayors or their counsel members \nor their local representatives to wring their hands and say: What \nprogram can we suggest Congress cut so we can get our meals today or \nour shelter for next week?\n  It is not the way we do business. I hope as Members come back tonight \nto talk about this, we can find a way forward, keep our government \noperating, and do what is right for Americans and our country.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. There are other Members who are coming down to speak. \nBut while I have this time, I wanted to just add a few other comments \nto the Record.\n  First of all, over the weekend, there were some reports and some \nstatements made that this was a manufactured crisis by one of our \ncolleagues on one of the big talk shows on Sunday morning.\n  First of all, that infers this is not a real crisis, that it was just \nmade up because we enjoy fighting here in Washington. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  This is not fun to do, but sometimes this is necessary. Sometimes it \nis necessary to draw sharp lines between policies because the outcome \naffects people's lives. Where would we have been along the gulf coast \nhad that Cantor doctrine been in effect and used when Katrina hit the \ngulf coast? Instead of New Orleans and Biloxi and large portions of the \ngulf coast being rebuilt today, we would still probably be debating \nwhere we were going to find the money to do the work. Now, that is No. \n1.\n  No. 2, the crisis may not be real for the whole country right now, \ntoday, as we speak on Monday, but I promise, for people in many \nStates--and I will find this document which I have used several times \nin debate on the Senate floor--it is pages and pages, too numerous to \nmention--they are already having a crisis because these line items and \nnumbers represent projects that have already been pink-slipped, shut \ndown.\n  Government is still operating through this week, and we are going to \nwork this out. We are not going to let the government shut down over \nthis. I promise you--if I have anything to say about it. I might not, \nand my caucus\n\n[[Page S5966]]\n\nmay overrule me, but it is worth arguing about to try to see if we can \ncome to some reasonable compromise, which Leader Reid has offered.\n  But there is already a crisis. For those who think this is \nmanufactured, why don't they spend time this afternoon calling some of \nthese small businesspeople who have shut down their operations?\n  They were building a road in Alaska, and they stopped because FEMA \nstopped their funding weeks and weeks ago. This isn't made up by Mary \nLandrieu. We can call Craig Fugate or anybody on this list if anyone \nthinks this is manufactured. They have stopped their projects because \nFEMA technically ran out of money months ago. They are operating on \nfumes. They stopped paying for all of their regular work that was going \non rebuilding lots of places in America so they could give out their \nemergency aid to the east coast. They had no choice because we didn't \ngive them enough money to make it through the year.\n  I sent a letter to the leadership on this issue months ago because I \nknow this; I am the chair of the committee. They keep saying to me: \nSenator, we are running out of money. I have been saying this--and I \nwill present letters for the Record. Anyone who follows this knows this \nis true. This is not a manufactured crisis.\n  This whole issue started when Representative Cantor decided that the \nway to fix this problem was to cut something in the budget and have to \noffset something in order for us to move forward, and then the gears \nstopped. It was like he just threw a wrench in the gears. Everything \nwas going along quite smoothly.\n  I know the American people are tired of the fighting and the name \ncalling. I am, proudly, a centrist Democrat. I am still proud to say \nthat. I have negotiated on probably every major deal that has been \ndone--or compromised. I have been a part of almost every one for the 15 \nyears I have been here. Some people don't like that about me, but I \nthink that is good, and I am proud of it.\n  I most certainly am not one of the ones who like to start a partisan \nbrawl just for the heck of it. This is an important principle. The \nprinciple is this: Should Americans have to scramble to find offsets \nwhile the water is rising and the wind is blowing, when we don't \nrequire the same for emergencies overseas? We don't scramble to find \noffsets when a famine happens or a drought hits in Africa. We send \nmoney because that is what Americans do. Yet our people are calling for \nhelp at home and somehow--this is on the tea party agenda--before we \ncan send them help we have to find an offset in Washington, an offset \nthat everybody agrees to. Good luck.\n  There are very few things here that two people agree to, let alone \n535. If I had to do that, Mr. President, for Katrina and Rita, I don't \nknow what I would have done.\n  We are in a crisis. It may not be for everybody in the country right \nnow, like it could be next week if the government shuts down, which it \nwill not. We are going to find a way forward. But for these people it \nhas been a crisis for several months. Bridge projects are shut down, \nlibraries are shut down, and all the workers have been sent home or \ntold not to expect a paycheck on this project. I don't know how many \npeople will continue to work without receiving a paycheck. Maybe some \npeople are still doing that.\n  No. 2, we sent $1.3 trillion to Iraq and Afghanistan in the last 7 \nyears--$1.3 trillion, not requiring one offset. Yet people in Florida \nare looking for help as are people in Vermont, and the Cantor doctrine \nsays we have to find cuts in the budget.\n  The Senator from Florida wants to speak. I want to be accurate in \nthis debate, so I want to correct one thing I said. I said that never \nbefore have we offset FEMA money. My staff corrected me and said that \none time in history, in recent memory, we did that for a small amount \nof FEMA money when President Clinton was the President because the \nRepublicans had just come into power and argued about it back then. \nPresident Clinton, to his credit, found an offset they could agree to, \nand they did it.\n  I don't think we should make this a routine exercise. It is not right \nfor the flood victims or the taxpayers in the long run. Eventually, we \nwill find a way to pay for these things, so let's reason together.\n  Harry Reid sent us a reasonable compromise. The House should focus on \nthis and try to take this compromise--if we can. It has been worth \ndiscussing because this is going to go into law one way or the other, \nand we are going to be living with the consequences. Those of us on the \ngulf coast who are in hurricane alley--I will show this chart, and it \nis quite disturbing. I will put it up again.\n  This chart shows from 1851 to 2008. These lines represent every \nhurricane that has hit the lower 48. These large colored lines are \nKatrina, Gustav, Rita, and Ike. Most certainly, along the east coast \npeople should know that this is just what happened. There was also a \ntornado chart that showed where the tornadoes hit, and there was one \nfor the earthquakes. Every part of the country at some time experiences \na disaster. We don't have to run up to Washington and gut the education \nprograms overnight or gut our transportation programs overnight or try \nto call a special committee meeting to find out where we can come up \nwith $1 billion by Friday to send to FEMA. We send it, and then we make \nthose decisions over time. It is the way any corporation would operate, \nit is the way any family would operate, and it is the way our \ngovernment should operate.\n  Again, if we take this Cantor doctrine to its ridiculous extreme, we \nwould have firetrucks screaming down the street while a house is on \nfire, and before they turn the hose on, they would ask the family to \ncome out and they would ask them what they should cut in the city \nbudget before they turned on the water. We can only make reasonable \nassumptions about what disasters there will be--their frequency and \ntheir rate. If we go under a little bit, then we have to provide the \nmoney until we can fix it in the long run.\n  I am going to yield the floor. I thank the Members for engaging in \nthis debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/26/senate-section/article/S5966-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to comment before the \nSenator from Louisiana leaves the floor. It is kind of like we have \nseen this movie before. If I recall, it was Friday. The Senator from \nLouisiana and I were out here with this chart talking about the same \nthing, showing all of these paths of hurricanes and how those folks who \nlive along the gulf and the Atlantic coast understand what natural \ndisaster is.\n  We are playing with people's lives when we threaten not to fund FEMA,\n\n[[Page S5967]]\n\nwhich can respond to these. How many of these do we have to have to get \nthrough to these decisionmakers who are blocking the funding of FEMA \nbecause of some ideological position? There are people out there who \nare hurting in Tuscaloosa, AL; in Joplin, MO, all throughout New \nEngland, and along the Atlantic coast--and who knows what is going to \nhappen? Hurricane season goes until the end of November.\n  I want to tell the Senator from Louisiana how much I appreciate her \nbringing this to our attention over and over again. We need to remind \npeople that there are certain things that only the government can do, \nand this is one of them. When people are in need, they have to rely on \nemergency functions from their government. That is one of the main \nreasons of having a government. Hopefully, that message will get \nthrough.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak about, basically, this budget \nconundrum in which we find ourselves. In a little less than an hour, we \nare going to vote on a motion to cut off debate just to get to the bill \nthat would continue to fund the government after this Friday so that \nthe government can operate.\n  Speaking of movies that we have seen before, didn't we see this movie \nback in early August? Then it was over a different question of whether \nthe government could continue to pay its bills. But in essence it was \nthe same thing. In that case it was the lifting of the debt ceiling. In \nthis case it is to keep the appropriations going, starting October 1.\n\n  So if we have seen this movie before, didn't Senators and Members of \nCongress go home in August? And didn't they hear from their people, and \nthe people said: What in the world are you all doing? What are you \nthinking? Have you guys gone off the rails, that you would threaten the \nshutdown of the government and all the necessary functions of the \ngovernment, which would then imperil our economy more already than it \nis now imperiled in this recession?\n  One would think Members of Congress got that message. Yet here we are \nagain, in late September, after having gone through that drill in early \nAugust. We are going through the same thing again--this brinkmanship, \nthis partisan ideological brinkmanship that has all the vestiges of \nbeing all balled up in electioneering politics and a Presidential \nelection. That is not any way to run a country.\n  Let me tell you why I think--if the folks out across America will \nstart letting their elected representatives know they have had enough--\nwhy we might see some change. With that cataclysmic confrontation we \nwent through in early August, in order to get the government to pay its \nbills, we set up a structure--a process in law--where there was \nimmediate debt reduction of some $1 trillion, but there is supposed to \nbe--and I am rounding--another $1\\1/2\\ trillion done by this \nsupercommittee that is supposed to report by Thanksgiving, and then we \nare to vote on it. Remember, a week and a half ago, the Presiding \nOfficer and I and 34 other Senators--Republicans and Democrats alike--\nwent to the Senate press gallery and we stood and said: We want a big \ndeal of deficit reduction. A lot of us were suggesting what we want is \ntax reform in the process, getting rid of a lot of the clutter in the \nTax Code that is so inefficient in the way of tax preference to \nindividual special interests, which have grown exponentially over the \nlast 20 years, since the last tax reform measure, which was 1986, and \ninstead utilize that revenue, which would be revenue gained, to \nsimplify the Tax Code and lower rates. The actuaries tell us that \nwould, in fact, crank up the engine of growth and from that growth \nwould come additional revenue.\n  Why is that so hard? Every constituent I have talked to seems to \nthink that is a fairly good idea. You know what they say? They say it \nsounds like common sense.\n  Mr. President, I see other Senators on the floor who wish to speak. I \nwant the Senator from New York to know I have been speaking to some of \nhis constituents--the titans on Wall Street--who are saying the same \nthing: What in the world are you guys doing? Have you all lost your \nminds?\n  We have an opportunity to do something. If we will have as our north \nstar some common sense, bipartisanship, and keeping in mind what is \ngood for the country and not for our particular little ideology, then \nwe can get something done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from \nFlorida. He knew I was waiting, and I know he cut short his remarks, so \nI appreciate that. But more importantly than that, I appreciate his \ninsight, his articulation of our situation, and his desire to help the \npeople of Florida. Nobody works harder for the people of Florida than \nthe Senator from Florida. They know disaster just about better than \nanybody else, given their geographic situation. So his fight for FEMA \ndollars is a fight for every citizen of that great State of Florida, \nwhere I must say many of my former constituents now reside, so I have a \nspecial care about Florida as well. I thank him for both his courtesy \nand his insightfulness.\n  FEMA runs out of money very soon. Already, recovery projects in more \nthan 40 States have been halted so FEMA can focus their last dollars on \nresponding to the latest disasters. To have FEMA not working in Joplin, \nMO, where we all saw the pictures, and because of the dangers that \nHurricanes Irene and Lee created, is unheard of in this country. It is \nunheard of.\n  The Senate has already passed the bipartisan bill to replenish FEMA's \ncoffers, providing $7 billion in immediate relief, not just for FEMA \nbut the Army Corps. I can tell you that in my State we need Army Corps \nrelief as well as FEMA relief because so many of our rivers have \nchanged course. They have flooded. I think I mentioned earlier the Erie \nCanal--the locks--are no longer by the river because the storm's force \nchanged the course of the Mohawk, so the river is here and the locks \nare here--the great historic Erie Canal. So we provided this $7 \nbillion.\n  A reasonable person might say--all our constituents are saying--to \nget government to work, the most logical thing to do would be quick \npassage by the House so we could begin to get those dollars out the \ndoor. Instead, House Republicans decided to take emergency disaster aid \nand leverage it to force cuts to a jobs program they themselves used to \nsupport. If there has ever been a case of playing politics, that is it. \nIf they don't like this jobs program, fine, fight it out in the regular \ncourse of business, but don't hold FEMA dollars hostage to cut jobs. \nThe American people don't want that choice. Help those who are in the \nmiddle of a disaster. Is the only way we can help them to cut jobs in \nMichigan or Louisiana or other States, at a time when our country is \nhurting for jobs? That is not America, and that is not what our \nconstituents have asked us to do. The jobs program they want to end, \nbefore they are willing to provide more disaster aid, is not some \nradical program. It was started under the Bush administration. It was \npassed with a bipartisan majority.\n  I understand their anguish. We have to cut funding. But we don't have \nto do it like this. We don't have to do it on the backs of the people \nof Schoharie County, whose homes have been blown away, or the people of \nBinghamton, who are in shelters because there is no rental housing for \nthem. We don't have to do it on their backs. That is not fair. If our \nRepublican colleagues want to have a fight over a program they used to \nsupport but now say the circumstances have changed, fine, we should \nhave that. That is what we are here for. But don't hold disaster aid \nhostage.\n  I want to say this, lest people think the Democratic stand is some \nway-out-there, leftwing stand. Guess who supports us. The U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. Because they \nknow what we are doing is right. Those are groups that are almost \nalways supporting Republican initiatives. So when they say we are \nright, doesn't that send a shot across the bow to my colleagues to back \noff this ideological, narrow, my-way-or-the-highway position?\n  Most importantly, the House Republican approach would require that we \nkill 40,000 jobs in order to help our fellow Americans put their lives \nand businesses back together after this year's record disasters. That \nis not right, it is\n\n[[Page S5968]]\n\nunprecedented, and I would say it is not the way we have done things in \nthis country in the past.\n  The CR we will vote on this afternoon is a fail-safe measure. It is a \nbill that will keep the government running at funding levels agreed to \nby Democrats and Republicans in the debt ceiling negotiations. It is a \ngood-faith effort to compromise and contains the same amount of \ndisaster relief funding House Republicans supported.\n  It falls short of fully funding FEMA, as we did in the bipartisan \nbill passed 2 weeks ago, with 10 Republican votes, but we are working \nto meet our colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the middle in \norder to break the impasse. Will they move a little to the middle to \nmeet us, or will they insist the only way to go is a bill that failed \nin this Chamber with a bipartisan vote against it of 59 to 36? Is \nSpeaker Boehner saying to us a bill that fails in the Senate 59 to 36 \nis the only way to go, when it is so wrong and not supported by the \nChamber of Commerce; when it is pitting jobholders, and the future of \nthis country in terms of energy independence, against each other versus \ndisaster assistance? That is not fair. The only difference between our \nbill and the House bill is it doesn't require the job-killing cuts the \nChamber of Commerce opposes and that our fragile economy can't afford \nright now.\n\n  We know there has been a lot of pressure on the 10 Senate Republicans \nwho joined us 2 weeks ago to fight full disaster funding. I hope they \ndo not cave in to the pressure exerted by the extreme minority in the \nHouse that demands job cuts as a precondition for disaster relief. I \nwould urge them not do it. If they can't resist that pressure, what is \ntheir solution? They know the House bill is a dead letter here.\n  The path forward is clear. The Senate has already spoken on the \npolitical bill sent to us by the House. We must pass this commonsense, \nmiddle-of-the-road compromise measure that is now before the Senate. It \nwill provide disaster aid to hard-hit communities across the country \nimmediately and prevent an unnecessary government shutdown.\n  We shouldn't even be talking about shutdown. Why are we? Because the \nother body decided to attach disaster relief to government funding. We \nare not just holding jobs hostage, we are holding government funding \nhostage in a my-way-or-the-highway presentation take it or leave it or \nyour government shuts down, take it or leave it or 40,000 people lose \ntheir jobs. That is not fair and that is not right.\n  Every aspect of our plan has already received major bipartisan \nsupport. Voting for it is the right thing to do. We must put politics \naside at a time when the economy of this country is so fragile. We must \navoid even coming close to a government shutdown. We must do what is \nright for our country. And what is right for our country is to pass the \ncompromise measure that has had bipartisan support in the past and vote \nfor it on the floor of the Senate in the next half hour.\n  One other comment. My great colleague from Louisiana has done an \nincredible job. She has been showing this, but in case people missed it \nover the last hour, it is a great little cartoon. There is a nice lady \nwith a gray bun and little glasses talking on the telephone. There is \nher TV on the roof of her house, which has, obviously, been flooded. \nThis cartoon is humorous, but I have seen flood levels up to this level \non house after house after house across large parts of the eastern part \nof New York. She is on the phone, saying: ``Welcome to the Republican \ndisaster relief hot line. At the tone, please tell us the emergency and \nhow you plan to offset the cost of your rescue.''\n  When the next disaster comes and people are struggling, are we going \nto have to debate how much to cut education funds? In the next \ndisaster, when people have experienced an earthquake, are we going to \nhave to debate how to help those people while we talk about how much to \ncut Border Patrol funds? In the next disaster, when fires are ravaging \nacross Texas or New Mexico or California, are we going to debate how \nmuch we have to cut food safety inspectors? That is not our way, and \nthat is why we need to support this bill which has bipartisan elements \nand has been supported by Members of both parties. That bill is a \ncompromise bill. It is the middle-of-the-road bill that is on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time, and I thank my great colleague from \nLouisiana for the great job she has done.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from New York, who has been a \nstrong clarion voice on this issue. He has helped to crystalize what \nthis is about. He is exactly right.\n  I want to read into the Record, as the Senator from Illinois comes to \nspeak, from several articles around the country that have editorialized \nexactly on the position that he ended on, and it is the point of this \nwhole debate--whether we accept the Cantor doctrine, which requires an \noffset before we send help to people who are stranded or flooded out or \nin an ice storm or in the middle of a tornado or whether we have to \nhave Washington cut the budget first.\n  The central Pennsylvania newspaper said it well. They said:\n\n       It is easy to generalize and say our government spends too \n     much money and needs to cut all government programs. Then a \n     tornado wipes out Joplin, MO, or a hurricane called Irene \n     slams into the East Coast destroying countless homes and \n     lives in Vermont or a flood devastates communities in Derry \n     Township, Middletown and Harrisburg, PA. It is then we count \n     on our local, state and federal governments for help and, in \n     particular, for the federal government to support us with \n     disaster relief. We have certainly seen this year through \n     wind, fire and rain--the ice could be next to come--that \n     FEMA's financial efforts cannot be tied to some sort of \n     Congressional pay-by-the-disaster system.\n       We cannot decide with each new catastrophe where we will \n     find money, stripping funds from transportation this month \n     and education the next.\n\n  That is what this debate is about. We did not choose this fight. It \nwas started by Representative Eric Cantor. There was a moment in time \nwhen he said we must offset this disaster.\n  Some of us stood right up and said: No, we will not.\n  I see the Senator from Illinois, but I sent four letters as the chair \nof this committee as early as February. Please don't let anyone in the \npress criticize me for waiting until the last minute. February 16, \n2011, I sent a letter saying: Heads up. This is going to be a problem.\n  Not many people listened. Then I sent another letter in March, then I \nsent another letter in May, and then I sent another letter May 11. We \nare now in September. One can accuse me of a lot of things. I most \ncertainly make mistakes, but not being ahead of this one is not one of \nthem. I knew this was going to happen.\n  Here we are. This was not started by Harry Reid. It was not started \nby Leader Durbin from Illinois. It was started when Eric Cantor said, \ndespite the fact that we sent $1.3 trillion to Iraq and Afghanistan to \nbuild cities and communities and houses in Iraq and Afghanistan, we \ncannot send any money to Vermont or to New Hampshire or to Virginia--\nhis own State, which is mind-boggling to me--until we find a program to \ncut. Then they cut a program that has bipartisan support that is \ncreating jobs in America.\n  I will yield the floor. The Senator from Illinois always has some \ninteresting things to add to the debate, and I appreciate his support \nand leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say to the Senator from Louisiana, \nshe has been a clarion and consistent voice on this issue because she \nhas seen it and lived it. Anyone representing the State of Louisiana \ncan give a lesson to all of us about what happens when the unexpected \noccurs and people lose their homes, their businesses, their lives. They \nare uprooted.\n  We had some folks from New Orleans in Chicago. They were leaving New \nOrleans to come to one of our fabulous winters because they had nowhere \nto go, and I saw the look in their eyes. They did not know where to \nturn. At that moment in time, many people across America count on the \nAmerican family. That is who we are and we represent that family in the \nSenate.\n  We stand for this country and for the families who are suffering \nthrough no fault of their own. When the Senator from Louisiana comes \nand tells us: Be\n\n[[Page S5969]]\n\ncareful when we set a standard that says before we can send the first \ndollar to someone who has lost their home or their business or their \nfarm or whatever we have to come back to Washington and go through a \nbudget debate and decide where we are going to cut--out of money for \neducation and medical research and the like. That is not the way it has \never happened. Emergency spending is emergency spending.\n  I have lived through it--nothing like what my colleague went through \nin Louisiana, but the floods of 1993 in downstate Illinois, I was in \npretty decent shape when it was over for all the sandbags I filled and \npushed around with thousands of volunteers. We saw what happened. There \nwere terrible things that happened, and I think the Senator from \nLouisiana would agree with me that flooding is one of the worst. It \ndoesn't go away. It sits there destroying people's homes and everything \nthey own, and when it finally goes away, what a mess. Also, in the \nMidwest, we have a little thing called a tornado. I grew up as a kid in \ndownstate Illinois listening for the siren and heading for the \nbasement. We did that I don't know how many times, sometimes in the \nmiddle of the night. But look at what happened to Joplin, MO. This \nbeautiful town in Missouri was almost wiped off the map by a tornado.\n  What do we tell the people who survive the next day? Sorry, Congress \nhas to meet and debate and we will get back to you? Of course not. We \nstand and help people--scores of volunteers, hundreds of volunteers who \ncome in for the Red Cross and so many other agencies and all the first \nresponders. Governors don't say: We will see if the Federal Government \nwill pay for this before we go in and help and provide lifesaving \nefforts. They do it, anticipating we will stand with them.\n  Now Congressman Cantor of Virginia decides there should be a new \napproach: We need Congress to get together and debate before we help \npeople who are victims of disasters.\n  That is a serious mistake. We have to stand by people, whether they \nlive in red States or blue States, whether they are Democrats, \nRepublicans, Independents. We stand by one another and that is \ncritically important.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Louisiana, I think the thing I noticed \nover the weekend in Illinois, as I traveled around, was how fed up \npeople are with what is going on in Washington on Capitol Hill. When \nthey see us break down into another cussing match over shutting down \nthe Government, they say: For goodness' sake, grow up--grow up and \naccept your responsibility.\n  We are here today accepting a grownup responsibility. The House of \nRepresentatives is not here today. I hope they are going to send a \nmessage to us that they found a solution or, if not, I hope they are \nplanning on returning this week because we have work to do.\n  On Saturday, the spending for the Government ends. Once again, we \nface a shutdown, a shutdown which would cause unnecessary hardship to \ninnocent people all across America. If you think you have heard this \nscript before or watched this movie before, you have. This is the third \ntime this year the House leadership has pushed a shutdown in front of \nus and said: That is it. Take it or leave it.\n  That is no way to run a Congress, and it is no way to run a great \nnation. We need to come together and agree. I will tell everyone what \nSenator Reid, the leader on the Democratic side, did to try to reach an \nagreement. We had originally asked for $7 billion additional money for \nFEMA for next year. I will bet we need it. But Senator Reid said: In an \neffort to compromise, I will cut that request in half. We can get back \ntogether if we need it. There was an effort in consensus and \ncompromise. It was totally rejected by the House. That is not a good \nway to act.\n  I also wish to add to what the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, \nsaid earlier about this idea that the only way to pay for disasters is \nto eliminate jobs in America. How wrong is that? To go from a natural \ndisaster to making our economic disaster worse? But that is what the \nHouse wanted to do. They wanted to eliminate jobs that are created by \nprograms that have worked. Let me give an example.\n\n  This intelligent, fuel-efficient vehicle program has put money into \nmajor automobile manufacturers to create more manufacturing jobs in \nIllinois, where we have had more jobs, good-paying American jobs for \nworkers, that cannot be shipped overseas, with a good salary and good \nbenefits. What is wrong with that picture? Isn't that what we are \nhoping for the rest of America as well?\n  All across the Midwest, these car manufacturers have used this \nprogram and more than 40,000 jobs have been created and the House \nRepublicans have said: Let's eliminate that and pay for disasters with \nit--totally upside-down thinking. We have to be thinking about helping \nthose in distress, and we have to be thinking about creating jobs. We \ncan do both.\n  I take no backseat when it comes to tackling the deficit and debt in \nthis country. I have been engaged in this debate for quite a while now \nand intensely over the last year and a half. But every economist and \nevery clear-thinking person has said, before we start serious deficit \nreduction, take care of our immediate needs--that would be the defense \nof America and responding to disasters--and make certain this recession \nis behind us. We cannot balance the budget with 14 million Americans \nout of work. So get busy creating jobs. And we are going to. The \nPresident has come up with a proposal which I think makes sense, giving \na payroll tax cut to working families. In my State of Illinois, where \nthe average family makes about $53,500 a year, President Obama's \npayroll tax cut would mean an additional $1,500 a year for them, which \nis going to be about $125 a month in their paychecks. I bet they can \nuse it as they watch the price of gasoline go up to $4.50 and go back \ndown and go up again. They can use it.\n  It also said: Let's give small businesses a tax credit and a tax \nincentive to hire the unemployed. I know, we all know, creating jobs in \nAmerica has to start with small business. The Senator from Louisiana \nheads up that committee. She knows it. She has been the most aggressive \nspokesperson for that cause of any in the Senate.\n  The same is true of where we are spending our money. We should be \ninvesting in America. In the suburbs of Chicago, in Morton Grove, IL, \nat the Golf Middle School, they took me on a tour of the 60-year-old \nschool, and it is hard to imagine how they keep it going. They took me \ndown to the boiler room. I don't think too many Senators spend too much \ntime in boiler rooms in schools today, but I did, looking at a 60-year-\nold boiler. The fellow, Jim Burke, who keeps it running, said it cost \nthem $180,000 last year to keep this old, antique system going. They \nneed a new HVAC system for the hundreds of kids going to this school. \nThat is an example of buying products in America, installing them in \nAmerica, and investing in America, so kids can be educated and can \nsucceed in America. That is a plan we all should endorse in both \npolitical parties.\n  In just a few minutes, we will have a vote on the floor, and I hope \nwe will vote in a bipartisan fashion in a clear voice to say we are \ngoing to stand behind the victims of disasters across America, the \nAmerican family can come together, and we are not going to cut jobs in \norder to reduce the pain people feel in disasters.\n  We can do both, create American jobs and make certain those who are \nstruggling through those disasters have the help they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I continue to be \namazed at his energy, in terms of leadership and what he does in \nWashington and his home State of Illinois. I appreciate the comments he \nhas brought to this debate.\n  I wish to say the vote we are going to have in a few minutes is going \nto decide whether we are going to change the way we help disaster \nvictims. We are either going to do it the way we have pretty much \nalways done it--when a disaster strikes, the Federal Government steps \nup; we are there. We encourage our Governors and mayors and local \nelected leaders to roll up their sleeves, work side by side with \npeople, and take care of business, basically, get people out of harm's \nway, move them into shelters, comfort them, console them, keep families \ntogether, and then work with them in\n\n[[Page S5970]]\n\nweeks and months and sometimes it takes years to get these communities \nback up and operating--or we are going to adopt the Republican sort of \ntea party/Cantor doctrine, which is ``my way or the highway,'' which is \nwhy we are having this debate a week before the end of the fiscal year, \nwhich says we are going to have to find money with each new \ncatastrophe. We are going to have to find money by stripping money from \neither education or transportation or, in this particular case, \nstripping money from a program that creates private sector jobs--a \npublic/private partnership, a lending program that helps new and \nemerging companies get the financial wherewithal to manufacture new \nautomobiles in America and puts Americans to work.\n  In fact, what is amazing about this offset that the Republicans have \nchosen to have this whole debate about is, it is an offset of a program \nthat is supported by Republicans themselves. In fact, many Republicans \nin the Senate and in the House have actually sent letters--and I am \ngoing to read one or two of those right now--to the Secretary of Energy \nasking for funding out of this exact program for creating jobs in one \nState, which is a legitimate thing to do. It is done all the time. \nThere is nothing wrong with that. What is wrong is then turning around \nand coming to Washington and voting to gut this program under the guise \nthat we need to do so to help disaster victims.\n  I have a number of letters and I ask unanimous consent they be \nprinted at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am going to read a letter written by the Members of \nthe Indiana delegation. At least three Republicans have signed this \nletter: Senator Lugar from Indiana, Representative Dan Burton from \nIndiana, and Representative Mike Pence from Indiana.\n  They wrote, on June 25:\n\n       We write today to highlight the remarkable automotive \n     innovation occurring in Indiana--and the tremendous potential \n     for Hoosiers to lead our national effort in transforming the \n     automotive sector. Indiana is uniquely qualified and prepared \n     to lead the nation and the world in the development and \n     commercialization of advanced battery, electric drive \n     vehicles and other innovative transportation technologies.\n       Hoosiers are committed to reaching our national goal of \n     reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and they are actively \n     researching, developing, and manufacturing technologies that \n     will be cleaner and create lasting jobs.\n       The Hoosier state is the most manufacturing-intensive state \n     in the union and is home to some 700 automotive related \n     companies which employ more than 130,000 workers. Moreover, \n     Indiana's broad diversity of domestic and international \n     companies, its long experience manufacturing light duty, \n     heavy duty, recreational and military vehicles, and its rich \n     legacy pioneering the development of the electric power train \n     makes the state a national hub for automatic automotive \n     technology development.\n\n  They go on and on. They say:\n\n       Indiana already is home to a number of established and \n     emerging battery and electric vehicle technology companies. . \n     . .\n       In addition, Indiana's world-class research universities \n     including Purdue University, Indiana University-Purdue \n     University Indianapolis, and the University of Notre Dame \n     have formed an active research and development partnership.\n\n  The letter goes on to say what a great job they are doing. ``We \nstrongly encourage you to give full consideration to the innovative \napplications for federal investment made by Indiana companies'' through \nthe electric drive vehicle battery component manufacturing initiative \nand the $25 billion Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan \nProgram. That is the exact loan program Republicans from Indiana have \nwritten to ask funding for that they are now eliminating to pay for \ndisasters. If this were a program that was not working, if this were a \nprogram that did not create jobs in America, if this were a program \nthat Republicans privately and publicly acknowledged was not a good \nprogram, that would be one thing. But to run home and cut ribbons, to \nsay you are creating jobs in Indiana or in New York or in Illinois and \nthen run up here and cut the program, claiming you have to do so to \nhelp disaster victims when it is just about unprecedented in the \nhistory of our country, there is something terribly wrong.\n  We do not need to be destroying jobs; we need to be creating them. We \ndo not need to be making excuses about how we do not have to help \nvictims of disasters; we need to be helping them.\n  I guess I take this a little bit personally because while the rest of \nthe Members sort of say things like: Well, FEMA is not really running \nout of money, and they can probably make it until Friday--there is some \ntalk about that going on. There are some technical ways that could be \ndone--I wish to remind everyone here that this is already an emergency \nfor over 400 projects that were shut down weeks ago. If you are a small \nbusiness owner who had a subcontract building a road in Alaska, it is \nan emergency for you because you were shut down and you cannot make \npayroll. You already bought the supplies to build the bridge, and \nnobody on the Republican side is caring about your crisis.\n  FEMA is technically out of money as we speak. The only way they are \ncontinuing to operate is because they have shut down these projects.\n  This is the third time in the last 6 years, to my knowledge, that \nprojects have been shut down across the country. Why is that right? \nMany of those projects are in Louisiana, some of them are in \nMississippi, and some of them now are in Joplin. If you were in a \ndisaster that happened a few years ago, because Republicans either will \nnot budget the money or will not budget enough money or every time you \ngo to ask for a dime, they require an offset somewhere else--truly what \nis happening is disaster victims in other parts of the country are \nsubsidizing this foolishness.\n  This does not fall equally on the backs of Democrats and Republicans. \nI know people are tired of hearing it, but it does not. Harry Reid did \nnot start this fight. Mary Landrieu did not start this fight. Dick \nDurbin did not start this fight. Eric Cantor of Virginia, a Republican \nleader, started this fight when he said: We cannot fund the 2011 \ndisasters without an offset.\n  So in this whole debate, what they have done is shut down projects in \nLouisiana and Mississippi despite the fact that I have said: We don't \nreally need an offset. We have made arrangements in next year's budget. \nIt is unprecedented, Representative Cantor. Your State is going to be \nhurt as well.\n  He doesn't seem to care. But I do care, and I do think it is worth \ntalking about.\n  I don't know if we will win this battle today. I don't know if we \nwill win this vote this afternoon. I am not the whip. I do not count \nthe votes. All I do is keep my eyes on the people who are in disasters \nbecause I have had to for the years I have been, unfortunately, the \nSenator from Louisiana who has been through the worst natural disaster \nour country has ever known. I have walked through too many destroyed \nneighborhoods, I have cried with too many people, and I have watched \nwhat they go through.\n  For me, this is not a simple change. This is a major change which we \ncannot afford in this country and which our people do not deserve. We \ncannot have a budget meeting every time there is a disaster in America \nand try to run up here and in 30 minutes or 2 days or a week decide \nwhat program we are going to slash that everybody can agree to so we \ncan send help, whether it is to West Virginia or to Florida or to \nMichigan or Louisiana. That is no way to run a government.\n  Now tea party people and Republicans want to bring change to \nWashington. I welcome some of that change but not this. This is not a \nchange we need. This is not a good policy for America. I am not opposed \nto change. I am adaptable. I am a centrist. I am a moderate. I can \nlisten to what Republicans and Democrats say, and I am proud of that. \nIt is a strength. I consider it a strength, not a weakness. This is not \na change I can support lightly, and that is what this fight is about. \nWe may be forced to change, but if we are, I want the people of America \nto know this was Eric Cantor's idea. This is on the tea party agenda. I \ndo not think it should be on America's agenda.\n\n[[Page S5971]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2009.\n     Hon. Dr. Steven Chu,\n     Secretary of Energy, James Forrestal Building, Independence \n         Avenue, SW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Chu: We write today to highlight the \n     remarkable automotive innovation occurring in Indiana--and \n     the tremendous potential for Hoosiers to lead our national \n     effort in transforming the automotive sector. Indiana is \n     uniquely qualified and prepared to lead the nation and the \n     world in the development and commercialization of advanced \n     battery, electric drive vehicles and other innovative \n     transportation technologies.\n       Hoosiers are committed to reaching our national goal of \n     reducing ow dependence on foreign oil, and they are actively \n     researching, developing and manufacturing technologies that \n     will be cleaner and create lasting jobs.\n       The Hoosier state is the most manufacturing intensive state \n     in the union and is home to some 700 automotive related \n     companies which employ more than 130,000 workers. Moreover, \n     Indiana's broad diversity of domestic and international \n     companies, its long experience manufacturing light duty, \n     heavy duty, recreational and military vehicles, and its rich \n     legacy pioneering the development of the electric power train \n     makes the state a national hub for automotive technology \n     development. Indiana's proven experience positions it to be \n     the leader in next-generation batteries and electric drive \n     vehicles. Hoosier companies like Delco Remy and later Delphi \n     were ahead of their time in producing batteries systems for \n     advanced technology vehicles, leading the development of the \n     battery system for the EVI, GM's first and only electric \n     vehicle.\n       Indiana already is home to a number of established and \n     emerging battery and electric vehicle technology companies. \n     Our state is- also a national hub for battery systems \n     development and testing for the defense and national security \n     industry with unique assets like the U.S. Navy's Naval \n     Surface Warfare Center Crane, which has forged strong \n     partnerships around energy storage technologies with several \n     top defense contractors across Indiana.\n       In addition, Indiana's world-class research universities \n     including Purdue University, Indiana University-Purdue \n     University Indianapolis and the University of Notre Dame have \n     formed an active research and development partnership around \n     next-generation battery technology and are working with a \n     network of industry partners to accelerate technology \n     transfer. These university partners are also collaborating \n     with Indiana's statewide community colleges to develop new \n     degree programs and curriculums needed to prepare the Hoosier \n     workforce for advanced battery technology jobs.\n       Most importantly, Hoosiers have committed themselves to the \n     goal of transforming our transportation sector. Diverse \n     stakeholders recognize that no one company has all the \n     answers and that success requires collaboration and \n     partnership that crosses multiple industry boundaries. \n     Hoosier companies have forged a number of joint partnerships \n     involving Fortune 500 companies, innovative start-ups anti \n     leading research institutions to leverage their assets and \n     accelerate the development of advanced battery and energy \n     technology solutions. Likewise, community support is \n     palpable, with a steady stream of interest from local \n     governments, schools, universities and non-government groups.\n       We strongly believe that Indiana is the smart choice for \n     investment of grants, loans and other federal support for the \n     research, development and commercialization of advanced \n     automotive technologies and fuels. In particular, several \n     Hoosier companies have applied for existing grants and loans \n     through the $2 billion Electric Drive Vehicle Battery and \n     Component Manufacturing Initiative and the $25 billion \n     Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program. As \n     you evaluate these proposals, we encourage you to remember \n     the strong multiplier effect that will come by investing in a \n     state already committed and with a broad base of support and \n     experience.\n       Indiana's automotive and energy technology industries are \n     uniquely positioned to participate in these new programs. \n     Their experience, technical expertise, and commitment to \n     collaboration would provide significant leverage for any \n     federal investment. Investing in Hoosier innovation will make \n     America safer, make our economy stronger and make our \n     environment cleaner.\n       We strongly encourage you to give full consideration to the \n     innovative applications for federal investment made by \n     Indiana companies and institutions to accelerate the \n     commercialization of high performance, safe, and cost \n     effective advanced battery technologies.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Richard G. Lugar, Evan Bayh, Dan Burton, Peter J. \n           Visclosky, Steve Buyer, Mark E. Souder, Mike Pence, \n           Baron P. Hill, Joe Donnelly, Brad Ellsworth, Andre \n           Carson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 16, 2011.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I was pleased on August 29th, 2010 when \n     you spoke at Xavier University on the fifth anniversary of \n     Hurricane Katrina about the will to keep up the fight to \n     recover from that catastrophic event. During the speech, you \n     spoke right to the survivors of the disaster and said, ``My \n     administration is going to stand with you--and fight \n     alongside you--until the job is done. Until New Orleans is \n     all the way back, all the way.''\n       I am asking you to stand with me now. Based on the latest \n     estimates from the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     (FEMA), the Disaster Relief Fund is expected to be exhausted \n     in June. I understand that a minimum of $1.565 billion is \n     needed just to meet the costs of eligible projects for the \n     balance of this fiscal year. This shortfall is largely the \n     result of past catastrophic and major disasters, such as \n     Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike, the Midwest floods of \n     2008, and the Tennessee floods of 2010.\n       In the absence of an emergency supplemental request from \n     you, the House Republican Leadership has decided to include \n     $1.565 billion of non-emergency funding in H.R. 1, now \n     pending before the House. In order to pay for this funding, \n     H.R. 1 reduces funding for the Coast Guard, FEMA, and State \n     and local first responders and emergency managers, the very \n     agencies that are responsible for preparing for and \n     responding to future disasters. It is true that in these \n     tough economic times, it is critical that we make disciplined \n     funding decisions, but it makes no sense to strip agencies of \n     the resources they need to prepare for future disasters in \n     order to pay for the costs of past disasters. We simply \n     cannot return to the days when FEMA could not do its job. \n     Therefore, I ask you to submit, without delay, a request for \n     emergency supplemental funding.\n       Without your request for the needed amount of funding, I am \n     concerned that history will soon repeat itself. Last year, \n     FEMA was forced to stop making payments for over five months \n     to my State and States across the Nation for recovery efforts \n     from past disasters. In addition to the $1.565 billion that \n     is necessary to continue disaster recovery this year, FEMA \n     estimates that $6 billion will be required in FY 2012-2014 to \n     pay for the recovery costs of past catastrophic disasters. \n     Such funding simply cannot be accommodated within the \n     existing budget of the Department of Homeland Security. I am \n     concerned that if only the amount to cover known costs for FY \n     2011 is requested, $1.565 billion, then FEMA and OMB will \n     once again have to stop making payments to States. There is \n     no reason for this to happen again. It is imperative that in \n     this and future budgets you request a sufficient amount of \n     funding for both the known costs of past disasters and the \n     estimated costs of future disasters.\n       In your August 29th speech, you said, ``I wanted to make \n     sure that the federal government was a partner--not an \n     obstacle--to recovery here in the Gulf Coast.'' \n     Unfortunately, the budget process applied to the Disaster \n     Relief Fund is an obstacle to recovery in Louisiana and the \n     whole Nation. Your Administration has done a lot to help my \n     State of Louisiana recover. I ask for your renewed commitment \n     to continue that effort.\n       With kindest regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mary L. Landrieu,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 2011.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Based on the latest estimates from the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Disaster \n     Relief Fund is expected to be exhausted in June, at the very \n     beginning of the hurricane season. A minimum of $1.565 \n     billion is needed just to meet the costs of eligible projects \n     for the balance of this fiscal year. This shortfall is \n     largely the result of past catastrophic and major disasters, \n     such as Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and Ike, the \n     Midwest floods of 2008, and the Tennessee floods of 2010.\n       There are currently 49 States that are recovering from \n     major disasters that you have declared under the Robert T. \n     Stafford Act. All of these recovery efforts would be put on \n     hold if FEMA is forced to stop disaster payments. Last year, \n     FEMA was forced to stop such payments for five months, \n     delaying recovery and increasing costs across the Nation. We \n     should not allow history to repeat itself.\n       Further complicating this funding problem is the imminent \n     onset of the flood season. The National Weather Service is \n     projecting that the country is at risk of, ``moderate to \n     major flooding this spring'', particularly in the Midwest. \n     The tragic events in Japan have reminded us of the potential \n     consequences of a catastrophic disaster. In responding to a \n     catastrophic disaster such as Hurricane Katrina, the current \n     Disaster Relief Fund balance would be exhausted in three \n     days.\n       In the absence of an emergency supplemental request from \n     you, the House Republican Leadership decided to include an \n     additional $1.565 billion of non-emergency funding for the \n     Disaster Relief Fund in H.R. 1. In order to pay for this \n     shortfall, H.R. 1 reduces funding for the Coast Guard, FEMA, \n     and State and local first responders and emergency managers, \n     the very agencies that are responsible for preparing for and \n     responding to future disasters. It is true that in these \n     tough economic times, it is critical that we make disciplined \n     funding decisions, but it\n\n[[Page S5972]]\n\n     makes no sense to strip agencies of the resources they need \n     to prepare for future disasters in order to pay for the costs \n     of past disasters. This problem only gets worse next year. \n     FEMA estimates the additional shortfall in FY 2012 to be $3 \n     billion.\n       We simply cannot return to the days when FEMA could not do \n     its job. Therefore, we ask you to submit, without delay, a \n     request for emergency supplemental funding. H.R. 1, as it \n     passed the House, contains $159 billion of emergency funding \n     for Overseas Contingencies because the Department of Defense \n     cannot absorb the cost of the wars within its base budget. \n     Similarly, the Department of Homeland Security cannot absorb \n     the costs of catastrophic disasters in its base budget.\n       Funding shortfalls in the Disaster Relief Fund with an \n     emergency designation is consistent with past practice, by \n     Democrats and Republicans alike. Since 1992, $110 billion out \n     of $128 billion appropriated to the DRF has been emergency \n     spending, primarily for Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and \n     Ike, and 9/11. In your budget estimates, you have included an \n     allowance for disaster costs, a responsible recognition of \n     the potential costs of disasters. However, absent an \n     emergency supplemental request, this allowance is nothing \n     more than an unfilled promise to communities recovering from \n     disasters.\n       We thank you for your consideration of this important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mary Landrieu, Sheldon Whitehouse, Tom Harkin, Dianne \n           Feinstein, Al Franken, Joe Lieberman, Barbara Boxer, \n           Richard Durbin, Jack Reed, Kent Conrad, Amy Klobuchar, \n           Frank Lautenberg, Ron Wyden, Jay Rockefeller.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2011.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On February 18, 2011 and March 17, \n     2011, I wrote you urging that you request an emergency FY \n     2011 supplemental to address the shortfall in funding in the \n     Department of Homeland Security Disaster Relief Fund. The \n     $1.2 billion shortfall for FY 2011 was largely the result of \n     past Presidentially-designated catastrophic disasters, such \n     as Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and Ike, the Midwest \n     floods of 2008, and the Tennessee floods of 2010. \n     Regrettably, no request was submitted to the Congress. The \n     recent tornados make this request all the more urgent \n     demonstrating once again that natural disasters are indeed \n     unpredictable, expensive, and require our compassionate and \n     effective response.\n       In the absence of an emergency supplemental funding \n     request, Congress had to make the difficult decision to cut \n     the base budget for the Department of Homeland Security by $1 \n     billion to accommodate the shortfall in fiscal year 2011. The \n     only other alternative was for the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency (FEMA) to stop making payments for past \n     disaster recovery efforts when they were estimated to run out \n     of money in July of 2011, the beginning of the hurricane \n     season. Congress determined that it made no sense to compound \n     the pain of communities devastated by past disasters by \n     stopping the recovery process.\n       As Chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations \n     Subcommittee, I am now drafting the FY 2012 Homeland Security \n     Appropriations bill. We have scrutinized your $43.6 billion \n     request. With one glaring exception, I find the request to be \n     balanced and responsive to the many threats that this Nation \n     faces. Regrettably, as in FY 2011, the request does not \n     include any funding to address what FEMA estimated before the \n     most recent disaster to be a $3 billion shortfall for the \n     Disaster Relief Fund for FY 2012.\n       This past week, you told the victims of the tornados in \n     Alabama that you would make sure that they were not \n     forgotten. You made a similar promise in New Orleans on the \n     fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. These promises cannot \n     be fulfilled without funding for the recovery effort, efforts \n     that often take many years of sustained investment.\n       It is true that in these tough economic times, we must make \n     disciplined funding decisions, but it makes no sense to strip \n     agencies of the resources they need to deter, prepare for, \n     and respond to future disasters in order to pay for the costs \n     of past disasters. Yet without leadership from the \n     Administration, we were forced, in the full-year continuing \n     resolution, to cut funding below your request for first \n     responder equipment and training grants, cyber security, port \n     security, transit security, and aviation security. Frankly, \n     given the increased threat of homegrown terrorism that you \n     eloquently spoke of in your State of the Union Address, and \n     the evolving threat that Secretary Napolitano has testified \n     to, these cuts were neither responsible nor cost-effective.\n       Your FY 2012 request of $1.8 billion, which is based on a \n     projection of the five-year average of disaster costs \n     excluding catastrophic disasters, includes no funding for the \n     known costs of past catastrophic disasters. As a candidate, \n     you rightly criticized your predecessor for hiding known \n     costs from his budget.\n       I urge you to seek emergency funding for the documented $3 \n     billion shortfall for FY 2012. As you know, it is consistent \n     with past practice, by Democrats and Republicans alike, to \n     fund Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) shortfalls with an emergency \n     designation. Since 1992, $110 billion out of $131 billion \n     appropriated to the DRF has been true emergency spending. You \n     include in your budget an allowance for disaster costs, which \n     is a responsible recognition of the potential costs of \n     disasters. However, absent an emergency funding request, this \n     allowance is nothing more than an unfilled promise to \n     communities recovering from disasters.\n       The Department of Homeland Security simply cannot absorb a \n     $3 billion shortfall in the proposed budget of $43.6 billion \n     for fiscal year 2012. Absent an emergency request, the \n     priorities that you have identified in your request to secure \n     the homeland will all regrettably be jeopardized.\n       Congress will begin drafting fiscal year 2012 \n     appropriations bill this month. In the continued uncertainty \n     of how the Administration will address the shortfall, I fear \n     the House will make the same irresponsible cuts it proposed \n     in H.R.1, only deeper, including cuts in FEMA, the \n     Transportation Security Administration, United States Coast \n     Guard, United States Secret Service, cyber, port, and transit \n     security, and grants to State and local governments to equip \n     and train first responders. In light of the threats this \n     Nation faces, such cuts make no sense.\n       I ask that you submit an emergency funding request for the \n     estimated shortfall for fiscal year 2012 without delay. \n     Disaster victims in 49 States, including the victims of the \n     recent tornados that have crossed this Nation, would be \n     impacted if FEMA were forced to stop disaster recovery \n     payments next spring.\n\n                       With kindest regards, I am\n\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Mary L. Landrieu,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n     Subcommittee on Homeland Security.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2011.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As the waters of the Mississippi River \n     continue to rise each day, communities in the lower \n     Mississippi River valley are bracing for widespread flooding. \n     In my state of Louisiana, farms and towns along the \n     Mississippi and in the Atchafalaya Floodway are busy \n     preparing to safeguard lives and property from devastation, \n     and we need your help.\n       The U.S. Army Corps and FEMA should continue their ongoing \n     efforts to notify individuals of the impending risk and help \n     them to escape from harm. I urge you to also move swiftly to \n     approve the pending and anticipated requests for disaster \n     declarations in the affected parishes of Louisiana, While I \n     appreciate the emergency declarations that have already been \n     issued for Louisiana and other states, more help will be \n     needed to fight the flood waters and help communities to \n     recover.\n       Specifically, I believe that public and individual \n     assistance from FEMA, crop disaster, conservation, and \n     watershed assistance from USDA, fisheries disaster assistance \n     from NOAA, disaster loans from SBA, and housing vouchers and \n     recovery grants from HUD will be needed in some communities. \n     Further, I urge you to instruct all of these agencies to \n     perform expedited damage assessments in order to determine \n     eligibility for Federal assistance.\n       By all accounts, the Mississippi River and Tributaries \n     (MR) Project is performing as intended and critical \n     investments over many decades have paid huge dividends in \n     reducing damage. However, not all communities in the path of \n     these flood waters have adequate protection, and additional \n     system upgrades will ultimately be required. According to the \n     U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, only 88 percent of the MR \n     Project has been completed since its initiation after the \n     Great Flood of 1927. I call on you to join me in analyzing \n     these remaining needs and developing a strategy to address \n     them as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mary L. Landrieu,\n                                            United States Senator.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I see the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I think we all appreciate so much the \npassion and compassion our colleague from Louisiana has for the people \nof America--not just the people of Louisiana but all over America. I \nthank her for taking this fight and making sure people understand what \nwe are fighting for. Being one of the other centrists in this body--and \nI think we have a majority right now--three of us--I appreciate all of \nus being in attendance.\n  I rise today to address the enormous frustration the American people \nmust feel witnessing their government and their leaders engaging in \nanother futile political exercise. Our government is being driven--and \nI agree with the Senator from Louisiana that we are not going to shut \ndown over this, but it is unbelievable to get into the fuss we are in \nright now, to make people believe we could come to the brink of another \nwhen we just went through this bloody mess in August.\n\n[[Page S5973]]\n\n  There is not a State in this great Nation that has not suffered the \nterrible tragedy and cost of a natural disaster. While there are many \ngovernment programs and issues we should vigorously debate, we surely \ncannot question the responsibility of government to help our \ncommunities in their darkest moments. In the America I believe in, we \ndon't look the other way when a community is suffering from the pain of \na natural disaster. We stand to offer a helping hand. It is this spirit \nof helping each other that has defined this Nation since its very \nbeginning, and we cannot let politics destroy that spirit.\n  Our belief in helping each other is a bedrock value for this country, \nand it runs much deeper than a belief in a political party. We are \nAmericans, and for the sake of this great Nation I know we all love, \nthese petty squabbles that define this place must end. That is why we \nmust fund FEMA disaster relief and why I voted for a Senate bill that \nwould fund FEMA through the end of the fiscal year.\n  Yes, we all agree that funding for disaster relief should be paid for \nin these most difficult times and especially now that we are looking at \nthese deficits we have accrued. Yes, we must save and set aside that \nmoney. My grandfather once told me, Mr. President--and I think you can \nappreciate this, being a small businessperson--you can't give someone \nthe shirt off your back if you don't have a shirt to give them. We have \nto plan and work hard to make sure we can put ourselves in position to \nhelp others.\n  Yes, we must return to the path of fiscal responsibility where we \nmanage our budgets wisely and put away enough money for the eventual \ndisasters we know will strike. In my great State of West Virginia, we \nhave a contingency fund. We know we are going to have floods and \nchallenges throughout our State, and we set aside, every budget year, X \namount of dollars, and we accumulate that to use for a crisis. We can \ndo the same right here in this great country of ours and in the \nNation's Capital.\n  It is absolutely wrong--no ifs, ands, or buts about it--to pay for \ndisaster relief out of funds that are creating jobs, with the potential \nof creating more jobs. Are there problems with some of the programs? \nAbsolutely. Can we fix those programs? Absolutely. Should we eliminate \nprograms that cost too much and offer little return? Absolutely. But \nare we so desperate to score political points that we eliminate a \nprogram--the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program--\nwhich is actually helping to bring jobs back to America? For the \nrecord, that program is credited with saving or creating 39,000 \nAmerican jobs, most with the Ford Motor Company, an American \nmanufacturer. It is something we need more of in this country. It is a \nprogram with support from both the chamber of commerce and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers. In fact, Ford actually moved a hybrid \nbattery facility from Mexico to Michigan because of this loan program. \nI can think of a lot of loan programs we should fight over, but are we \nreally going to defund a program that has helped bring jobs back to \nAmerica? I don't think so.\n  So where do we go from here? Well, of my Republican and Democratic \nleaders, I respectfully ask them to consider how simple a choice we \nface. We can rebuild America or we can afford to pay for it. We can \nchoose to fund FEMA or afford to pay for it. We can do all of this if \nwe face the fact that we cannot continue to go into debt and spend \nbillions in Afghanistan while suggesting that in order to fund FEMA, we \nmust cut a program that actually helps to create jobs in America.\n  As I have said before, we must choose between rebuilding Afghanistan \nor rebuilding America. Today, we can make that choice. I, along with \nmany of you, choose to rebuild America. At a time when our economy is \nstrugglingly and our deficit is exploding, I cannot believe we in \nWashington would choose to rebuild another nation at the expense of our \nown. We can do better for this, and for the sake of our Nation's \nfuture, we must to better than this. We should not engage in a \npolitical theater that makes the false choice between funding disaster \nrelief or eliminating a jobs program that actually helped create \nAmerican jobs.\n  It is time for us to set our priorities. It is time for us to rebuild \nAmerica, not to rebuild Afghanistan or Iraq. Helping America to rebuild \nduring times of natural disaster must be a priority that cannot be \ndefined by partisanship.\n  In West Virginia alone, several projects worth nearly $\\1/2\\ million \nhave now been put on hold because of the bickering and squabbling that \ngoes on. Those projects include funding to help individuals whose \nproperty was damaged in the severe snowstorms in 2009, flooding in \n2010, as well as critical equipment that monitors waterflow in areas \nprone to flooding, equipment that is vital for forecasting river levels \nduring our floods. This doesn't make any sense to me, and I know it \ndoesn't make any sense to the people of West Virginia.\n  I cannot believe that any American would choose to lose billions more \nin waste and corruption in Afghanistan while we ignore the needs of our \nneighbors here at home--our neighbors who just this year survived \ntornadoes, floods, and hurricanes, and who need shelter and food.\n  I would like to offer the following amendment to offset the cost of \nfunding FEMA by eliminating $1.6 billion from programs that will fund \nnation building in Afghanistan and instead direct that money to FEMA, \nto programs that rebuild America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          affordable care act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stabenow for her work in \nprotecting children's dental coverage. I want to clarify any confusion \nabout the Finance Committee's intent when we adopted her amendment, C-\n7, on pediatric dental coverage. As I understand it, her intent was to \nensure that commercial stand-alone dental plans could participate \nfairly in an exchange and could also operate outside an exchange. The \nSenator expressly provided that these stand-alone dental plans could \noperate outside State or Federal exchanges.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct and I thank the Senator for all his \nefforts in support of children's dental coverage as well and for this \nopportunity to clarify the intentions of my amendment. I offered this \namendment to allow competition in the marketplace for dental benefits \nby allowing traditional stand-alone dental plans to participate both in \nand outside an exchange, just like health plans that provide coverage \nfor medical care. The amendment ensured that stand-alone dental \npolicies may fulfill the requirements of the essential health benefits \npackage when paired with a qualified health plan covering all benefits \nother than pediatric oral health services within the exchange. To quote \ndirectly from the amendment, it indicated that ``required pediatric \ndental benefits in the non-group and small group markets (in and \noutside an exchange) may be separately offered and priced from other \nrequired health benefits.''\n  Many American families today receive dental coverage through stand-\nalone dental plans. Failure to properly implement the amendment as it \nwas intended could result in serious disruptions in the dental coverage \nthese families receive. That is why it is important that we get this \nright, and I appreciate the opportunity to make this clarification.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator for clarifying this issue.\n  Also Senator Stabenow and I want to thank the Chairman for working so \nclosely with us and a number of our colleagues to ensure that the \nAffordable Care Act includes children's oral health care as part of the \nessential benefits package that health insurers must offer in order to \nparticipate in health insurance exchanges. In doing so, we fully \nrecognized that too many children suffer needlessly from dental \nproblems that are overwhelmingly preventable and that oral health is \nintegral to their overall health.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, I completely agree, Senator Bingaman. In fact our \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee also overwhelmingly agreed that \nchildren must have access to oral health care, which is so critical to \ntheir overall well-being. We talked about the story of Deamonte Driver, \na 12-year-old Maryland boy who died from a brain infection caused by \ntooth decay. He couldn't get access to an $80 dental procedure that \nwould have saved his life. When his condition got worse, he ended up \nenduring two emergency surgeries, weeks of hospital care, and\n\n[[Page S5974]]\n\n$250,000 worth of medical bills--but it was all too late. Stories like \nthis remind us of the importance of dental care for children, which is \nwhy the pediatric element of the essential health benefits package \nexpressly includes oral care.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Senator Stabenow, I want to be sure that we clarify any \nconfusion about the Finance Committee's intent when we adopted your \namendment, C-7, on pediatric dental coverage. As I understand it, the \nSenator's intent was to ensure that commercial stand-alone dental plans \ncould participate fairly in an exchange. When we adopted the Senator's \namendment, we understood that children receiving coverage through an \nexchange would have the same level of benefits and consumer \nprotections, including all cost sharing and affordability protections, \nwith respect to oral care. This holds true whether they received \npediatric oral care coverage from a stand-alone dental plan or from a \nqualified health plan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct, Senator Bingaman, and I thank you for \nthis opportunity to clarify my intentions. The amendment ensured that \nstand-alone dental policies may fulfill the requirements of the \nessential health benefits package when paired with a qualified health \nplan covering all benefits other than pediatric oral health services \nwithin the exchange. To be clear, I intended for stand-alone dental \nplans to fully comply with the same level of relevant consumer \nprotections that are required of qualified health plans with respect to \nthis essential benefit. To quote directly from my modified amendment C-\n7 that was adopted in committee, ``. . . stand-alone dental plans must \nbe allowed to offer the required pediatric dental benefits directly and \nto offer coverage through the Exchange and must comply with any \nrelevant consumer protections required for participation in the \nExchange.''\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator for clarifying this point.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wish to thank Senator Bingaman for raising this issue, \nand Senator Stabenow for clarifying the intentions. I would like to \necho the Senator's comments and reiterate the importance of ensuring \nthat a full and affordable oral health benefit and the consumer \nprotections we so carefully drafted apply equally to the pediatric oral \ncare benefit whether offered by a stand-alone dental plan or a \nqualified health plan in an exchange.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN: I thank Senators Baucus and Stabenow for their \nassistance in clarifying this issue.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak against the process by \nwhich this body is passing major legislation as we approach the end of \nthis fiscal year. Last week we were asked, without debate or amendment, \nto pass at least a half dozen bills reauthorizing or extending expiring \nlaws and spending authorities--some of which authorize the expenditure \nof billions of dollars over the next year.\n  Actions such as this are a big part of what gives Washington a \nreputation for being dysfunctional. The fact that authorizations for \nmany programs expire on September 30 each year is not a secret. Nor is \nit a secret when September 30 will come around each year. But instead \nof planning ahead, working for weeks or months to address a foreseeable \nneed, and actually doing its work on time, Congress resorts to passing \nmassive bills at the last minute when there is not time for serious \nscrutiny or changes.\n  It is unconscionable this body would avoid debating such programs in \na meaningful way. I would ask my colleagues, can you be sure these \nprograms are working as efficiently as possible? Can you assure the \nAmerican people the Federal Government is maximizing value for their \ntax dollars? Are these bills taking meaningful steps to eliminate waste \nand duplication within these programs?\n  We would know the answers to those questions if these bills had gone \nthrough the normal process of consideration in committees and on the \nSenate floor. Senators would have the chance to ask questions to the \nofficials administering the programs and propose changes to them. \nInstead, we are faced with bills that have had very little--if any--\nprocess in the Senate at a time where even a week's delay to consider \nthe bills will result in the programs expiring. That is unacceptable \nand should be embarrassing to the Senate as an institution.\n  We need to change the way Congress does its business. Part of that is \nreining in excessive spending and having more robust debates regarding \nthe allocation of scarce taxpayer dollars. We must do better in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, over the last week or so I have outlined, \nhere and in a letter to the Joint Select Committee on Deficit \nReduction, a seven-part plan to reduce the deficit in ways that do not \noverburden American working families or damage economic growth. In my \nletter and in three previous speeches on the Senate floor, I have \npointed out that revenues, and not just spending cuts, are necessary if \nwe are to achieve significant deficit reduction. And I have discussed \nfour proposals for restoring revenues: combating offshore tax havens; \nending the corporate stock option loophole; and ending loopholes for \nhedge fund managers and derivatives traders.\n  Today I want to discuss three additional changes to our tax system \nthat will make it more efficient and more equitable. We should make two \ntax rate changes: ending the unsustainable Bush-era tax cuts for the \nwealthiest Americans, and restoring capital gains tax rates to \nsomething approaching the rates in place under President Reagan. Also, \nwe should replace the IRS's antiquated tax lien system. These \nproposals, combined with the other points of my plan, could reduce the \ndeficit on the order of $1 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  Now, some of my colleagues may balk at the notion of reversing years \nof tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. But I believe if we take \noff our ideological blinders, if we look at facts--hard, stubborn \nfacts--the need for these reforms is clear.\n  First, we should allow Bush-era tax cuts to end for those making more \nthan $250,000. The case for this change is straightforward: It would \nrestore a measure of fairness to the tax code that has been sadly \nlacking for more than a decade, and it would reduce the deficit by \nhundreds of billions of dollars.\n  Supporters of the tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 made a number of \npromises. President Bush said his cuts ``will bring real and immediate \nbenefits to middle-income Americans.'' And yet in the decade since they \nbegan, the incomes of middle-class Americans have stagnated. According \nto the U.S. Census Bureau, the typical American household's income, \nwhen adjusted for inflation, actually fell more than 8 percent from \n2001 to 2010. President Bush said his tax cuts would increase the pace \nof job creation. And yet during the Bush years, jobs grew at roughly \none-third the rate that we enjoyed during the Clinton administration. \nPresident Bush said ``we can proceed with tax relief without fear of \nbudget deficits, even if the economy softens.'' And yet just those tax \ncuts going to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans have added hundreds \nof billions of dollars to the deficit since 2001. So, these tax cuts \nhave failed to deliver the promised benefits, and they have driven us \ndeeper and deeper into debt. Ending them will bring down the deficit; \nPresident Obama's proposal to end the cuts for high-income earners \nwould reduce the deficit by an estimated $866 billion over 10 years.\n  What these tax cuts did deliver is a striking and continuing rise in \nincome inequality. It's no coincidence that as we passed a series of \ntax cuts whose benefits overwhelmingly flow to the wealthiest \nAmericans, those wealthy individuals have seen their fortunes rise. A \nfew decades ago, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans took home 10 \npercent of all income. Today, they get 24 percent of all income. As \nthose at the top have prospered greatly, middle-class wages have \nstagnated--again, down more than 8 percent, for the median American \nhousehold, since the Bush tax cuts took effect.\n  A second proposal also would bring down the deficit and bring more \nfairness to the tax code: restoring capital gains tax rates closer to \nthose in place during the Reagan administration. Capital gains are \nincome from the increase in value of an asset, such as a stock. Today, \nthanks to the Bush-era tax cuts, the top rate on capital gains is 15 \npercent. That's substantially lower than the 28 percent rate included\n\n[[Page S5975]]\n\nin President Reagan's Tax Reform Act of 1986.\n  The theory in slashing capital gains tax rates was that lower rates \nwould encourage investment, job creation and economic growth. But as \nhas been the case with slashing ordinary income tax rates for the \nwealthy, cutting capital gains taxes simply has not delivered what \nsupporters promised. Given the stagnation in middle-class living \nstandards that we have seen since the 1980s, it is difficult to argue \nto middle-class Americans that reducing capital gains rates made them \nbetter off.\n  Instead, this is another benefit that flows overwhelmingly to the \nwealthiest among us. According to the Tax Policy Center, more than 75 \npercent of the benefit from lower capital gains taxes goes to those \nwith incomes over $1 million a year, and 94 percent of the benefit to \nthose above $200,000.\n  This tax break for the most fortunate of our citizens also adds tens \nof billions of dollars each year to the deficit. The Congressional \nBudget Office earlier this year estimated that raising the capital \ngains rate by just 2 percentage points would reduce the deficit by \nabout $50 billion over 10 years. Raising the top rate closer to Reagan-\nera levels would bring far more deficit reduction.\n  Those who fight to preserve these high-income tax cuts call attempts \nto end them ``class warfare.'' Ending these tax breaks won't start a \nclass war. It will help end one--a war that, for more than a decade, \nhas taken a devastating and immediate toll on the middle class, and \ncreated huge new deficits that damage their future prospects as well.\n  The simple fact is that if we are to ensure that the burden of \ndeficit reduction falls equitably, and that all our citizens are asked \nto contribute toward this goal, we must address these upper income tax \ncuts that have helped balloon the deficit. Deficit reduction will \nrequire spending cuts, and some of those cuts will fall hard on working \nfamilies. But we can't ask them to carry the entire burden. That would \nbe contrary to common sense, because spending cuts alone cannot achieve \nreal deficit reduction. And it would be contrary to any sense of \nfairness. We all have to contribute.\n  Our constituents are speaking, and speaking loudly, on this topic. \nAnd they are speaking eloquently. Let me tell you about an email I \nreceived from a constituent a few weeks ago about our deficit.\n  This Michigan resident and her husband consider themselves upper \nmiddle class--though she wrote that ``many would call us wealthy.'' She \nwrote to me that we need to cut spending, and to compromise to do it. \n``I will like some cuts and hate others and that is OK with me!'' she \nwrote.\n  But she also wrote: ``I also strongly urge you to consider passing \nwhat many would call tax hikes. . . . We are willing to pay a bit more \nto help our country and safeguard our children's futures.'' Upper \nincome Americans, she wrote, ``aren't paying taxes at a fair and just \nrate. Fix this.''\n  And we should fix it. This constituent of mine said she was part of a \n``silent majority'' in favor of increasing revenue. I am not sure how \nsilent they are, but she is certainly part of a majority. In a recent \nWashington Post-ABC News poll, 72 percent of Americans--and 54 percent \nof Republicans--said they favored increasing taxes on those who make \nmore than $250,000 a year as part of our deficit reduction strategy. \nAmericans are strongly in favor of a balanced approach to deficit \nreduction that protects working families. They are asking us to fight \nfor the middle class, and it is time we did so.\n  Let me discuss briefly the tax lien proposal. Tax liens are a basic \ntool to collect unpaid taxes. Today, Federal law requires liens to be \nfiled on paper in more than 4,000 locations around the country, \ndetermined by the location of the lien. The IRS maintains a service \ncenter that does nothing but monitor dozens of varying local \nrequirements for lien filings, track filings, and release liens once \nthey are paid.\n  I have introduced legislation, S. 1390, along with Senator Begich, to \nreplace this antiquated system with an electronic federal tax lien \nregistry available to the public on the Internet at no cost. The IRS \nestimates that this change would not only save millions of dollars in \nadministrative costs, but also enable the IRS to release liens more \nquickly once they have been paid and free up employees and resources \nfor other work. Equally important, a public electronic registry could \nhelp encourage those who owe taxes to settle their bills and take \nenormous pressure off taxpayers who have paid what they owe.\n  Let me come back to where I started last week. Congress faces a \ndifficult task in the weeks ahead. We must agree to $1.2 trillion or \nmore in deficit reduction over the next decade. Failure to agree on a \nplan means automatic budget cuts through the sequestration process--\nincluding greatly damaging cuts to defense and other important Federal \nprograms.\n  In my letter to the Joint Select Committee and here on the floor, I \nhave outlined ways to avoid that outcome, proposing commonsense changes \nthat bring equity to our Tax Code and restore lost revenue. If we \nreject that course, it almost certainly means damaging cuts in \nimportant programs--programs that keep our nation safe, that keep our \nfaith with senior citizens and veterans, and that prepare our children \nfor the future. Rejecting that course almost certainly means a failure \nto significantly reduce the deficit, because spending cuts alone are \nnot enough to accomplish the deficit reduction we need.\n  The choice is ours. I hope we will not allow ideology to blind us to \nthe reality of our budget situation, to the needs of middle-class \nfamilies, or to the strong and consistent message from Americans who \nare demanding a balanced approach to reducing the deficit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining on the Democratic \nside.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia is \nabsolutely right. We have tens of billions of unspent dollars sitting \nin accounts for Iraq and Afghanistan for rebuilding roads and such \nthere. Let's spend it in America. Let's spend it on America. It is \nAmerican tax dollars. Let's spend it on America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Has the time arrived for the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. In fact, before we do that, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is \nnot invoked on the pending Reid motion to concur with an amendment, the \nmajority leader be recognized to withdraw the pending motion to refer \nand the pending motion to concur with an amendment; that the majority \nleader be recognized to offer a new motion to concur with an amendment, \nthe text of which is at the desk--amendment No. 665; that there be no \namendments, points of order, or motions in order to the Reid motion to \nconcur other than budget points of order and the applicable motions to \nwaive; that there be up to 10 minutes of debate equally divided between \nthe two leaders or their designees prior to vote a vote on adoption of \nthe Reid motion to concur with an amendment; further, that the Reid \nmotion be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold; that if the Reid \nmotion to concur with an amendment is agreed to, the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of H.R. 2017 and that the majority leader be \nrecognized to offer an amendment, the text of which is at the desk; \nthat it be the only amendment in order to the bill; that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time, and the \nSenate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended, all with no \nintervening action or debate; and that if the Reid motion to concur \nwith an amendment is not agreed to, the majority leader be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n[[Page S5976]]\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Reid motion to \n     concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. \n     2608, with an amendment No. 656.\n         Harry Reid, Daniel K.

I move to concur in the House amendment to the Senate \namendment to H.R. 2608 with an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] moves to concur in the \n     House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2608, with an \n     amendment numbered 665.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the previous order, there will be now \nup to 10 minutes of debate, equally divided between the two leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know everyone is in a hurry, and I will be \nas fast as I can.\n  Tonight can best be summed up by Johnny Isakson, the Senator from \nGeorgia, who said: It is only worth fighting when there is something to \nfight for.\n  We have basically resolved this issue. I wish to recognize the \nleadership of Senator Landrieu. She chairs the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee on Appropriations. She is our expert on disaster. She has \ndone a wonderful job of maintaining this in the eyes of the public.\n  In Friday morning's vote, we established, beyond a shadow of a doubt, \nthat the Senate can't pass the House-passed CR. It got 36 votes. We \ncouldn't pass it no matter what happens. With today's vote, Senate \nRepublicans are showing they will back up the House vote on the \nquestion of offsetting spending in 2011. That is the vote we just took. \nBut today's news also points a way that is more understanding and \ncertainly a way out. Today's news story has come out saying FEMA \ndisaster aid has enough money to last through this fiscal year. This \nafternoon, I received word from Jack Lew, of OMB, and FEMA that they \nwill be able to get through the week without additional funding. That \nmeans they can get through the fiscal year without more money. I think \nit is very clear this is the right way to go. It shows us the way out \nand means we no longer have to fight 2011 funding.\n  I repeat what I said at the very beginning; that is, the way out is \nto focus on 2012. If we no longer need 2011 funding, then we can pass a \nbill that funds just 2012. This compromise should satisfy Republicans. \nIt includes their own 2012 FEMA funding number, and it should satisfy \nthe Democrats because it does not include the offsets we have talked \nabout so much. It would be a win for everyone because we could end \nwithout another government crisis.\n  I appreciate Senator McConnell for being understanding and working \nwith us in this regard. But I end this from where I started, Senator \nJohnny Isakson: Let's fight when there's something to fight about. \nThere is nothing to fight about tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to very briefly walk us \nthrough where we have been and where we are.\n  After tonight's vote, I think the best path forward is clear. The \nquickest and surest way to get FEMA all the disaster funds it needs and \nto put an end to any talk of government shutdown would have been for \nthe Senate to take up and pass the House-passed CR right away.\n  As we know, our friends on the other side will not agree to that. \nHowever, earlier today, as we all know, FEMA indicated it already has \nthe funds it needs for the duration of the current CR--which is, \nbasically, this week--without the billions more in funding Democrats \nhave been calling for.\n  Quite frankly, I think this is a vindication of what Republicans have \nbeen saying all along: Before we spend the taxpayers' money, we should \nhave a real accounting--a real accounting--of what is actually needed.\n  We also believe that, in these days of huge deficits, we need to \nprioritize our spending around here.\n  That said, with this next vote, I think the majority leader has found \na path forward, one that will continue to fund the government and which \ngives FEMA the funds it needs without any added emergency spending for \nthe rest of this current fiscal year--in other words, this week--\nemergency funds that FEMA now says it doesn't need.\n  So tonight we will have had, after the next vote, two votes: One to \nreject deficit finance disaster spending without necessary spending \ncuts elsewhere and one to keep the government operational and to \nprovide responsible disaster funding into November.\n  The CR, should it pass, will be within the top line we agreed to last \nsummer. We have already basically voted on this top line. It will \nprovide FEMA $2.65 billion in funding next fiscal year to continue the \nrecovery efforts. It will not contain any emergency spending for this \ncurrent fiscal year--the rest of this week. So it will drop both the\n\n[[Page S5977]]\n\nemergency spending and the provisions paying for that spending from the \nHouse-passed bill.\n  Again, my preferred path forward would have been to pass the House \nbill. But since our friends on the other side have rejected that \napproach, I believe this is a compromise that is a reasonable way to \nkeep the government operational.\n  So now that we have demonstrated that there aren't enough votes to \nsupport more on offset spending, I am going to vote, and would \nencourage my colleagues to vote, in favor of the clean CR, which is the \nnext vote we are going to have.\n  In my view, this entire fire drill was completely and totally \nunnecessary, but I am glad a resolution appears to be at hand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. This, tonight, is the Johnny Isakson solution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GARLAND\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \naccomplished educator and veteran who has dedicated his life to \nteaching young Kentuckians. Mr. Grover Cleveland ``G.C.'' Garland was \ninvolved with the Laurel County School System for over 50 years, where \nhe played a vital role in changing the face of education in Laurel \nCounty before finally retiring in 1988.\n  G.C., 79, graduated from Bush High School in 1948 at the age of 16. \nAt 18, he began teaching at Sasser School, part of the Laurel County \nSchool District, after only 2 years of college--his oldest student was \n16, barely 2 years younger than him. G.C. spent another year teaching \nbefore he joined the U.S. Air Force to serve his country in the Korean \nwar.\n  G.C. received his basic training in San Antonio, TX, and was \ntransferred around before ending up in Fairbanks, AK. While on leave \nfrom his duties G.C. met his wife of 56 years, Joan, at the Ocean Wave \nSkating Rink in Fariston, KY.\n  In January 1956, G.C. was discharged from the Air Force and returned \nto Kentucky, where he returned to school at the University of Kentucky \nand received a degree in secondary education. He majored in math, \nhistory, and political science. After graduation, G.C. and his family \nreturned to Laurel County and he began teaching at Bush. During his 8 \nyears at Bush, G.C. received his master's degree and also assumed the \nrole of part-time guidance counselor.\n  In 1965, G.C. assumed the position of central office supervisor after \nLaurel County School Superintendent Hayward Gilliam asked him to help \nbuild Laurel County's first million-dollar high school. He spent 13 \nyears as supervisor before being hired as the Laurel County \nsuperintendent in 1978. In his 10-year tenure as superintendent, he \noversaw several major projects, including the construction of Cold Hill \nElementary and junior high schools North and South Laurel Middle \nSchools.\n  In 2006 Mr. Garland was honored when the Laurel County school \nadministration named one of the new office buildings after him--the \nG.C. Garland Administration Building, on the campus of London \nElementary School. Furthermore, two of G.C.'s daughters, Jan and \nSharon, currently work at Bush Elementary School.\n  Grover Cleveland ``G.C.'' Garland's lifetime of work and dedication \nto the education of Kentuckians is truly an inspiration to the people \nof our great Commonwealth. The Laurel County Sentinel Echo recently \npublished an article highlighting and thanking G.C. for his service to \nthe people of Kentucky. I ask unanimous consent that the full article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Laurel County Sentinel Echo, Spring 2011]\n\n                           Building a Legacy\n\n                            (By Sue Minton)\n\n       For more than 50 years Grover Cleveland (G.C.) has been \n     involved with the Laurel County School System, except for \n     four years he served his country in the U.S. Air Force, and \n     one year teaching another county.\n       The 79-year-old entered Murray Elementary School (Clay \n     County) at the age of five\n\n[[Page S5988]]\n\n     and finished his elementary years at Burning Springs \n     Elementary.\n       ``Burning Springs was a three-room elementary school and \n     they didn't teach every grade every year,'' Garland said. \n     ``They were not teaching the fifth grade the year I was \n     supposed to be in the fifth. I was promoted to the sixth \n     grade and this put me two years ahead of myself. I always did \n     well academically, but socializing and sports were a problem \n     for me. I was a nerd in today's language.''\n       Before Garland entered high school, his parents moved from \n     Clay County to Laurel County and he continued his education \n     at Bush High School, graduating in 1948 at the age of 16.\n       Then having completed two years of college, the 18-year-old \n     found himself teaching at a one-room school.\n       ``The year was 1950 and I was teaching in the Laurel County \n     School District at Sasser School, teaching grades first \n     through eighth,'' he recalls. He had one student, a girl, who \n     was 16, just two years younger than he was at the time.\n       ``That first year I also had two beginners. This concerned \n     me,'' he added. ``I thought, how would I ever deal with them. \n     By the end of the school year I was more proud of them than \n     any of the other students. You could really see what they had \n     accomplished.''\n       For his second year Garland was transferred to Valley \n     Grove, the last one-room school built in Laurel County. ``I \n     had only taught there half a year when I received greetings \n     from President Harry Truman. I didn't let them draft me; I \n     joined the Air Force. The Korean Conflict was raging at that \n     time.''\n       Garland received his basic training at Lackland Air Force \n     Base in San Antonio, Texas. He was later transferred to \n     Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss., where he remained \n     for two years before going to Low Air Force Base in Denver, \n     Colo.\n       ``I was in Denver three months before I was transferred to \n     Fairbank, Alaska with Project Remote,'' he said. ``While \n     there I developed back trouble and was transported to a \n     bigger hospital at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois. The \n     doctors were getting ready to do surgery when the surgeon \n     went on leave. I was sent to Walter Reed Medical Center in \n     Washington, D.C. where I had surgery.''\n       ``After recovering from back surgery, I returned to Laurel \n     County to get my wife, Joan, and my car,'' he added. ``I got \n     married before going to Alaska, but she couldn't go with me. \n     I only had about six months left in my enlistment period and \n     we returned to Washington, D.C.''\n       Although both Garland and his wife, Joan, were from Laurel \n     County, they had not met before.\n       ``I met Joan on leave from the Air Force at the Ocean Wave \n     Skating Rink at Fariston,'' he recalls. ``We planned on \n     getting married at Christmas in 1954, but I got my orders for \n     Alaska in October. I asked her if we could get married before \n     I left and she said `yes.' '' The couple have been married 56 \n     years.\n       In January 1956, Garland was discharged from the U.S. Air \n     Force. He and Joan returned to Kentucky and Garland returned \n     to education.\n       He attended the University of Kentucky, receiving a degree \n     in secondary education majoring in math, history and \n     political science. While at UK, Garland taught one year at an \n     elementary school in Bourbon County. Also, his son, Ronald \n     Wayne, was born. (Wayne is now a chemical engineer for \n     Eastman Chemical Company in Kingsport, Tenn.).\n       Garland and his family moved back to Laurel County and he \n     started teaching at Bush School. For eight years he taught \n     mostly math.\n       He remembers teaching trigonometry to one senior class. \n     ``The class had an average I.Q. of 120. Those students have \n     gone on to do great things. I wish we put more emphasis on \n     the Gifted and Talented Program these days.''\n       ``Also, our daughters, Sharon and Jan, were born during my \n     tenure at Bush.''\n       Garland later accepted the responsibilities of a half-time \n     guidance counselor.\n       ``The guidance counselor program began while I was at \n     Bush,'' he said.\n       ``I picked-up my master's degree while I was teaching at \n     Bush and it was at this time the National Defense Education \n     Act began. The government got all excited after Russia \n     launched the satellite Sputnik, thinking other countries were \n     superior to the United States in math and science. This \n     spurred more training for math teachers and guidance \n     counselors. I was in both categories, so I got a lot of those \n     institutes. I made a summer job out of going to school. Joan \n     said I was a professional student.''\n       It was during one of the institutes at UK during the summer \n     of 1965 that Garland was contacted by then Laurel County \n     School Superintendent Hayward Gilliam. ``Mr. Gilliam told me \n     he wanted to bring me into the central office as a \n     supervisor. He said he was going to build a new high school \n     and wanted me to help him. At that time we still had 12 to 14 \n     one-and-two room schools. They had been good in their day, \n     but their day had long since passed.''\n       Garland relates a story pertaining to a one-room school.\n       ``When I went into the central office it was during Lyndon \n     Johnson's term and they had just discovered poverty in these \n     hills.' The Council of Southern Mountains in Berea had \n     gathered some books they wanted to send to our one-and-two \n     room schools. People had donated the books; they were mostly \n     for adults. One of the schools received some of these books \n     in a blue footlocker. A representative from the council came \n     down to see where his books had gone and what good they had \n     done. I took him to the school. They had a substitute teacher \n     that day and she had no idea where his books had gone. He \n     noticed a big blue patch on the front door and said `at least \n     the box was useful.' They had taken part of the footlocker \n     and patched a hole on the front door.''\n       He recalls how the new school, Laurel County High School, \n     was built.\n       ``Before I took the supervisor's job I talked to some \n     people and was told they didn't think the district could \n     build a new school. The district was in debt. But, Mr. \n     Gilliam was determined. That was the same year of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the ``big'' \n     federal aid program that offered funds to areas in poverty. \n     It was broken down into different programs, one being the \n     Title I Program. Laurel County's first allotment of Title I \n     money was $414,860. That was a lot of money in those days. We \n     still had those one-and-two room schools, were short on \n     teachers and short overall on classrooms. The people over \n     ESEA first said no construction with the funds. Susan Lou \n     Young and I came into the central office at the same time as \n     supervisors and we went with Mr. Gilliam to Frankfort to \n     speak with the state coordinator of Title I. We were told we \n     could not use the funds for construction. Mrs. Young said, \n     `Looks like we are just too poor to be helped.' The \n     coordinator later said he thought about that and went to \n     Washington, D.C. They agreed some of the money could be used \n     for construction.''\n       Among the first building projects were libraries and \n     reading rooms on the existing consolidated schools, followed \n     by a lunchroom at Bush School.\n       Mr. Gilliam approached Garland saying he could purchase a \n     60-acre farm for $2,000 an acre if he could get $80,000 from \n     the Title I money.'\n       ``We told them in Frankfort how we were going to do away \n     with the one-and-two room schools and consolidate so the \n     students could have more Title I services,'' Garland added. \n     ``London School, and independent district, was bursting at \n     the seams and had no room to expand. At this time they merged \n     with the Laurel County School District, and in the 1970-71 \n     school year Laurel County High School opened, partially built \n     with Title I funds.''\n       ``This was the first million-dollar school in Laurel \n     County,'' he added. ``And the four old high schools became \n     junior highs.''\n       After 13 years as a supervisor and federal programs \n     coordinator with the school district and the retirement of \n     both Mr. Gilliam and the assistant superintendent, Garland \n     pitched his hat in the ring for superintendent.\n       In 1978 Garland was hired as superintendent with a two-year \n     contract. Joe McKnight came on-board as assistant \n     superintendent.\n       In 1980 Garland's contract was not renewed and with 30 \n     years of service to the district, he retired.\n       ``That fall, the political climate changed. The \n     superintendent was terminated and I applied to come back,'' \n     Garland said. ``I was hired, finished the former \n     superintendent's term and received a four-year contract. I \n     was superintendent for 10 years minus the 6 or 7 months when \n     my contract was not renewed, retiring under my own steam in \n     1988.''\n       Under Garland's administration, Cold Hill Elementary and \n     the junior high schools, now North and South Laurel Middle \n     Schools, were the major projects.\n       In 2006, Laurel County's current school administration paid \n     tribute to his legacy in education by naming one of the new \n     administration office buildings after him--the G.C. Garland \n     Administration Building, located on the campus of London \n     Elementary School.\n       Assistant Superintendent Joe McKnight succeeded Garland as \n     superintendent. ``Joe did a lot for the system. The second \n     high school, north Laurel High School, Hunter Hills and the \n     new Bush school were built while he was superintendent.''\n       With two daughters in education--Jan teaching fifth grade \n     and Sharon a guidance counselor, both at Bush Elementary \n     School--Garland thinks the education field has changed a \n     great deal.\n       ``The facilities have changed dramatically over the years. \n     We have always had good people, but there is no comparison to \n     the facilities today as to 1965 when I went into the central \n     office. Teachers are better trained today, at least in terms \n     of college years and degrees and there is more and better \n     funding of services for students. Teachers see it harder \n     because of paperwork involved and discipline. I think \n     paperwork takes away from time that could be used for \n     instruction. But I guess students are like the rest of us, \n     they are spoiled by all that has been handed to them. I just \n     hope we don't hand them the debt to pay.''\n       ``I don't think society in general appreciates a good \n     education. Not necessarily the children. I think we are a \n     spoiled society. In my days in school when they talked about \n     rights, they talked about responsibility as well. Since the \n     60s we have majored on rights with very little talk about \n     responsibility.''\n       ``Again, we have always had good people in the Laurel \n     County School System and I was always for the principals and \n     assistant principals,'' he said. ``In my time we kind of used \n     them as a board of directors. They made it easier on us in \n     the central office. They had a hand in setting the policies \n     and they backed the policies.''\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\n       Garland said he missed the students terribly for a while \n     after he left the classroom, as well as the good people he \n     worked with at the central office and the school system in \n     general.\n       ``I worked with a lot of good people,'' he said. ``We had a \n     great team. I give any credit due to my family, my church and \n     all the people I worked with. Also, I think we all owe a debt \n     of gratitude to our current board members and to all who have \n     ever served in that role.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/26/senate-section/article/S5987-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5987-S5989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO GROVER CLEVELAND ``G.C.'' GARLAND\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \naccomplished educator and veteran who has dedicated his life to \nteaching young Kentuckians. Mr. Grover Cleveland ``G.C.'' Garland was \ninvolved with the Laurel County School System for over 50 years, where \nhe played a vital role in changing the face of education in Laurel \nCounty before finally retiring in 1988.\n  G.C., 79, graduated from Bush High School in 1948 at the age of 16. \nAt 18, he began teaching at Sasser School, part of the Laurel County \nSchool District, after only 2 years of college--his oldest student was \n16, barely 2 years younger than him. G.C. spent another year teaching \nbefore he joined the U.S. Air Force to serve his country in the Korean \nwar.\n  G.C. received his basic training in San Antonio, TX, and was \ntransferred around before ending up in Fairbanks, AK. While on leave \nfrom his duties G.C. met his wife of 56 years, Joan, at the Ocean Wave \nSkating Rink in Fariston, KY.\n  In January 1956, G.C. was discharged from the Air Force and returned \nto Kentucky, where he returned to school at the University of Kentucky \nand received a degree in secondary education. He majored in math, \nhistory, and political science. After graduation, G.C. and his family \nreturned to Laurel County and he began teaching at Bush. During his 8 \nyears at Bush, G.C. received his master's degree and also assumed the \nrole of part-time guidance counselor.\n  In 1965, G.C. assumed the position of central office supervisor after \nLaurel County School Superintendent Hayward Gilliam asked him to help \nbuild Laurel County's first million-dollar high school. He spent 13 \nyears as supervisor before being hired as the Laurel County \nsuperintendent in 1978. In his 10-year tenure as superintendent, he \noversaw several major projects, including the construction of Cold Hill \nElementary and junior high schools North and South Laurel Middle \nSchools.\n  In 2006 Mr. Garland was honored when the Laurel County school \nadministration named one of the new office buildings after him--the \nG.C. Garland Administration Building, on the campus of London \nElementary School. Furthermore, two of G.C.'s daughters, Jan and \nSharon, currently work at Bush Elementary School.\n  Grover Cleveland ``G.C.'' Garland's lifetime of work and dedication \nto the education of Kentuckians is truly an inspiration to the people \nof our great Commonwealth. The Laurel County Sentinel Echo recently \npublished an article highlighting and thanking G.C. for his service to \nthe people of Kentucky. I ask unanimous consent that the full article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Laurel County Sentinel Echo, Spring 2011]\n\n                           Building a Legacy\n\n                            (By Sue Minton)\n\n       For more than 50 years Grover Cleveland (G.C.) has been \n     involved with the Laurel County School System, except for \n     four years he served his country in the U.S. Air Force, and \n     one year teaching another county.\n       The 79-year-old entered Murray Elementary School (Clay \n     County) at the age of five\n\n[[Page S5988]]\n\n     and finished his elementary years at Burning Springs \n     Elementary.\n       ``Burning Springs was a three-room elementary school and \n     they didn't teach every grade every year,'' Garland said. \n     ``They were not teaching the fifth grade the year I was \n     supposed to be in the fifth. I was promoted to the sixth \n     grade and this put me two years ahead of myself. I always did \n     well academically, but socializing and sports were a problem \n     for me. I was a nerd in today's language.''\n       Before Garland entered high school, his parents moved from \n     Clay County to Laurel County and he continued his education \n     at Bush High School, graduating in 1948 at the age of 16.\n       Then having completed two years of college, the 18-year-old \n     found himself teaching at a one-room school.\n       ``The year was 1950 and I was teaching in the Laurel County \n     School District at Sasser School, teaching grades first \n     through eighth,'' he recalls. He had one student, a girl, who \n     was 16, just two years younger than he was at the time.\n       ``That first year I also had two beginners. This concerned \n     me,'' he added. ``I thought, how would I ever deal with them. \n     By the end of the school year I was more proud of them than \n     any of the other students. You could really see what they had \n     accomplished.''\n       For his second year Garland was transferred to Valley \n     Grove, the last one-room school built in Laurel County. ``I \n     had only taught there half a year when I received greetings \n     from President Harry Truman. I didn't let them draft me; I \n     joined the Air Force. The Korean Conflict was raging at that \n     time.''\n       Garland received his basic training at Lackland Air Force \n     Base in San Antonio, Texas. He was later transferred to \n     Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss., where he remained \n     for two years before going to Low Air Force Base in Denver, \n     Colo.\n       ``I was in Denver three months before I was transferred to \n     Fairbank, Alaska with Project Remote,'' he said. ``While \n     there I developed back trouble and was transported to a \n     bigger hospital at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois.

I asked her if we could get married before \n     I left and she said `yes.' '' The couple have been married 56 \n     years.\n       In January 1956, Garland was discharged from the U.S. Air \n     Force. He and Joan returned to Kentucky and Garland returned \n     to education.\n       He attended the University of Kentucky, receiving a degree \n     in secondary education majoring in math, history and \n     political science. While at UK, Garland taught one year at an \n     elementary school in Bourbon County. Also, his son, Ronald \n     Wayne, was born.

Mr. President, I rise today to join in the \ncelebration of Hispanic Heritage Month and to recognize the many \ninvaluable contributions that have been made by the Hispanic-American \ncommunity.\n  For generations, a vibrant Hispanic community has worked tirelessly \nto enrich and strengthen our Nation.\n  With ancestors coming to the U.S. from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean, \nand Central and South America, the Hispanic community's rich culture \nhas enhanced the great diversity of the United States.\n  According to the latest census numbers, there are more than 54 \nmillion people of Hispanic heritage living in the United States, \nincluding 4 million in Puerto Rico alone.\n  All across America, a vibrant Hispanic-American community is \ncontributing to all sectors of our economy and is playing a key role as \nsmall business entrepreneurs and government leaders on the Federal, \nState and local levels.\n  This is especially true in California, my home State, which boasts \nover 1,000 publicly elected officials of Hispanic heritage. These \ndedicated public officials serve as Members of the U.S. Congress, the \nCalifornia State Legislature, and hold numerous positions on the city \nand county levels of government.\n  This year, I was proud to support the nomination of Yvonne Gonzalez \nRogers to serve as a U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of \nCalifornia. Her nomination is historic, as she would be the first \nLatina judge to serve on that court.\n  Judge Gonzalez represents an American success story, as her path in \nlife has been extraordinary. Of her parents, her sixteen aunts and \nuncles, and their children, Judge Gonzalez Rogers is one of only three \nfamily members to attend college.\n  She has been able to rise from modest beginnings to graduate from two \nof the best universities in the country.\n  It is my hope that many more young people will follow Judge \nGonzalez's journey. That is why I believe it is in America's best \ninterest to give talented young adults who have good moral character \nand are dedicated to serving the United States the opportunity to \nsucceed. The DREAM Act embodies the values of hard work that make this \ncountry great and I will continue to support this important \nlegislation.\n  I believe it is also important to recognize the 1.1 million Hispanic \nAmericans 18 years or older who are veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces. \nAmericans of Hispanic descent have defended and served our country with \nvalor in every conflict since the Revolutionary War.\n  Forty-one Hispanic Americans have received the Congressional Medal of \nHonor, the highest military award presented by the United States.\n  I commend our Hispanic-American veterans, as well as those on active \nduty, who have risked and given their lives for the safety and well-\nbeing of our Nation.\n  It is my hope that more of today's young people, including those of \nHispanic heritage, will soon have the opportunity to pursue their \ndreams of obtaining a higher education degree or serving in the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  On the larger front, we must continue to strive towards reforming our \nbroken immigration system, which is crucial to the future success of \nthe Nation's economy.\n  This country was built by people who risked everything because they \nbelieved in the promise and opportunities available in America. Part of \nthe American dream is that anyone with a desire and a will to work can \nmake a life for themselves here.\n  As the current generation of Hispanic Americans continues to strive \nto fulfill the American dream, I am pleased to celebrate their past \naccomplishments as well as their future achievements that will continue \nto make this country great.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/26/senate-section/article/S5989-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5989-S5991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO LAWRENCE H. LEE AND GERALD GRINSTEIN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to two men \nwhose influence has greatly benefitted my State.\n  My good friend Lawrence H. Lee was, at one time, the CEO of Western \nAirlines. As you may know, before merging with Delta Air Lines in 1986, \nWestern was one of the largest airlines serving the western U.S.\n  In 1982, as an executive at Western Airlines, Lawrence was \nresponsible for establishing a hub for the airline in Salt Lake City, \nUT. This would prove to be a consequential decision, both for the \nairline and, most especially, for the economic future of the State of \nUtah.\n  In the early 1980s, Western Airlines was on the verge of bankruptcy. \nLawrence was appointed CEO in 1983 and tasked with the job of turning \nthe airline around. Under his leadership, they were able to reduce \ncosts and return Western to profitability. Ultimately, this success led \nto Western's merger with Delta Air Lines.\n  During his tenure as CEO of Western Airlines, Lawrence's right-hand \nman was none other than Gerald Grinstein, Delta's future CEO. An \nexcerpt from Lawrence's journal gives an account of Mr. Grinstein's \nefforts to save Delta Air Lines and preserve its Salt Lake hub.\n  It is important to note that Delta's Salt Lake hub, which exists as a \ndirect result of my friend Lawrence's decision to create a hub there \nfor Western Airlines, is vital to Utah's economy. Salt Lake City is \nsmall relative to other major airline hubs in the U.S. Therefore, the \ncity and its surrounding community receive an almost inordinate \neconomic benefit from the presence of the Delta hub. Delta's Salt Lake \nhub attracts untold amounts of business to Utah. It was cited as a \nreason that Utah was able to secure the Winter Olympics in 2002. All \ntold, Utah receives nearly $18 billion every year from commercial \naviation, most of which is derived from Delta's presence in the market.\n  I thank my good friend Lawrence Lee for his contribution to Utah's \ngrowth and development. In his journal, Lawrence states that Gerald \nGrinstein should be considered a ``Giant of Salt Lake City.'' I \ncertainly agree. But, I believe much the same could be said about \nLawrence Lee.\n  Mr. President, as testimony to the importance of Lawrence Lee and \nGerald Grinstein to Utah's economic growth, I ask unanimous consent \nthat an excerpt from the Personal Journal of Lawrence H. Lee be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\n       Excerpt from the Personal Journal of Lawrence H. Lee--2011\n\n       When an ``unfriendly takeover'' of a public transportation \n     company occurs, one of the most important events to transpire \n     is the testimony of each of the two Chief Executive Officers \n     before the United States Senate Commerce Committee. The \n     answer to each of the Senator's questions, and the way each \n     Senator reacts to that answer, can pretty well predict \n     whether or not they will bless the takeover.\n       This event took place between US Airways and Delta Air \n     Lines. US Air had offered between eight and ten billion \n     dollars to purchase Delta Air Lines while Delta was in \n     bankruptcy. They had the financing arranged to buy Delta and \n     it was apparent the Creditor's Committee was in favor of \n     their purchase arrangement.\n       Had you been given the job to select a candidate who would \n     ultimately become Delta Air Lines' CEO to testify at this \n     hearing, what array of education, talent and experience might \n     be included in your list of credentials? The future of \n     thousands of employees and the financial health of at least \n     one state's economy would most likely hang in the balance of \n     this person's success in giving convincing testimony at this \n     Senate hearing.\n       If I had been given that job, this is what I might have \n     submitted as requirements to assure victory.\n       Graduate from the law school of an acclaimed university.\n       Be the Chief of Staff to an influential United States \n     Senator.\n       Practice law as Chief Counsel to the Commerce Committee of \n     the U.S. Senate.\n       Be Counsel to the Senate Merchant Marine and Transportation \n     Subcommittee. Serve on a major airline's board of directors.\n       Ultimately be appointed Chief Executive Officer of that \n     company.\n       Merge the airline with a partner who would keep the \n     airline's current hub operations in place.\n       Be appointed to the merged airline's board of directors and \n     so impress the others on the board that they would extend the \n     person's tenure beyond the mandatory age for leaving the \n     board.\n       Take over the leadership of that airline when it is \n     financially crippled and then take it through bankruptcy.\n\n\n So begins my account of Gerald Grinstein's rescue of Delta Air Lines \n                     and the Salt Lake Airline Hub\n\n       One must look at Grinstein's post-graduate history in order \n     to understand how decades later he arrived at a point where \n     his actions, while the airline was in bankruptcy, were \n     crucial to the future economy of Utah.\n       Not long after Jerry graduated from Harvard Law School and \n     entered the political arena, he obtained a position in \n     Washington as Chief Counsel to the U.S. Senate Commerce \n     Committee and Counsel to the Merchant Marine & Transportation \n     Subcommittee. This put him in touch with some very important \n     Senators; several who were still serving when he was CEO of \n     Delta Air Lines.\n       Grinstein was introduced to Western Airlines by Neil \n     Stewart, Western's Vice President Governmental Affairs. Neil \n     knew him when he was Administrative Assistant to the Senator \n     from the State of Washington, Warren G. Magnuson.\n       Dominic P. Renda, then CEO of Western, was seeking a \n     replacement for a retiring board member from Seattle. He \n     asked Stewart for a suggestion and Neil recommended Gerald \n     Grinstein who was then elected to the Board of Directors in \n     1977. During a later discussion with an influential member of \n     Western Airline's board of directors, Bishop Victor Brown, I \n     discovered that we both had the feeling that there was \n     something special about Jerry. Although he had never held an \n     executive position in a corporation, we felt he had un-tapped \n     potential.\n       In the 1980's, Salt Lake City seemed ready to do what was \n     necessary to become a greater draw for new industry. To have \n     this happen, the right people were in place; especially the \n     new Mayor, Ted Wilson. He had based his campaign on the \n     expansion of the Salt Lake Airport. When I arrived in \n     February, 1982 with the news that Salt Lake City was to be \n     Western's main hub operation, it was as though Mayor Wilson \n     had been awaiting our arrival. He welcomed us with open arms.\n       With the successful completion of the Salt Lake hub, and \n     subsequent building of the ``D'' concourse, Western Airlines \n     was in the position to meet the new deregulated marketplace; \n     however, our cost structure was still too high to fight off \n     the new low-cost carriers. This led to continued losses.\n       By April 1, 1983 I was asked to take on the chore of \n     turning Western around. I knew I would need someone at my \n     side who was a good communicator with fresh views; someone \n     who was strong and yet sufficiently flexible to step into a \n     new career.\n       Western was on the edge of bankruptcy, so the changes \n     required had to be made quickly. From the moment I was asked \n     to be the CEO I knew Jerry Grinstein was the man that could \n     fill this position. In January, 1984, he accepted the \n     position of President and Chief Operating Officer.\n       We at Western Airlines were successful in lowering costs, \n     showing a record annual profit; and a potential groom, Delta \n     Air Lines, had proposed marriage. In their proposal, Delta \n     offered Western two seats on their board of directors. Jerry, \n     then the CEO, took one of them. Later his experience and \n     performance was deemed so valuable that the Delta board \n     waived the ``age 70 and out'' rule so Jerry could stay on the \n     board.\n       When Leo Mullin, Delta's CEO, resigned, Jerry was asked to \n     be the President and CEO. Delta was in grave financial \n     condition. Grinstein did everything in his power to keep \n     Delta out of bankruptcy, but the pilot's cooperation did not \n     come early enough to keep this from happening. Therefore, on \n     September 14, 2005, Delta and its subsidiaries filed a \n     petition for bankruptcy protection.\n       During this bankruptcy, US Airways, Inc. made an \n     unsolicited eight-billion dollar offer to buy Delta Air \n     Lines. Their plan was filed and was being evaluated by the \n     Creditors Committee. Grinstein had submitted Delta's plan for \n     recovery to this same group and one was being weighed against \n     the other.\n       The Creditors Committee knew that the merging of Delta with \n     US Airways would require government approvals. There was a \n     strong employee program mounted at Delta to fight off this \n     takeover. Nevertheless, in spite of their efforts, rumors \n     persisted that the Creditors Committee felt US Airways offer \n     was best and that they could get the government approval \n     necessary to allow it to go forward; that is, until Jerry \n     Grinstein appeared before the Senate.\n       Jerry, and Doug Parker, CEO of US Airways, were asked to \n     testify before the Senate Transportation Sub-Committee; the \n     same august body to whom Jerry had once served as counsel. \n     Grinstein was in his favorite element. He was calm, collected \n     and totally prepared to defend his plan to exit bankruptcy \n     over Parker's plan to purchase Delta.\n       There was standing room only and the public area was filled \n     with uniformed personnel from Delta Air Lines. Pilots in \n     their full regalia were lining the walls. Those who had \n     initially resisted Grinstein's attempts to cut costs were now \n     on his side and cheering him on.\n       At one critical point of the long examination, Parker made \n     a speech on how he was going to maximize profits from his \n     proposed venture and a Senator asked where he was going to \n     get the aircraft to accomplish this feat. His quick answer \n     was, ``From Delta.'' The pilots along the wall went \n     ballistic. Jerry handled this well and the meeting soon \n     ended.\n       Following this session, it was obvious to the Creditors \n     Committee that approval from the government now looked risky \n     and not long after, Delta's plan was accepted. Grinstein's \n     testimony was the linchpin in blocking US Airways' effort. No \n     one else in the world could come close to accomplishing what \n     Jerry did in that Senate Chamber. Jerry was at the right \n     place at the right time to preserve the transportation \n     service that Western Airlines established in May, 1982; the \n     Salt Lake City Hub.\n       One might wonder why I place so much emphasis on this \n     particular hub. I'll explain this as briefly as I can. It is \n     because, in ratio to population, Delta Air Lines brings to \n     Utah an inordinate amount of employment and revenue, as \n     compared to other major airline hubs in America.\n       In 2006 Campbell Hill was engaged by the Air Transport \n     Association to survey all 50 States in the Union to see what \n     percentage of their economy was derived from commercial \n     aviation. Their study indicates that Utah is receiving close \n     to eighteen-billion dollars a year from commercial aviation. \n     The only States higher than Utah in percentage of employment \n     from commercial aviation are Hawaii and Nevada; no surprise, \n     considering their heavy tourist trade. This is why the Salt \n     Lake City aviation hub is so vital to Utah's financial \n     system.\n       Another point to consider is that many of the companies \n     that have opened businesses in Utah have stated that a major \n     factor in their decision is the superior air transportation \n     service available to them.\n       One other detail, the hub offers an immeasurable prestige \n     to Utah by attracting many events that would otherwise book \n     elsewhere. The greatest example of this is the 2002 Winter \n     Olympics. To quote Kern Gardner, the man credited for \n     recruiting Mitt Romney to organize those Olympics, ``Without \n     the Delta Air Lines hub we would never have been successful \n     in bringing the Winter Olympics to Salt Lake City.'' A point \n     of interest, Kern was Chairman of the Airport Commission when \n     Western decided to bring the hub to Utah. He was a great help \n     to us at that time.\n       To me, the most significant contribution of the airline hub \n     in Salt Lake City is the service it performs for the Church \n     of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who has its headquarters \n     in Salt Lake City. The LDS Church has become a strong-\n     worldwide entity and, with its large missionary program, \n     books more travel than most big corporations. Recently there \n     were non-stop flights added from Salt Lake City to Paris and \n     to Tokyo. When this hub was formed by Western Airlines, we \n     could only dream of such a local achievement. Without the LDS \n     Church Headquarters in SLC it is doubtful one could support \n     this direct-flight convenience.\n       By any measure, Grinstein should be considered ``A Giant of \n     Salt Lake City.'' Through his efforts he helped preserve the \n     ``economic structure'' of which I have spoken. Had US Airways \n     been successful in their attempt to purchase Delta Air Lines, \n     the multi-billion dollar a year contribution to Utah's \n     economy from the Salt Lake City aviation hub could have been \n     severely disrupted.\n       Utah enjoys a finely-tuned transportation service and we \n     owe Gerald Grinstein a debt of gratitude for helping to keep \n     it in place.\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/26/senate-section/article/S5991-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in the aftermath of September 11, \nAmericans found strength in each other and in our common values. At a \ntime when polarization and division seem to characterize the public \ndebate on many of the important issues confronting our Nation, \nincluding terrorism and border security, the 10th anniversary of \nSeptember 11 has been an occasion for us to reflect and refocus on the \ncore values that unite us as Americans, including the belief that each \nperson should be free to live without persecution, regardless of race, \nreligion, or ethnicity.\n  It is in that spirit that I wish today to recognize the work of the \nAnti-Defamation League; which has carried out important work in \nopposition to the anti-Semitic sentiments of those promoting September \n11 conspiracy theories. As we mark the 10th anniversary of September \n11, we must strongly condemn the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories that \nblame Jews or Israel for carrying out the September 11 terrorist \nattacks that continue to this day.\n  The ADL also plays an important role in addressing the consequences \nof hate and fostering a dialog through its recent work with a broad \ncoalition of groups. In its retrospective, ``9/11 Ten Years Later: The \nChanging Face of Hate, Terrorism and Democracy in America,'' the ADL \nassesses the proliferation of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories related \nto the September 11 terrorist attacks, the nature and magnitude of \nhomegrown extremism and terrorism, the growing problem of anti-Muslim \nbigotry, and the recalibration of the balance between security and \nindividual rights. The ADL also has been a leader in promoting police-\ncommunity partnerships and expanding training for law enforcement.\n  We face serious challenges in the fight against terrorism and violent \nextremism. In meeting those challenges, we as lawmakers should be \ninspired by efforts like those of the ADL to transcend division and \ndifferences.\n  On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of September 11, it is an \nhonor for me to recognize the work of the ADL and underscore the \nimportance of their message.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/26/senate-section/article/S5991-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE FREEPORT FLAG LADIES\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to three truly \nremarkable Mainers--Elaine Greene, Carmen Footer and JoAnn Miller, \naffectionately known as, The Freeport Flag Ladies. It has been said \nthat great things come in threes. That adage applies many, many times \nover for my friends and phenomenal Mainers, all retired and residing \ntogether in Elaine's home on School Street in Freeport. I am in awe of \nthem and their story which is one of unabashed patriotism, limitless \ninspiration, and a love of country that makes us all inexpressibly \nproud.\n  Every Tuesday morning from 8 to 9 a.m., regardless of weather and \nirrespective of season, these renowned Flag Ladies have stood not far \nfrom another icon in Maine, L.L. Bean, with the presence and exuberance \nof not one, but three Statues of Liberty having come to life for the \nsingle purpose of paying rightful homage to those who have sacrificed \nfor all of us--our brave service men and women and our first \nresponders.\n  And incredibly, they have never, ever missed a Tuesday--not once. \nThey have given up vacations and used the money they saved for this and \nother endeavors, including sending care packages to those fighting in \nIraq and Afghanistan. They travel to Bangor International Airport two \nto three times a week to join the Maine Troop Greeters, or to Pease \nInternational in New Hampshire, they attend numerous troop send-off or \nwelcome-home ceremonies, and Elaine estimates she has taken 1 million \nphotos of the troops when they greet them at various locations.\n  These women project the inescapable belief that our strength and \nresolve as a State and a nation have always emanated not from Augusta, \nnot from Washington, but from the people themselves--from tireless \npatriots of their own volition performing the most extraordinary of \ndeeds. I well recall when we stood shoulder to shoulder as the steel \nbeams from the Twin Towers--bequeathed by officials at Ground Zero to \nthe town of Freeport--journeyed this past May from their hallowed home \nin New York to be enshrined in a 9/11 Memoria1. Elaine, Carmen, and \nJoAnn's leadership in bringing the steel to Maine was instrumental.\n  How fitting it is that this massive steel beam that once undergirded \nthe World Trade Center now undergird our spirits, our hearts, and our \nmemories in Freeport. After all, there are only a finite number of \nsteel pieces that remain from the Twin Towers, and the requests for \nthem within America and around the world far exceed what is available. \nTo have the proud distinction of displaying this beam--in which so much \nmeaning is infused--defies description. But behind Maine's selection \nwas the knowledge that we would be more than custodians of this \npatriotic emblem--that we would in fact be its steward. What better \nstewards than the Freeport Flag Ladies.\n  The words are difficult to find to adequately convey the height of my \nadmiration, not to mention the sense of privilege I have felt when \njoining them on Main Street to wave American flags. People honk as they \ndrive by, they wave, they stop and thank them--it really is something. \nLet me just say, it was the highest of honors to join Elaine, Carmen, \nand JoAnn on the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks in \nFreeport.\n  Ever since I learned of their exceptional response to the horrific \nevents of 9/11, Tuesdays have never been the same for me, for my staff, \nand for the countless individuals who have encountered them in Freeport \nor heard about them in the news. Indeed, after the heinous acts that \noccurred that Tuesday morning on September 11, 2001, when President \nBush asked us all, as Americans, to walk outside and light a candle in \nremembrance of those individuals taken tragically from us too soon, \nElaine, Carmen, and JoAnn did just that. But they also kindled a deeper \nflame in all of us by bringing American flags with them to wave on Main \nStreet in Freeport. And for that we are so very grateful.\n  It is fitting that these three women with backgrounds in health care \nhave taken it upon themselves--one Tuesday at a time, one greeting at a \ntime, one photo at a time, and one good word at a time--to help heal \nour Nation by harnessing the best of who we are and what we stand for, \nwhether in the best of times or when facing adversity.\n  When considering their stalwart dedication to our country and those \nwho serve her, I cannot help but recall one of Maine's giants and \nAmerica's military heroes, GEN Joshua Chamberlain, who once said, ``I \nlong to be in the field again, doing my part to keep the old flag up, \nwith all its stars.'' The Freeport Flag Ladies, by being civilian \nsentinels of freedom have indeed been doing their part for 10 years. \nThank you Elaine, Carmen, and JoAnn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/26/senate-section/article/S5991-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5991-S5992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. C. PAT TAYLOR\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Dr. C. Pat \nTaylor, who has served as president of Southwest Baptist University in \nBolivar, MO, for the last 15 years, making him the longest serving \npresident in the 133-year history of the school. Dr. Taylor already had \nan impressive record in higher education before coming to SBU in 1996. \nIn the last 15 years he has added to that record of accomplishment and \nearned respect for his leadership and dedication to the students and \ncommunity at Southwest Baptist University.\n  Southwest Baptist University is a very special place to me. I earned \nmy undergraduate degree there and 20 years later served 4 years as its \nPresident. Dr. Taylor is my successor, and I have enjoyed watching the \nuniversity grow and get even better under his leadership.\n  During his remarkable tenure at SBU:\n  Dr. Taylor has presented a record 11,881 degrees since 1996.\n  SBU has Missouri's third largest nursing degree program on its \nSpringfield campus.\n  The number of student missionaries sent out in North American has \ndoubled to more than 400 in the last decade, and Dr. Taylor hopes to \nsee that continue to increase.\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\n  Student enrollment peaked at more than 3700 in the fall of 2009 and \nremains at 3,576 this semester.\n  The Partner in Excellence campaign between 1999 and 2005 raised a \nrecord $62 million to fund 13 major building projects for the arts, \ninstructional technology and extended learning, sports and athletics, \nreligious education, and campus parking.\n  The SBU endowment more than doubled during the last decade to over \n$19 million.\n  The school's first doctoral program was launched, and the number of \nphysical therapy applications has grown each year.\n  ``It's all God's blessing,'' Dr. Taylor has explained. ``We've worked \nhard, but God has blessed it. It's not what we've done, but it's what \nGod has done through us. When I really look at our success, it's \nbecause God has ordained that we will be successful.''\n  I could not agree with Dr. Taylor more. I would add that Dr. Taylor \nis a blessing to Southwest Baptist University and the community. It is \nmy hope that Southwest Baptist University continues to meet its mission \nas a ``Christ-centered, caring academic community preparing students to \nbe servant leaders in a global society.'' It is a bold calling, and I \nam certain SBU has the leadership and dedication in Dr. Taylor to see \nit fulfilled.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/26/senate-section/article/S5992-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GLENN VANSELOW\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I want to recognize and honor \nGlenn Vanselow and wish him well upon his upcoming retirement from his \nposition as executive director of the Pacific Northwest Waterways \nAssociation of Portland, OR.\n  Glenn has served as the executive director of the Pacific Northwest \nWaterways Association since 1989. His 22 years of service to Oregonians \nand all the residents of the Northwest have been invaluable. His \nadvocacy on behalf of infrastructure projects in the region has been \nkey to ensuring that Oregon's ports remain a vital component of our \neconomy and laid a foundation for them to grow and flourish in the \nfuture.\n  He has been critical to helping build and maintain the locks, dams, \nhydropower and irrigation projects on the Columbia/Snake River system \nthat have been so important to commerce in our region. He brought \nexperience, know-how, leadership, and vision to critical navigation \nprojects like the Columbia River Channel Deepening and the lock gate \nreplacements just this past winter. And a few years ago, we were able \nto celebrate the completion of repairs to the Tillamook north jetty \ntogether.\n  Glenn has made many stops along the way in serving the Northwest. He \nis on the board of the Lower Columbia River Estuary Partnership, he \ncochaired the Bi-State Water Quality Study for the Lower Columbia and \nserved as chair of the Lower Columbia River Estuary Program in \ndeveloping a management plan for ecosystem restoration. Past board \nmemberships have included the Oregon Governor's Council of Economic \nAdvisors, Regional Maritime Security Coalition-Columbia River, and \nUniversity of Idaho College of Mines Advisory Board.\n  The legacy of Glenn's time with PNWA will be the permanent and long-\nterm investments in Oregon that he helped move forward, the jobs those \nprojects helped to create, and the families who have benefited from the \ngreat work the PNWA has done during his tenure. I know my home State of \nOregon owes Glenn a great debt.\n  I congratulate Glenn on his significant contributions to the growth \nand development of the economy of the Pacific Northwest, and I wish him \nwell in retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/26/senate-section/article/S5992-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/26/senate-section/article/S5992-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/26/senate-section/article/S5992-4", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on today, September 26, 2011, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Upton) has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 2646.

Madam President, the Senate today is expected to pass the \nKate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act of 2011. I support this \nlegislation and I commend its sponsors, Senator Isakson and Senator \nBoxer, and their counterpart in the House of Representatives, \nCongressman Poe, for the efforts they have made to get it passed.\n  Kate Puzey was a young, vivacious Peace Corps volunteer in Benin when \nshe was murdered. Not only was she the victim of a terrible crime, the \nPeace Corps mishandled her case, in fact it contributed to her death by \nfailing to protect her identity after she sent an email expressing \nconcerns about the actions of a family member of a Peace Corps \nemployee. It was inexcusable, and it tarnished the Peace Corps' \nreputation.\n  This legislation is also a tribute to Kate Puzey's family, who never \nwavered in their determination to honor and remember Kate by doing \neverything possible to protect the safety of other Peace Corps \nvolunteers. And I commend the former volunteers, who were victims of \nsexual assault when they served, who have joined with her family in \nthis effort.\n  I support this bill and have been a strong proponent of reform at the \nPeace Corps to improve training, transparency, accountability, and the \neffective use of resources. In fact, the report accompanying the Senate \nversion of the fiscal year 2012 Department of State and foreign \noperations bill, S. 1601, which was reported by the Appropriations \nCommittee earlier this week, discusses several steps the Peace Corps \nshould take in this regard. But as chairman of the State and Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee that is responsible for the Peace Corps' budget \nat a time when, like other Federal agencies, it is facing cuts, I want \nto take this opportunity to ask my friend from Georgia if he would \nclarify the intent behind a few of the bill's provisions.\n  Am I right in understanding that the Peace Corps has established an \nOffice of Victim Advocacy and that the requirement in section 8A(e)(3) \nof a 24-hour sexual assault hotline can be met by ensuring that all \nvolunteers have contact information for the Office of Victim Advocacy? \nI assume this provision is not intended to impose an onerous or \nimpractical burden on the agency, but rather is intended to ensure that \nvolunteers who are victims of sexual assault have reliable contact \ninformation for a Peace Corps employee who is appropriately trained to \nreceive a report of sexual assault and provide the necessary \ninformation and support to the volunteer.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Yes, that is correct. Peace Corps volunteers need \ncontact information for 24 hour access to the Office of Victim \nAdvocacy, and this is what we intend by a hotline.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is it correct that section 8C(d), ``Transition,'' is \nspecifically intended to ensure that the Office of Victim Advocacy \nassists returned volunteers who are attempting to access services \nthrough the Federal Employees' Compensation Act? While such services \nare not provided through Peace Corps, and the agency's role may be \nlimited, the victim advocate can assist and guide returned volunteers \nthrough the Department of Labor process.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Yes, that is the intent.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is it also correct that section 8E(a), ``Monitoring and \nEvaluation,'' is not intended to impose new requirements on the agency, \nnor to supersede current requirements in law, such as those of the \nGovernment Performance Results Act--Modernization Act, enacted in 2010. \nThe GPRA-MA requires agencies to develop strategic and performance \nplans, among other things. To the extent that the agency already meets \nthe requirements of this subsection to monitor and evaluate country \nprograms and directors, it would not have to expend additional scarce \nresources for these purposes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. With respect to section 8F(a)(3), concerning stalking, the \nmandate that the agency protect the confidentiality of volunteers who \nreport stalking to ``the maximum extent practicable'' would not \npreclude the agency from taking appropriate steps to ensure the safety \nand security of the volunteer, or to take other steps to provide \nservices to him or her. A victim of stalking may be at risk of physical \nattack, and if other appropriate individuals need to be informed of the \nidentity of a volunteer in order to take action to address a potential \nrisk to that volunteer's safety or security, we would\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\nnot want to prevent that. At the same time, the agency must ensure that \nit complies with all legal protections regarding confidentiality, \nincluding the Privacy Act.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Concerning section 8H, ``Removal and Assessment and \nEvaluation,'' we recognize that Peace Corps cannot guarantee or know \nwith absolute certainty that a given site is safe. But we do want the \nagency to take all necessary steps to assess the safety of a \nvolunteer's site if that volunteer expresses a legitimate concern that \nhe or she is at risk of imminent bodily harm.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Yes, that is what we expect.\n  Mr. LEAHY. This bill, once it becomes law, may require the agency to \nhire additional staff, and given the wording of section 10, ``Offset of \nCosts and Personnel,'' that could mean cutting costs or laying off \nother staff. However, I want to be sure that unless the new employee is \nbeing added solely because of this law, and would not have otherwise \nbeen added, and that the new staff's responsibilities relate solely to \nimplementing provisions of the law, the agency would not be required to \neliminate another position. Personnel numbers at any agency fluctuate, \nso it is important to determine whether a particular employee was hired \n``to carry out the provisions of this Act,'' as indicated in subsection \n(2).\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator, and again commend him and the Puzey \nfamily for this very important legislation. We all support the Peace \nCorps' mission and we want to do everything we can to help it succeed, \nand at the same time ensure that volunteers have the training and \nsupport they need. There are inherent risks whenever an American \ntravels, studies, works, or serves overseas, especially in remote areas \nin poor countries where law enforcement and judicial systems are often \ncorrupt or dysfunctional. But what happened to Kate Puzey should never \nhave happened. We need to do everything reasonably possible to protect \nthe safety of Peace Corps volunteers, and this bill represents a major \nstep forward. I am very pleased that it bears Kate's name. I know Peace \nCorps Director Aaron Williams has already taken some significant steps \nin this regard, and that he shares our goal.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the substitute amendment at the \ndesk be agreed to; the committee-reported amendment, as amended, be \nagreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 283\n\n       Whereas the United Nations has designated the year of 2011 \n     as the International Year of Chemistry and is holding a \n     worldwide celebration called ``Chemistry--Our Life, Our \n     Future'', which recognizes the achievements made in the field \n     of chemistry and the contributions of those achievements to \n     the well-being of humankind;\n       Whereas the science of chemistry is vital to the \n     improvement of human life because of its power to transform;\n       Whereas chemistry provides solutions that successfully \n     address global challenges involving safe food and water, \n     alternate sources of energy, improved health, and a healthy \n     and sustainable environment;\n       Whereas the members of chemical enterprise and industry, \n     scientific societies, and academia in the United States, and \n     the Government of the United States, generate important \n     contributions to the economy of the United States, and \n     energize the scientific and technological base with critical \n     innovations;\n       Whereas 2011 represents the 100th anniversary of the award \n     of the Nobel Prize to Marie Curie for the second time, the \n     first time that an individual had received a second Nobel \n     Prize;\n       Whereas Marie Curie has inspired generations of scientists \n     to excel in their fields;\n       Whereas the purpose of the ``Chemistry--Our Life, Our \n     Future'' celebration is to increase public appreciation of \n     chemistry in meeting world needs, to further the development \n     of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics \n     education at all levels, and to encourage interest in \n     chemistry among young people in order to create a future \n     corps of innovators;\n       Whereas exciting new practices of sustainable green \n     chemistry incorporate design processes to maximize the amount \n     of raw material that ends up in the end product, use safe, \n     environmentally benign substances, including solvents, design \n     energy efficient processes, and minimize waste disposal by \n     not creating it in the first place; and\n       Whereas during the year of 2011, countries and \n     organizations will reach out to adults and children through \n     symposia, conferences, demonstrations, workshops, contests, \n     school activities, exhibitions, and other public events to \n     increase awareness of the history and importance of \n     chemistry: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the year of 2011 as the ``International Year \n     of Chemistry'';\n       (2) supports the goals of the International Year of \n     Chemistry;\n       (3) recognizes the necessity of educating the public on the \n     merits of the sciences, including chemistry, and promoting \n     interest in the sciences among the youth of the United \n     States; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States to \n     participate in the International Year of Chemistry through \n     appropriate recognition of programs, activities, and \n     ceremonies that call attention to the importance of chemistry \n     to our well-being in the present and the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/26/senate-section/article/S6008-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6008-S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL FALLS PREVENTION AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 284\n\n       Whereas older adults, 65 years of age and older, are the \n     fastest-growing segment of the population in the United \n     States, and the number of older adults in the United States \n     will increase from 35,000,000 in 2000 to 72,100,000 in 2030;\n       Whereas 1 out of 3 older adults in the United States falls \n     each year;\n       Whereas falls are the leading cause of injury, death, and \n     hospital admissions for traumatic injuries among older \n     adults;\n       Whereas, in 2009, approximately 2,200,000 older adults were \n     treated in hospital emergency departments for fall-related \n     injuries, and more than 582,000 were subsequently \n     hospitalized;\n       Whereas, in 2007, more than 18,400 older adults died from \n     injuries related to unintentional falls;\n       Whereas the total cost of fall-related injuries for older \n     adults is $80,900,000,000, including more than \n     $19,000,000,000 in direct medical costs;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimate that if the rate of increase in falls is not slowed, \n     the annual cost under the Medicare program will reach \n     $32,400,000,000 by 2020; and\n       Whereas evidence-based programs show promise in reducing \n     falls and facilitating cost-effective interventions, such as \n     comprehensive clinical assessments, exercise programs to \n     improve balance and health, management of medications, \n     correction of vision, and reduction of home hazards: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 23, 2011, as ``National Falls \n     Prevention Awareness Day'';\n       (2) commends the Falls Free Coalition and the falls \n     prevention coalitions in 43 States and the District of \n     Columbia for their efforts to work together to increase \n     education and awareness about the prevention of falls among \n     older adults;\n       (3) encourages businesses, individuals, Federal, State, and \n     local governments, the public health community, and health \n     care providers to work together to promote the awareness of \n     falls in an effort to reduce the incidence of falls among \n     older adults in the United States;\n       (4) urges the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to \n     continue developing and evaluating strategies to prevent \n     falls among older adults that will translate into effective \n     fall prevention interventions, including community-based \n     programs;\n       (5) encourages State health departments, which provide \n     significant leadership in reducing injuries and injury-\n     related health care costs by collaborating with colleagues \n     and a variety of organizations and individuals, to reduce \n     falls among older adults; and\n       (6) recognizes proven, cost-effective falls prevention \n     programs and policies and encourages experts in the field to \n     share their best practices so that their success can be \n     replicated by others.\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/26/senate-section/article/S6009-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           ORDER OF PROCEDURE THROUGH MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2011\n\n  Mr. REID.
