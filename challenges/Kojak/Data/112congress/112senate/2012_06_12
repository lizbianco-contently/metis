Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Amending the Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week the President said the \nprivate sector is ``doing fine.'' Well, the fact is the private sector \nisn't doing fine and the President's comments make me wonder what \nprivate sector he may be talking about.\n  Since he took office, we have had 40 straight months of unemployment \nof over 8 percent and more than 23 million Americans are either \nunemployed, underemployed, or have given up looking for a job \naltogether. Last month's job report said the economy added only 69,000 \njobs--far below what forecasters had predicted. That is the Obama \neconomy, and it is not doing fine.\n  With the debt the size of our GDP, the President's recent push for \neven more government spending is equally out of touch. Taking more \nmoney out of the private sector, out of the hands of businesses and job \ncreators or borrowing it to pay for yet another stimulus has \nconsequences. We need to reduce the size and scope of government,\n\n[[Page S3932]]\n\nnot expand it. We need to put in place a progrowth policy to allow the \nprivate sector to flourish.\n  That is why Republicans have been calling for years for comprehensive \ntax reform and for both parties to sit down and begin the process of \nreforming entitlements. That is how we will get our fiscal house in \norder and help the economy grow as well. But without Presidential \nleadership, it simply can't happen.\n\n  Controlling only one Chamber, Republicans in Congress can only do so \nmuch. The Republican-led House has passed budgets while, for 3\\1/2\\ \nyears, the Democratic-led Senate has refused to do so. And they have \npassed 28 job-related bills over in the House that our Democratic \nfriends here in the Senate refuse to take up. For our part, Senate \nRepublicans will continue to pursue a pro-jobs agenda, and I encourage \nour Democratic friends to join us before the administration's spending \nand debt spree forces us into the sort of economic spiral we currently \nsee facing folks over across the Atlantic. They can start by working \nwith Republicans on our commonsense amendments to the farm bill.\n  The President may think the private sector is doing fine or that the \ngovernment isn't big enough, but those in rural America are definitely \nnot doing fine. The biggest threat to farmers in Kentucky and across \nAmerica is this administration's job-killing regulations. That is why \nRepublicans are calling for votes on commonsense amendments that would \neither eliminate or prevent future job-killing regulations from going \ninto effect which would provide the necessary relief for American \nfarmers and give a boost to rural America in these challenging economic \ntimes.\n  Last year, while visiting Atkinson, IL, the President blew off one \nfarmer when he asked about policy regulations. The President said, \n``Don't always believe what you hear.'' Either the President doesn't \nknow what his administration is doing or he doesn't want the American \npeople to know it is his policies that are hurting farmers all across \nthe country. It is either one or the other.\n  Here are a few examples of this administration's policies that are \nsuffocating the American agricultural industry and the Republican \namendments we want the Senate to take up.\n  Last fall, the Department of Labor attempted to regulate the \nrelationship, believe it or not, shared between parents and their kids \non family farms. The proposed rule would have prohibited those under \nage 16 from manual labor such as stall cleaning, using a shovel, and \nusing a battery-operated screwdriver. Many people in my State consider \nthis the type of manual labor that is widely referred to as Saturday \nmorning chores. Senator Thune is offering an amendment that would \nrequire the Department of Labor to consult with Congress before \nimplementing such regulations.\n  The EPA wants to lift the ban that prevents Washington, DC, \nbureaucrats from regulating nonnavigable waters. The expanded Federal \njurisdiction would bring the EPA and their redtape and taxes into the \nbackyards of millions--literally millions--of Americans. The economic \nimpact would be disastrous.\n  Congress passed a navigable ban to protect families, small \nbusinesses, and farmers from Washington bureaucrats trying to seize \ncontrol of their water or their land. The U.S. Supreme Court twice \naffirmed the limits of Federal authority under the Clean Water Act. \nBut, apparently, the EPA believes they are above the other two branches \nof government, and Senators Paul and Barrasso are offering two \namendments that would stop the EPA in its tracks.\n  The EPA is considering a regulation that would require farm and ranch \nfamilies to take as yet undefined measures to lower the amount of dust \nthat occurs naturally--I am not kidding--lower the amount of dust that \noccurs naturally and is transmitted into the air due to agricultural \nproduction activities. It is hard to go through this and maintain one's \ncomposure. These activities include such things as combining, haying, \nmoving cattle, tilling a field, or even driving down a gravel road. \nFailure to do so would result in a substantial fine. Senator Johanns is \noffering an amendment that would prevent the EPA from issuing any new \nrule that regulates agricultural dust. I kid you not, they want to \nregulate agricultural dust.\n  Finally, Senator Crapo and Senator Johanns are offering an amendment \nthat would help farmers across the country continue to manage their \nunique business risks associated with their day-to-day operations. The \namendment would prevent unnecessarily diverting capital away from job \ncreation and investing in their businesses in a way that was never \nintended by the sponsors of the Dodd-Frank Act. Preventing this \nunnecessary burden would promote economic growth, protect farmers and \nbusinesses, and ultimately help save American jobs.\n  In these extremely difficult economic times, rural America is already \nstruggling to get by and it simply can't be bothered by an overreaching \nFederal Government that has literally no idea of the unintended \nconsequences of its policies.\n  These five commonsense Republican amendments I have outlined, along \nwith several others, put an end to numerous job-killing regulations, \nand each of these amendments deserves a vote.\n  I now wish to address another matter.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McConnell and Mr. Reid pertaining to the \nintroduction of S.J. Res. 43 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will take my time now and talk about a \nnumber of things.\n\n\n                              Job Creation\n\n  The first thing I wish to mention is that my friend the Republican \nleader talked about the fact that the President has not done enough to \ncreate jobs.\n  Mr. President, we all have heard that longstanding joke--in fact, it \nwas not a joke. I represented a young man who murdered his parents, and \nthe joke during that period of time was, I guess now your defense is \ngoing to be that he is going to claim he is an orphan. There was \nnothing novel or new or unique in the experience I had representing \nthat young man who had killed his parents, but the Republican leader's \nremarks remind me of that. He is saying that the problem with this \ncountry is President Obama. That is like the fact that someone kills \ntheir parents and then claims they are an orphan.\n  Republicans have blocked bill after bill after bill. These pieces of \nlegislation have been suggested by, introduced by friends of President \nObama. These were all job-creating bills, and simply every one of \nthese, with rare exception, has been stopped on a procedural basis by \nthe Republicans.\n  Then the Republican leader cites nonrelevant Republican amendments \nthey would like to offer on the farm bill as ways to create jobs. But \nit is precisely these nonrelevant, nongermane amendments that keep the \nSenate from doing its work--its job-creating work--like the farm bill. \nThe farm bill involves 16 million people who work doing farm programs. \nWe have not done one in 5 years. The highway bill is something we are \nwaiting for Republicans in the House to move with us on.\n  So I would just simply say that we live in a world that is imperfect. \nWe live in a country that is imperfect. But let's give credit where \ncredit is due. President Obama and this administration found themselves \nin a terribly deep hole when he was elected 3\\1/2\\ years ago. The \nadministration he replaced lost more than 8 million jobs--about 1 \nmillion jobs a year in the prior administration. And President Obama \nhas had 27 straight months of private sector job creation. So I think \nwe deserve and he deserves some credit for the work he has done in that \nregard.\n  So I really strongly object to the Republican leader's remarks. It is \njust simply wrong. And if we had some cooperation from my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, as we say, we would have a lot more jobs \ncreated in this country. But my friend has said that his No. 1 issue is \nto defeat President Obama, and that is what has happened here. We \nsimply have not been able to legislate appropriately because that is \ntheir mantra.\n\n[[Page S3933]]\n\n                             Cybersecurity\n\n  Mr. President, technology has changed our world, and that is an \nunderstatement. It has changed the way we shop, the way we bank, even \nthe way we travel. It changes the way we get information, and that is \nan understatement, and the way we share it, and that is an \nunderstatement.\n  It was about 10 years ago or so that I decided to sell my home here \nin the suburbs, and I was stunned by one of my boys telling me: Hey, \nDad, do you want to find out what other homes have been selling for \naround that area? Give me about a minute. And they pulled up on the \ncomputer every home in that area that had been sold in the last 2 \nyears--when, how much.\n  There was even more detail than that. I was like: How do you do that? \nThat was 10 years ago. That was in the Dark Ages with technology. There \nis so much that can be done now. Somebody can go online, go to Amazon, \nthey can buy virtually anything in the world on that one Web site.\n  I met with someone a couple weeks ago who had gone to work with \nGoogle when they had 15 employees, and he talked to us about the \ntremendous problems they had starting this company. They wanted to give \npeople information. I will not go into all the details, but it was very \ndifficult to come up with the Google that now exists. It was not there \nwhen there were 15 employees.\n  They were working all night long trying to shut down computers and \nkeep others going. So it is amazing what we have on the computer. \nEveryone can do it. Who wrote that song? What is the name of that play? \nWhat is the capital of Uzbekistan? Go to our BlackBerry. Go to whatever \nwe have and get it in a second.\n  So the way we get information, the way we share it, has changed so \ndramatically. It has changed the way our country protects itself. That \nis not something people understand as well as Google and Amazon. But \nthe way we protect our country has changed. It has changed the type of \nattacks we have to guard against.\n  Some of the top national security officials, including GEN Martin \nDempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, GEN David Petraeus, \nfour-star general, now head of the CIA, one of America's great \npatriots, and Leon Panetta, Secretary of Defense, have all said that \nmalicious cyber attacks are the most urgent threat to our country, not \nNorth Korea, not Iran, not Pakistan, not Afghanistan but cyber attacks. \nWe have already seen some of these. They have been kind of quiet to \nsome but not to those in the security field.\n  We have seen cyber attacks on our nuclear infrastructure, our Defense \nDepartment's most advanced weapons, and the stock exchange Nasdaq had \nan attack. Most major corporations have been attacked. They spend huge \namounts of money protecting their products or their operations from not \ncollapsing because of cyber attacks.\n  Cyber attacks do not threaten only our national security, they \nthreaten our economic security. These attacks cost our economy billions \nof dollars every year, millions of dollars every hour, and thousands of \njobs. So we need to act quickly to pass legislation to make our Nation \nsafer and protect American jobs.\n  The Defense Department, Department of Homeland Security, and experts \nfrom across the intelligence community have issued chilling warnings \nabout the seriousness of this threat. I cannot stress enough how \nconcerned people who understand security feel about this. Just a few \ndays ago, Senator McConnell and I received a letter from a remarkable \nbipartisan group of former national security officials, Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  The group includes six former Bush and Obama administration \nofficials: Michael Chertoff, who has been a circuit court judge, \njudicial scholar, became head of the Department of Homeland Security \nduring some very difficult times we had in this country; Paul \nWolfowitz, who has been advising Presidents for decades; ADM Mike \nMcConnell; GEN Michael Hayden; GEN James Cartwright, William Lynn, III. \nThat is who signed the letter, and I could give a short dissertation on \nevery one of these individuals about what they know about the security \nof our country.\n  The letter presented the danger in stark terms, as stark as I could \never imagine. This is a public letter. Listen to what this one \nparagraph says: ``We carry the burden of knowing that 9/11 might have \nbeen averted with intelligence that existed at the time.''\n  Listen to that. They are admitting \n9/11 could have been averted with the tools we had at hand. They go on \nto say:\n\n       We do not want to be in the same position again when \n     ``cyber 9/11'' hits--it is not a question of whether this \n     will happen; it is a question of when.\n\n  This is not me saying this. This is General Hayden, who was the head \nof the CIA, briefing us many times about some of the most sensitive \nmatters going on during the height of the Iraq war, Marine GEN James \nCartwright, Defense Department expert William Lynn, III.\n  This eminent group called the threat of a cyber attack imminent. What \ndoes imminent mean? It means now. They said it ``represents the most \nserious challenge to our national security since the onset of the \nnuclear age sixty years ago.''\n  Let me reread that. They said it ``represents the most serious \nchallenge to our national security since the onset of the nuclear age \nsixty years ago.'' They said it; I did not. The letter noted that the \ntop cybersecurity priority is safeguarding critical infrastructure: \ncomputer networks--we talked about those a little bit already. But \ncomputer networks that control our electrical grid, our water supply, \nour sewers, our nuclear plants, energy pipelines, communication systems \nand financial systems and more.\n  Because of Senator Mikulski--she was the one who said this was \nimportant--we did this. We went down to this classified room. We had a \nbriefing on an example of what would happen to New York City if they \ntook down the computer system to run that State's electricity. It would \nbe disastrous, not only for New York but for our country.\n  These vital networks must be required to meet minimum cybersecurity \nstandards. That is what these prominent Americans believe, and so do I. \nThe letter was clear that securing the infrastructure must be part of \nany cybersecurity legislation this Congress considers. I believe that \nalso.\n  GEN Keith Alexander, Director of the National Security Agency, has \nsaid something very similar. This is what he wrote to Senator McCain \nrecently:\n\n       Critical infrastructure protection needs to be addressed in \n     any cyber security legislation. The risk is simply too great \n     considering the reality of our interconnected and \n     interdependent world.\n\n  General Alexander is one voice among many. President Obama; the \nnonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies Commission \non Cyber Security; the two Chairmen of the 9/11 Commission, Governor \nKean and Congressman Hamilton; the Director of National Intelligence, \nGeneral Clapper; the Director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, have all \nechoed a call to action--not sometime in the distant future but now. \nThey believe the attack is imminent.\n  The attack may not be one that knocks down buildings, starts fires \nthat we saw on 9/11, but it will be a different kind of attack, even \nmore destructive. The entire national security establishment, including \nleading officials of the Bush and Obama administrations, civilian and \nmilitary leaders, Republicans and Democrats, agree on the urgent need \nto protect this vital infrastructure.\n\n  That is only part of it. Yet some key Republicans continue to argue \nthat we should do nothing to secure the critical infrastructure, that \nwe should just focus on the military. When virtually every intelligence \nexpert says we need to secure the systems that make the lights come on, \ninaction is not an option. A coalition of Democrats and Republicans, \nincluding the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator \nLieberman, and the ranking member, Senator Collins; the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, Senator Rockefeller--remember, Senator Rockefeller \nwas for years chairman of the Intelligence Committee and/or the ranking \nmember; Senator Feinstein, now the chair of the Intelligence Committee, \nhave joined together and proposed one approach to address the problem. \nIt is legislation. It is not something that is theoretical. It is not \nan issue paper. It is legislation.\n\n[[Page S3934]]\n\n  Their bill is an excellent piece of legislation. It has been endorsed \nby many members of the national security community. It is a good \napproach, and it would make our Nation safer. But there are other \npossible solutions to this urgent challenge. Unfortunately, the critics \nof the bill have failed to offer any alternatives to secure our \nNation's critical infrastructure.\n  The longer we argue over how to tackle these problems, the longer our \npowerplants, financial system, and water infrastructure go unprotected. \nEveryone knows this Congress cannot pass laws that do not have broad \nbipartisan support. There are 53 of us, 47 of them. So we will need to \nwork together on a bill that addresses the concerns of the lawmakers on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  But for that to happen, more of my Republican colleagues need to \nstart taking this threat seriously. It is time for them to participate \nproductively in the conversation instead of just criticizing the \ncurrent approach. There is room for more good ideas on the table, and I \nwelcome the discussion of any Republican generally interested in being \npart of the solution.\n  The national security experts agree. We cannot afford to waste any \nmore time. The question is not whether to act but how quickly we can \nact. I put everyone on notice. We are going to move to this bill at the \nearliest possible date.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Under the previous order, the following hour will be equally divided \nand controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nmajority controlling the first half and the Republicans controlling the \nfinal half.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, before I talk about the \nproduction tax credit which brought me to the floor, I wish to \nassociate myself with the leader's remarks.\n  I have the great privilege to sit on the Armed Services Committee and \nthe Intelligence Committee. The leader has put his finger on what \nshould be a singular focus on the part of the Senate. We have been \nwarned about the threats in the cyber domain. It is time to act. There \nare plans that are concrete, focused, and have great support. We should \nact as soon as we possibly can. I wish to thank the leader for bringing \nthat to our attention.\n\n\n                          Wind Power's Future\n\n  I rise to talk about a very important issue for the economies of both \nmy State and the entire Nation. That is the future of the wind power \nindustry in the United States and a future that is at risk, I might \nadd, if Congress does not extend the production tax credit for wind. \nSuch inaction jeopardizes U.S. jobs and threatens what is a real bright \nspot for American manufacturing. Such inaction is not acceptable to the \npeople in my home State of Colorado, nor, I believe, to Americans more \nbroadly.\n  Many of us know--I think all my colleagues know--that we have seen \nthe wind industry grow by leaps and bounds over the last few years. \nAccording to the Wind Energy Industry Association, the industry has \nattracted an average of over $15 billion annually from 2001 to 2011 in \nprivate investment in our wind sector in the United States.\n  In 2009, that figure was $20 billion, when 10,000 megawatts, the \nhighest annual total to date of wind, was installed. Seventy-five \nthousand hard-working Americans find good-paying jobs in the wind \nsector. There are 6,000 of those jobs in Colorado. So I am not \nunbiased, but when we look around the country, nobody should be \nunbiased.\n  Those jobs also have a positive ripple effect on all these \ncommunities where they are based. In just over the last 4 years, wind \nrepresented 35 percent of all new power capacity in our country, second \nonly to natural gas. With technology advances, wind turbines are now \ngenerating 30 percent more electricity per turbine, which means they \nare producing more energy while driving down cost.\n  This also means all Americans from the Great Plains to the eastern \nshores have access to more affordable, reliable, and secure clean \nenergy. That is a win-win. It is little wonder our constituents are \ndemanding we extend the wind production tax credit. I wish to say this \nindustry and the good news that is coming out of it could not have come \nat a better time for our manufacturing base, which has seen \nrelentlessly tough times over the last few years.\n  The wind industry is cutting against the grain. It is creating \nmanufacturing jobs at a time when many companies are outsourcing jobs. \nThis chart gives a great picture of what has been happening all over \nthe country. We see every sector of the country where we have wind \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  At the end of last year, the wind industry included almost 500 \nmanufacturing facilities that employ 30,000 people spanning 43 States. \nWe have wind projects in a vast majority of States--38 out of 50. Last \nyear alone over 100 different wind projects were installed--ranging \nfrom a single turbine to over 4,000-megawatt capacity plants.\n  Back in 2005--7 years ago--we had only five wind turbine \nmanufacturers. But with steady and consistent growth and government \npolicy support and certainty, the number of domestic and international \nmanufacturers grew to 23 at the end of 2011. That is a key factor, the \ncertainty that has been provided that will help this industry continue \nto grow jobs.\n  At a time when our economy is still coming back after the 2008 \nrecession, and we are facing stiff competition from other countries, \nthe wind industry is a dynamic example for how we can grow \nmanufacturing jobs and investment in our country. When I started, I \nmentioned the wind production tax credit, the PTC. It has been a key \nfactor in this growth, central to this young industry--and it is still \na very young industry--and its success in America by helping make wind \nenergy more economical, which is still being commercialized.\n  This critical tax credit expires at the end of this year. Unless we \nact now in this Congress to extend the wind production tax credit, we \nrisk losing this industry as well as the jobs, the investment and \nmanufacturing base it creates, to our competitors in China, in Europe, \nand other countries. That is the last result we need in our economy.\n  I have come to the floor to urge the Congress to keep our country an \nopen marketplace for innovative energy industries and for new \ninvestments. The United States is on the cutting edge of renewable \nenergy technologies and on a path to further secure our energy \nindependence. We have to maintain that momentum by passing an extension \nof the wind production tax credit.\n  In fact, it is so important--this extension--that I am planning to \ncome to the Senate floor every morning until we get our act together \nand extend the PTC--not just for Colorado but for every State in our \ncountry. I plan to talk about the importance of wind energy in a \ndifferent State every time I come to the floor. I look forward to \ntalking about the State of the Presiding Officer, the State of \nDelaware.\n  I hear every day from Coloradoans who are incredulous that we have \nnot acted to extend this commonsense tax credit. We need to be reminded \nthat American jobs are at stake if we fail to act.\n  Simply put, if we don't extend the PTC as soon as possible, the wind \nindustry will shrink significantly in 2013. Estimates are that we can \nlose almost half of the wind-supported jobs, down from 78,000 in 2012 \nto 41,000 in 2013.\n  If we fail to extend this tax credit, total wind investment is \nprojected to drop by nearly two-thirds, from $15.6 billion in 2012 to \n$5.5 billion in 2013. That is simply unacceptable. Luckily, I am not \nalone in this effort. There is strong bipartisan support in the Senate \nfor the extension of this tax credit. Yes, this is one of those \noccasions where we are talking about legislation that is supported by \nMembers of both parties.\n  Senator Grassley, a Republican Senator from Iowa--along with myself \nand seven other Democrats and Republicans--introduced a bill earlier \nthis year to extend the tax credit. Senator Jerry Moran, a Republican \nSenator from Kansas, and I led 12 Members from across the country and \nboth sides of the aisle in urging our Senate leadership to work with us \nto extend the PTC as soon as possible.\n  We have not seen that happen yet, Mr. President. Instead of \naddressing this bipartisan proposal which has been\n\n[[Page S3935]]\n\na proven job creator, Congress has been caught up in partisan fights. \nLet's do what Americans are demanding. Let's work together to create \njobs and strengthen our economy, as well as our energy security. Let's \npass the PTC as soon as possible--ASAP.\n  I will be back tomorrow, and I will talk more specifically about the \nimportance of the PTC to my home State of Colorado. We are home to \nthousands of renewable energy jobs, including high-paying manufacturing \nones. But that could change literally overnight if the PTC is not \nextended.\n  For the good of our economy, I ask all of my colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle to work with me. Let's work together to get the PTC \nextended.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                             Cybersecurity\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I rise today to discuss an amendment that I \nam proposing to the 2012 farm bill that we are debating in the Senate. \nBefore I speak to that, I also want to associate myself with the \nleader's comments about the importance of taking care of our cyber \ndefense, putting ourselves in a position to be able to deflect and \ndeter cyber attack from terrorists and otherwise against our industries \nand against our Federal Government.\n  As chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, cyber command is part of our responsibility. The \nleader is exactly on target with his comments about the need to move \nforward to protect our country against future cyber attacks--which we \nencounter daily--recognizing that we perhaps do know what we know, but \nwe are in that unfortunate position of not knowing what we don't know.\n  To modernize and move forward is absolutely essential to maintain our \nvigilance against cyber attacks in the future.\n\n\n                          Direct Farm Payments\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, the amendment I wish to talk \nabout today and propose is about fairness. It is about fairness for \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers and fairness to all taxpayers.\n  First, I note that one of the key elements of the 2012 farm bill that \nwe drafted in the Senate, and is now on the floor, is about reform. In \nparticular the bill reforms a program of Federal subsidies that have \ngone to farmers regardless of whether farm prices were high or low.\n  These subsidies are known as direct farm payments. They were \nestablished by the 1996 farm bill as a way to transition producers away \nfrom a government-controlled system of agriculture to more market-based \nagriculture.\n  These direct farm payments, which are outdated government subsidies, \nwere supposed to be temporary, and the 2012 farm bill takes the \nnecessary step to eliminate them and remove them from the future.\n  When this change is enacted, farmers will not be paid for crops they \nare not growing on land they are not planting. Eliminating these direct \npayments will save $15 billion over 10 years, which will be used for \ndeficit reduction.\n  Producers in my State understand that given our Nation's fiscal \nproblems, we have to have shared sacrifice to get the debt and deficit \nunder control. If we end these outdated subsidies, the farm bill \nestablishes that crop insurance will be the focal point of risk \nmanagement by strengthening crop insurance and expanding access so that \nfarmers are not wiped out by a few days of bad weather or bad prices.\n  Crop insurance is a shared private-public partnership that maintains \nthe safety net we all need to sustain American agriculture. In my \nefforts to identify other areas where shared sacrifice for deficit \nreduction can be pursued, I am proposing an amendment to eliminate \nanother set of government subsidies which are unnecessary and should be \neliminated. These subsidies go to just 2 percent of the Nation's \nlivestock producers. They receive substantial taxpayer-paid subsidies \nfor grazing on public lands.\n  In the interest of fairness to all livestock producers and the \ntaxpayers, we need to reform Federal grazing subsidies. My amendment \nwould require that ranchers pay grazing fees based more closely on the \nmarket value for their region when grazing on public lands. Today, the \n2 percent of livestock producers grazing on public lands pay far below \nmarket value that other market producers are paying.\n  Given our huge Federal debt and deficit, we can no longer afford to \nheavily subsidize an elite group of ranchers to graze their cattle on \npublic lands at the taxpayers' expense. These ranchers receive a \nspecial deal--Federal ``welfare'' so to speak--that they don't need, \nmost ranchers can't get, and taxpayers should not be paying for.\n  It is a matter of fairness to level this playing field, and it will \nhelp balance the budget as well. This 2 percent of the country's \nranchers have grazing rights on public lands that cost the government, \nby lost income, $144 million a year to manage. But the government \ncollects only about $21 million a year in grazing fees from ranchers, \naccording to a 2005 study by the GAO. That leaves a net cost to \ntaxpayers of more than $120 million a year. Losing the $120 million of \ntax money per year isn't fair to taxpayers, nor is it fair to producers \nwho then are required to subsidize their competition.\n  This report also found that the two agencies that manage most of the \nFederal grazing lands--the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. \nForest Service--actually reduced grazing fees during years when grazing \nfees on private lands increased. Get that: The Federal Government \nreduced fees on public lands when fees are being raised on private \nlands.\n  The GAO found that from 1980 to 2004, BLM and Forest Service fees \nfell by 40 percent. At the same time, grazing fees charged by private \nranchers rose by 78 percent. By an actuary's term, that is \ndisintermediation. One is going one direction and the other another \ndirection.\n  Furthermore, GAO found if the goals of the grazing fee were to \nrecover expenditures, BLM and the Forest Service would charge $7.64 and \n$12.26 per ``animal unit month.'' That is much higher--get this--than \nthe current $1.35-per-animal unit ranchers pay to graze on public \nlands. That is not fair.\n  The GAO stated that the formula used to calculate the fee includes \nranchers' ability to pay and is not ``primarily to recover the \nagencies' expenditures or to capture the fair market value of forage.'' \nNo kidding. That is what they said and what they think this program is \nall about.\n  In Nebraska, it costs livestock producers who get this special deal \n$1.35 per cow to graze on public lands. But it costs other producers \nwho don't graze on public land an average of $30 per cow to graze on \nprivate land just in northwest Nebraska. It costs an average of $38 per \ncow on private land just across all of northern Nebraska. That is \naccording to the University of Nebraska's agriculture economics \ndepartment.\n  I note that I am aware others before me have tried to reform Federal \ngrazing fees, and they are saying to me right now: Good luck. Given \ntoday's critical need to get our Nation's fiscal house in order, it is \ntime to bring grazing costs on public lands more in line with what it \ncosts producers to graze on private lands. There is no fairness in this \ndisparity.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in working to improve the 2012 farm \nbill reforms by ending unfair and outdated Federal grazing subsidies. \nDoing so would bring fairness to all livestock producers and have the \nadded benefit of saving taxpayers more than $2 billion over the next \ndecade--savings that could help pay down the national debt and reduce \nour deficit in the meantime.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Agriculture Reform\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, in a short while--I think this \nafternoon--we will officially be back on consideration of what is \ndubbed the farm bill--the Agricultural Reform, Food, and Jobs Act. This \nis something we do every 5 years to secure the safest, most affordable, \nreliable food supply in the world. We are very proud of what our \nfarmers and ranchers do.\n  The largest investment in land and water conservation we make as a \ncountry on working lands is made through the farm bill--protecting our \nGreat Lakes, the Chesapeake Bay, and supporting farmers who have \nenvironmental challenges and managing those on their lands. So these \nare very important investments.\n\n[[Page S3936]]\n\n  We also make important investments in nutrition for families who need \ntemporary help, as many families certainly have during this economic \ndownturn, and many other exciting opportunities that create jobs.\n  The Presiding Officer, I know, cares very deeply about manufacturing, \nas do I. One of the areas in which we are growing the economy is by \nmaking things, growing things, and bringing those together in something \ncalled bio-based manufacturing, which I will be talking more about as \nwe proceed, but the idea is to use agricultural products to offset \nchemicals, to offset oil and plastics. This is an exciting new \nopportunity for us. We expand upon that through opportunities in what \nwe call the farm bill.\n  The bottom line is this is a jobs bill. There are 16 million people \nat work in this country--and there are not too many bills that come to \nthe floor that have the number 16 million--that are in some way related \nto agriculture and food production. It may be processing, it may be \nproduction, it may be in the sales end, but 16 million people work in \nthis country because of agriculture in some way, and so it is important \nwe get this right.\n  We also have a major trade surplus in this country coming from \nagriculture. So we are producing it here and then we are selling it \noverseas. I certainly wish to make sure we are focusing on exporting \nour products, not our jobs. The shining star of that is in agriculture, \nwhere we have seen just in the last few years a 270-percent increase in \nagricultural exports. So this is a big deal for us and it is part of \nwhy this is a jobs bill and very important.\n  We also know we need to reform agricultural production policies. This \nbill is very much about cutting subsidies as well as creating jobs. So \nwhat are we doing? We have taken the view in this farm bill where \nrather than focusing on protecting individual programs that have been \nwith us a long time, we have focused on principles: What is it we need \nto do to have a strong economy, to support our farmers? Whether it is a \nweather disaster, such as we have had in Michigan, or whether it is a \ndisaster in markets and prices, we don't want our farmers losing their \nfarms because of a disaster beyond their control. We all have a stake \nin that. There is nothing more risky, in terms of a business, than \nagriculture, where one is at the whim of the weather and other market \nforces. So we want to make sure we are there.\n  We also know that for too long we have paid government money to folks \nwho didn't need it for crops they didn't grow. We are not going to do \nthat anymore. This is a huge reform in public policy, where we are \nmoving to risk-based management. We are focusing on what we need to do \nto cut the deficit and strengthen and consolidate and save dollars but \nalso provide risk management. In fact, in this bill, we are reducing \nthe deficit by $23 billion.\n  We have not had the opportunity to have in front of us a bill on the \nfloor that cuts the deficit, with strong bipartisan support around \npolicies that make sense and that we agree to. This is an area where we \nhave come forward. In fact, I am very proud of the fact our Agriculture \nCommittees--in the fall, when the deficit reduction effort was going \non--came forward with a House-Senate bipartisan agreement on deficit \nreduction. In fact, if every committee had done that, we would have \ngotten to where we needed to go.\n  I wish to thank my friend and ranking member Senator Roberts for his \nstrong leadership, as well as the chairman and ranking member in the \nHouse for their joint efforts in that way.\n  But when that didn't happen, we decided we would keep our commitment \nto deficit reduction and move forward on policies that would achieve \nthat and we have done that with $23 billion in cuts. We do that by \nrepealing what is called direct payments that go to a farmer regardless \nof what is happening, whether it is good times or bad.\n  In fact, we replace four different farm subsidies with a \nstrengthening of crop insurance and additional risk-management efforts \nwhen there is a loss by the individual farmer, at the county. We focus \non loss. As I indicated, we will support farmers for what they plant.\n  We strengthen payment limits in terms of where we focus precious \ntaxpayer dollars, and we also took a scalpel as we looked at every part \nof the USDA programs. We looked for duplication, what made sense, what \nwas outdated, and we eliminated 100 different programs and \nauthorizations within this farm bill policy. Again, I don't know many \ncommittees that have come forward with that kind of elimination.\n  That doesn't mean we are eliminating the functions, the critical \nareas of supporting farmers and ranchers or conservation or expanding \njobs through renewable energy or our nutrition efforts or so on--farm \ncredit, other beginning farmers, and all the efforts we are involved \nin. We are just doing it in a more streamlined way. We are cutting \npaperwork.\n  In rural development, which affects every single community, every \ntown, every village, every county outside our urban areas, we want to \nmake sure a part-time mayor can actually figure out rural development \nand use the supports that are there to start businesses, to focus on \nwater and sewer infrastructure or roads, that it is actually simple and \navailable and doable from their standpoint. We have spent our time \nworking together to come up with something that makes sense for \ntaxpayers, for consumers of food, for those who care deeply in every \nregion of our country about how we support farmers and ranchers and for \nthose who care very deeply about our land and water and air resources \non working lands and how we can work together to actually do that.\n  We are moving forward now to the next phase on our farm bill \nconsideration. Senator Roberts and I are working closely together to \ntee up some amendments--both Democratic and Republican amendments--so \nwe can begin the process of voting. We know there is a lot of work to \ndo. Colleagues have a lot of ideas. Certainly, some of those ideas I \nwill support, some I will not support, but the process of the Senate is \nto come forward and offer ideas, debate them, and vote.\n\n  So we are working hard, hopefully to tee up some votes this afternoon \nor tomorrow that would give us the opportunity to move forward. We know \nthere is a lot more work to do. We have a lot of ideas that colleagues \nhave, and we will continue to negotiate moving forward on a final set \nof amendments. But we think it is important to get started.\n  I wish to thank all our colleagues who came together on the motion to \nproceed. It was extraordinary. After a strong bipartisan vote in \ncommittee, we are very appreciative of the fact our colleagues are \nwilling to give us the opportunity to get this done with such a strong \nbipartisan vote on the motion to proceed.\n  Also, before relinquishing the floor, I notice my colleague from \nSouth Dakota is here, and I wish to personally thank him for his \nleadership on this bill, with extremely important provisions in the \nbill, both on risk coverage. The proposal to support farmers who have a \nloss came from a very important proposal Senator Thune and Senator \nSherrod Brown put forward, along with other colleagues, which is the \nfoundation of what we are doing to work with crop insurance to support \nfarmers. Also, Senator Thune has been pivotal in a very important part \nof conservation that ties what we call the sodsaver amendment to the \nprotection of prairie sod, prairie land, to crop insurance. If someone \nis breaking up the sod, there would be a penalty on the crop insurance \nside. So it is an important way of bringing together accountability and \ncrop insurance and protecting our native sod. This is something, among \nmany other things, Senator Thune has been involved in and shown real \nleadership.\n  As I said, this has been a strong bipartisan effort. Again, I thank \nmy colleague from Kansas who has been a partner in this effort.\n  I look forward to having the opportunity to bring all our amendments \nto the floor and to give people the opportunity to move forward in good \nfaith. It is going to be critical that we move forward in good faith so \nwe can begin to debate, to vote, and to get this bill done.\n  All the policies we have talked about actually end on September 30 of \nthis year, with very disastrous results for farmers and ranchers if we \ndon't get this done. They need economic certainty. The 16 million who \nwork because of agriculture are counting on us to get this done so they \ncan make their\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\ndecisions on what they are going to plant and how their business is \ngoing to work.\n  I am proud of the effort so far, our coming together and having folks \njoin in this wonderful bipartisan effort to get to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my Republican \ncolleagues, Senators McCain and Ayotte, and myself be permitted to \nenter into a colloquy for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Defense Sequestration\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I come to the floor, along with my \ncolleagues, Senators McCain and Ayotte, to talk about the significant \nuncertainty surrounding sequestration and its threat to our national \nsecurity.\n  The triggered reduction in spending is $1.2 trillion. After \naccounting for 18 percent in debt service savings, the required \nreductions amount to $984 billion to be distributed evenly over a 9-\nyear period or $109.3 billion per year. So what we are talking about is \n$54.7 billion in reductions will be necessary in both the defense and \nnondefense categories, despite the fact--despite the fact--defense \nfunding constitutes just 20 percent of the budget.\n  As my colleagues Senators McCain and Ayotte are well aware, this \nsequester disproportionately impacts defense spending, putting our \nnational security at risk.\n  It has been almost a full year since the Budget Control Act was \npassed, and Congress needs a precise understanding from this \nadministration as to the full effects of sequestration on national \nsecurity funding. Both Senator McCain and I, along with Senators \nSessions, Ayotte, and others, have called on the administration to \ndetail the impact of sequestration on defense accounts.\n  This information is necessary for Congress to address the deep and \nunbalanced defense budget cuts that are expected under sequestration--\nwhich are in addition, I might add, to the $487 billion in reductions \nthat were carried out last August.\n  What little information has been made available from the \nadministration about the planned cuts to defense should give all of us \npause about our Nation's security if sequestration proceeds without any \nmodifications.\n  In a letter to Senators McCain and Graham this past November, \nSecretary Panetta said that over the long term, sequestration means we \nwill have the smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest fleet of \nships since 1915, and the smallest tactical fighter force in the \nhistory of the Air Force.\n  If sequestration were to go into effect, we risk turning back the \nclock on our military strength to where it was during the early 20th \nCentury, before World War II. That clearly cannot be allowed to happen \nif we hope to have a future in which we are secure, prosperous, and at \npeace in the world.\n  I wish to turn now to my colleague Senator McCain, who is the ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee. He has been a leader in calling \nattention to this cloud of sequestration cuts looming over the Defense \nDepartment and its threat to our national security. He is, obviously, \none of the foremost experts in the Senate when it comes to the issue of \nnational security, and someone who has been raising the issue of \nsequestration and its impact to our national security interest for some \ntime.\n  I would ask Senator McCain if he might comment on his observations \nwith regard to this issue and its impact on national security.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague from South Dakota and appreciate \nvery much his leadership on this issue and my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Ayotte, who has done a preliminary study on the \neffect of these sequestrations on our defense industries and jobs and \nemployment in States across America.\n  In fact, she has been asked by the Conference of Mayors to give them \nassessments. One of the problems we have is not only sequestration \nitself, as my colleague from South Dakota mentioned, but the American \npeople don't fully understand the impact--not only from a national \nsecurity standpoint but from an economic standpoint.\n  I appreciate and admire our Secretary of Defense who continues to say \nthat sequestration would be devastating to our national security, the \neffects would be Draconian in nature. He has described it in the most \ngraphic and, I think, accurate terms. But we don't know exactly what \nthose impacts would be and, unfortunately, the Secretary of Defense and \nthe Defense Department have not given us information as to what those \nimpacts would be. The American people need to know and they deserve to \nknow what these impacts would be.\n  That is why we put in the Defense authorization bill a requirement \nthat the Secretary of Defense send to the Congress and the American \npeople the exact effects of this sequestration, which he has refused to \ndo, up until now.\n  Since we have not taken the bill to the floor--and it may not be \nsigned until the end of this year--that is why I have an amendment \npending on the farm bill, to seek that same reporting, because Members \nof Congress, elected representatives, and the American people deserve \nto know the effects of sequestration.\n  One, they need to know from the interest of our national security, \nbut I would argue to my friend they also need to know from the impact \non an already faltering economy. I want to thank the Senator from New \nHampshire, who has done more on this issue. In fact, she has given \nevery member of our conference a rough readout as to exactly what the \nimpact would be in our States. But obviously, the Senator from New \nHampshire and I don't have access to the same database the Secretary of \nDefense has as to these Draconian effects.\n  So in summary, I would say we are facing what is now known as the \nfiscal cliff: the debt limit, which needs to be raised; the \nsequestration issue; the expiration of the Bush tax cuts; and several \nother issues, which we are all going to now address in a lameduck \nsession. That is a Utopian vision for a lameduck session that, frankly, \nis not justified by history.\n  One of the aspects of this sequestration, the reason we need to \naddress it now, is because the Pentagon has to plan. They have to plan \non a certain budget. They can't wait until the end of this year, or \nearly next year when it kicks in, until January 2, I believe it is, of \n2013, in order to adjust to it. So, one, we need the information.\n  And, two, Members of Congress need to know that the sequestration \nissue should be, and must be, addressed. I thank Senator Thune not only \nfor his outstanding work on the farm bill but also for his leadership \non this important issue.\n  I yield to my colleague from New Hampshire, who has done probably a \nmore in-depth study of this issue and its impact on the defense \nindustry in America and jobs and employment than any other Member.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank Senator McCain for his leadership as the ranking \nRepublican on the Armed Services Committee. No one knows these issues \nbetter in the Senate than John McCain. So it is an honor be here with \nhim, and also my colleague Senator Thune, with whom I serve on the \nBudget Committee. Senator Thune has been very concerned about the \nimpacts of sequestration on our national security. I call sequestration \nthe biggest national security threat you have never heard of. The \nAmerican people need to know this threat to their national security, to \nthe protection of our country, which is our fundamental responsibility \nunder the Constitution.\n  I fully support the amendment Senator McCain has brought forward on \nthe farm bill that he championed, along with Senator Levin, on the \nDefense authorization, because we can't afford to keep hiding the \ndetails of what will happen to our Department of Defense and our \nmilitary if sequestration goes forward.\n  To be clear, as Senator Thune has already identified, the Department \nof Defense is taking significant reductions. In the proposed 2013 \nbudget from the President, the Department will take approximately $487 \nbillion in reductions over the next 9 years. That already means a \nreduction of approximately 72,000 of our Army and a reduction of 20,000 \nof our Marine Corps. But what we are here talking about today\n\n[[Page S3938]]\n\nis an additional $500 billion to $600 billion in reductions coming in \nJanuary of 2013 that the American people need to know about, and our \nDepartment of Defense should clearly identify what is going to happen \nwith those reductions.\n  But here is what we do know. As Senator McCain and Senator Thune have \nalready talked about, our Secretary of Defense has warned that these \ncuts will be devastating; that they will be catastrophic; that we will \nbe shooting ourselves in the head if we did this for our national \nsecurity; that we would be undermining our national security for \ngenerations.\n  This is what it means, and what our service chiefs have told us so \nfar about the preliminary assessments of sequestration:\n  For our Army, what they have said is an additional 100,000 reduction \nin our Army, 50 percent coming from the Guard and Reserve, on top of \nthe 72,000 coming in the proposed 2013 budget. That would result in our \nground forces being reduced to the smallest size since before World War \nII.\n  For the Navy, our current fleet is 285 and the Navy has said \npreviously that we need 313 ships. If sequestration goes forward the \nNavy has said that our fleet will have to shrink to between 230 to 235 \nships and submarines. At a time when China is investing more and more \nin their navy, where we have increased our defense focus in our \nnational security strategy on the Asian Pacific region, it would make \nthat increased focus a mockery, truthfully, if we allowed sequestration \nto go forward.\n  We have heard the same from our Marine Corps. What the Marine Corps \nhas said about sequestration every Member of Congress should be \nconcerned about. The Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps has said \nif sequestration goes forward, it is an additional 18,000 reduction in \nour Marine Corps, and that the Marines would be incapable of conducting \na single major contingency operation. Think about it: The Marine Corps \nof the United States of America incapable of responding to a single \nmajor contingency operation. This is at a time when the threats to our \ncountry have not diminished. This is at a time when we still have men \nand women, as we sit here today, who are serving us admirably in \nAfghanistan.\n\n  And, by the way, OMB has already said that the OCO--or war funding--\nwill not be exempt from sequestration.\n  We owe it to our men and women who are in the field right now to make \nsure they have the support they need and deserve from this Congress.\n  When we look at where we are, this is not just about our national \ndefense. But you would think that being about our national defense, our \nforemost responsibility in Congress, would be enough to bring everyone \nto the table right now to resolve this, regardless of whatever your \nparty affiliation is. But this is also an issue about jobs, because the \nestimates are, in terms of the job impact in this country, George Mason \nUniversity estimates that over 1 million jobs will be lost in this \ncountry over 1 year due to sequestration. And that is just looking at \nresearch and development and procurement.\n  Well, let's talk about some of the States that will be impacted, \nbecause every one of my colleagues represents a State in this Chamber \nthat will be impacted by the jobs at issue.\n  We look at where our economy is right now, and yet we continue not to \naddress this fundamental issue of sequestration when 1 million jobs are \nat stake.\n  For Virginia, the estimate is 123,000 jobs; Florida, 39,000 jobs; \nOhio, 18,000 jobs; North Carolina, 11,000 jobs; Connecticut, 34,000 \njobs; Pennsylvania, 36,000 jobs. In my small State of New Hampshire, it \nis projected that we will lose approximately 3,300 jobs.\n  So not only is this a national security issue, but we are also \ntalking about our defense industrial base. And once we lose much of the \ntalent in that industrial base, it doesn't necessarily come back. We \nhave many small employers who can't sustain these cuts, who will go \nbankrupt, and won't be able to come back. And once they are gone, we \nlose their expertise and the U.S. military becomes more reliant on \nforeign suppliers.\n  In fact, the CEO of Lockheed Martin has said recently:\n\n       The very prospect of sequestration is already having a \n     chilling effect on the industry. We're not going to hire. \n     We're not going to make speculative investments. We're not \n     going to invest in incremental training, because the \n     uncertainty associated with 53 billion of reductions in the \n     first fiscal quarter of next year is a huge disruption to our \n     business.\n\n  To my colleagues who think we can kick this can down the road until \nafter the elections, please understand that when it comes to jobs, \nthese defense employers have a responsibility under Federal law, what \nis called the WARN Act, to notify their employees if they are going to \nbe laid off at least 60 days before a layoff will occur.\n  What that means is there could be hundreds of thousands of WARN Act \nnotices going out, likely before the election in November, letting \npeople across this country know that they may lose their job because \nCongress has not come forward and addressed this fundamental issue to \nour national security right now.\n  In conclusion--and I know Senator Thune is supportive of this. I am \nthe cosponsor of a bill along with Senator McCain and others that comes \nup with savings to deal with the first year of sequestration, and I \nwould ask every Member of this Chamber: Let's sit down and resolve \nthis. We do need to cut spending, and we should find these savings. It \nis important to deal with our debt. But let's make sure we find savings \nthat don't devastate our national security or undermine our national \nsecurity for generations or hollow out our force, as our Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff has said about sequestration. I would urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's sit down now and resolve \nthis issue on behalf of our most important responsibility, which is to \nprotect the American people from the threats that still remain around \nthe world and are very real. We have seen it with Iran trying to \nacquire the capability of a nuclear weapon. It still remains a very \nchallenging time, and we need to protect our country from the threats \nwe face.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Thune, and I turn it back to him.\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say to my colleague, the Senator from New \nHampshire--because she mentioned that she and I both serve on the \nBudget Committee--that this perhaps could have been avoided had we \npassed a budget that dealt with title reform.\n  The reason we have these huge cuts, these steep and unbalanced cuts \nto the defense budget, is because we punted on the Budget Control Act \nto the supercommittee, which didn't produce a result, and this \ntriggered these across-the-board reductions in spending--half of which \ncome out of the defense budget, as the Senator mentioned, a defense \nbudget that represents only 20 percent of Federal spending. So \nproportionality here seems to be a real issue. Why would you gut the \npart of a budget from which you get the resources to keep your country \nsafe and secure?\n  Frankly, it comes back--in my view, at least--to the fact that now, \nfor 3 consecutive years, the Budget Committee, on which the Senator and \nI both serve, has failed to produce a budget, spelling out a more \nreasonable and thoughtful plan for how to deal with these challenges as \nopposed to having this budget axe fall in this disproportionate way on \nour national security interests.\n  I am curious as to the Senator's thoughts with regard to the reason \nwhy we are where we are today.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would say to my colleague from South Dakota, you are \nabsolutely right. It is outrageous that it has been over 1,100 days \nthat we have not had a budget in the Senate. In the Budget Committee \nthat we both serve on, the Senator and I are anxious to resolve the big \nfiscal issues facing our country.\n  I agree with the Senator from South Dakota, if we did that function \nof budgeting, we wouldn't be in this position where we have put our \nnational security at risk because we are not taking on the big-picture \nfiscal issue to get our fiscal house in order in Washington and make \nsure we reform mandatory spending so those programs are sustainable and \navailable for future generations. So here we are.\n  Not only do I serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, but I am \nthe wife of a veteran. It is astounding to me that we would put our \nnational security at risk rather than doing our jobs, putting together \na budget that is\n\n[[Page S3939]]\n\nresponsible and proportional. That is one of the underlying reasons why \nwe find ourselves in the position we are right now.\n  I ask my colleague from South Dakota, as Commander in Chief, the \nPresident has a responsibility on this very important issue. It is such \nan important and weighty responsibility as President of the United \nStates to be Commander in Chief. Where is the President on these \nissues?\n  Mr. THUNE. Ironically, the point my colleague from New Hampshire made \nearlier and the statements made by the President's own Defense \nSecretary about what these cuts would mean just speak volumes. It is \nabsolutely stunning when we look at the impact this would have on our \nnational security budget, and, at least to date, the President is not \nweighing in on this argument at all.\n  I think what the Senator from New Hampshire and Senator McCain and I \nare saying is this: Show us your plan.\n  If we are going to do something about this, we need to know how they \nintend to implement this. So the transparency issue is very important. \nAsking them to tell us how they are planning on making these reductions \nseems to be a critically important part of not only informing the \nAmerican public but giving Congress a pathway--if there is one--to \naddress and perhaps redistribute these reductions.\n  When we are talking about a $109 billion reduction that will take \neffect in January of next year--half of which comes out of defense--on \ntop of $\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts to accrue over the next decade that were \napproved as part of the Budget Control Act, that is a huge chunk out of \nour national security budget.\n  I think the Senator from New Hampshire made an excellent point as \nwell about how this obviously impacts national security first and \nforemost. I have always maintained that if we don't get national \nsecurity right to protect and defend the country, then the rest is all \nsecondary.\n  But there is a huge economic impact, as was pointed out not only by \nthe study my colleague from New Hampshire mentioned but also by the \nCongressional Budget Office recently in speaking about the fiscal cliff \nthat hits us in the first part of January next year and could cost us \n1.3 percent in growth, which, according to the President's economic \nadvisers, could be 1.3 million jobs. If the national security issue \ndoes not get your attention, certainly we would think the economy and \njobs issue would. Yet we are hearing silence--crickets coming out of \nthe White House.\n  I would hope he would weigh in on this debate and at least provide us \nwith an idea of how the administration intends to implement this and \nhopefully a plan about how to avert this. As has been emphasized by the \nPresident's Defense Secretary, there would be a catastrophic impact on \nour national security interest.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I ask Senator Thune, is this not so important when we \nthink about the impact on our national security that now we hear from \nthe President that Members on both sides of the aisle should sit down \ninstead of kicking this can beyond the elections?\n  What I have heard from our employers is that they will have to make \ndecisions now that could impact our defense industrial base. We are \ntalking about shipbuilders, we are talking about experts, small \nbusinesses that work in this area. Once those jobs go away in terms of \na small business, such as a sole supplier on one of our major \nprocurement programs, which happens quite often, that expertise goes \naway. We don't immediately pull that back. So we are talking about an \nestimate of 1 million jobs, and the private sector can't wait for us to \nresolve this until after the election. They need us to resolve this \nnow. In my view, our military can't wait until after the election, nor \nshould our military be put in that position. They should know that we \nare going to resolve this because we want to keep faith with them. We \ndo not want to hollow out our force. We do not want to put them at \nrisk. So, on a bipartisan basis, this is a critical issue to resolve \nbefore the election. I wondered what my colleague's view was on that.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, again I appreciate the leadership of the \nSenator from New Hampshire as a member of the Armed Services Committee \non not only this issue of national security but also as a member of the \nBudget Committee, where we serve together. It is critical that we do \nsomething soon, and the reason for that, as the Senator from New \nHampshire mentioned, is that a lameduck session of Congress--is not an \nappropriate time to try to legislate on a major issue such as this, \nparticularly given the fact that there is going to be a pileup of other \nissues. We have tax rate expiration issues to deal with and potentially \nanother debt limit vote coming up.\n  It seems to me that we ought to provide as much certainty as we can \nto our military, to the leaders of our military who have to make these \ndecisions, and to the people who build these weapons systems and \nexperience many of these reductions that will impact jobs.\n  As my colleague mentioned, there is a Warren Act requirement that \nthey notify people if they are going to lay off people. There has to be \na lead time to this, and that is why getting a plan from the \nadministration that lays out in specific and detailed terms exactly \nwhat they intend to do with regard to sequestration is really important \nto this process and as a matter of fundamental transparency for the \nAmerican people and for the Congress.\n  Clearly, there is a need--in my view, at least--for us to deal with \nthis in advance of the election, not waiting, not punting, and not \nkicking the can down the road as is so often done here.\n  I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Arizona, the ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, and my colleague from New \nHampshire in raising and elevating this issue and putting it on the \nradar screen of the Senate in hopes that something might actually \nhappen before the election. But that will require that the President of \nthe United States and his administration get in the game. So far, we \nhaven't heard anything from them with regard to how they would \nimplement sequestration or what suggestions they might have that would \navoid and avert what would be a national security catastrophe if these \nplanned or at least proposed reductions go into effect at the first of \nnext year.\n  I see that the Senator from Arizona, the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee, is back. Does the Senator have any closing comment \nbefore we wrap up this session?\n  Well, let me thank my colleagues in the Senate and particularly the \nSenator from Arizona and the Senator from New Hampshire for what they \nare doing on this issue. I hope that we are successful and that in the \nend we can get some greater transparency from the administration about \nhow they intend to implement these reductions and that we might be able \nto take the steps that are necessary, as was pointed out, on a \nbipartisan basis. This is not an issue that affects one side or the \nother, it is an issue that affects the entire country when we are \ntalking about our national security interests and the great jeopardy \nand risk we put them in if we don't take steps to address this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate in a colloquy with my colleague from South Carolina, Senator \nGraham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           National Security\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senator Graham and I know there are others \nwho would like to come to the floor on the issue of the almost \nunprecedented release of information which directly affects our \nnational security--in fact, the most important programs in which we are \nengaged, including the use of drones and our counterterrorism \nactivities, and, of course, the highly classified cyber attacks that \nhave been made on the Iranians in order to prevent them from achieving \ntheir goal of building nuclear weapons.\n  I can't think of any time that I have seen such breaches of ongoing \nnational security programs as has been the case here. The damage to our \nnational security has been articulated by many both inside and outside \nof the administration, including the most damaging that we have seen. \nOur Director of National Intelligence said that it is the worst he has \nseen in his 30 years of service in the area of intelligence. All of the\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\nranking and chair members of the Intelligence Committee, Armed Services \nCommittee, Foreign Relations Committee, and Homeland Security Committee \nhave described in the strongest terms what damage has been done by \nthese ``leaks.''\n  Among the sources that the authors of these publications list are \n``administration officials'' and ``senior officials''; ``senior aides'' \nto the President; ``members of the President's national security team \nwho were in the [White House Situation Room] during key discussions''; \nan official ``who requested anonymity to speak about what is still a \nclassified program''--I am quoting all of these from the public cases; \n``current . . . American officials . . . [who would not] allow their \nnames to be used because the effort remains highly classified, and \nparts of it continue to this day''; several sources who would be \n``fired'' for what they divulged--presumably because what they divulged \nwas classified or otherwise very sensitive.\n  One author notes:\n\n       [O]ver the course of 2009, more and more people inside the \n     Obama White House were being `read into' a [particular \n     secret, compartmentalized] cyber program [previously known \n     only by an extremely tight group of top intelligence, \n     military and White House officials], even those not directly \n     involved. As the reports from the latest iteration of the bug \n     arrived--\n\n  Talking about the cyber attack on Iran--\n\n     meetings were held to assess what kind of damage had been \n     done, and the room got more and more crowded.\n\n  Some of the sources in these publications specifically refused to be \nidentified because what they were talking about related to classified \nprograms or ongoing programs. One of the authors specifically observed \nthat some of his sources would be horrified if their identities were \nrevealed.\n  As always with this leaking, which goes on in this town, although not \nat the level I have ever seen, I think we need to ask ourselves first \nwho benefits--certainly not our national security or our military \nintelligence professionals or our partners abroad who are more exposed \nas a result of these leaks. I think to answer the question of who \nbenefits, we have to look at the totality of circumstances. In this \ncase, the publications came out closely together in time. They involved \nthe participation, according to those publications, of administration \nofficials. The overall impression left by these publications is very \nfavorable to the President of the United States.\n  So here we are with a very serious breach of national security--and \nin the view of some, the most serious in recent history--and it clearly \ncries out for the appointment of a special counsel.\n  I would remind my colleagues and my friend from South Carolina will \nremind our colleagues that when the Valerie Plame investigation was \ngoing on, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle argued \nstrenuously for the appointment of a special counsel at that time. \nLater on, I will read some of their direct quotes.\n  It is obviously one of the highest breaches of security this country \nhas ever seen because of ongoing operations that are taking place. By \nthe way, our friends and allies, especially the Israelis, who have been \ncompromised on the Stuxnet operation, the virus in the Iranian nuclear \nprogram, of course, feel betrayed.\n  Now, can I finally say that I understand our colleague and \nchairperson of the Intelligence Committee is going to come over to \nobject to our motion for the appointment of a special counsel. It is \nthe same special counsel who was appointed at other times in our \nhistory, and ahead of her appearance after the statements she made \nabout how serious these breaches of intelligence were. It is a bit \npuzzling why she should object to the appointment of a special counsel.\n\n  I ask my colleague from South Carolina--to place two outstanding \nindividuals and prosecutors to investigate still places them under the \nauthority of the Attorney General of the United States. The Attorney \nGeneral of the United States is under severe scrutiny in the House of \nRepresentatives. The Attorney General of the United States may be cited \nfor contempt of Congress over the Fast and Furious gunrunning-to-Mexico \nissue which also resulted, by the way, in the death of a brave young \nBorder Patrolman, Brian Terry, in my own State, who was killed by one \nof these weapons. That is how serious it is.\n  I would think Mr. Holder, for his own benefit, would seek the \nappointment of a special counsel, and I ask that of my friend from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think it not only would serve Mr. Holder well, but \ncertainly the country well.\n  We are setting the precedent that if we do not appoint a special \ncounsel--and I don't know these two U.S. attorneys at all. I am sure \nthey are fine men. But the special counsel provisions that are \navailable to the Attorney General need to be embraced because it \ncreates an impression and, quite frankly, a legal infrastructure to put \nthe special counsel above common politics. The precedent we are about \nto set in the Senate if we vote down this resolution is, in this case, \nwe don't need to assure the public that we don't have to worry, the \nperson involved is not going to be interfered with; that in this case \nwe don't need the special counsel, and there is no need for it.\n  Well, to my colleagues on the other side, how many of them said we \nneeded a special counsel--Peter Fitzgerald--who was not in the \njurisdiction--Illinois wasn't the subject matter of the Valerie Plame \nleaks. It happened in Washington. When Peter Fitzgerald was chosen as a \nspecial counsel, the country said that is a good choice, chosen under \nthe special counsel provisions, which are designed to avoid a conflict \nof interest.\n  What is the problem? For us to say we don't need one here is a \nprecedent that will haunt the country and this body and future White \nHouses in a way that I think is very disturbing, I say to the Senator \nfrom Arizona, because if we needed one for Valerie Plame--allegations \nof outing a CIA agent--and if we needed one for Jack Abramoff, a \nlobbyist who had infiltrated the highest levels of the government, why \nwould we need one here? Is this less serious?\n  The allegations we are talking about are breathtaking. Go read Mr. \nSanger's book as he describes Operation Olympic Games. It reads like a \nnovel about how the administration, trying to avoid an Israeli strike \nagainst the Iranian nuclear program, worked with the Israelis to create \na cyber attack on the Iranian nuclear program, and how successful it \nwas. It literally reads like a novel.\n  What about the situation regarding the Underwear Bomber case, a plot \nthat was thwarted by a double agent. One could read every detail about \nthe plot and how dangerous it was and how successful we were in \nstopping it from coming about. Then, how we got bin Laden and sharing \ninformation with a movie producer, but telling the world about the \nPakistani doctor and how we used him to track down bin Laden.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I add revealing the name of Seal \nTeam 6.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That takes us to the bin Laden information. In the book \nthere is a scenario where the Secretary of Defense went to the National \nSecurity Adviser, Thomas Donilon, and said, ``I have a new \ncommunication strategy for you regarding the bin Laden raid: Shut the F \nup.''\n  But the drone program, a blow-by-blow description of how the \nPresident handpicks who gets killed and who doesn't.\n  This is breathtaking. Certainly, it is on par with Abramoff and \nPlame, I think, the biggest national security compromise in \ngenerations. For our friends on the other side to say we don't need a \nspecial counsel here, but they were the ones arguing for one in the \nother two cases, sets a terrible precedent, and we are not going to let \nthis happen without one heck of a fight.\n  Senator Obama wrote a letter with a large group of colleagues urging \nthe Bush administration to appoint a special counsel and to have an \nindependent congressional investigation on top of that of the Valerie \nPlame CIA leak case. He also joined in a letter with his Democratic \ncolleagues urging the Bush administration to appoint a special counsel \nin the Jack Abramoff case because the allegations were that Mr. \nAbramoff had access to the highest levels of government and that \nextraordinary circumstances existed.\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n\n  What are we talking about here? We are talking about leaks of \nnational security done in a 45-day period that paint this President as \na strong, decisive national security leader. The book questions--not \njust the articles--is there any reason to believe this may go to the \nWhite House? Look what happened with the Scooter Libby prosecution in \nthe Valerie Plame case. The Chief of Staff of the Vice President of the \nUnited States eventually was held accountable for his involvement.\n  Is there any reason to believe that senior White House people may be \ninvolved in these leaks? Just read the articles. But this is a book \nreview by Mr. Thomas Riggs of the book in question by Mr. Sanger. \nThroughout, Mr. Sanger clearly has enjoyed great access to senior White \nHouse officials, most notably to Thomas Donilon, the National Security \nAdviser. Mr. Donilon, in fact, is the hero of the book as well as the \ncommentator of record on events. It goes on and on in talking about how \nthese programs were so successful.\n  Here is the problem. In the House, when a program is not so \nsuccessful, such as Fast and Furious, that is embarrassing to the \nadministration. One can't literally get information with a subpoena. So \nwe have an administration and an Attorney General's Office that is \nabout to be held in contempt by the House for not releasing information \nabout the Fast and Furious Program that was embarrassing. When we have \nprograms that were successful and make the White House look strong and \nthe President look strong, we can read about it in the paper.\n  All we are asking for is what Senator Obama and Senator Biden asked \nfor in previous national security events involving corruption of the \ngovernment: a special counsel to be appointed, with the powers of a \nspecial counsel, somebody we can all buy into. If we set a precedent of \nnot doing it here, I think it will be a huge mistake.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, wouldn't my colleague agree that one of \nthe most revealing aspects of this entire issue from program to program \nthat leads to enormous suspicion would be that probably the most \nrespected Member of the President's Cabinet who stayed over from the \nBush administration, Secretary Gates, was so agitated by the revelation \nof information about the bin Laden raid that he came over to the White \nHouse and said to the President's National Security Adviser that he had \na ``new communication strategy.'' He responded by saying to the \nNational Security Adviser, ``Shut the F up.'' That is a devastating \ncomment and leads one to the suspicion that things were done improperly \nin the revelation of these most important and sensitive programs that \nwere being carried out and are ongoing to this day.\n  So I ask my colleague, what is the difference between the Biden-\nSchumer-Levin-Daschle letter to President Bush in 2003 where they \ncalled for the appointment of a special counsel--Vice President Biden--\nand how the White House should handle Libby? I think they should \nappoint a special prosecutor. In 2003, then-Senator Biden called for a \nspecial counsel with 34 Senators, and then-Senator Obama requested the \nappointment of a special counsel to lead the Abramoff case.\n  I was involved heavily initially with the Abramoff case, and I can \ntell my colleagues even though there was severe corruption, there was \ncertainly nothing as far as a breach of national security is concerned. \nYet they needed a special counsel, according to then-Senator Obama, to \ninvestigate Abramoff but not this serious consequence.\n  So I guess my unanimous consent request for this resolution will be \nobjected to. But the fact is, we need a special counsel because the \nAmerican people need to know. I do not believe anyone who has to report \nto the Attorney General of the United States would be considered as \nobjective.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if I may, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the letters written by Senator Obama and Senator \nBiden asking for a special counsel.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Obama, et al. Letter on Abramoff\n\n                                                 February 2, 2006.\n     Hon. Alberto Gonzales,\n     U.S. Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear General Gonzales: We write to join the request made \n     last week that you appoint a special counsel to continue the \n     investigation and the prosecution of those involved in the \n     corruption scandal surrounding Jack Abramoff's dealings with \n     the federal government. The Department's response to the \n     press regarding that request did not address the fundamental \n     issue of a conflict of interest or the other serious issues \n     raised by the letter.\n       This scandal has shaken the public's confidence in our \n     government and all involved must be pursued vigorously. A \n     special counsel will ensure the public's confidence in the \n     investigation and prosecution and help to restore its faith \n     in our government. FBI officials have said the Abramoff \n     investigation ``involves systemic corruption within the \n     highest levels of government.'' Such an assertion indicates \n     extraordinary circumstances and it is in the public interest \n     that you act under your existing statutory authority to \n     appoint a special counsel.\n       Mr. Abramoff's significant ties to Republican leadership in \n     Congress, and allegations of improper activity involving \n     Administration officials, reaching, possibly, into the White \n     House itself, pose a possible conflict of interest for the \n     Department and thus further warrant the appointment of a \n     special counsel. Recent news reports confirm that Mr. \n     Abramoff met the President on several occasions and during \n     some of those meetings, Mr. Abramoff and his family had their \n     photos taken with the President. Mr. Abramoff also organized \n     at least one and possibly several meetings with White House \n     staff for his clients. These meetings with the President and \n     White House staff occurred while you were serving as White \n     House Counsel. Given the possible ties between Mr. Abramoff \n     and senior government officials, we believe the appointment \n     of a special counsel is not only justified, but necessary.\n       The Public Integrity section of the Department has thus far \n     pursued this case appropriately, and we applaud its pursuit \n     of Mr. Abramoff and his colleagues. As the investigation \n     turns to government officials and their staffs, both in the \n     Executive and Legislative branches, we have no doubt that if \n     the investigation is left to the career prosecutors in that \n     section, the case would reach its appropriate conclusion. \n     Unfortunately, the highly political context of the \n     allegations and charges may lead some to surmise that \n     political influence may compromise the investigation. This \n     concern is heightened by allegations that Frederick Black, \n     the former acting U.S. Attorney for Guam and the Northern \n     Marianas, was replaced, perhaps improperly, as a result of \n     his investigation of Mr. Abramoff.\n       Appointment of a Special Counsel at this point in time is \n     made even more appropriate by the White House's recent \n     nomination of Noel Hillman, the career prosecutor in charge \n     of the case, to a federal judgeship. As a new prosecutor will \n     need to take over the case, we ask you to appoint an outside \n     Special Counsel so the public can be assured no political \n     considerations will be a part of this investigation or the \n     subsequent prosecutions.\n       Because this investigation is vital to restoring the \n     public's faith in its government, any appearance of bias, \n     special favor or political consideration would be a further \n     blow to our democracy. Appointment of a special counsel would \n     ensure that the investigation and prosecution will proceed \n     without fear or favor and provide the public with full \n     confidence that no one in this country is above the law.\n       We know you share our commitment to restoring the public's \n     trust in our government. We hope you will take the only \n     appropriate action here and appoint a special counsel so we \n     can ensure that justice is done while preserving the \n     integrity of the Justice Department.\n       We look forward to hearing from you on this matter soon.\n         Harry Reid; Charles E.

You have \n     personally pledged the White House's full cooperation in this \n     investigation and you have stated\n\n[[Page S3942]]\n\n     your desire to see any culprits identified and prosecuted, \n     but the Administration's actions are inconsistent with your \n     words.\n       Already, just 14 days into this investigation, there have \n     been at least five serious missteps.\n       First, although the Department of Justice commenced its \n     investigation on Friday, September 26, the Justice Department \n     did not ask the White House to order employees to preserve \n     all relevant evidence until Monday, September 29. Every \n     former prosecutor with whom we have spoken has said that the \n     first step in such an investigation would be to ensure all \n     potentially relevant evidence is preserved, yet the Justice \n     Department waited four days before making a formal request \n     for such documents.\n       Second, when the Justice Department finally asked the White \n     House to order employees to preserve documents, White House \n     Counsel Alberto Gonzales asked for permission to delay \n     transmitting the order to preserve evidence until morning. \n     That request for delay was granted. Again, every former \n     prosecutor with whom we have spoken has said that such a \n     delay is a significant departure from standard practice.\n       Third, instead of immediately seeking the preservation of \n     evidence at the two other Executive Branch departments from \n     which the leak might have originated, i.e., State and \n     Defense, such a request was not made until Thursday, October \n     1. Perhaps even more troubling, the request to State and \n     Defense Department employees to preserve evidence was \n     telegraphed in advance not only by the request to White House \n     employees earlier in the week, but also by the October 1st \n     Wall Street Journal report that such a request was \n     ``forthcoming'' from the Justice Department. It is, of \n     course, extremely unusual to tip off potential witnesses in \n     this manner that a preservation request is forthcoming.\n       Fourth, on October 7, White House spokesperson Scott \n     McClellan stated that he had personally determined three \n     White House officials, Karl Rove, Lewis Libby and Elliot \n     Abrams, had not disclosed classified information. According \n     to press reports, Mr. McClellan said, ``I've spoken with each \n     of them individually. They were not involved in leaking \n     classified information, nor did they condone it.'' Clearly, a \n     media spokesperson does not have the legal expertise to be \n     questioning possible suspects or evaluating or reaching \n     conclusions about the legality of their conduct. In addition, \n     by making this statement, the White House has now put the \n     Justice Department in the position of having to determine not \n     only what happened, but also whether to contradict the \n     publicly stated position of the White House.\n       Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, the investigation \n     continues to be directly overseen by Attorney General \n     Ashcroft who has well-documented conflicts of interest in any \n     investigation of the White House. Mr. Ashcroft's personal \n     relationship and political alliance with you, his close \n     professional relationships with Karl Rove and Mr. Gonzales, \n     and his seat on the National Security Council all tie him so \n     tightly to this White House that the results may not be \n     trusted by the American people. Even if the case is being \n     handled in the first instance by professional career \n     prosecutors, the integrity of the inquiry may be called into \n     question if individuals with a vested interest in protecting \n     the White House are still involved in any matter related to \n     the investigation.\n       We are at risk of seeing this investigation so compromised \n     that those responsible for this national security breach will \n     never be identified and prosecuted. Public confidence in the \n     integrity of this investigation would be substantially \n     bolstered by the appointment of a special counsel. The \n     criteria in the Justice Department regulations that created \n     the authority to appoint a Special Counsel have been met in \n     the current case. Namely, there is a criminal investigation \n     that presents a conflict of interest for the Justice \n     Department, and it would be in the public interest to appoint \n     an outside special counsel to assume responsibility for the \n     matter. In the meantime, we urge you to ask Attorney General \n     Ashcroft to recuse himself from this investigation and do \n     everything within your power to ensure the remainder of this \n     investigation is conducted in a way that engenders public \n     confidence.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Daschle.\n     Joseph R. Biden.\n     Carl Levin.\n     Charles E. Schumer.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I guess the difference is we are supposed to trust \nDemocratic administrations, and we can't trust Republican \nadministrations. I guess that is the difference. It is the only \ndifference I can glean here. Certainly, the subject matter in question \nis as equal to or more serious in terms of how it has damaged the \nNation and in terms of the structure of a special counsel. If we \nthought it was necessary to make sure the Abramoff investigation could \nlead to high-level Republicans, which it did, and if we thought the \nValerie Plame case needed a special counsel to go into the White House \nbecause that is where it went, why would we not believe it would help \nthe country as a whole to appoint somebody we can all buy into in this \ncase, give them the powers of a special counsel? That is what was urged \nbefore when the shoe was on the other foot.\n  This is a very big deal. We are talking about serious criminal \nactivity. Apparently, the suspects are at the highest level of \ngovernment, and I believe it was done for political purposes. To not \nappoint a special counsel would set a precedent that I think is \ndamaging for the country and is absolutely unimaginable in terms of how \nsomeone could differentiate this case from the other two we have talked \nabout.\n  To my Democratic colleagues: Don't go down this road. Don't be part \nof setting a precedent of not appointing a special counsel for some of \nthe most serious national security leaks in recent memory--maybe in the \nhistory of the country--while at the same time most of my Democratic \ncolleagues were on the record asking about a special counsel about \neverything and anything that happened in the Bush administration. This \nis not good for the country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of a resolution regarding the recent \nintelligence leaks, which means the appointment of a special counsel, \nwhich is at the desk. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have served on the Intelligence Committee \nfor 11 years now, and I have seen during that time plenty of leaks. I \nhave tried with every bit of my energy to demonstrate how serious an \nissue this leaking matter is. In fact, I teamed up with Senator Bond--\nour colleagues remember Senator Bond, of course--and I sponsored \nlegislation to double--double--the criminal penalty for those who leak, \nfor those who expose covert agents. So I don't take a back seat to \nanybody in terms of recognizing the seriousness of leaks and ensuring \nthat they are dealt with in an extremely prompt and responsive fashion.\n  What is at issue here is whether we are going to give an opportunity \nfor U.S. attorneys--professionals in their fields--to handle this \nparticular inquiry. I see no evidence that the way the U.S. attorneys \nare handling this investigation at this time is not with the highest \nstandards of professionalism.\n  I have disagreed with the Attorney General on plenty of issues. My \ncolleagues know I have been particularly in disagreement with the \nAttorney General on this issue of secret law. I think there are real \nquestions about whether laws that are written in the Congress are \nactually the laws that govern their interpretations. So I have \ndisagreed with the Attorney General on plenty of matters. I think I \nhave demonstrated by writing that law with Senator Bond that I want to \nbe as tough as possible on leakers.\n  But I would now have to object to the request from our colleague from \nArizona simply because I believe it is premature. For that reason, Mr. \nPresident, I object to the request from the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                        President's War On Coal\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think I have time reserved now for up to \n30 minutes. I wish to first of all say that the subject we have been \nlistening to is life threatening. It is critical. That is not why I am \ndown here today because we have something else that is very important.\n  I have come to the floor today with some breaking news. The momentum \nto stop President Obama's war on coal is now so great that some of my \ncolleagues--Senators Alexander and Pryor--are going to introduce a \ncountermeasure to my resolution. My resolution would put a stop to the \nsecond most expensive EPA regulation in history--a rule known as \nUtility MACT, with which the occupier of the chair is very familiar. \nThe countermeasure is a cover bill, pure and simple.\n  While my resolution requires the EPA to go back to the drawing board\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\nto craft a rule in which utilities can actually comply, the measure \nthat Senators Alexander and Pryor are offering would keep Utility MACT \nin place but delay the rule for 6 years. This alternative is a clear \nadmission that the Obama EPA's policy is wrong, but it does not fix the \nproblem. It simply puts off the day of execution for a matter of 6 \nyears.\n  What is really going on here? Since my S.J. Res. 37 is a privileged \nmotion, it must be voted on by Monday, June 18, unless we extend it, \nwhich I would be willing to do, until after the farm bill takes place. \nThat might be a better idea. It requires 50 votes to pass. The \nAlexander-Pryor cover bill will likely be introduced tomorrow. It is a \nbill that will likely never be voted on and would require 60 votes to \npass. Therefore, the Senators who want to kill coal by opposing S.J. \nRes. 37 will put their names on the Alexander-Pryor bill as cosponsors \nto make it look as if they are saving coal, when in reality that bill, \nthe Alexander-Pryor bill, kills coal in 6 years.\n  We have seen this before. I remember when we considered the Upton-\nInhofe Energy Tax Prevention Act when it came to the floor last year. \nIt was a measure that would have prevented the EPA from regulating \ngreenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. I would like to expand on \nthat, but there is not time to do that.\n  My colleagues offered a number of counteramendments so they could \nhave a cover vote. They wanted to appear as if they were reining in the \nout-of-control EPA--and I think everybody knows what is going on right \nnow with all those regulations--for their constituents back home, all \nthe while letting President Obama go through with his job-killing \nregulations. Some chose to vote for the only real solution to the \nproblem--the Energy Tax Prevention Act--and some chose the cover vote. \nBut all in all, 64 Senators went on record that day as wanting to rein \nin the EPA. But some of them did not have the courage to stand by it.\n  Of course, it is highly unlikely the Utility MACT alternative by \nSenators Alexander and Pryor will ever get a vote, but that is not the \npoint. The point is just to have something out there that Senators in a \ntough spot can claim to support.\n  As I have said many times now, the vote on S.J. Res. 37 will be the \none and only opportunity to stop President Obama's war on coal. This is \nthe only vote. There is no other vote out there. If we do not do this, \nand that rule goes through--Utility MACT--coal is dead. This is the \nonly chance we have.\n  Fortunately, we have a thing called the CRA. It is a process whereby \na Senator can introduce a resolution to stop an unelected bureaucrat \nfrom having some kind of an onerous regulation. That is exactly what I \nhave done with this. But this is the only chance for my colleagues to \nshow constituents who they do stand with. Which of my colleagues will \nvote for the only real solution, which is my resolution, and which of \nmy colleagues will vote for a cover vote?\n  What has changed over the past few weeks to the extent of my \ncolleagues suddenly feeling it necessary for a cover vote?\n  A lot has changed because the American people are speaking up, and \nthey are not happy about the Obama EPA. When I go back to Oklahoma, \nthat is all I hear. It does not matter if you are in the ag business, \nif you are in the military business, if you are in the manufacturing \nbusiness, they are all talking about the onerous regulations that are \ntaking place in the EPA. I am pleased to say we have picked up the \nsupport of groups representing business and labor. Even more \nencouraging is a growing number of elected officials are working across \nthe aisle to save coal. The Senate has taken notice, and the first \nSenate Democrats are beginning to come on board.\n  I want to commend Senator Joe Manchin, who happens to be occupying \nthe chair at this time, and Senator Ben Nelson. They were the first two \nSenate Democrats to come out publicly in support of our resolution. I \nmust say, I am very glad to see that they have made the right choice to \nstand with their constituents.\n  Senator Manchin's announcement came just after the Democratic \nGovernor of West Virginia, Governor Tomblin, sent a letter asking him, \nas well as Senator Rockefeller, to vote for my resolution because, he \nsaid, EPA's rules have--and I am quoting now the Democratic Governor of \nWest Virginia; and the occupier of the chair will know this--EPA's \nrules have ``coalesced to create an unprecedented attack on West \nVirginia's coal industry.'' Still quoting, he said: ``This attack will \nhave disastrous consequences on West Virginia's economy, our citizens \nand our way of life,'' and that EPA ``continues on this ill-conceived \npath to end the development of our nation's most reliable cost-\neffective source of energy--coal.''\n  I am very proud of a lot of the officials in West Virginia for what \nthey have come out with. Governor Tomblin is not the only Democrat to \nbe concerned. West Virginia Lieutenant Governor Jeffrey Kessler sent a \nseparate letter to the West Virginia Senators and others asking them to \npass S.J. Res. 37 in order to save what he called West Virginia's \n``most valuable state natural resource and industry.'' He reminded the \nSenators that:\n\n       On May 25, 2012, the State of West Virginia challenged the \n     MATS rule--\n\n  that is the kill coal rule--\n\n     and cited four reasons the defective rule should be rejected.\n\n  That is not all. A group of bipartisan State legislators from West \nVirginia also wrote the Senators and others urging them to support S.J. \nRes. 37 out of concern for the devastating impact on West Virginia. As \nthey wrote:\n\n       Several West Virginia power plants have announced their \n     closure and the loss of employment that comes with it. \n     Additionally, it is projected that with the implementation of \n     this rule, consumer electric rates will skyrocket.\n\n  We all know that is true. Even the President has stated that.\n  I wish to note that we have support from nearly 80 percent of the \nprivate sector--those businesses that President Obama claims are \n``doing just fine.'' Apparently, they do not think they are doing all \nthat fine. American businesses are suffering because of aggressive \noverregulation by the Obama administration.\n  Let me take a minute to read the names of just some of the groups \nthat are supporting our efforts to pass S.J. Res. 37: The National \nFederation of Independent Business, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, the National Association of Manufacturers, the \nIndustrial Energy Consumers of America, the American Chemistry Council, \nthe Association of American Railroads, the American Forest and Paper \nAssociation, the American Iron and Steel Institute, the Fertilizer \nInstitute, the Western Business Roundtable, and the National Rural \nElectric Cooperative Association.\n  That is just part of it.\n  Then the unions. The unions are coming too--I have talked about the \nbusinesses and read all of their groups--they have come to stop the \noverregulation that is killing jobs. Cecil Roberts, I had the occasion \nto meet him once. He is the president of the United Mine Workers, one \nof the largest labor unions in the country. He recently sent a letter \nto several Senators saying the union's support for my resolution is \n``based upon our assessment of the threat that the EPA MATS rule''--\nthat is the coal-killing rule--``poses to United Mine Workers \nAssociation members' jobs, the economies of coal field communities, and \nthe future direction of our national energy policy.''\n  Remember, Cecil Roberts is the one who traveled across the country in \n2008 campaigning for President Obama. But after 4 years of his \nregulatory barrage designed to kill the mining jobs his union is trying \nto protect, Mr. Roberts has said his group may choose not to endorse \nPresident Obama or just sit the election out. As he explained:\n\n       We've been placed in a horrendous position here. How do you \n     take coal miners' money and say let's use it politically to \n     support someone whose EPA has pretty much said, ``You're \n     done''?\n\n  With even Democrats and unions supporting my effort to save millions \nof jobs that depend on coal, EPA has to be feeling the pressure.\n  Gina McCarthy, the Assistant Administrator of EPA's Office for Air \nand Radiation, came out with a statement last week vehemently denying \nthat Utility MACT and EPA's other rules are an effort to end coal. She \nsaid:\n\n\n[[Page S3944]]\n\n\n       This is not a rule that is in any way designed to move coal \n     out of the energy system.\n\n  Everybody knows better than that.\n  EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson echoed this sentiment saying that it \nis simply a coincidence that these rules are coming out at the ``same \ntime'' that natural gas prices are low so utilities are naturally \nmoving toward natural gas. Her message was: Do not blame the EPA.\n  Last week on the Senate floor, I described why their public health \nand natural gas arguments do not hold up, so I will not go into that \ntoday. But what I wish to focus on today is that these claims backing \nup their efforts to kill coal are just a part of the far-left \nenvironmental playbook.\n  There is a pretty big difference between what EPA is saying publicly \nand what they are saying when they talk with their friends, when they \nfeel as though they can let their guard down and admit what is really \ngoing on down at the EPA. That is exactly what happened in a video \nrecently uncovered of Region 6 Administrator Al Armendariz. While \nPresident Obama was posing in front of an oil pipeline in my State of \nOklahoma pretending to support oil and gas, Administrator Armendariz \ntold us the truth, that EPA's ``general philosophy'' is to ``crucify'' \nand make examples of oil and gas companies.\n  You may remember last week when I spoke on the Senate floor, I talked \nabout a newly discovered video of EPA Region 1 Administrator Curt \nSpalding who is caught on tape telling the truth to a group of his \nenvironmental friends at Yale University. At a gathering there, he said \nthat EPA's rules are specifically designed to kill coal and that the \nprocess isn't going to be pretty.\n  He openly admitted:\n\n       If you want to build a coal plant you got a big problem.\n\n  He goes on to say that the decision to kill coal was ``painful every \nstep of the way'' because it will devastate communities in Virginia, \nPennsylvania, and any area that depends on coal for jobs and \nlivelihoods. That is kind of worth repeating. He said it is going to be \npainful. At least he recognized that. And we all know exactly what he \nis talking about.\n  I read his whole quotes on the floor of the Senate. They are a little \ntoo long to read now. But he talks about how painful it is going to be \nfor all these families who are losing their jobs because we are killing \ncoal.\n  I talked a lot about President Obama's war on coal last week, but \nwhat I did not have time to address was the Obama administration's \nallies in this war. It would come as no surprise that Administrator \nSpalding and, indeed, many at EPA are working hand in hand with the \nfar-left environmental groups to move these regulations to kill coal.\n  Last July, Administrator Spalding spoke at a Boston rally for Big \nGreen groups--that is capitalized: ``Big Green''--supporting EPA'S \nUtility MACT rule. That is the rule that would kill coal. In a YouTube \nvideo of this rally, Administrator Spalding gushes over the \nenvironmental community, thanking them profusely for ``weighing in on \nour behalf.'' So here we have EPA admitting that Big Green is working \nfor them.\n  His whole speech was directly out of the environmental playbook. This \nis something that really exists: the environmental playbook. It was all \nabout the so-called health benefits of killing coal. And he said:\n\n       Don't let anybody tell you these rules cost our economy \n     money.\n\n  This is out of their playbook.\n  Administrator Spalding is not alone in his alliance with Big Green. \nAlso appearing with these far-left environmental groups was Region 5 \nAdministrator Susan Hedman. According to Paul Chesser, an associate \nfellow for the National League and Policy Center, Hedman told \nsupporters at the rally:\n\n       We really appreciate your enthusiastic support for this \n     rule. It's quite literally a breath of fresh air compared \n     with what's going on in the nation's capital these days.\n\n  Of course, the former EPA region 6 Administrator Armendariz showed us \nagain last week just how close EPA's relationship is with the far left \ngroups. Armendariz had agreed to testify before Congress. It was \nactually over in the House, but at the last minute he canceled. As it \nturns out, Armendariz was in Washington that day. But while he \napparently could not find time to testify before Congress, he did have \ntime to stop by the Sierra Club for what has been described by the \ngroup as a private meeting. I suspect that Armendariz was there for a \njob interview. His ``crucify them'' resume makes him the perfect \ncandidate.\n  Of course, EPA and their Big Green allies cannot tell the public the \ntruth that they are crucifying oil and gas companies or that their \nefforts to kill coal will be ``painful every step of the way'' so they \nare deceiving the public with talking points from their playbook. When \nI say ``playbook,'' I mean a literal document telling activists exactly \nhow to get the emotional effects they want.\n  We recently got a copy of this, and I have to say its contents are \nquite revealing. It comes from usclimatenetwork.com, a coalition of \nseveral major environmental groups, and it is a guideline for \nenvironmental activists when they attend hearings with the EPA to \nsupport the agency's greenhouse gas regulations.\n  A quick search revealed it was apparently written by a key player in \nthe Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign, which is an aggressive effort \nto shut down all coal plants across America. After offering some tips \non the word limit and how to deliver the message, the document urges \nactivists to make it personal. It asks: Are you an expectant or new \nmother? Grandparent? If so, it suggests you bring your baby to the \nhearing. As it states, some examples of great visuals are ``holding \nyour baby with you at the podium or pushing them in strollers, baby car \nseats,'' and so forth. ``Older children are also welcome.'' It \nencourages the visual aids of ``Asthma inhalers, medicine bottles, \nhealthcare bills'' and all these other things that are good visuals.\n  The American Lung Association certainly took a page of this playbook. \nWe have all seen the commercials of the red buggy in front of the \nCapitol. Of course, the Sierra Club put their principles to practice by \ninundating the American people with images of small children with \ninhalers.\n  The posters for the Beyond Coal campaign also featured abdomens of \npregnant women with an arrow pointing to the unborn baby. The words on \nthe arrow are, ``This little bundle of joy is now a reservoir for \nmercury.'' Another one says, ``She's going to be so full of joy, love, \nsmiles, and mercury.''\n  Of course, the supreme irony is that the campaign that claims to be \nprotecting this unborn child is the same one that is aggressively \nprochoice. It is coming from a movement that believes there are too \nmany people in the world and actively advocates for population control \nand abortion.\n  Just after a hearing in May of this year, the Sierra Club posted \npictures of their efforts. Sure enough, there is one of Mary Anne Hitt, \ndirector of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign, holding her 2-year-\nold daughter Hazel. But for all their efforts, it is clear the campaign \nis about one thing only; that is, killing coal.\n  At a hearing, Mary Anne Hitt with the Sierra Club said, ``We are here \ntoday to thank the Obama administration and to show our ironclad \nsupport for limiting dangerous carbon pollution being dumped into the \nair.'' She apparently sees the Obama administration as the closest ally \nin the Sierra Club's effort, and she has said about the Beyond Coal \ncampaign:\n\n       Coal is a fuel of the past. What we're seeing now is the \n     beginning of a growing trend to leave it there.\n\n  Of course, it is not just coal they want to kill; they want to kill \ncoal, oil, and gas. A lot of people do not realize that. It was not \nlong ago that Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, \nsaid:\n\n       As we push to retire coal plants, we're going to work to \n     make sure we are not simultaneously switching to natural gas \n     infrastructure. And we're going to be preventing new gas \n     plants from being built wherever we can.\n\n  So it is not just coal. It is oil. It is gas. We have to ask the \nquestion--at least I get the question asked when I go back to my State \nof Oklahoma because there are normal people there. They say: If we do \nnot have coal, oil, and gas, how do you run this machine called \nAmerica? The answer is we cannot.\n  As this vote on my Utility MACT resolution approaches, look for many \nof\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\nmy liberal friends to take their arguments directly out of the far left \nenvironmental playbook. Get ready to see lots of pictures of babies and \nchildren using inhalers. But these are the same Members who voted \nagainst my Clear Skies bill, that would have given us a 70-percent \nreduction in real pollutants, I am talking about SOx, NOX, \nand mercury. We had that bill up, and that was one that would have \nactually had that reduction--a greater reduction than any President has \nadvocated. When President Obama spoke--at that time he was in the \nSenate--he said: I voted against the Clear Skies bill. In fact, I was \nthe deciding vote, despite the fact that I am from a coal State and \nhalf my State thought I had thoroughly betrayed them because I thought \nclean air was critical and global warming was critical.\n  At an April 17 hearing this year, Senator Barrasso and Brenda \nArchambo, of the Sturgeon for Tomorrow, who testified before the EPW \nCommittee, ``Would Michigan lakes, sturgeon, sportsmen, families have \nbeen better off had those reductions already gone into effect when they \nhad the opportunity to pass [Clear Skies]?''\n  Her answer was yes. We are talking about, by this time, 6 years from \nnow, we would have been enjoying those reductions. There are crucial \ndifferences between Clear Skies and Utility MACT. Clear Skies would \nhave reduced the emissions without harming jobs and our economy because \nit was based on a commonsense, market-based approach. It was designed \nto retain coal in American electricity generation while reducing \nemissions each year.\n  On the other hand, Utility MACT is specifically designed to kill coal \nas well as all the good-paying jobs that come with it. EPA itself \nadmits the rule will cost $10 billion to implement, but $10 billion \nwill yield $6 million in benefits. Wait a minute. That does not make \nsense. That is a cost-benefit ratio between $10 billion and $6 million \nof 1,600 to 1.\n  If their campaign is so focused on public health, why did Democrats \noppose our commonsense clean air regulations? Very simple. Because we \ndid not include CO2 regulation in the Clear Skies \nlegislation. President Obama's quote only verifies that. He is on \nrecord admitting he voted against these health benefits because \nregulating greenhouse gases, which have no effect whatsoever on public \nhealth, was more important. In other words, the real agenda is to kill \ncoal.\n\n  Just before President Obama made the decision to halt the EPA's plan \nto tighten ozone regulations, the White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley \nasked: ``What are the health impacts of unemployment?'' That is one of \nthe most important questions before this Senate in preparation for the \nvote on my resolution to stop Utility MACT. What are the health impacts \non the children whose parents will lose their jobs due to President \nObama's war on coal? What are the health impacts on children and low-\nincome families whose parents will have less money to spend on their \nwell-being when they have to put more and more of their paychecks into \nthe skyrocketing electricity costs?\n  EPA Administrator Spalding gave us a clue about the impacts of \nunemployment. It would be, as he said, ``Painful. Painful every step of \nthe way.'' Do my colleagues in the Senate truly want that? I deeply \nregret that I have to be critical of two of my best friends in the \nSenate, Senators Alexander and Pryor, particularly Senator Pryor. Three \nof my kids went to school with him at the University of Arkansas. He is \nconsidered part of our family. He is my brother. But if someone has \nbeen to West Virginia and to Ohio and to Illinois, to Michigan, to \nMissouri, and the rest of the coal States, as I have, and personally \nvisited with the proud fourth- and fifth-generation coal families, as I \nhave and certainly the occupier of the chair has, they know they will \nlose their livelihood if Alexander-Pryor saves the EPA's effort to kill \ncoal. I cannot stand by and idly allow that to happen.\n  Let me conclude by speaking to my friends in this body who have yet \nto make up their minds as to whether they will support my resolution. I \nknow everyone in the Senate wants to ensure we continue to make the \ntremendous environmental progress we have made over the past few years. \nWe truly have.\n  The Clean Air Act many years ago cleaned up the air. We have had \nsuccesses. Unfortunately, this administration's regulations are failing \nto strike that balance between growing our economy and improving our \nenvironment. Rather, this agenda is about killing our ability to run \nthis machine called America.\n  Again, I wish to welcome the support of Senators Manchin and Ben \nNelson, who listened to their constituents. It is the rest of the \nSenators from the coal States that I am concerned about. What about \nSenators Levin and Stabenow, who come from a State that uses coal for \n60 percent of its electricity?\n  What about Senator Conrad from a State with 85 percent of the \nelectricity coming from coal? In Ohio, where Senator Brown is from, \n19,000 jobs depend on coal. Then there is Virginia, home of Senators \nWarner and Webb, which has 31,660 jobs, a 16 to 19 percent increase in \nthe electric rates.\n  Arkansas, the war on coal there, that is 44.9 percent of electricity \ngeneration in the State of Arkansas; Tennessee, 52 percent of \nelectricity generation, 6,000 jobs; Missouri, 81 percent of electricity \ngeneration--81 percent in the State of Missouri. That is 4,600 jobs at \nstake; Montana, 58 percent; Louisiana, that is 35 percent of \nelectricity generation. These are all States that depend on coal for \ntheir electricity generation; lastly, Pennsylvania, 48.2 percent of \nelectricity generation, 49,000 jobs would be lost in Pennsylvania if \nutility MACT is passed. That is significant. I would not be surprised \nif all these Senators from coal States that I just mentioned will vote \nfor the bill of Senators Alexander and Pryor that says: Let's kill \ncoal, but let's put it off for 6 years.\n  I repeat. It does not do any good to delay the death sentence on coal \n6 years. Contracts will already be violated and the mines will be \nclosed. So I say to my colleagues that their constituents will see \nright though those of who choose a cover vote. The American people are \npretty smart. They know there is only one real solution to stop, not \njust delay, EPA's war on coal.\n  I hope they will join Senators Manchin and Nelson and me and several \nothers and stand with the constituents, instead of President Obama and \nhis EPA, which will make it painful every step of the way for them all. \nWe need to pass S.J. Res. 37 and put an end to President Obama's war on \ncoal. This is the last chance we have to do this. There is no other \nvote coming along.\n  If a Senator does not want to kill coal, they have to support S.J. \nRes. 37. It is our last chance to do it. Again, we do not know when \nthis is going to come up. It is locked in a time limit, unless we, by \nunanimous consent, increase that time. I have no objection to putting \nit off until after the farm bill because that is a very important piece \nof legislation. So we will wait and see what takes place.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/12/senate-section/article/S3945-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                                spending\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I will speak for a few minutes on the farm \nbill, which we are debating this week.\n  Four years ago, President Obama was elected on the promise of change, \nthe promise to cut the deficit in half in the first term, and to get \nunemployment, before the end of his first term, to a low of 6 percent. \nWe all know what happened to those promises.\n  Two years ago, a wave of Republicans were elected with the promise of \ncutting spending, borrowing, and debt. Yet debt has continued to \nexplode, as has spending. We were promised change,\n\n[[Page S3946]]\n\nbut we got more of the status quo--a lot more of it. We got a lot more \nspending, borrowing, and debt--to the point where most Americans, at \nthis point, are deeply concerned about the future of their country.\n  Americans are still demanding change, and for good reason. We must \nchange the way business in Washington is done because we are nearly $16 \ntrillion in debt. We talk about the debt all the time, and these \nnumbers are facts. We are poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on a \nmassive farm bill that some people in Washington have the nerve to tell \nthe American people saves money.\n  I want to talk a little bit about that because we obviously need to \nsave money. But despite all the fuss about the need to cut spending, \nthe debt ceiling debate, and the fact that we are actually cutting our \nmilitary defenses to the bone because of our overspending in other \nareas, let's look at what we have done this year as a Senate. We passed \na highway bill that spent $13 billion bailing out a highway trust fund \nbecause we spent too much there. We have spent another $140 billion in \ncorporate welfare reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. We passed an \n$11 billion Postal Service bailout. Now we are working on a $1 trillion \nfarm bill.\n  No one here can bring up one bill where we have actually cut \nspending. Yet we know our country is going off a fiscal cliff. The farm \nbill supporters are telling us this bill saves money. Unfortunately, we \nare using the same smoke-and-mirror accounting that is often used in \nWashington--a lot of gimmicks that make it appear less expensive--and \nit is an affront to the American people who are demanding less spending \nand debt.\n  There is absolutely no connection between what some of my colleagues \nare telling their constituents back home and what they are doing in \nWashington as far as cutting spending. They talk about cutting \nspending, but now they want to pass this farm bill.\n  The farm bill we are debating today is projected by the CBO to cost \nabout $1 trillion over the next 10 years. The last farm bill cost $600 \nbillion. This is a 60-percent increase.\n  If we look at these numbers on the chart, you can understand the rest \nof the debate. The Congressional Research Service has confirmed these \nnumbers. In 2008 we passed a farm bill that was projected to spend $604 \nbillion over 10 years. The bill we are considering today is projected \nto spend nearly $1 trillion--$969 billion. Yet the folks who are \nspeaking about the farm bill here are telling us this saves some $20 \nbillion. Only in Washington could they look at you with a straight face \nand say this saves money.\n  Let's talk about how they actually get that figure.\n  In 2008 it was about $600 billion. This farm bill is about $1 \ntrillion. What happened in the meantime was mostly the President's \nstimulus package, which spent about $1 trillion. It had a lot of money \nin it for food stamps. It was a short-term, temporary stimulus, \nsupposedly with a lot of new money for food stamps.\n  Between 2008 and now, we have increased food stamp spending about 400 \npercent--400 percent. I think that number actually goes back to 2000. \nDuring periods of good economy and low unemployment, we increased food \nstamps, and we have continued to increase that dramatically over the \nlast few years. There was supposed to have been a temporary increase in \nfood stamps. We are actually locking in that spending permanently with \nthis new farm bill. But since it is slightly lower than this temporary \nincrease, the folks speaking to us today are saying: This is big \nsavings, America. We are saving money on the farm bill. It is actually \na 60-percent increase in the last farm bill.\n  There is only one question: Does this bill really save money? The \nanswer is absolutely not. Instead of doing the reforms we need in the \nFood Stamp Program, which, frankly, is about 75 percent or more of this \nbill, we are passing a farm bill that locks in what is supposed to be a \ntemporary spending level for food stamps over the next 5 years.\n  What is really in this farm bill? A lot of it is food stamps. There \nis some foreign aid. There are some things for climate change. There is \nhousing and foreclosure. And there is broadband Internet. It is a \ncatch-all for a lot of things. But in order for us to get what we need \nfor the pharmaceutical industry in America, we have to agree to this \nhuge additional increase in these other programs.\n  The stunning expansion in the Food Stamp Program is particularly \nconcerning because more than one in seven Americans is now on the Food \nStamp Program. The number of people on the program has increased by 70 \npercent since 2007 and 400 percent since 2000. This, again, was when \nour economy was good and unemployment was low. We were still \nincreasing.\n  Unfortunately, many politicians are using the food stamps to buy \nvotes. The small part of the bill that actually deals with farming \nreplaces one form of corporate welfare for another. The bill eliminates \nthe controversial direct payment system but replaces it with something \nthat many consider far worse--a new program in this bill that is called \nagricultural risk coverage that promises farmers the government will \npay for 90 percent of their expected profits if the market prices \ndecline. Under this scheme, farmers will pay no attention to the laws \nof supply and demand because the government will guarantee their \nprofits.\n  Americans want less spending and less debt. All the polls we have \nlooked at--the National Journal poll that came out--said 74 percent of \nAmericans believe the spending on food stamps should stay the same or \ndecrease, and the spending on the farm bill, 56 percent say, should \nstay the same or decrease. Yet we are increasing it 60 percent.\n  It is hard to answer the question of why we continue to do this--\ncontinue to spend money, borrow money, and talk about the need to cut. \nYet for one program after another we increase spending.\n\n  I oppose this bill for the reasons I have talked about. It spends $1 \ntrillion. We need an open debate, which we are being told we are not \ngoing to have. We are not going to have all the amendments we are \ntalking about, which we need to fix this program. So if the leader \ndecides to limit the debate and limit the amendments, I will absolutely \noppose this bill and do everything I can to stop it.\n  I plead with my colleagues to start telling Americans the truth. This \nfarm bill increases spending. It doesn't save money. It adds to our \ndebt. It locks in spending on a program we need to change, particularly \nfor the beneficiaries of the Food Stamp Program who are not being \nhelped. They are being trapped in a dependent relationship with \ngovernment indefinitely instead of us doing what will actually help \nthem get a job and improve their status in life.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                        National Security Leaks\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the issue of \nnational security leaks.\n  A few weeks ago, the world learned that U.S. intelligence agencies \nand partners disrupted an al-Qaida plot to blow up a civilian aircraft. \nWe are all very familiar with the success of this effort, and we \napplaud those involved in preventing a truly horrific terrorist attack.\n  However, my concern today, and has been since that time, is that the \npublic has become too familiar with this successful operation. \nSpecifically, due to an intelligence leak, the world learned of highly \nsensitive information, sources, and methods that enabled the United \nStates and its allies to prevent al-Qaida from striking again.\n  This irresponsible leak jeopardizes future operations and future \ncooperation with valuable sources and intelligence partners overseas. \nThe release of this information--intentional or not--puts American \nlives at risk as well as the lives of those who helped us in this \noperation.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the only recent leak to occur. As a member \nof the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I am deeply concerned \nabout a troubling rash of leaks exposing classified intelligence \ninformation that has come out in the last several weeks. This paints a \ndisturbing picture of this administration's judgment when it comes to \nnational security.\n  There is a questionable collaboration with Hollywood, whereby the \nObama\n\n[[Page S3947]]\n\nadministration decided to give unprecedented access to filmmakers \nproducing a movie on the bin Laden raid--including the confidential \nidentity of one of our Nation's most elite warriors. Discussions with \nreporters in the aftermath of the raid also may have revealed the \ninvolvement of a Pakistani doctor, who was sentenced to 33 years in \nprison for treason after playing a critical role in the hunt for bin \nLaden.\n  The pages of our newspapers have highly classified information \npublicized pertaining to intelligence operations in Yemen and Iran--\ncurrently, the two most concerning foreign policy challenges this \nNation faces. This is in addition to the frequency with which top \nadministration officials now openly discuss the once highly classified \nexecution of drone strikes. All too frequently we read in these \npublications that ``highly placed administration officials'' are the \nsource of confirmation of previously classified information.\n  Sadly, these incidents are not the first time this Nation's secrets \nhave spilled onto the streets or in the book stores. The problem stems \nin part from the media's insatiable desire for information that makes \nintelligence operations look a lot like something out of a Hollywood \nscript. This media hunger is fed by inexcusable contributions from \ncurrent and former government officials.\n  Mr. President, I want to repeat that last statement. This media \nhunger to publish classified information comes from the inexcusable \ncontributions of current and former government officials. We now know \nthat investigations by the FBI, CIA, and now two prosecutors are \nunderway, but more must be done to prevent intelligence disclosures \nfrom occurring in the first place.\n  The question of whether the White House purposely leaked classified \ninformation, as the President refutes, is not my main point. Whether it \nwas intentional has little bearing on the results. Highly classified \ninformation still got out, and it appears to have been enabled by \ninterviews with senior administration officials.\n  At this time, I take the President at his word that the White House \ndid not purposely leak classified information. But what about his \nadministration leaking it accidentally or what about mistakenly or--and \nthis is perhaps the best adjective that might apply--what about \nstupidly? There remain a lot of unanswered questions about the White \nHouse's judgment and whether the actions by this administration, \nintentional or not, enabled highly sensitive information to become \npublic.\n  The House and Senate Intelligence Committees are working together in \na nonpartisan fashion--let me emphasize that we are working together in \na nonpartisan fashion--to address this issue. As a member of the \ncommittee, I am working with my colleagues to evaluate a range of \nreforms to reduce or hopefully eliminate the opportunity for future \nleaks. I wish to commend Chairman Feinstein and Vice Chairman Chambliss \nfor their efforts and genuine interest in moving forward with this, and \nI thank them for their leadership on this matter. Our committee, \nworking across the Capitol with the House Intelligence Committee, will \nbring forward recommendations, including legislation, to address this \ngrowing problem.\n  As the Department of Justice conducts its investigations, we cannot \nlose sight of important questions that must be answered, such as but \nnot limited to the following:\n  Question No. 1: Why did the White House hold a conference call on May \n7 with a collection of former national security officials, some of whom \nare talking heads on network television, to discuss the confidential \noperation to disrupt the al-Qaida bomb plot?\n  Question No. 2: Why is the White House cooperating so candidly with \nHollywood filmmakers on a movie about the Osama bin Laden raid, one of \nthe most highly secretive operations in the history of this country? \nWhile we don't know the date of the public release of this Hollywood \nproduction, we can be sure that any release prior to the November \nPresidential election will fuel a firestorm of accusations of political \nmotives.\n  Question No. 3: Why would the confidential identity of elite U.S. \nmilitary personnel be released to Hollywood filmmakers?\n  Question No. 4: Why would administration officials even talk to \nreporters or authors writing books or articles about incredibly \nsensitive operations?\n  Question No. 5: Did any administration officials--in the White House \nor not--authorize the disclosure of classified information?\n  These are just some of the key questions that must be asked in this \ninvestigation. There also remain several questions surrounding the \ncurrent investigations. The appointment of two prosecutors to lead \ncriminal investigations into the recent leaks is a step forward, but \nthe scope remains unclear, as well as the question of whether we should \ninsist on a special counsel given the current concerns about the \ncredibility of the Justice Department.\n  Will these investigations focus just on the Yemen and Iran issue or \nwill the leaks involving drone strikes and other leaks that have \noccurred in the past months also be a target of the investigation?\n  Will White House officials be interviewed as part of this \ninvestigation? Which officials will or will not be available to take \npart in the investigation? Will those who are former or no longer a \npart of the administration or the Federal Government or those outside \nit, including those reporters in question, be a part of this \ninvestigation?\n  Will e-mails or phone calls of administration officials be analyzed \nto identify who spoke with the reporters and authors in question and \nwhen?\n  Again, whether these officials are intentionally leaking classified \ninformation is not the main point. If they put themselves in situations \nwhere they are discussing or confirming classified information, they \nmust also be held accountable. Public pressure is required to shape \nthese investigations and to ensure all our questions about these events \nare answered, which is why I am speaking here today.\n  Every day, we have men and women in uniform serving around the globe \nto protect and defend this great country, and every day we have \nintelligence professionals and national security officers working \nbehind the scenes with allies and potential informants to prevent \nattacks on our country. These leaks undermine all that hard work and \nall those countless sacrifices. Additionally, it risks lives and the \nsuccess of future operations. Not only must we plug these damaging and \nirresponsible leaks, we also must work to do all we can to eliminate or \ngreatly reduce the opportunity for them to occur in the future.\n  Criminal prosecution and congressional action is not the only \nsolution. We also need public accountability. Administration officials \ncontinue to speak off the record with reporters and authors about \nclassified information even after these recent disclosures. It is a \npractice that contributes to unwise and harmful consequences.\n  Purposely or accidentally, loose lips can bring about disastrous \nresults. Perhaps the best advice is the saying: ``You don't have to \nexplain what you don't say'' or maybe it is even simpler than that. \nMaybe the best advice for those who are privy to confidential \ninformation is what former Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, and I \nparaphrase: Just shut the heck up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last night the Senate voted to end the \nRepublican filibuster of this outstanding nominee. For the 28th time \nsince President Obama was elected, the majority leader was forced to \nfile cloture to get an up-or-down vote on one of President Obama's \njudicial nominations. Justice Hurwitz is not a nominee who should have \nbeen filibustered. With the support of Senator Kyl, the partisan effort \nto stall yet another judicial nomination was defeated. I thank Senator \nKyl and the Republican Senators who had the good sense to agree to \nproceed to an up-or-down vote on this nomination.\n  By any traditional measure, Justice Hurwitz is the kind of judicial \nnominee who should have been confirmed easily by an overwhelming, \nbipartisan majority. Justice Hurwitz has served for 9 years on the \nArizona Supreme Court and had a distinguished legal career. He has the \nsupport of his home state Senators, both conservative Republicans. He \nwas unanimously rated well qualified by the American Bar Association \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary. And he was nominated to \nfill a longstanding judicial emergency vacancy on the overburdened\n\n[[Page S3948]]\n\nNinth Circuit after extensive consultation between the White House and \nthe Arizona Senators.\n  The campaign that was mounted by the extreme right against this \noutstanding nominee was wrong. I spoke against it yesterday, as did \nSenator Kyl and Senator Feinstein. Some were attempting to disqualify a \nnominee with impeccable credentials because a Federal judge for whom \nthat nominee clerked some 40 years ago decided a case with which they \ndisagree, a case that is still reflected as the law of the land. We \nhave seen a number of new and disappointing developments during the \nlast 2 years as Republicans have ratcheted up their partisan opposition \nto President Obama's judicial nominees. On this nomination, for \nexample, I saw for what I think may be the first time a Senator reverse \nhis vote for a nomination and, instead, oppose cloture and support a \nfilibuster of that same nomination.\n  Justice Hurwitz's nomination is representative of the new standard \nthat has been imposed on President Obama's judicial nominees since this \nPresident took office. After close consultation with home State \nSenators, President Obama sent to the Senate a nominee with \nunimpeachable credentials. Indeed, in the near decade that he has \nserved on the Arizona Supreme Court, not one of Justice Hurwitz's \ndecisions has been overturned. Despite the bipartisan support for \nJustice Hurwitz, and his excellent credentials, partisan Republicans \nhave filibustered this nomination.\n  I heard some Senate Republicans attempt to mischaracterize Justice \nHurwitz's record on the death penalty. Over his 9-year tenure on the \nArizona Supreme Court, Justice Hurwitz has personally authored eight \nopinions and joined numerous other opinions upholding the death \npenalty. He also responded to both Senator Grassley and Senator \nSessions that ``the death penalty is a constitutionally appropriate \nform of punishment'' and that he ``has voted in scores of cases to \nuphold the death penalty.''\n  Justice Hurwitz's critics argue that he was the lone dissenter in two \nrulings involving the death penalty, but in each case Justice Hurwitz \ndid not oppose the death penalty but sought to ensure that due process \nwas followed to guarantee fair justice and prevent reversal on appeal. \nIn State v. Beaty, the State of Arizona had decided overnight to apply \na new death penalty execution cocktail, and Justice Hurwitz felt that a \nnew execution warrant was necessary. Justice Hurwitz's dissent was not \nopposing the death penalty; rather, he specifically requested the court \n``immediately issue a new [execution] warrant effective as soon as \nlegally possible.''\n  In State v. Styers, Justice Hurwitz relied on Supreme Court precedent \nand held that it prevented the Court from affirming the defendant's \ndeath sentence when one aggregating factor had not been tried to a \njury. In his dissent, Justice Hurwitz reasoned that a limited \nproceeding on that aggravating factor was ``constitutionally mandated \nand will likely bring this case to conclusion more promptly than the \nnew round of federal habeas proceedings that will inevitably follow \ntoday's decision.'' Thus, Justice Hurwitz did not ``quarrel with the \nsubstance of the determination,'' but felt that the procedural error \nshould have been corrected.\n  The fact that he successfully argued the case of Ring v. Arizona, \nwhere the U.S. Supreme Court found by a 7 2 vote that the Constitution \nrequires a jury trial to establish the aggravating circumstances that \nmake a defendant eligible to receive the death penalty, does not make \nhim an opponent of the death penalty any more than Justice Scalia and \nJustice Thomas, who supported the decision, oppose the death penalty. \nThat case was principally about the defendant's Sixth Amendment right \nto a jury trial and it was not a challenge to the death penalty.\n  Moreover, a ``study'' cited that purports to label Justice Hurwitz as \n``pro defendant'' is based on a sample size of only 10 criminal cases--\nand Justice Hurwitz was not on the bench for four of them. That is \nhardly representative of Justice Hurwitz's career on the bench and the \nmany criminal appeals Justice Hurwitz has heard and the many \nconvictions he has upheld. Let us be honest about his record.\n  Justice Hurwitz is an outstanding nominee with impeccable credentials \nand qualifications. He has a record of excellence as a jurist. Not a \nsingle decision he has made from the bench in his nine years as justice \nhas been reversed, and he has the strong support of both Republican \nSenators from Arizona as well as many, many others from both sides of \nthe political aisle.\n  A graduate of Princeton University and Yale Law School, Justice \nHurwitz served as the Note and Comment Editor of the Yale Law Journal. \nFollowing graduation, he clerked on every level of the Federal \njudiciary: First for Judge Jon O. Newman, who was then U.S. District \nJudge on the District of Connecticut. Subsequently, he clerked for \nJudge Joseph Smith of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \nThen he clerked for Justice Potter Stewart of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  He then distinguished himself in private practice, where he spent \nover 25 years at a law firm in Phoenix, Arizona. While in private \npractice, Justice Hurwitz tried more than 40 cases to verdict or final \ndecision. Justice Hurwitz has also taught classes at Arizona State \nUniversity's Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law for approximately 15 \nyears on a variety of subjects including ethics, Supreme Court \nlitigation, legislative process, civil procedure, and Federal courts.\n  By any traditional measure, Justice Hurwitz is the kind of judicial \nnominee who should be confirmed easily by an overwhelming, bipartisan \nvote. And now that the Senate has been forced to invoke cloture with 60 \nvotes to end a partisan filibuster, I hope the Senate will vote to \nconfirm him with bipartisan support.\n  I will conclude by emphasizing what I have been saying for months, \nthat the Ninth Circuit is in dire need of assistance. This nomination \nshould have been considered and confirmed months ago. The Chief Judge \nof the Ninth Circuit along with the members of the Judicial Council of \nthe Ninth Circuit, wrote to the Senate months ago emphasizing the Ninth \nCircuit's ``desperate need for judges,'' urging the Senate to ``act on \njudicial nominees without delay,'' and concluding ``we fear that the \npublic will suffer unless our vacancies are filled very promptly.'' The \njudicial emergency vacancies on the Ninth Circuit harm litigants by \ncreating unnecessary and costly delays. The Administrative Office of \nU.S. Courts reports that it takes nearly 5 months longer for the Ninth \nCircuit to issue an opinion after an appeal is filed, compared to all \nother circuits. The Ninth Circuit's backlog of pending cases far \nexceeds other Federal courts. As of September 2011, the Ninth Circuit \nhad 14,041 cases pending before it, far more than any other circuit.\n  When Senate Republicans filibustered the nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan to the D.C. Circuit for positions she took while representing \nthe State of New York, they contended that their underlying concern was \nthat the caseload of the D.C. Circuit did not justify the appointment \nof another judge to that Circuit. I disagreed with their treatment of \nCaitlin Halligan, their shifting standards and their purported caseload \nargument. But if caseloads were really a concern, Senate Republicans \nwould not have delayed action on the nominations to judicial emergency \nvacancies on the overburdened Ninth Circuit for months and months.\n  So, let us move forward to confirm Justice Hurwitz without further \ndelay. The partisan filibuster against this nomination was wrong. Just \nas we moved forward after defeating the filibuster of the nomination of \nJudge Jack McConnell, let us move forward now to vote on the 17 other \njudicial nominees ready for final Senate action and make real progress \nin working with the President to fill judicial vacancies around the \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, shortly, we are going to move to confirm the \njudge whose nomination we voted to move forward to last night. If \neveryone will be at ease for just a moment.\n  Let me ask Senator Coburn how long he wishes to speak.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will speak in conjunction with the \nmajority whip for a short period of time. I don't have a long speech.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will be patient, we will get this done very \nquickly.\n\n[[Page S3949]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. You bet.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the matter before the Senate is the \nnomination of Judge Hurwitz; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID.

I wonder if the majority leader would permit me to \nmake a brief statement.\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the motion to \nproceed is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                      Vote on Hurwitz Confirmation\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. I simply \nwanted to say I did not object to a voice vote on Mr. Hurwitz's \nconfirmation, but I wished to make this statement.\n  Last night, I voted for cloture because when I became a Senator, \nDemocrats were blocking an up-or-down vote on President Bush's judicial \nnominees. I said then that I would not do that and did not like doing \nthat. I have held to that in almost every case since then. I believe \nnominees for circuit judges, in all but extraordinary cases, and \ndistrict judges in every case ought to have an up-or-down vote by the \nSenate.\n  So while I voted for cloture last night, if we had a vote today, I \nwould have voted no against confirmation because of my concerns about \nMr. Hurwitz's record on right-to-life issues.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I just want to have it noted for the \nrecord that I would have voted no on this nominee had we had a recorded \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I associate myself with those last two \nremarks. I would have also voted no. I wish we had had a recorded vote.\n  I wasn't able to understand even what the majority leader was saying, \nit was spoken so softly, but had we had a recorded vote, I would have \nbeen listed as no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I was shocked and disappointed to \nlearn that the majority leader came to the floor to yield back all time \nand move immediately to a voice vote on the nomination of Andrew David \nHurwitz to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the ninth circuit. I find this to \nbe quite irregular and outside the recent precedents of this Senate. \nTypically, Members are informed of such actions in advance. I was not \nso informed, and I am the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. I \ncertainly did not intend to yield my time and, in fact, I intended to \nspeak further on the nominee, particularly to make clear some \ncorrections that I think needed to be made after I debated this \nyesterday.\n  Regardless of yielding time or further debate, I expected a rollcall \nvote on this nominee. This has been Senate precedent recently. Before \ntoday, cloture was invoked on 22 different judicial nominees. Only 1 of \nthose 22 was confirmed without a rollcall vote--Lavenski Smith to the \neighth circuit. Cloture was invoked 94 to 3 on July 15, 2002, and he \nwas confirmed by unanimous consent later that day. Even Barbara Keenan, \nfourth circuit, had a confirmation rollcall after cloture was invoked \n99 to 0.\n  Furthermore, it has been our general understanding around here for \nsome time that circuit votes would be by rollcall vote. So I am \nextremely disappointed that there has been a breach of comity around \nhere.\n  Yesterday I outlined my primary concerns regarding the nomination of \nAndrew David Hurwitz to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the ninth circuit. I \ncontinue to oppose the nomination and will vote no on his confirmation.\n  I want to supplement and correct the Record on a few issues that \narose during yesterday's debate. One of the biggest misunderstandings \nis that opposition to Justice Hurwitz is based on a 40 year-old \ndecision made by a Judge other than Justice Hurwitz. I do not oppose \nhis nomination because of what somebody else did, or because Justice \nHurwitz was a law clerk. My opposition, on this issue, is based on what \nMr. Hurwitz himself takes credit for.\n\n  He authored the article in question, not as a young law clerk, but \nwhen he was well established and seasoned lawyer, shortly before \njoining the Arizona Supreme Court. In that article Justice Hurwitz \npraised Judge Newman's opinion for its ``careful and meticulous \nanalysis of the competing constitutional issues.'' He called the \nopinion ``striking, even in hindsight.'' Let me remind you, the \nconstitutional issues and analysis he praises is Newman's influence on \nthe Supreme Court's expansion of the ``right'' to abortion beyond the \nfirst trimester of pregnancy. This, Hurwitz wrote, ``effectively \ndoubled the period of time in which states were barred from absolutely \nprohibiting abortions.''\n  Hurwitz's article was clearly an attempt to attribute great \nsignificance to decisions in which the judge for whom he had clerked \nhad participated. I think by any fair measure, it is impossible to read \nJustice Hurwitz's article and not conclude that he wholeheartedly \nembraces Roe, and importantly, the constitutional arguments that \nsupposedly support it.\n  Now it would not be surprising to learn that Justice Hurwitz might \nnot be a pro-life judge. The question is not his personal views, but \nhis judicial philosophy. He defends the legal reasoning of Roe, despite \nnear universal agreement, among both liberal and conservative legal \nscholars, that Roe is one of the worst examples of judicial activism in \nour Nation's history.\n  I have also raised my concern that Justice Hurwitz's personal views \ndo seep into his decisions as a judge. Yesterday, I discussed his \ntroubling record on the death penalty and how he appears to be pro-\ndefendant in his judicial rulings. Some of my colleagues came to the \nfloor and stated they were unaware of even one case where his personal \nviews influenced his judicial decision making. So I will review a bit \nof the record.\n  While in private practice, Justice Hurwitz successfully challenged \nArizona's death penalty sentencing scheme in Ring v. Arizona, even \nthough the law previously had been upheld by the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States in Walton v. Arizona.\n  After the Ring decision, Hurwitz, attempted to expand the ruling by \nasking the Arizona Supreme Court to either throw out each man's death \nsentence and order a new trial or to resentence each to life \nimprisonment with the possibility of parole, saying that allowing the \nprevious death sentence to stand would be a ``dangerous precedent.'' \nThe Arizona Supreme Court refused to overturn the convictions and death \nsentences on a blanket basis, ruling that the trials were fundamentally \nfair and that the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling didn't require throwing \nout all the death sentences.\n  Justice Hurwitz didn't stop there. While on the Arizona Supreme \nCourt,\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\nJustice Hurwitz continued to attempt to expand the scope of the Ring \ncase. His personal opposition to the death penalty appears to have \ninfluenced his decisions on the Arizona Supreme Court.\n  Justice Hurwitz was the lone dissenter in the case of State of \nArizona v. Styers. In that case, a jury found James Lynn Styers guilty \nof the 1989 murder, conspiracy to commit first degree murder, \nkidnapping, and child abuse of four-year-old Christopher Milke.\n  Four-year old Christopher was told he was being taken to see Santa \nClaus, but instead he was taken to the desert and brutally shot in the \nback of the head.\n  After years of appeals, the case found itself in federal court, \nmaking its way to the Ninth Circuit. In 2008, nearly 19 years after the \nheart wrenching crime took place, the Ninth Circuit sent the Styers \ncase back to Arizona. In June 2011, some 22 years after this horrific \nevent occurred, the Arizona Supreme Court, in a 4 1 decision, upheld \nStyers' death sentence. Justice Hurwitz, attempting to cite Ring as \nauthority--the case he argued in while in private practice--was the \nsole Justice on the Arizona Supreme Court who thought that \nChristopher's murderer should be given another trial, likely resulting \nin another round of delays.\n  If he had his way, the victims in this crime would still be awaiting \njustice, Arizona taxpayers would be facing unnecessary expenses and \nsociety at large would still be waiting for a resolution of the case.\n  In another death penalty case, State of Arizona v. Donald Edward \nBeaty, Justice Hurwitz was again the lone dissenter. Donald Beaty was \nconvicted of the May 9, 1984 murder in Tempe of 13-year-old Christy Ann \nFornoff. Thirteen-year-old-Christy was abducted, sexually assaulted and \nsuffocated to death by Beaty while collecting newspaper subscription \npayments.\n  Beaty, who has been on death row since July, 1985, was scheduled to \ndie by lethal injection at an Arizona Department of Corrections prison \nin Florence at 10 a.m. on May 25, 2011, more than 27 years after the \ncrime occurred. Beaty's execution was delayed for most of the day as \nhis defense team tried to challenge the Arizona Department of \nCorrections' decision to substitute one approved drug for another in \nthe state's execution-drug formula. The Arizona Supreme Court ruled 4 1 \nto lift the stay, with the majority saying Beaty's lawyers hadn't \nproved he was likely to be harmed by the change. Once again, Justice \nHurwitz was the sole dissenter.\n  If Justice Hurwitz had his way, the State would have had to start \nover with the death warrant process, leading to additional delays and \npain to the victim's family.\n  So there are two examples of where his death penalty views seeped \ninto his judicial decision making.\n  As a sitting Justice on the Arizona Supreme Court, Justice Hurwitz \ntends to be pro-defendant. A study by court watcher and Albany Law \nSchool Professor Vincent Bonventre validated the pro-defendant posture \nof Justice Hurwitz. In a 2008 study, Professor Bonventre examined the \ncriminal decisions in which the Arizona Supreme Court was divided over \nthe previous five years. His study found that Justice Hurwitz was the \nmost pro-defendant member of the Court, siding with the pro-defendant \nposition 83 percent of the time. This is well outside the mainstream \nfor the other members of the Court during the five-year period. As \nreported by the study, he took a pro-prosecution posture during that \nfive year period only once since he joined the court.\n  Mr. President, my opposition to Justice Hurwitz is not because of any \nmisbehavior in his youth, silly antics as a college freshman or \nimmature writings in college. I am not suggesting anything like that is \nin his record, but such examples were raised in the debate yesterday. \nIt is unfortunate that such arguments would have been raised in this \nserious debate.\n  I oppose the confirmation of Justice Hurwitz based on his record as a \nJustice on the Arizona Supreme Court and because of his published views \nwhich reflect a judicial ideology that is outside the mainstream.\n  Madam President, it seems to me that all the business of the Senate \nis based upon trust between one Senator and another. When the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee isn't notified of this action--or any \nother Senator--it seems to me that trust has been violated. I won't be \nsatisfied that that trust has been restored unless there is some action \ntaken to have a rollcall vote on this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today the Senate confirmed Executive \nCalendar No. 607, Andrew David Hurwitz, of Arizona, to be United States \nCircuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit on a voice vote. I request that the \nRecord reflect my opposition to the nominee and that I would have voted \n``nay.''\n\n\n  Objection to Further Proceedings on the Nomination of Andrew Hurwitz\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier today, the nomination of Andrew \nHurwitz, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit was \nagreed to by voice vote. It is unclear whether or not a motion to \nreconsider was made, whether or not a motion to table a motion to \nreconsider was offered, and whether or not a request was made to notify \nthe President was part of the order.\n  I object to any further proceedings, including those listed above, \nbased on the fact that a rollcall vote was expected on this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the record, I want to be recorded as \nan affirmative on the previous nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's vote will so be noted.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor now with my friend and \ncolleague from the State of Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, to discuss an \namendment we hope to offer to the farm bill, which I believe is the \npending matter before the Senate. I will make a brief statement and \nthen yield to my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  As I said, I come to the floor to speak about an amendment I intend \nto offer with Senator Coburn. Our amendment would reduce the level of \npremium support for crop insurance policies by 15 percentage points for \nfarmers with an adjusted gross income over $750,000 a year.\n  According to a recent GAO report, the Federal Government pays, on \naverage, 62 percent of crop insurance premiums for farmers. Let me put \nthat in perspective. These farmers are buying insurance so they can \nprotect themselves against the risk of low prices or bad weather, and \nthe premiums that are charged to them are collected to pay to those \nfarmers who collect. At the end of the day, 62 percent of the value of \nthe premiums for the crop insurance are paid by the taxpayers. In other \nwords, there is a 62-percent Federal subsidy on these premium support \npayments for crop insurance across America.\n  The amendment which I will offer with Senator Coburn would change \nthat. The reason came out very clearly in the GAO report on crop \ninsurance. Last year the Federal Government--the taxpayers--spent $7.4 \nbillion to cover that 62 percent of crop insurance premiums--$7.4 \nbillion in subsidies for crop insurance for farmers, and the amount \nspent by taxpayers each year has been growing dramatically. To cover \nroughly the same amount of acres, the Federal Government paid nearly $2 \nbillion more in 2011 than in 2009 because the value of the crops--the \nprice for the crops--had gone up during that period of time.\n  A point we would like to make and hope our colleagues would note is \nthat 4 percent of the most profitable farmers in America or farming \nentities accounted for nearly one-third of all the premium support \nprovided by the Federal Government. This is an indication on this chart \nof what we are talking about. The premium subsidies for 3.9 percent of \nfarmers across America accounted for a little over 32 percent, almost \n33 percent of all the Federal premium support subsidies. These are \npretty expensive farmers when it comes to the Federal subsidy. Facing \nstark realities, we can't justify continuing to provide this level of \npremium support to the wealthiest farmers.\n  Net farm income has gone up dramatically--in 2011 reaching a record \nhigh of $98.1 billion. The USDA forecasts that income will continue to \ngrow at a slightly higher rate than costs over the life of this farm \nbill\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\nwhich is before us. And the net income--much like government payments, \nagricultural payments are concentrated in our largest farms. Farm size \nhas a direct impact on the profit margin of the farm.\n  We have many large farms in Illinois, certainly across the country, \nbut we have many smaller farmers too. What is the difference? On a \nsmaller farm with lower income, there is less return, less profit, \nhigher risk. According to the USDA, farms with sales ranging from \n$100,000 to $175,000 have an average profit margin of 1.2 percent. You \ncan see they are close to the edge. They need crop insurance. In a bad \nyear, they are wiped out. But take a look at the larger farms. With \nmore than $1 million in sales each year, their average profit margin is \n26.8 percent. There is an economy of scale. There is money to be made. \nAnd that is the basis for Senator Coburn and me drawing the line and \nsaying there will be a reduction in the Federal subsidy for crop \ninsurance premiums for the most profitable farms. These larger and \nwealthier farms can afford to cover more of their own risk, and they \nshould cover more of their own risk.\n  The single largest recipient of crop insurance premium support last \nyear received $2.2 million to cover the Federal Government's share of \nthe policy to insure nursery crops across three counties in Florida, at \na value of $57.7 million.\n  In another example, an individual received over $1.6 million in \npremium subsidies to insure corn, potatoes, sugar beets, and wheat \nacross 24 counties in 6 States. The total value of the crops insured: \n$23.5 million.\n  Back home in Illinois, a limited liability corporation received \nnearly $1 million in premium subsidies from the Federal Government to \ninsure corn and soybeans grown in 17 counties across my State. The \ntotal value of the crop: $28.4 million.\n  We are not describing small farms by definition. Are you telling me \nthat a producer insuring a crop valued at $57.7 million will stop \nparticipating in the Crop Insurance Program if the Federal Government \nonly pays on average about 50 percent of the premiums instead of the \ncurrent 62 percent? I don't think so.\n  Our amendment is simple and straightforward. If you have an adjusted \ngross income on your farm at or above $750,000, your premium support \nwill be reduced by 15 percentage points. A provision in the underlying \nbill increasing premium support for beginning farmers--taking care of \nthe new farmers and those with smaller farms--sets a precedent for \ndifferentiating premium support based on need. So it isn't a radical \nnotion by any means. Our amendment takes the same technical approach \nalready accepted in the underlying bill. Further, the agriculture \ncommunity is already very familiar with the use of adjusted income, as \nit is already applied to title I programs. We have to draw the line \nsomewhere. Our amendment is a commonsense reform that limits the future \ncost of crop insurance programs.\n  Let me reassure producers across America and in my home State of \nIllinois that this is not an attack on crop insurance. We need crop \ninsurance. Everywhere I go, producers tell me crop insurance is the \nmost important tool the Federal Government offers farmers to manage \nrisk. I hear them, and I recognize the role crop insurance has played \nin managing the Federal role of providing disaster assistance. So I \nwill be very clear. This amendment does not exclude anyone from \nparticipating in crop insurance. The vast majority of farmers will see \nabsolutely no change in the level of premium support provided by the \nFederal Government. This amendment only impacts farmers' largest farms \nwith the highest income--those most able to cover more of their own \nrisk.\n  Why are we doing this? Because we have a deficit, and we need to deal \nwith it in an honest fashion. The underlying farm bill saves money in \ndirect payments and other means over a number of years, and I commend \nSenators Stabenow and Roberts for that effort.\n  What Senator Coburn and I will do over the next 10 years is reduce \nthe deficit by another $1.2 billion with this simple change limiting \nthe Federal subsidy and crop insurance to those wealthiest, largest \nfarmers in America. How can we ask Americans to share in any sacrifice, \nto cut spending, or reduce the debt if we cannot summon the political \nwill to ask the wealthiest farm operations to take such a modest cut in \nthe Federal subsidy for crop insurance?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3240) to reauthorize agriculture programs \n     through 2017, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to comment very clearly on what \nthis amendment does.\n  Farm and agricultural production in this country is vital both to the \ncountry and to our export markets. We have through the years tried many \ndifferent approaches to make sure we have the stability and the \nproduction power in this country for our needs and also to many \nbeneficial aspects of our foreign policy where we use agricultural \nproducts for that.\n  Imagine if you are a business other than agriculture and you have \ndecided that regardless of the mistakes you might make or the \nuncontrolled variables that might impact your business or the downturn \nin the economy, that with 62 percent of government funding you can buy \nan insurance policy that guarantees you a profit. That is what this new \nfarm bill has moved to. That is going to be our agricultural program as \nfar as the Senate is looking at it. There is a real differential there \nbetween the rest of business and commerce in America and our farm \nprogram. I understand the need for that, but this bill actually \nincreases our costs for the Crop Insurance Program by $5.2 billion as \nit is written.\n  What the Senator from Illinois and I have proposed is a commonsense \nearnings limit that is associated with every other program in title I \nthat would say: We are going to help you, but we are just not going to \nhelp you as much because you therefore, and by your own success, have \nthe means to help yourself.\n  We are going to spend a lot of money on insurance over the next 10 \nyears in this farm bill. It is $94.6 billion. What Senator Durbin and I \nare proposing is $1.2 billion in savings.\n\n  A lot of people don't realize the advances that our farmers and the \nindustries that supply them have made. As Senator Durbin pointed out, \nfarm income has been up the last 5 years and is projected to continue \nto increase. Input costs for fertilizer are going down. Input costs for \nseed and other chemicals are going up. We want a viable farm program, \nbut what we don't want is the next generation paying for additional \nwealth for those who, in fact, can afford to insure themselves.\n  This is a very modest proposal. We could have had an amendment that \nsaid: If you make over $750,000, we shouldn't be subsidizing any of \nyour crop insurance. We would still have a crop insurance program for \nthis very well-off 4 percent had we done that. What we said is that now \nis the time to start looking at that. We will look at it again with the \nnext farm bill, but certainly those who are so well-positioned to \nmaximize profits from agriculture don't need a 62-percent subsidy to \ntheir crop insurance.\n  This is a controversial amendment. We understand that. We know a lot \nof people are going to disagree with us. But the point is this: At how \nmuch income should the average, hard-working American still be paying \ntaxes to supplement your income? And that is really the question. \nShould a factory worker making $45,000 a year continue to supplement \nsomebody who is making $10 or $12 or $15 million a year through a crop \ninsurance program?\n  So we are not taking it away. All we are saying is that this needs to \nbe moderated, and moderated in a manner that won't impact anybody \nexcept this top 4 percent. If we do that, what we will do is, as the \nSenator from Illinois said, start solving some of our budget. It is not \na lot compared to what our problems are, but the way you get out of \ntrillion-dollar deficits is a billion dollars at a time.\n  What we are asking and what all of us are going to be asking over the \nnext 2 to 3 years of anybody in this country is to sacrifice some. So \nwhat Senator Durbin and I are doing is saying to the best, to the most \nefficient, to those\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\nwho make the most money, we want you to start sacrificing now by \nlimiting by 15 percent the subsidy that comes to you for this bill. I \nthink it is common sense. It is also fair. I would have gone further in \na lot of areas, but I think we have an agreement that this is something \nwe should do, we can do, and it will have no negative impact in terms \nof our production of agriculture, in terms of quantity or quality.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, over the last several years, first as \nGovernor of Tennessee and later as a U.S. Senator, I have learned that \nhealthier air also means better jobs for Tennesseans. That is why I \nintend to vote to uphold a clean air rule that requires utilities in \nother States to install the same pollution control equipment the \nTennessee Valley Authority is already installing on coal-fired power \nplants in the TVA region.\n  TVA alone can't clean up our air. Tennessee is bordered by more \nStates than any other State. We are literally surrounded by our \nneighbors' smokestacks. If we in Tennessee want more Nissan and \nVolkswagen plants, we will have to stop dirty air from blowing into \nTennessee, and here is why. Back in 1980, I was Governor and Nissan \ncame to Tennessee. The first thing the Nissan executives did was to go \ndown to the State air quality board and apply for an air quality permit \nfor their paint emissions plant. If the air in the Nashville area had \nbeen so dirty that Nissan couldn't have gotten an air quality permit \nfor additional emissions, Nissan would have gone to Georgia and we \nwould not be able to say today that one-third of our manufacturing jobs \nin Tennessee are auto jobs.\n  Every one of Tennessee's major metropolitan areas is struggling today \nto meet the standards that govern whether industries can acquire the \nair quality permits they need to locate in our State.\n  I once asked the Sevierville Chamber of Commerce leaders to name \ntheir top priority. They said to me: Clean air. Now, Sevierville is not \nnecessarily a hotbed of leftwing radicals. Sevier County is the most \nRepublican county in the State. It is nestled right up against the \nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park. It is where Dolly Parton was born. \nI live in the next county, right up next to Great Smoky Mountains \nNational Park.\n  East Tennesseans know that 9 million visitors come each year to see \nthe Great Smoky Mountains, not to see the Great Smoggy Mountains, and \nwe want those tourist dollars and the jobs they bring to keep coming. \nDespite a lot of progress, the Great Smokies is still one of the most \npolluted national parks in America. Standing on Clingman's Dome--our \nhighest peak, about 6,643 feet--you should be able to see about 100 \nmiles through the natural blue haze about which the Cherokees used to \nsing. Yet today, on a smoggy day you can see only 24 miles.\n  There are 546 Tennesseans who work today in coal mining in our State, \naccording to the Energy Information Administration. Every single one of \nthose jobs is important. This has been an important tradition in a few \ncounties in East Tennessee. At the same time, there are 1,200 \nTennesseans who work at the Alstom plants in Knoxville and Chattanooga \nthat will supply the country with most of the pollution-control \nequipment required by this rule. Every one of those Tennesseans' jobs \nis important too. Of the top five worst cities for asthma in the United \nStates, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, \nthree are in Tennessee. They are Memphis, Chattanooga, and Knoxville. \nOnly last year Nashville dropped out of the top 10 worst U.S. cities \nfor asthma. Because of the high levels of mercury, health advisories \nwarn against eating fish caught in many of Tennessee's streams.\n\n  According to the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, nationally mercury \ncauses brain damage in more than 315,000 children each year. It also \ncontributes to mental retardation. Half of the manmade mercury in the \nUnited States comes from coal-fired power plants. This new rule \nrequires removing 90 percent of this mercury. The rule also controls \n186 other hazardous pollutants, including arsenic, acid gases, and \ntoxic metals.\n  Utilities have known this was coming since 1990 because these 187 \npollutants, including mercury, are specifically identified in the 1990 \namendments to the Clean Air Act as air pollutants that need to be \ncontrolled by utilities. Now the Federal courts have added their weight \nand ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to control these \npollutants.\n  An added benefit of the rule is that the equipment installed to \ncontrol these hazardous pollutants will also capture fine particles, a \nmajor source of respiratory disease that is primarily regulated under \nanother part of the Clean Air Act. This new equipment will add a few \ndollars a month to residential electric bills. The EPA estimates a 3-\npercent increase nationwide. But because the Tennessee Valley Authority \nhas already made a commitment to install these pollution controls, the \ncustomers of TVA will pay this rate increase anyway--with the rule or \nwithout the rule. To reduce the costs, the Senator from Arkansas, \nSenator Pryor, and I will introduce legislation to allow utilities 6 \nyears to comply with the rule, which is a timeline many utilities have \nrequested. Earlier today the Senator from Oklahoma, who is sponsoring a \nresolution to overturn the rule, referred to the legislation Senator \nPryor and I offered as a cover amendment and suggested in some way that \nit wasn't a sincere effort. I greatly respect the Senator from \nOklahoma. Sometimes we have different points of view, but I have \ndifferent points of view with the Senator from Minnesota, the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, not to mention Senators from almost everyplace in the \ncountry. But I respect those different points of view just as I respect \nSenator Inhofe's different point of view, and I hope he will respect \nmine. Here is my point of view: Ever since I have been in the Senate, I \nhave introduced legislation to clean up the air in Tennessee. Why have \nI done that? Because we don't want the Great Smoggy Mountains, we want \nthe Great Smoky Mountains. We don't want to perpetually have three of \nthe top five asthma cities in the country. We don't like health \nadvisory warnings on our streams so we can't eat our fish.\n  We especially don't want the Memphis Chamber of Commerce to recruit \nanother big auto plant to the big Memphis megasite and then learn that \nthey can't come here because the Memphis area has dirty air and the \nauto manufacturer can't get a necessary air permit. It would be even \nworse if that dirty air is blowing in from another State.\n  So what this rule is about is requiring our neighbors, and the rest \nof the country, to do the same thing we are already doing. If they \ndon't do it, we have no chance in the world to ever have clean air in \nTennessee. Also, if we don't, we will have worse health and fewer jobs.\n  Now as far as the 6 years goes, the law gives States the right to add \na fourth year to the 3 years the utilities have to comply with the law. \nToday Federal law gives the President of the United States the right to \nadd 2 more years to that, so that is 6 years. In the law today the \nPresident and the States could make sure utilities have 6 years to \ncomply with this rule. I believe that makes sense.\n  If I were the king and could wave a magic wand, that is what I would \ndo. Why would I do that? Because we will be getting environmental \nbenefits over the 6 years. So what will happen is utilities will assess \ntheir coal plants, decide which ones are too old or too expensive to \noperate, decide within 3 years to close those they will not continue to \noperate, and then they will have 6 years to spread the costs of \nimplementing the expensive pollution-control equipment--most of it is \ncalled SCRs and scrubbers--on their coal-fired powerplants.\n  Most of the utilities have suggested this 6-year timeline as the \nsingle best way to clean the air and to do it in a way that has the \nleast impact on electric bills.\n  So we will introduce our legislation to give utility executives 6 \nyears to implement the rule, but we will also write President Obama a \nletter and urge him to grant the 6 years so utility executives can have \nthat certainty. Some are saying this rule is anticoal. I say it is pro-\ncoal in this sense because it guarantees coal a future in our clean \nenergy mix. As I have said, the Tennessee Valley Authority has decided \nto\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\nput the pollution control equipment it needs to make coal clean on all \nof the coal plants it continues to operate. That doesn't count carbon; \nthat counts all of the hazardous pollution. It counts sulfur, nitrogen, \nsulfur, mercury, and those sorts of things.\n  That means, long term, the TVA will be able to produce more than one-\nthird of its electricity from clean coal. That guarantees its future \nfor the foreseeable future in our region, and this is the largest \npublic utility in the world. The rest of our electricity in the \nTennessee Valley will come from even cleaner natural gas and from \npollution-free nuclear power and hydropower.\n  Ever since Tennesseans elected me to the Senate, which was about 10 \nyears ago, I have worked hard to clean up our air. Tennesseans know \nthat. Most of them agree with me. They thank me for it when I go home \non weekends. They do that because they know if I do not help clean up \nour air in Tennessee, and if I don't stop dirty air from blowing into \nour State from other States who don't have pollution controls on their \ncoal plants, that it jeopardizes our health and it jeopardizes our \nopportunity to continue to be one of the Nation's leading States in \nattracting auto jobs and in attracting tourists.\n  I notice on the Senate floor the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Pryor, \nand I thank him for his leadership on the issue and for his practical \nattitude. I believe we have the same goals, which are, No. 1, clean the \nair but keep the electric bills down at the lowest possible cost, and \nwe believe we have the most constructive proposal to do that. We hope \nPresident Obama will agree with us.\n  First, we hope the Senate will agree with us and uphold the rule; \nsecond, that the President will agree with us and grant 6 years; and, \nthird, if he does not, that the Congress will agree with us and pass a \nlaw giving utilities 6 years to spread out the costs.\n  I thank the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask that I be given 10 minutes to speak \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I would like to commend my colleague from \nTennessee and his leadership when it comes to clean air. He has a long \nhistory for fighting for clean air in Tennessee in this country, and we \nshare the common goal of maintaining a safe and reliable source of \nelectricity, but also one that is safe for human health.\n  Cleaner air means better health for Arkansans, for Tennesseans, and \nfor everyone in the entire country. This all started back in 1990 with \nsome Clean Air Act amendments signed by President George H.W. Bush \nauthorizing EPA to regulate air pollutant emissions from powerplants. \nThese regulations have been two decades in the making.\n  As I said, it started back in 1990, and a lot has changed since then. \nBut one thing that has improved greatly since then is technology. These \nclean air rules try to make these coal-fired powerplants 90 percent \ncleaner. They can now achieve that 90 percent reduction from \nuncontrolled emissions of mercury and other pollutants because of \ntechnology. We have the ability to make this achievable today. I don't \nknow if that was true 20 years ago, but it is certainly true today.\n  I would like to visit with my colleagues for the next few minutes \nabout the plan Senator Alexander has put forward in which I heartily \njoin him. It is a three-step plan:\n  First, vote no on Senator Inhofe's resolution that we understand will \ncome up sometime in the next several days.\n  Second, consider voting for the legislation that we are proposing and \nthat we would like to move to the Senate floor within a reasonable \namount of time that would basically say all the utility companies get 6 \nyears to comply with these new rules. Again, these new rules that are \nnow on the books and have been on the books since February have been 20 \nyears in the making.\n  The third step we are proposing is a letter to the President of the \nUnited States to urge him in the interim to give the additional 2 \nyears, which he has the authority to do under the law. He can do 2 \nyears with an Executive order.\n  Let me just walk through those very quickly. Some of the reasons I am \ngoing to vote no on Senator Inhofe's resolution of disapproval is \nbecause although I believe the EPA is wrong in their timetable, I think \n3 years is too short. I don't think that is enough time. As Senator \nAlexander said a few moments ago, we can do the math that is in the \nstatute and in the regulations, and it probably adds up to 6 years. \nLet's go ahead and be up front and give them the 6 years. Six years \nwill do it, and that creates certainty. That means people can plan, \nthat means people can schedule equipment, and skilled laborers can come \nfrom the United States and not outsourced from overseas, and most of \nthe equipment will be made in the United States. That gives our utility \ncompanies time to do all of this.\n  I think the EPA is wrong in the sense that they are trying to force \nthis over a 3-year period. I think 4 years is a minimum and 6 years is \nwhat we really need. I think that just makes the most sense under the \ncircumstances.\n  With all due respect to Senator Inhofe, for whom I have a lot of \nrespect, his resolution of disapproval is wrong. I think it is the \nwrong approach. I think it is over the top. It reverses course and, \nbasically, if I understand it, it allows the utility companies to \npollute at will. It actually creates a legal problem that I am not sure \nwe adequately discussed on the Senate floor. I am sure we will as we go \nthrough this process and as Senator Inhofe's resolution actually comes \nto the Senate floor, but it creates a legal problem.\n  If it were to pass, what does the future hold? The law says if a \nresolution of disapproval passes, then the agency cannot put forward a \nsubstantially similar regulation.\n  What does that mean in this circumstance? There is no legal precedent \nfor that. Some argue if the resolution of disapproval passes, that is \nit, Katey bar the door; that this is no holds barred, so to speak, when \nit comes to oil and coal plants and what they can produce.\n  I certainly hope that is not the case. I don't know if that is the \ncase, but legal experts disagree, and I don't think that is a chance we \nshould take. There is no doubt that sending plumes of mercury and \nparticulate matters and things such as sulfur dioxide, et cetera, \ncreates serious health hazards for children and adults. One can look at \nthe statistics when it comes to heart attacks or premature deaths, \nasthma, and all kinds of different ailments that human beings suffer. \nThere is no doubt that these coal-fired plants contribute to that.\n\n  As we have seen, when we grandfather these plants, they don't, out of \nthe goodness of their hearts, do the things necessary to stop the \npolluting. What they do is they keep running them because they are \ngrandfathered. That needs to stop at some point in the future as well. \nI think our approach helps in that way as well.\n  I talked about the EPA being wrong and I talked about Senator Inhofe \nhaving the wrong approach. The third thing I would say is let's extend \nit, not end it. I think that by making clear we want the full 6 years--\nthe 3 years in the statute, the 1 year in the State, the 2 years that \nthe President has discretion on--I think that 6 years gives everybody \nample time to plan, take care of business as they should, and make sure \nwe have electricity capacity in this country.\n  I would say we need to stop the scare tactics about job loss and the \nsky is falling and this is the end of the coal industry in America. I \ncompletely disagree with that. I think the United States would be very \nsmart to continue to use coal because we have something like 400 years \nworth of coal usage. We are kind of like the Saudi Arabia of coal. So I \nam not trying to hurt the coal industry. I am not trying to kill jobs \nor do anything like that. But I think if we look at the small cost--we \nhave to understand that these plants are worth billions and billions of \ndollars and we are talking about adding some costs to that. One \nestimate I saw is it is going to add about 3 percent. But if we look at \nthe balancing of costs of what we are trying to accomplish here versus \nthe health costs in savings we get, there is really no comparison. I \nthink it is fair to say that what the Alexander approach does is it \nactually\n\n[[Page S3954]]\n\nsaves kids' lives. It is good for business. It is good for our \nenvironment. It is good for our people.\n  I think what we see here is a false choice that some people are \ntrying to present. Some people say we have to be either pro coal or pro \nhealth. That is a false choice. We can be both. We can be pro coal and \nhave a good, robust coal industry. If we were to open a magazine here \nin Washington or the Washington Post, oftentimes we will see a full-\npage ad that talks about clean coal. We turn on the television and \nwatch some of the news shows and the coal industry is advertising clean \ncoal. What are they talking about? This is what they are talking about. \nThey are talking about cleaning up these coal plants so we can still \nuse this precious American resource, but we do it in such a way that we \neliminate 90 percent of the pollution and the harmful particulates that \nare in coal--90 percent. That is clean coal. That is what they are \ntalking about.\n  So let's do this, but let's do it over a 6-year period, not over a 3- \nor 4-year period. Let's not force ourselves into a false choice. Let's \ndo the right thing for this generation and the generations to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wish to congratulate the Senator from Arkansas for \nhis very clear explanation of what we are about here. The United States \nproduces 25 percent of all the wealth in the world every year. In order \nto do that, we use about 20 to 25 percent of all of the electricity in \nthe world. We need low-cost, reliable, large amounts of clean \nelectricity and we need for coal to have a secure part of the future of \nour clean energy mix.\n  I have said for years, we know what to do about sulfur, nitrogen, \nmercury, and the hazardous pollutants. We have the pollution control \nequipment to capture all of those. We can make the coal clean, except \nfor carbon, so let's put that over here on the side for a minute. We \ncan make the coal clean and we should do it. We should have done it in \na law over the last few years. We have had 15 Senators equally divided \non both sides of the aisle trying to pass a law. We couldn't get it \ndone so we defaulted to the EPA, so now they have had to do the rule. \nBut the Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990 we told EPA to write \nthis rule. In the law, it listed the pollutants that have to be \ncontrolled. In 2005, President Bush tried to write this rule but a \nFederal Court threw it out and in 2008 said to the EPA, you have to do \nit, the way the law says to do it. So Congress has told them to do it, \nthe courts have told them to do it, and now they have done it according \nto the law. If we don't like the rule, we have to change the law, which \nwe are not doing with the resolution of disapproval.\n  The constructive thing we can do is let the rule go forward. Let's \nhave clean coal be a part of our clean energy mix, and then let's allow \nutilities what they many of them have asked for, 6 years to implement \nthe rule. Hopefully, our legislation will pass. Hopefully, just the \nmere introduction of it, particularly by those of us who support the \nrule, will persuade President Obama that it would be a reasonable \nExecutive Order for him to make, to assure people across the country \nthat we will have no interruption in the reliability of our electricity \nand that we will have no great increase in costs in most parts of the \ncountry.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arkansas when he said that coal needs \nto be a very important part of our future. This regulation will make \ncoal in our region an important part of our electricity production. If \nthe TVA is the biggest public utility in the country, and it is going \nto produce a third of its electricity from coal with pollution-control \nequipment on the plants. That is clean coal.\n  But the real holy grail of energy for me is the scientist who \ndiscovers the way to turn carbon from existing coal plants into \nsomething commercially useful. It will probably be in energy. In the \nDepartment of Energy right now they have an interesting experiment \nwhere they are applying a biologic process--really, bugs--to \nelectrodes, turning it into oil. Imagine what would happen if all the \ncoal plants in our country could turn the carbon they produce into \nother kinds of energy. Then, suddenly, we would have this 400-year \nsupply of coal, and the carbon, as well as all the other parts, would \nbe clean and we could use even more coal than the one-third it is \nlikely to represent.\n  I appreciate very much the leadership of the Senator from Arkansas, \nhis advocacy, and his clear statement of opinion. I wish to say to both \nour Republican and Democratic colleagues, if you are looking for a way \nto have clean coal, clean air, and do it at the lowest possible cost to \nthe taxpayer, let's do what most of the utilities have asked for and \ngive them a timeline of 6 years to implement the rule. The easiest way \nto do it would be for the President to introduce the Executive Order, \nand each State to give the utility one more year, because that \nauthority is already a part of the Federal law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Texas is waiting so \nlet me conclude in the next couple of minutes.\n  We talked about clean coal and why that is important. Let me tell my \ncolleagues what else is important. Based on the statistics, the health \nbenefits are between $37 billion and $90 billion. That is an estimate \nfor 2016. For every dollar we put in, we get up to $9 back in health \nbenefits. The new rules could prevent up to 11,000 premature \ndeaths, 4,700 heart attacks, 130,000 asthma attacks, 140,000 cases of \nrespiratory symptoms, over 9,000 cases of bronchitis, 5,700 hospital \nemergency room visits, 540,000 missed work or sick days, and 3.2 \nmillion days when people must restrict their activities. Mercury, they \nsay, causes brain damage in more than 315,000 children each year. Half \nof the U.S. manmade mercury comes from coal-fired powerplants. The new \nrules require removing 90 percent of that mercury.\n\n  So back to the point of Senator Alexander. This approach provides \ncertainty. It ensures grid reliability. It allows sufficient time for \nutilities to comply under this bad economy. It gives manufacturing and \nskilled labor jobs to U.S. companies and U.S. workers, and it also \nreduces health problems and costs associated with the coal industry \nright now.\n  With that, I ask my colleagues to consider looking at the Alexander \nand Pryor approach. I would love to visit with any of my colleagues who \nare so inclined.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this morning during a hearing in front of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, the Attorney General appeared, and in \nan exchange I had with him, it culminated with my call upon him to \nresign his position as Attorney General. That is a very serious matter. \nI wish to take a few minutes to explain why, after long deliberation, I \nhave come to this conclusion. I do believe it is the right decision and \nit is long overdue.\n  I served as an attorney general of my State--an elected attorney \ngeneral, not an appointed attorney general. I believe strongly the \nAmerican people deserve a chief law enforcement officer who will be \nindependent of political influence, who will be accountable to the law, \nand who will be transparent, particularly in his dealings with the \nCongress. Unfortunately, Attorney General Holder has failed on all of \nthese counts.\n  At his confirmation hearing in 2009 in front of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Eric Holder said his Department of Justice would ``serve \njustice, not the fleeting interests of any political party.'' He also \nsaid he would seek to achieve a ``full partnership with this Committee \nand with Congress as a whole.'' I wish he had kept his word. \nRegrettably, he has not.\n  In the past few weeks I have joined my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle in our shock at news articles that have disclosed some of the \nmost sensitive classified programs of our national security apparatus. \nThese were reportedly covert operations aimed at thwarting terrorist \nattacks as well as defeating Iran's nuclear aspirations. The leaks, \naccording to the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator \nFeinstein--I am paraphrasing here, but I believe she says these are \nsome of the worst she has seen in her tenure on the Intelligence \nCommittee. Others have suggested these are some of the most damaging \npotential leaks\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\nin our history--certainly recent history.\n  According to the very stories that reported these programs, the \nsources come from the highest reaches of the executive branch of our \ngovernment; namely, the White House. As Democrats and Republicans have \nboth made clear, the unauthorized release of classified information is \na crime--it is a crime--because it threatens our national security and \nputs the lives of those who are sworn to defend our Nation in jeopardy. \nAs many have hastened to point out, it also jeopardizes the cooperation \nof our allies. Who would be motivated to be a source of classified, \nhighly sensitive information that would be provided to our intelligence \ncommunity if they knew they were likely to be on the front page of the \nWashington Post or The New York Times?\n  The news articles containing the leaked information paint the \nPresident in a flattering light. The concern is that they appear just \nas his reelection campaign is getting into full swing.\n  Let me be clear. These facts raise legitimate concerns about the \nmotives behind what everyone agrees is criminal conduct. That is why it \nis so important to have an investigation of these leaks that is \nindependent, nonpartisan, and thorough. Unfortunately, Attorney General \nHolder has demonstrated, at least to me, that he is incapable of \ndelivering that kind of investigation.\n  Just hours before Senator McCain and Senator Chambliss called for a \nspecial prosecutor or, in the parlance of the statute now, a special \ncounsel, Holder's Deputy Attorney General Jim Cole told me he didn't \nthink an independent investigation was warranted because the leaks \ndidn't come from the White House or this administration. Amazingly, he \nhadn't, apparently, done an investigation before he reached that \nconclusion. Attorney General Holder apparently takes the same view. He \nhas already decided who is not to blame, and he has excluded the \nadministration and the White House and the reported sources of the \ninformation--although not named, they were named by category--he has \nalready written them off and suggested that they could not possibly be \nthe source of any of these leaks.\n  I looked into the special counsel law which says that a special \nprosecutor is called for when an investigation would present a conflict \nof interest for the Justice Department.\n  I concede the Attorney General has a very tough job. He is a member \nof the President's Cabinet, but he has a special and independent \nresponsibility as the chief law enforcement officer of the country and \nhe can't be confused about those roles. There have been some reports \nthat some of these leaks may have even emanated from the Justice \nDepartment itself. In fact, this morning, the Attorney General \nacknowledged that some of the Department of Justice's National Security \nDivision had recused itself from an ongoing leak investigation. We \ndon't know the details of that, but he did concede that his own \nNational Security Division at the Department of Justice--some members \nof that division had already recused themselves.\n  These leaks in the New York Times--I am talking specifically about \nthe drone program and about the cyber attacks on Iran's nuclear \ncapability--quoted senior administration officials and quoted members \nof the President's national security team.\n  Now, that is not a large number of people to question or to identify. \nIn fact, that is the very source given in these stories that reported \nthe leaks--``senior administration officials'' and ``members of the \npresident's national security team.''\n  This is the same story that said that on the President's so-called \nkill list that he personally goes over with his national security team \nidentifying targets of drone attacks, that also David Axelrod, his \nchief political adviser, sat in, apparently, on at least one, maybe \nmore meetings.\n  But instead of an independent prosecutor, Attorney General Holder has \nchosen to appoint two U.S. attorneys who are in his chain of command \nand who will report to him and who are directly under his personal \nsupervision. One of those is U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia \nRonald Machen, who volunteered on the Obama campaign in 2008 and who \nhas given thousands of dollars to the President's political campaigns \nover the years. I do not have any issue with that. That is his right as \nan American citizen. But it does raise legitimate questions about his \nability to be independent and conduct the kind of investigation I am \ntalking about. Oh, by the way, Mr. Machen also got his start as a \nFederal prosecutor when he went to work for U.S. Attorney General Eric \nHolder. That is not an independent investigation--that is the point--\nand it helps to demonstrate why it is that Attorney General Holder has \na conflict of interest himself that requires the appointment of a \nspecial counsel, not the appointment of two U.S. attorneys who are \ndirectly responsible to him and through whom he can control the flow of \ninformation to Congress and others.\n  Reasonable people will wonder, where does the Attorney General's \nloyalty lie--to the President of the United States to try to help him \nget reelected or his duty to enforce the laws of the U.S. Government?\n  This would be troubling enough to me if this were an isolated event, \nbut what has brought me to this serious conclusion that Attorney \nGeneral Holder should, in fact, resign goes back much further because \nthis is only a symptom of the Department of Justice's complete lack of \naccountability, independence, and transparency.\n  Take the tragedy known as Operation Fast and Furious. And we know, \nunder Attorney General Holder's watch, the Department of Justice \nordered the transfer of more than 2,000 high-caliber firearms to some \nof the most dangerous drug cartels operating in Mexico. The Attorney \nGeneral disingenuously tried to confuse this with an operation known as \nWide Receiver, which was done in consultation with the Mexican \nGovernment and where the point was not to let the guns walk without \nsurveillance but to track them. It was ended when it became very \ndifficult to track them and thus gave rise to the operation known as \nFast and Furious, which had an altogether different mode of operation.\n  Instead of tracking these firearms and arresting cartel agents \ntrafficking them, under Operation Fast and Furious, Department of \nJustice officials ordered law enforcement agents to break off direct \nsurveillance and to allow these guns to ``walk''--apparently under the \nmistaken belief that they could somehow find them at a later time and, \nthrough alternative means of surveillance, discover the nature of the \norganization and the distribution of these guns and help them bring \ndown some of these cartels. Unfortunately, and quite predictably, the \nweapons from this flawed operation have been used to commit numerous \nviolent crimes on both sides of the southern border, including the \nmurder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010.\n  Far from being apologetic, Attorney General Holder's conduct during \nthe congressional investigation into this flawed program has been \nnothing short of misleading and obstructionist, having complete \ndisregard for Congress's independent constitutional responsibility to \nconduct oversight and investigations of the Department of Justice and \nother Federal agencies.\n  For example, Attorney General Holder has stonewalled the \ninvestigation, turning over less than 10 percent of the documents \nsubpoenaed by a congressional committee.\n  Attorney General Holder's Department misled Congress in a February \n2011 letter where they claimed that Operation Fast and Furious did not \neven exist--there was no program to allow guns to walk into the hands \nof the cartels and to lose direct surveillance of them. We now know \nthat is false but only because Lanny Breuer, 9 months later, in \nNovember 2011, came before the Senate Judiciary Committee and said: You \nknow, that letter we wrote in February 2011 saying there was not any \ngun-walking program known as Fast and Furious--that was false. That was \nnot true.\n  So for all that period of time, Attorney General Holder and his \nDepartment misled Congress by claiming falsely that Fast and Furious \ndid not exist.\n  Then, in addition, Attorney General Holder misled Representative \nIssa, who has led the investigation in the House of Representatives, by \ntestifying that he only learned of Operation Fast\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\nand Furious ``over the last few weeks.'' That was in May 2011. He said \nhe only learned about it in ``the last few weeks.'' Brian Terry was \nmurdered in December 2010, yet Eric Holder said he only learned in \n``the last few weeks'' about Operation Fast and Furious, and that was \nin May 2011. We now know that is false.\n  Attorney General Holder also misled the public at a September 2011 \npress conference by claiming that Operation Fast and Furious did not \nreach into the upper levels of the Justice Department. We now know that \nis false. I personally reviewed some of the wiretaps that were produced \nas a result of a whistleblower through the House investigating \ncommittee, and it makes clear that the rationale for securing a wiretap \nwas because they did not expect to be able to keep track of the weapons \ndirectly by direct surveillance, describing, in essence, the tactics of \nOperation Fast and Furious. Those required the authorization of high-\nlevel Department of Justice employees, including those in Lanny \nBreuer's office. Again, Attorney General Holder and his staff misled \nthe public, claiming Operation Fast and Furious was unknown at the \nupper reaches of the Justice Department.\n  Attorney General Holder misled the Senate Judiciary Committee last \nNovember by testifying that he did not believe that these wiretap \napplications approved by senior deputies included detailed discussion \nof gunwalking. As I said, we know that to be false. I read them with my \nown eyes yesterday, although they remain under seal. And Attorney \nGeneral Holder has refused to take any step to ask the court to modify \nthat seal so we can then review those and compare his story with what \nis revealed in the affidavits. So as long as these documents remain \nunder seal, we are left with the ``he said, she said'' that he could \nresolve if he would agree to go to the court and ask that they be \nunsealed for purposes of the congressional investigation.\n\n  Then, when there were reports of gunwalking operations in Houston, \nTX, at a sports dealer known as Carter's Country, I asked Attorney \nGeneral Holder whether there were gunwalking operations in my State. \nWhen you had a legitimate seller of firearms say: Hey, I think there is \nsomething suspicious going on, you have people making bulk purchases of \nfirearms, and I am worried they may be going to the cartels or other \nsources, they were told: Do not do anything about it. Let them go.\n  But when I asked Attorney General Holder to confirm or deny that \nthere was an Operation Fast and Furious look-alike or that Fast and \nFurious itself was operating in my State, again, I got no reply.\n  I have no idea what else the Attorney General and his Department are \nconcealing from the American people or, more importantly, the Brian \nTerry family, who deserve to know what happened and how this operation \nwent terribly awry.\n  Perhaps worst of all has been the lack of accountability, starting at \nthe top. In the last 16 months since Operation Fast and Furious was \nuncovered, Eric Holder has not fired a single person in his Department \nfor supplying 2,000 high-caliber firearms to drug cartels in Mexico. \nThat is really astonishing. I have to ask, if no one has been held \naccountable, what does it take to get fired at the Holder Justice \nDepartment?\n  Attorney General Holder's litany of failure does not end there, \nagain, putting politics ahead of his job as the chief law enforcement \nofficer of the country and, indeed, putting what appears to be a \npolitical agenda ahead of the law.\n  For example--another example--Attorney General Holder has targeted \ncommonsense voter ID legislation passed by the Texas Legislature and \nthe South Carolina Legislature, which the Supreme Court of the United \nStates has overwhelmingly upheld the constitutionality of since 2008. \nSo here is the Texas Legislature, the South Carolina Legislature--and \nothers perhaps sitting in the wings--trying to take steps to protect \nthe integrity of the vote of qualified voters in their State. And who \nis the chief obstructionist to that goal? It is the Attorney General \nand the Department of Justice. So now we find ourselves--my State, \nSouth Carolina, and others find themselves in litigation asking the \ncourts to do what the Attorney General will not and acknowledge that \nthe Supreme Court decision in 2008 is the law of the land.\n  These voter identification laws are designed to require citizens to \nproduce a valid photo identification. If you do not have a valid photo \nidentification, you can get one for free. In my State, you can show up \nwithout any ID and vote provisionally as long as you come back within a \nperiod of time and produce one. So it is no impediment to participation \nin votes. You know what. The American people are accustomed to \npresenting a photo ID because every time you get on an airplane, every \ntime you want to buy a pack of cigarettes or a beer, you have to, if \nyou are of a certain age, produce a photo ID to prove you are of a \ncertain age. But Mr. Holder has been so outrageous as to compare these \nvoter ID laws to Jim Crow poll taxes--it is outrageous--a charge that \nis defamatory and an insult to the people of my State and anyone with \ncommon sense. You know what. You have to show a photo ID to get into \nEric Holder's office building in Washington, DC. Yet it is \ndiscriminatory somehow? It discourages qualified voters from casting \ntheir ballot? It is ridiculous. While Attorney General Holder is \nblocking State efforts to prevent voter fraud, he neglects the voting \nrights of the men and women in uniform who serve in our country's Armed \nForces.\n  In 2010--actually before that--on a bipartisan basis, we introduced \nlegislation and passed it overwhelmingly, something called the MOVE \nAct. It is a military voting act. But after its passage, which was \ndesigned to make it easier for troops who are deployed abroad or \ncivilians deployed abroad to cast a ballot in U.S. elections, the \nAttorney General failed to adequately enforce this legislation, which \nwas designed to guarantee our Active-Duty military and their families \nthe right to vote. If Mr. Holder had spent as much time and effort \nenforcing this law as he recently spent attempting to get convicted \nfelons and illegal aliens back on the voter rolls in Florida, thousands \nof military voters might have gotten their ballots on time rather than \nbe disenfranchised in 2010.\n  These are not the only duly enacted laws the Attorney General has \nfailed to enforce in order to carry out the political agenda that \napparently he believes is more important.\n  The Attorney General has announced he will refuse to defend the \nbipartisan Defense of Marriage Act that was signed by President Bill \nClinton, despite the fact that has been the law of the land for more \nthan 15 years. It is, in fact, the duty of the Department of Justice to \ndefend laws passed by Congress that are lawful and constitutional. Yet \nhe refuses to even do so, and the litany goes on.\n  In addition to using the Justice Department as a political arm of the \nObama campaign, he has also moved the Department in a dangerously \nideological direction in the war on terror. Attorney General Holder has \nfailed to grasp the most important lesson of 9/11 and the 9/11 \nCommission, that there is a difference between criminal law enforcement \nfor violating crimes and the laws of war that are destined to get \nactionable intelligence and prevent attacks against the American \npeople, not just punish them once they have occurred, which is the \nfunction of the criminal law.\n  His actions have demonstrated that he believes terrorism is a \ntraditional law enforcement problem warranting the same old traditional \nlaw enforcement solutions. But they, by definition, occur after the \nfact, after innocent people have been murdered, rather than designed to \nprevent those attacks.\n  For example, Attorney General Holder attempted to hold trials for \nmaster minds of the 9/11 attack, such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in \ncivilian court in Manhattan. He wanted to do so in spite of the outcry \nof local communities and the fact that civilian trials would give \nterrorists legal protections they are not entitled to under our \nConstitution and laws and which they do not deserve.\n  Attorney General Holder attempted to transfer terrorists from \nGuantanamo Bay Cuba to prisons in the United States over the repeated \nobjection of local communities and the Congress.\n  What is more, when Federal agents detained, thankfully, the Christmas\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\nDay Bomber in Chicago who was trying to blow up an airplane with a bomb \nhe had smuggled and that was undetectable to law enforcement agents, he \ninsisted that instead of being treated as a terrorist, an enemy \ncombatant, he be read his Miranda rights. That is right. Attorney \nGeneral Holder insisted this terrorist be told: You have the right to \nremain silent. You have the right to a lawyer. This is the sort of \nmuddled thinking that I think has created such potential for harm, \ntreating a war and terrorists as if they were conventional criminals \nwho ought to be handled through our civilian courts.\n  While Attorney General Holder was worrying about the rights of people \nsuch as the Christmas Day Bomber, he was targeting some of the very \nAmericans who risked their lives to keep America safe. In fact, he \nappointed a special prosecutor--he thought this was sufficient to \nappoint a special prosecutor, not to investigate these classified leaks \nbut to investigate U.S. intelligence officials in conducting their \nduties--he appointed a special prosecutor to investigate CIA \ninterrogators during the prior administration, men and perhaps women \nwho did what they did based on legal advice from the Department of \nJustice and based on the belief that what they were doing was important \nto the safety and security of U.S. citizens, and I think they were \nright.\n  Attorney General Holder has also seen fit to release top secret memos \ndetailing interrogation methods, information which, of course, quickly \nfound its way into the hands of America's enemies and which they could \nuse to train to resist our intelligence-gathering efforts.\n  Attorney General Holder's failure to grasp the most important lesson \nof the last decade, that we are at war against al-Qaida, demonstrates \nmore than just a willingness to carry a political agenda for this \nadministration. It is a sad result of an ideological blindness to the \nlaw. It has moved the Department of Justice, and unfortunately this \ncountry, in a dangerous direction.\n  I would continue on with examples of Eric Holder's litany of failure, \nbut I believe the case is clear-cut. The American people deserve an \nAttorney General who is independent of politics, who is accountable to \nthe oversight of Congress, and who is transparent. Mr. Holder has \nproven that he is none of these things. It is with regret, not with \nanger but with regret and sadness I say it is time for him to resign.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise to stress the critical \ninfrastructure needs across our Nation and to urge the House of \nRepresentatives to act quickly and to pass a meaningful transportation \nbill. On March 14, the Senate passed the Moving Ahead for Progress in \nthe 21st Century Act by a strong bipartisan vote of 74 to 22.\n  Later that month, I came to the floor of the Senate to highlight the \nimportance of the passage of our surface transportation bill. Since \nthen, the American people have been waiting for the House of \nRepresentatives to act on their version of a transportation bill. Three \nmonths to the week after the Senate passed our Transportation bill on a \n74-to-22 bipartisan vote, with the Nation continuing to wait for action \nand the June 30 deadline to renew or extend the transportation program \ncoming closer and closer, the leaders of the House of Representatives \nhave announced not a short-term extension but they have announced their \ninterest in a longer term extension to the end of 2012.\n  I suppose the good news is that means we have some interest in moving \nforward with transportation. But that is not good enough for the people \nof this country. In Minnesota, as you know, the construction season has \nbegun, and because of our cold winters, we do not always have a long \nconstruction season. This kind of delay, where we have a very good \nbipartisan bill which includes $700 million in construction projects \nfor our State of Minnesota, this kind of delay can be crippling. We \nhave a much smaller window of time in which we can complete much needed \nprojects for easing congestion and improving safety.\n  These projects will help get commuters out of traffic and moving in \nthe Twin Cities; projects to help ensure that farmers and food \nproducers across greater Minnesota can transport their supplies at the \nright time to the right place to ensure that we continue to have a safe \nand reliable food supply.\n  Think about the projects in Minnesota that need to be completed: \nHighway 52 in Rochester. Highway 52, a long-time problem in terms of \ndeaths, in terms of traffic accidents, still an area where people get \nkilled; U.S. Highway 14 in southern Minnesota, continuing to wait for \nthat to be completed; 101 in the western metropolitan area, a little \ngirl was just killed walking her bike, getting on her bike going across \nthat Highway 101--killed; Highway 94 out by Rogers, a bottleneck all \nthe time. I have been in it several times myself; 23 in Marshall needs \nto get done. There is a major company out there, Schwan's, but we have \na highway that is not able to carry the food and the goods to market \nthat it should because that construction has not been done; roads from \nMoorhead to the Iron Range, to Duluth, all that needs to be completed.\n  That is why it is not good enough to hear the House of \nRepresentatives talk about a simple extension when we have a strong \nbipartisan transportation bill that came out of the Senate. We also \nneed to be aware of the costs incurred by each additional day of delay. \nThe longer it takes for the Congress to pass a transportation bill, the \nlonger it takes projects to be completed, the more expensive they \nbecome to taxpayers. That stands to reason. Anyone who has built an \naddition on their house understands that--delay, delay, delay.\n\n  That is a waste of taxpayers' money. That is why we have to get this \nbill done. State Departments of Transportation, contractors, \nconstruction workers, engineering firms, and other industries need \ncertainty to move forward with the bill. These are private sector jobs, \nprivate sector jobs that await the passage of this bill. They should \nnot have to wait any longer for the House of Representatives to act.\n  Take, for example, Caterpillar. That might not be the first company \nwe would think of when we think about the Transportation bill. Everyone \nsees the Caterpillar tractors, Caterpillar trucks throughout the rural \nareas. This business employs 750 people at its road-paving equipment \nmanufacturing facility in Minnesota. I have been there. They gave me a \npink Caterpillar hat. I spoke to all their employees. They are people \non the frontlines of American industry helping to create the real \n``Made in America'' product that keeps jobs in our country and puts \ndollars in our economy.\n  They are ready to get to work. They are ready to get to work \nimproving our Nation's roads, our bridges, our tunnels, and our \nhighways. I ask the House of Representatives: Why are we making these \nworkers wait? They are ready to get these paving projects done. They \nare ready to help the commuters in our State to get to work faster. \nThey want to get going. There is no reason to delay getting this bill \ndone.\n  For decades, passing a transportation bill was considered one of the \nmost basic noncontroversial duties of the Congress, and we have an \nopportunity to come together to find commonsense solutions to move \nAmerica forward. We cannot afford to keep the engine of our economy \nidling by limiting our talk to yet another extension of the surface \ntransportation program. The Senate Transportation bill is fully paid \nfor and will allow States to move forward to make the critical \ninfrastructure investments in our Nation's roads and our bridges and in \nour transit systems.\n  In addition, the bill makes critical reforms to transportation \npolicy. Just last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nreleased a report announcing that 58 percent of high school seniors had \ntexted or e-mailed while driving in the previous month--58 percent of \nkids out there on the road while we are all driving--we have to \nremember that 58 percent--nearly 60 percent of the kids out on the road \nare doing a text, are doing an e-mail while they are driving. That is \nnot acceptable.\n  The bipartisan Transportation bill includes provisions that I worked \non to\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\nhelp prevent texting while driving and implement graduated license \nstandards. The bill gives State departments of transportation increased \nflexibility so they can address these unique needs. The Senate-passed \nsurface transportation bill also reduces the number of highway programs \nfrom over 100 down to 30. By saying they are not going to pass this \nbill in the House, they stop us from getting rid of those kinds of \nduplication. It defines clear national goals for our transportation \npolicy. It streamlines environmental permitting. Why would they want to \nstop that? Why would they want to stop us from streamlining \nenvironmental permitting? But that is what they are doing by saying \nthey want a simple extension.\n  The bill expands the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and \nInnovation Program. The Minnesota Department of Transportation has \nsuccessfully used the program in the past and it will continue to be a \nkey element of our State's and other State's transportation networks in \nthe future. The fact is, we have neglected the roads and bridges that \nmillions of Americans rely on for too long.\n  No one knows that better than we know it in our State where that I \n35W bridge tragically collapsed in the middle of a summer day, \nsomething no one could ever expect would have happened. It is not just \na bridge. It is an eight-lane highway 6 blocks from my house. If that \ncan happen there, it can happen anywhere in America.\n  We simply cannot wait and delay any longer when we have a bipartisan \nbill with 74 Senators who voted for it. There is absolutely no excuse \nfor the House of Representatives not taking this up. If we want to know \nif there are other bridges with problems, look at this. The number from \nthe Federal Highway Administration shows that over 25 percent of the \nNation's 600,000 bridges are either structurally deficient or \nfunctionally obsolete.\n  For further proof, we need look no further than the 2009 Report Card \nfor America's Infrastructure, released by the American Society of Civil \nEngineers. It gave our Nation's Infrastructure a near failing grade. \nBut crumbling infrastructure does not just threaten public safety; it \nalso weakens our economy. Congestion and inefficiencies in our \ntransportation network limit our ability to get goods to market. They \nexacerbate the divide between urban and rural America, they constrain \neconomic development and competitiveness, and they reduce productivity \nas workers idle in traffic.\n  Americans spend a collective 4.2 billion hours a year stuck in \ntraffic--4.2 billion hours a year, at the cost to the economy of $78.2 \nbillion or $710 per motorist. So I ask the House of Representatives: \nHow can you look at those numbers and decide not to move forward with a \nbill that streamlines our programs, that actually makes some smart \ndecisions in terms of reform, and that actually puts the money out \nthere that we need to build our bridges and build our roads? It is \nsimply time to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe period for debate only on S. 3240 be extended until 5 p.m., and \nthat the majority leader be recognized at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, as I was heading to the \nCapitol today, I could not help but think about the jolting news from \nmy State that the U.S. Department of Justice will have to sue my State \nof Florida over its purge of the voting rolls.\n  Being a native Floridian whose family came to Florida 183 years ago, \nand having the great privilege of serving the people of my State for a \nnumber of years, it is simply hard for me to conceive that the State of \nFlorida is trying to deliberately make it more difficult for lawful \ncitizens to vote.\n  But the Governor did sign a new law that the legislature passed over \na year ago to reduce early voting days, to make it more difficult to \nvote if you move to another county, to blunt registration drives, and \nto eliminate the Sunday before the Tuesday election in early voting. \nAnd then Governor Scott launched his massive purge of the voting rolls, \nhunting for suspected noncitizens.\n  In so doing, he is now defying Federal authorities, who point to \nFederal law and say you cannot conduct a purge of voter rolls so close \nto an election. We are 2 months away from a primary election in the \nmiddle of August. We are a little over 4 months away from the general \nelection. Yet the Governor and his administration end up doing this. \nWhat they ought to do is ensure the credibility of our voter rolls, not \nsuppress citizens from voting under the fiction of some perceived \nfraud.\n  But above all else, the State of Florida must ensure that every \nlawful citizen who has the right to vote can do so without hindrance \nand impediment.\n  It was quite a while ago, but something Dr. King once said about \nvoting rights seems very appropriate again. Dr. King said:\n\n       The denial of this sacred right is a tragic betrayal of the \n     highest mandates of our democratic traditions. It is \n     democracy turned upside down.\n\n  I hope the Governor of Florida will heed those words.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nto speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I rise to speak about \nthe Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, which is a landmark piece of \nlegislation, one that I believe has saved many lives and brought us \ntogether as Americans in standing up for what we believe is right. With \nthis law, we have said that the United States takes domestic violence \nvery seriously and we are taking a moral stance against it now.\n  In April of this year, I was proud to join a strong bipartisan group \nof Senators in passing S. 1925, the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nAct reauthorization. Sixty-eight Senators from this Chamber supported \nthe bill.\n  Many of us were moved by the personal stories coming out of our \nStates about the critical impact of VAWA in local communities. In \nMassachusetts, I was inspired by the work of organizations such as Jane \nDoe, Inc., the North Shore Rape Crisis Center, the YWCA of Central \nMassachusetts, and REACH Beyond Abuse, to name a few, and there are \nmany more. In March of this year, I visited service providers in \ncentral Massachusetts that receive VAWA funding and learned a great \ndeal more about how VAWA is changing lives for the better.\n  New problems are plaguing our communities, and as times change \ngovernment must adapt as well if it is going to make a difference in \npeople's lives. Fortunately, the Senate bill includes many improvements \nthat have been developed over time with various nonprofits in law \nenforcement agencies and individuals who deal with these challenges \neach and every day. I am very proud to be a cosponsor of what is \nclearly a good, thoughtful bill.\n  Unfortunately, following the bipartisan Senate action, the House \npassed a dramatically scaled-back version of the VAWA legislation that \ndid not include core provisions that would improve the law. It seems \nthat rather than work through some of these problems, the House was \ncontent to pass a bill that didn't address a number of growing problems \nfacing individuals today. That is not how we legislate or how we should \nbe legislating. We need to pass a bipartisan, bicameral bill that the \nPresident will sign.\n  Because the House took up a bill that didn't go far enough, the House \nbill passed largely along party lines, as compared to the bipartisan \nSenate bill we passed a short time ago. Now, once again, the House and \nSenate are at an impasse.\n  As someone who has personally experienced domestic violence up close \nand seen its effect on families, including mine, this is completely \nunacceptable.\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n\nThe vast majority of the bill is broadly supported by both sides of the \naisle. It is beyond frustrating that the House has become distracted by \na tiny percentage of the bill that has caused gridlock. Even worse, it \nseems that some are willing to allow procedural technicalities to block \nthe way forward. I have to tell you that this makes no sense to me, at \na time when people's lives are potentially at stake. This bill should \nbe done already. Women in Massachusetts and throughout the country--\nsurvivors of violence--deserve better, and we should provide that \nleadership immediately.\n\n  Today I am calling on the House and Senate leadership and the \ncommittees of jurisdiction to listen to the calls from millions of \nAmericans and come together and pass a bill that addresses critical \nneeds in our communities and the citizens of those communities. All \nsides need to come together and work through the small amount of \ndifference they have. As I have said before, in my experience, when \npeople of good will work together and do one good deed, it begets other \ngood deeds, and so on. We can get together in a room and work through \nthese challenges and come up with solutions. I frequently hear from \nmany colleagues that this is the way things used to be done around \nhere. I yearn and work every single day I am here to get back to that \nway of bipartisanship and spirit of working together. I hope we can get \nsome of that bipartisan, bicameral spirit back and pass the Violence \nAgainst Women Act reauthorization.\n  In closing, we need to start to look out for the people's interests, \nnot our political and personal interests or the parties' interests but \nthe interests of the people. We need bridge builders in this Chamber to \nget this bill across the finish line and on the President's desk. The \nchallenges we face in reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act are \nnot insurmountable; far from it. We know that. I am confident if the \nHouse and Senate leadership come together and work out our differences, \nwe can pass a bill we can all be proud of and send it to the \nPresident's desk and save lives.\n  Let's put politics aside and focus on solving problems. Remember, we \nare not just Democrats, Republicans, or Independents, we are Americans \nfirst. We need to start to work in that vein to get things done.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I know this week we are talking about, \namong other things, the Agriculture bill, and I am supportive of moving \nforward with that bill.\n  Like so many other things in our economy, the more certainty we can \ncreate for farming families, for agribusinesses, the more likely they \nare to make decisions now and to make decisions that create good \nresults. The more things we know in advance, normally, in \ndecisionmaking, the more things there are to know.\n  There is plenty people don't know in agriculture. My mom and dad were \ndairy farmers, and there is a lot that can go wrong on the farm. People \ndon't know how many things there might be--weather and lots of other \nthings that they can't count on. It would be nice to have a farm bill \nthat people could count on.\n  I know the bill we pass here will only be half of the work of getting \nthat bill passed, but we need to do that and we need to get our economy \ngoing again. Like so many others, I disagree with the President's sense \nthat the private sector is fine because the private sector is not fine. \nThe economy is not fine. As I have said on this floor many times in the \nlast 2 years, private sector job creation should be the No. 1 priority \ndomestically of the government today: What can we do to create more \nprivate sector jobs.\n  Two years ago, the administration and the White House kicked off the \nRecovery Summer. They said the success of the $831 billion stimulus \nplan had done its job. Secretary Geithner penned an op-ed in the New \nYork Times that said: Welcome to the Recovery. But today we still see \nunemployment higher than it should be, the unemployment rate at 8.2 \npercent.\n  If we were looking at the same workforce we had 30 years ago--and we \nknow the population has gotten bigger, so logically the workforce has \ngotten bigger too. If we were looking at a workforce that was \nreflective of the workforce in January 2009, unemployment would be 11.1 \npercent today. It is 8.2 percent because we are considering a workforce \nthat is smaller. The number of people who are actively out there \nconsidering themselves either in the workforce or wanting to be in the \nworkforce is lower than any time in the last 30 years.\n  Certainly, the Recovery Summer didn't work. The rhetoric was high, \nbut the economy didn't grow as we would have hoped it would. The \ncreation of jobs didn't occur. GDP, the gross domestic product, grew at \n1.7 percent in 2011, and it is still below 2 percent--1.9 percent--in \n2012. Only 77,000 jobs were created in April, and only 69,000 jobs were \ncreated in May.\n  We are just not doing the job here. The stimulus didn't work. Part of \nthe stimulus was to try to help States offset the shortages they had. \nBut to some extent all that did was postpone for another year or maybe \neven 2 years States having to make decisions that only States should \nmake. The Federal Government has enough things to run without trying to \nrun everything. The Federal Government shouldn't be responsible for the \nthings States are responsible for, and we should do the things we do at \nthe Federal level the best they can possibly be done, starting with \ndefending the country.\n  We are looking at some reduction in defense spending that, if it \nhappens, will not only negatively impact our ability to defend the \ncountry, if we don't do those reductions exactly right, it will also \nhave real impact on the economy.\n  The stimulus didn't create the jobs. The labor force participation \nrates are at a 30-year low. Middle-class incomes have dropped $4,350 in \nthe last 3 years. The private sector is not doing well, nor is the \neconomy doing well. The number of long-term unemployed has doubled to \n5.5 million since the President took office. Housing prices continue to \ndecline.\n  Many of the economic forecasters, including the Congressional Budget \nOffice, project that economic growth downgrades and skepticism toward \nthe recovery will continue. The Congressional Budget Office recently \nreleased a dismal long-term budget outlook showing that the country's \nFederal debt per person is on track to triple in a generation. That \ntrack has to stop. We can make the decision: Do we want to be Europe? \nDo we want to be Greece? Do we want to be Italy? Do we want to be \nIreland or Portugal or Spain? All we have to do is pick up a paper any \nday of the week now to know surely that is not who we want to be. Or do \nwe want to get our government rightsized for our economy? Do we want to \nget back to where we don't let our economy be overwhelmed by the \ngovernment?\n  What has happened in so many of the countries I just mentioned and \nothers in Europe is that they have let the government get bigger than \nthe economy can support.\n  The CBO talked about what would happen if we don't take this action \nbetween now and early next year: If we let taxes go back up, if we let \ndefense spending go in the direction that it appears to be heading, \nwhat happens then?\n  Even President Clinton and former domestic adviser to then-Secretary \nof the Treasury Summers said we need to continue current tax policies \nfor some time in the future. I remember at the end of 2010, the \nPresident said: Now is not the time to discourage jobs. Well, exactly \nwhen would be the time to discourage jobs?\n  The job of the Federal Government domestically should be to figure \nout what we can do to encourage jobs because with only the rarest of \nrare occasions the Federal Government, with few exceptions, doesn't \ncreate jobs. The Federal Government, however, has a lot to say about \nthe environment in which people make that decision as to whether they \nare going to create a job. With constant discussion of energy policies \nthat don't make sense and too much regulation and raising taxes and\n\n[[Page S3960]]\n\nhealth care costs that are unknown for every job that is added, people \njust don't add those jobs.\n  So whether it is the agriculture economy--which, again, I will say, \neven though the unemployment there is twice as high as government \nsector unemployment, the agriculture economy is almost twice as high as \nthe 4.2 percent of government sector unemployment. It is still a bright \nspot in the current economy. But that economy will be better if we give \npeople more of a chance to plan.\n  The Recovery Summer didn't work. We will soon know what the court has \nto say about the affordable health care act. But we only have to talk \nto a few job creators, and not for very long, to know that the \naffordable health care act is standing in the way of job creation just \nas are regulations. The EPA keeps regulating.\n  The shortest path to more American jobs would be more American \nenergy. We have energy resources in greater abundance than we believe \nwe had just a few years ago, oil shale and gas shale. We should produce \nmore of our own energy that would allow us to make things again. And \nwhat we can't produce, if we can buy it from our closest neighbors and \nour dependable friends, we should do that. There is nothing wrong with \nbuying from people who don't like us. But it is crazy to have to buy \nfrom people who don't like us, particularly if we can buy from people \nwho like us.\n\n  When we send $1 to our neighbors in Canada, they send almost $1 back \nevery single time. The likelihood that Canadians will decide they don't \nwant to sell us oil or gas is virtually zero. We can't say that about \nevery country we have gotten too dependent on in recent years.\n  So let's do the right thing. Let's have a true path to recovery. \nLet's have good energy policy. Let's have good tax policy. Let's have \ngood regulatory policy. And let's see if we can't get the private \nsector the kind of priority in job creation it needs. Of course, that \nincludes one of the brightest lights in the private sector, which is \nfarming families and the agriculture economy and our ability to compete \nin a world because of the great job we do in agriculture.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized out of turn, and I will cease when Senator Blumenthal shows \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I come from the farm State of Oklahoma. \nThe biggest threat to the future of farmers is burdensome and costly \nregulations.\n  I have three amendments. The amendments I am proposing will provide \nsignificant regulatory relief for farmers struggling in a tough \neconomy.\n  There is virtually no history of oilspills from agricultural \noperations, and farms simply do not pose the risk of the spills other \nsectors do. Starting next year, farmers who have oil and gas tanks--\nthat is all of them. They all have oil and gas tanks on their farms. \nThey are located in different areas, but if they have a certain \naggregate amount, they will be required to hire a certified \nprofessional engineer to design a spill prevention control and \ncountermeasure plan just like major oil refineries. They may also be \nrequired to purchase new capital equipment to comply with the rule, \nincluding dual containment tanks on farm trucks and fuel storage units \nthat will necessarily raise the cost.\n  My amendment would exempt farmers from these regulations for above-\nground oil storage tanks that have an aggregate storage capacity of \nless than 12,000 gallons.\n  I know a small wheat farmer in northwest Oklahoma by the name of \nKeith Kisling. He is one of the only farmers who took the time to \nactually comply with the SPCC regulation. Those are spill regulations. \nMost people didn't even try to comply.\n  First, he had to fill out over 80 pages of paperwork he did not \nunderstand. He hired an online service to help him comply, which cost \nhim money and didn't make his job much easier. He must keep a copy of \nthis plan on his property at all times in case he is inspected. If he \nhad older tanks, the rules would require him to purchase new double-\nwalled tanks that are incredibly expensive. In addition, he now has to \nbuild a berm around his tanks to hold 18,000 gallons of fuel in case it \ndoes leak. This will be very expensive and time consuming. He also must \ninstall a liner underneath the tanks and at the bottom of the berm to \ncontain any leaks. He reports that the rules are extremely confusing \nand the regulations just don't make any sense, given the fact that \nfarmers would not let leaks go unnoticed because diesel fuel is too \nexpensive.\n  In addition to providing this exemption, it will also allow farmers \nwho are regulated to self-certify instead of going to the expense of \nhiring engineers to do that for them. I am hoping my colleagues will \nlook at this as a regulation that is not needed and accept my \namendment.\n  I have a second amendment having to do with storm water. One of the \nbiggest threats is the overburdensome and costly regulation. But one of \nthe best ways to stop these rules is to ensure that when an agency \nstates they will collect the best available information before imposing \na new regulation, that they do that.\n  This amendment will ensure that the EPA keeps its word and fully \nevaluates a current storm water regulatory situation--what practices \nwork and what don't work, what the costs are and what the benefits \nare--before barreling ahead with new uncertain regulations.\n  In EPA's current storm water regulations, they committed to complete \nan evaluation of the current rule. This amendment simply stops the EPA \nfrom issuing any new regulations until they comply with the rules. In \nother words, they have said they would do this. This stops them from \ninvoking a regulation and completing it until they have completed what \nthey have already agreed to.\n  Rest assured this is nothing new to the EPA. In fact, in the EPA \nguidance that accompanies the current regulations, they recommended the \nsame thing: that until the evaluation of the current program is \ncompleted, no new requirements be imposed, especially for small \ncommunities.\n  So all my amendment does is force the EPA to do what they have \nalready agreed they would do, and that should be a fairly easy one to \npass.\n  Madam President, I see the Senator from Connecticut has arrived, and \nso I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am here today to speak about a \nbipartisan amendment I have offered to the farm bill. It is an \namendment that incorporates a bill I offered, the Animal Fighting \nSpectator Prohibition Act, and is cosponsored by Senators Kirk, \nCantwell, Brown of Massachusetts, Wyden, and Landrieu. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Kerry be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, commonly in advocating or \nintroducing bills, Senators will have photographs or digital aids, and \nI thought about doing that today, but then realized that the \nphotographs appropriate for this bill are of mangled, cruelly torn \nanimals that have died in the midst of torture from a blood sport that \nhas no place in any of our American towns or cities or countrysides. \nThis blood sport involves animal fighting. This activity is not only \ncruel and inhumane, it is also a sport that fosters, promotes, and \nencourages illegal activity, including drug dealing, gangs, and \ngambling. It is a source of the worst instincts. It encourages the \nworst in the human condition and the worst in the individuals who \nparticipate and come to watch it.\n  Congress has recognized this fact in the past, as recently as 2007, \nby upgrading the Federal law against animal fighting. It is prohibited, \nand the act of 2007 made the interstate transport of fighting animals, \nor cockfighting tools, a Federal felony.\n  In 2008, in the wake of the Michael Vick case, Congress again \nimproved the\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\nlaw, making possession and training of fighting animals a felony and \nenhancing the upper limits of jail time for anyone engaged and \nconvicted of it, so the Federal law now is very comprehensive and very \npowerful. It prohibits exhibiting, buying, possessing, training, and \ntransporting an animal for participation in a fighting activity. It is \ncomprehensive and powerful except for one loophole, and that is the one \nI propose to cover through this amendment to the farm bill.\n  This legislation would prohibit knowingly attending an animal fight \nby setting penalties that include a fine or imprisonment of up to 1 \nyear or both. It would also extend stricter penalties for any \nindividual who knowingly brings a child to an animal fight, and the \npenalty for engaging in that activity would be a fine and prison \nsentence of up to 3 years or both. So the loophole here is that \nspectators are not covered and bringing children to these events is not \ncovered, and that is why this legislation is absolutely essential.\n  Why spectators? Well, spectators are commonly participants. In fact, \nthe sport would not exist without spectators. They are the ones who \ngamble, engage in other criminal activity, and who go there simply to \nengage in that activity. They are there not only to watch but to bring \ntheir own animals to fight or to gamble illegally or for drug dealing \nillegally or gang activity illegally. Spectators are the source of \nfinancing, and they make it profitable. They must be subject to Federal \nlaw and Federal prohibitions in the same way as anyone who actually \nengages in already prohibited activity. This type of criminal element--\ngathering of dogfights or cockfights--ought to be subject to the same \nkinds of prohibition.\n  Why children? Well, without stating the obvious, coming to a \ncockfight or a dogfight, which is a blood sport, leads to other kinds \nof violence. I don't need to cite the scientific evidence for anyone \nwho is a parent and a Member of this body. Right now there is no law \nthat applies to bringing children to such an event, and we need to \nclose that loophole.\n  Again, if I had photographs here, one would be of a small girl \nliterally crying at the sight of one of these animals mangled and \ncruelly torn apart before death.\n  This bill would in no way apply to innocent bystanders because it \nwould require proof that the person is aware they are at such an animal \nfight. It would not intrude on States rights. In fact, 49 States \nalready have similar laws. We need a Federal law because many of these \nactivities are in interstate commerce and the power of the Federal \nGovernment as an enforcer is irreplaceable. The Federal Government \nought to be on record against the crimes involved that are committed by \nspectators and against bringing children to this kind of event.\n  When animal fighting involves players from a number of different \nStates, a county sheriff or a local law enforcer simply lacks the power \nto deal with it and to root out the entire operation--not just to make \narrests at the site but to root out the whole operation so that the \npenalties are more comprehensive and the organized criminal activity is \nended. These crimes are a Federal matter and the Federal response ought \nto be overwhelming. In the Michael Vick case, as an example, the local \nCommonwealth attorney refused to take action and Federal authorities \nhad to prosecute this case.\n  This measure has law enforcement endorsements not only from sheriffs \nbut from others who care about this problem, such as the Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers Association and the Fraternal Order of Police. It \nis supported as well by the American Veterinary Medical Association and \nthe Humane Society of the United States, which has been a strong \npartner in this effort and does so much great work to protect animals \nin this country and around the world. My thanks to the Humane Society \nfor its courageous leadership in this area.\n  It would be no cost to the Federal Government, to answer a question \nthat is always raised. The Congressional Budget Office has scored this \nlegislation and found it has zero cost to the Federal Government. So \nlet me say the legislation is bipartisan, it is commonsense, it is \nhumane, it is right, and it will cost zero dollars to close this last \nremaining loophole, this last remaining refuge for a blood sport that \nhas no place in a civilized society. It gives Federal law enforcers the \ntools they badly need to stop it, and I urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nperiod for debate only on S. 3240 be extended until 5:30 p.m., and that \nthe majority leader be recognized at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a Stabenow-\nRoberts perfecting amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the \nbill, as amended, be considered original text for the purpose of \nfurther amendment; that the following Lee motion to recommit and four \namendments be the first amendments and motion to recommit in order to \nthe bill with no other first-degree amendments or motions to recommit \nin order until these amendments and motion are disposed of: Paul No. \n2182, Shaheen No. 2160, Coburn No. 2353, Cantwell No. 2370, and Lee \nmotion to recommit; that there be up to 60 minutes of debate equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees on each of these \namendments and the Lee motion; that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime on all four amendments and the Lee motion, the Senate proceed to \nvotes in relation to the amendments and motion in the order listed; \nthat there be no amendments or motions in order to the amendments or \nthe Lee motion--which is the motion to recommit--prior to the votes \nother than motions to waive points of order and motions to table; that \nupon disposition of these amendments and the Lee motion, I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I am very \nconcerned about Dr. Shakil Afridi. He is a doctor in Pakistan who got \ninformation that helped us and led to the capture of bin Laden. He is \nnow being held in prison. He has been put in prison in Pakistan for 33 \nyears. I don't think we should continue to send U.S. taxpayer money in \nthe form of foreign aid to Pakistan when they are holding in prison a \ndoctor who simply helped us to get bin Laden.\n  This issue is of the utmost urgency. His case will be heard for an \nappeal. It is a political case. It can be influenced by U.S. actions. I \nthink the U.S. taxpayers should not send money to Pakistan when \nPakistan is holding this innocent man who helped us get one of the \nworld's most dangerous men, a mass murderer who killed 3,000 Americans. \nWe captured him with help from Dr. Shakil Afridi, and Dr. Afridi \ndeserves our help now.\n  I have an amendment that is very important. It is not germane. But \nthat does not mean it is not important. It is very important that we \nsend Pakistan a signal that we will not continue to send them a welfare \ncheck when they are holding in prison a political prisoner who helped \nus get bin Laden. This amendment is of the utmost urgency and would \nonly require 15 minutes of the Senate's time. I am not asking for all \nday. I am asking for 15 minutes to vote on ending aid to Pakistan until \nthey release Dr. Afridi.\n  I do not think this is too much to ask. The Senate has historically \nbeen a body that allowed debate, that allowed amendments, pertinent or \nnot pertinent. This one is very important. Time\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\nis of the essence for Dr. Afridi. It is the least we can do for someone \nwho helped us to get bin Laden. I ask that we allow time for this \namendment to occur. I object to the unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate the good intentions of my \nfriend from Kentucky because they are good intentions. But we are on a \nbill now that just simply does not allow something like that to come \nforward. I would like to work with him in the future--I am sure a \nnumber of other Senators would--to focus on our relations with \nPakistan.\n  It is not only the problem he outlined, but there are other things--\nthe ability of our vehicles to drive to Afghanistan and lots of other \nthings. It is an issue on which the Foreign Relations Committee has \nheld hearings. It is something on which we need to focus, and I would \nalso indicate to my friend that Senator Leahy, who has been a protector \nof human rights for his entire career, is the chairman of the State-\nForeign Operations Subcommittee. He is also concerned about this.\n  So I would say to my friend that he does not stand alone in his \nconcern. But there has to be a time and place for everything. \nHopefully, we can have a full debate on our relations with Pakistan in \nthe near future.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2389\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on behalf of the managers, I call up \namendment No. 2389, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 250, \nS. 1940.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 250, S. 1940, a bill to \n     amend the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, to restore \n     the financial solvency of the flood insurance fund, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have managed a few bills during my time \nhere, quite a few bills. It is always so gratifying, after the work \nthat goes into the work you have done on a committee or a subcommittee, \nto have that matter come to the floor. It is a terrible disappointment \nto not be able to move forward as you anticipated.\n  So I say that for Senator Stabenow and Senator Roberts. No one has \nworked harder than they have in bringing the bill to the floor. It is \nbipartisan. It is important not only for the State of Michigan, the \nState of Kansas, but it is important for the country.\n  I wish we could proceed in another way to have amendments heard and \nvoted on. But even though this is something awkward, we are going to \nmove forward with this bill. We are going to bring up some amendments. \nThey are big amendments. They are crucial to Senators being able to \nissue their opinions on this legislation. One deals with sugar, one \ndeals with food stamps, both very controversial and very important.\n  We are going to have those amendments, and, hopefully, we will have a \ngood debate on those matters. We can move forward on this bill in other \nways. I have not given up hope. I know Senator Stabenow and Senator \nRoberts have not given up hope to have a universal agreement so we can \nlegislate on this bill.\n  As I have indicated, we do not do this very often in this manner. But \nit is important because we have an issue that needs to move forward. A \nlot of times when the tree is filled we just walk away from it. We are \nnot going to walk away from this. This bill is far too important. It \naffects the lives of millions of people--about 16 million--in America.\n  The reforms have been made in this bill--I remember when I came from \nthe House of Representatives 26 years ago, we wanted to make the \nreforms that are in this bill. So they have done remarkably good work. \nWe hear everyone, Democrats and Republicans, talking about: Let's do \nsomething about the debt and the deficit. Here we have done it.\n  What they have done is bring to this body a bill that reduces our \ndebt by $23 billion. We have a long ways we need to go beyond that. \nBut, gee whiz, this is a big deal, $23 billion. So I commend and \napplaud the two managers of this bill. They are fine Senators. They \nhave done a service to our country by getting us to the point we are \nnow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first I want to thank our leader for \nhis strong support and helping us bring this to the floor. We would not \nbe here without the Senator from Nevada, our leader. Frankly, there are \nmany demands, many things on his plate and our plate in the Senate. He \nunderstands 16 million jobs are affected by what happens in agriculture \nin this country. So I thank Senator Reid for his willingness to support \nus and continue to support us as we move forward to get this bill done.\n  I also want to thank my partner and my ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Kansas, for his continued leadership as we move the bill forward. \nWe would have liked to have begun the unanimous consent agreement to \nmove forward on six different amendments, not the universe of \namendments. Certainly, anyone could come down and say: Why isn't my \namendment part of the first six?\n  We wanted to get started as we worked with colleagues to bring up \nother amendments. So we have put forward something that involves, first \nof all, a technical amendment we need to do for the bill, a perfecting \namendment, and then two Democratic colleagues' amendments and three \nRepublican colleagues' amendments, including the Senator from Kentucky \nwho just entered the objection, an important debate that involves an \namendment he is involved in.\n  So our first step was to try to do this around unanimous consent. But \nunderstanding that we do have an objection, Senator Reid has offered us \nanother path to do this by creating a way for us to at least have the \ndebate on two of the issues we had put forward in the six amendments \nbefore us.\n  One involves the Sugar Program for our country, and we have a number \nof Members who have different amendments. We have one that will be in \nfront of us. It is an opportunity for everyone to say their piece. I \ncan tell you as someone who represents a lot of sugar beets that I care \nvery deeply about this issue and certainly support the Sugar Program. \nBut it is an important debate to have, and Members deserve to be heard \non all sides.\n  The other relates to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. \nMany Members have feelings on all sides about this, and so we think it \nis an important debate to have to give people an opportunity to give \ntheir opinions.\n  I certainly, as this goes forward tomorrow, will be doing that myself \nand certainly feel very strongly that what we have done in the bill on \naccountability and transparency to make sure every dollar goes for \nfamilies who need it is very important. But we want Members to have an \nopportunity to be able to debate what is important policy for our \ncountry.\n  As we are moving forward on both of these amendments tomorrow, we \nwill also be working, our staffs and ourselves, to come together on a \nlarger package, a universe of amendments to offer to the body of the \nSenate to be able to move forward so we can come up with a finite \nnumber of amendments that will allow us to complete the bill.\n  Many amendments have been offered. We are going to spend our time \ngoing through those just as we did in committee where we worked across \nthe aisle. We had 100 amendments and whittled that down to a point \nwhere we could come forward with agreed-upon amendments. We are going \nto do the same thing. We are going to put together a universe of \namendments to move forward on the bill.\n  But while we are doing that, we will have an opportunity--we invite \nMembers who care particularly about either of the issues that will be \nvoted on tomorrow--the leader will move forward with a motion to table \non those, but we want everyone to have an opportunity to come to the \nfloor and be able to be heard on both of those issues.\n\n  So we are moving forward. We would have liked to have done it with a \nlarger group of amendments that we could have started with while we \ncontinue through. Our goal is to allow as much opportunity for \ndiscussion and debate as possible. But, frankly, I have to say, before \nyielding to my friend from Kansas, our goal ultimately is to pass this \nbill.\n  I mean we have 16 million people who are counting on moving forward \nwanting certainty. Our farmers and ranchers want to know what is coming \nfor them as they are in the planting season, going into harvest season \nin the fall. They need economic certainty. We need to make sure we have \na policy going forward that makes sense and is put in place before \nSeptember 30 of this year when these policies run out and very serious \nramifications to the budget take place.\n  Frankly, I think all of us have said at one time or another that we \nwant to\n\n[[Page S3965]]\n\nsee deficit reduction. I do not know of another bill that has come \nbefore this body with $23 billion in deficit reduction, bipartisan, and \na number that was agreed to in the fall with the House and the Senate.\n  We have an opportunity to tell the people we represent in the country \nthat we meant it when we said deficit reduction. We meant it when we \nsaid reform. We meant it when we said we were going to work together to \nget things done. We have been doing that with a wonderful bipartisan \nvote in committee, with a very strong vote to proceed to this bill last \nweek, and we know the hard part is getting through it and coming up \nwith the list of amendments we intend to do.\n  We are asking for our colleagues to work with us on behalf of the \npeople of this country who have the safest, most affordable food supply \nin the world because of a group of folks called farmers and ranchers \nwho have the biggest risk in the country and go out every day to work \nhard to make sure we have the national security and the food security \nwe need for our country.\n  They are looking to us to get this done, along with children and \nfamilies across this country. We will do that. We will begin that \nprocess between now and tomorrow with a debate on two important issues.\n  I see my distinguished colleague and friend here, the ranking member. \nI also thank another distinguished colleague, the Senator from Iowa, \nwho has made very significant contributions in this legislation on \nreforms--reforms he has been fighting for for years. We have stepped up \nto back him up and support him. We need to get this done--these \nreforms--and get this bill done. We are going to work hard to make sure \nwe do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, this isn't exactly the trail I had \nhoped we would take to get to a successful conclusion on a farm bill \nthat we need so vitally in farm country, for all the reasons that the \ndistinguished chairwoman has outlined. I need not go over all of those \nreasons. I will mention that we have a September 30 deadline in which \nthe current farm bill expires. The alternative is to go back to the \ncurrent farm bill, which we know is outdated, and it has a payment \nsystem that is also outdated.\n  The other alternative, if you don't extend the farm bill, is you go \nto the 1949 act, which is not sustainable. It is not really an \nalternative. I had hoped we could start considering this. We had three \nRepublican amendments, two Democratic amendments, and also the \nperfecting amendment. But that is not the trail we are going to go \ndown.\n  Basically, I think about the only thing I can add is that we are not \ngiving up. We can't. We will keep working as hard as we can to \naccommodate all Members. I know there is a lot of talk on both sides of \nthe aisle about a global agreement. That seems to be a little bit of an \nexaggeration, more especially for this body. At any rate, that \nagreement would encompass every Members' concern at least, and we would \ngo back to what the Senate used to be and have everybody offer \namendments and debate them and then vote and have a conclusion. That is \nexactly what we did when we marked up the bill with over 100 amendments \nin 4\\1/2\\ hours. That was a record. That is not what we are going to do \nas of tomorrow. At least there is some degree of movement.\n  I know the Senator from Iowa has several amendments that are \nextremely important to the future of agriculture program policy. I \ncommend him for his leadership in the past and for being such a \nsuccessful partner in working things out not only for his State but for \nthe country.\n  We will persevere and we will get this done. I guess we are like John \nPaul Jones--we have just begun to fight.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I know my colleague from New Hampshire \nwishes to speak, but for the purpose of Members' understanding, I would \nlike to let everyone know what is happening now.\n  We do have two amendments that will be voted on tomorrow morning. The \nmajority leader has at his disposal the ability to have a motion to \ntable, which he will exercise in the morning. But we want anyone \ninterested in either of these two topics or amendments to come forward \nwith the opportunity to debate tonight. Senator Shaheen has an \namendment that I know is very important to her and many other Members, \nand we want everyone to have the opportunity this evening to do that.\n  There will be a vote. I am not sure of the time exactly, but I would \nthink at this point it will be in the morning. So we want those who are \ninterested in debating the Sugar Program or debating the question of \nwhether to block grant the nutrition program, the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, to come forward to discuss and \ndebate that this evening. There may be some time in the morning, but we \nwill be moving forward on both of these amendments. So we want to let \nthem know that if these are topics they are interested in, we would \ncertainly welcome them coming to the floor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stabenow, who has done \nsuch a great job of chairing the Agriculture Committee. She and Ranking \nMember Roberts really have done amazing work to bring this bill to the \nfloor. It is bipartisan, and it is legislation that makes some \nsignificant reforms in the farm programs we have had.\n  In New Hampshire, many of the programs that are authorized in the \nfarm bill are critical for our farmers and our rural communities, as \nwell as for the protection of our natural resources. I hope we do have \nsome agreement so that we will be able to actually have a full debate \non this bill in the remainder of this week and in the upcoming week.\n  As I said, this legislation makes much needed reforms to our farm \nprograms, and it helps to reduce the deficit. For all of that terrific \nreform and the work that has been done, Senator Stabenow and Ranking \nMember Roberts deserve real appreciation and thanks from this body.\n  However, there is one glaring exception to the reforms that have been \nmade in the bill; that is, the bill contains no reform to the Sugar \nProgram. The sugar subsidies we provide to farmers in America are \nreally unique because what the Federal Government does is to \nartificially restrict supply and provide a subsidy that keeps prices \nfor sugar in the United States at nearly twice the world average. These \nare high prices that hurt consumers. They hurt businesses. In fact, a \nrecent study found that the program costs Americans $3.5 billion a \nyear.\n  Let me explain how the subsidy works. First, the Federal Government \nsets a floor on sugar prices through guarantees. So they guarantee how \nmuch is going to be paid for the price of sugar. These price floors \nensure that sugar growers and processors will always receive a minimum \nprice for sugar regardless of what happens on the world market. But \nsugar prices have been far higher than the minimum price for years now, \nand that is thanks to some additional, very egregious government \ncontrols on sugar. Under the sugar subsidy program, the Federal \nGovernment tells sugar growers how much they can grow. These \nrestrictions are called marketing allotments, and they limit how much \nsugar is available on the market and restrict the ability of buyers and \nsellers to trade sugar freely. So this is not a market enterprise when \nit comes to sugar in the United States, and no other U.S. crop is \nsubject to these same kinds of government controls. As a result, in the \nUnited States we have severe supply shortages which keep sugar prices \nartificially high.\n  The last component of the subsidy program for sugar is trade \nrestrictions. The Federal Government severely restricts the amount of \nsugar companies can import into the United States. So only about 15 \npercent of sugar in the United States is imported at those lower world \naverage prices.\n  Again, no other crop is subject to the kinds of restrictions and \nprice controls I have just described. The result is a\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\nsubsidy that hurts hundreds of thousands of businesses and consumers \nand only benefits about 4,700 sugar growers. Unfortunately, the farm \nbill before the Senate, while it contains a lot of reforms, contains no \nreforms to this subsidy program.\n  I have introduced several amendments, but the one we are going to be \nvoting on tomorrow is one that would repeal the subsidy so that prices \nare determined by the market instead of government controls.\n  For the past 1\\1/2\\ years, I have been working with our colleague, \nSenator Mark Kirk of Illinois, on bipartisan legislation--the SUGAR \nAct--which would phase out the Sugar Program over several years and \neliminate government control of sugar prices. Unfortunately, Senator \nKirk can't be here tomorrow for this vote because he is continuing his \nrecovery, but I am pleased there is a bipartisan group of our \ncolleagues who have joined in support of this sugar reform. In \nparticular, Senators Lugar, McCain, Durbin, Toomey, Lautenberg, Coats, \nPortman, Feinstein, and my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator \nAyotte, have all joined me in calling for elimination or significant \nreform of the Sugar Program.\n  This is a big concern for us in New Hampshire and other States around \nthe country that actually make candy or other products that rely on \nsugar. In New Hampshire, we are the American home of Lindt chocolates. \nWe also have a number of other small candy companies. As this chart \nshows, American manufacturing companies such as Lindt pay almost twice \nthe world average price for their sugar. In fact, prices have gone up \nconsiderably since Congress passed the last farm bill in 2008.\n  We can see that this blue line at the bottom is the world price of \nraw sugar. This red line is the U.S. price of raw sugar. This green \nline at the top is the U.S. wholesale refined sugar price. So while we \ncan see how much higher that raw sugar price is, we can also see what \nit does to the refined sugar price, and we can see how significantly it \nhas increased since the last farm bill. Again, the sugar subsidy \nprogram is able to keep these prices so high because it distorts the \nmarket.\n  In addition to the minimum prices guaranteed by the government, the \nFederal Government drastically restricts the supply of sugar in the \nUnited States, with only about 15 percent of sugar sold coming from \nabroad--thanks to those import restrictions. The government controls \nhow much each individual sugar processor can sell, and that further \nrestricts supply on the market. Again, the result of these government \ncontrols is to keep the artificially high prices for sugar that are \nreflected on this graph.\n  These high sugar prices hurt job creation. According to the \nDepartment of Commerce, for every one job protected in the sugar \nindustry through this program, we are sacrificing three jobs in \nAmerican manufacturing. A recent study by an agricultural research firm \ncalled Promar suggests that the program--the sugar subsidy, that is--\ncosts 20,000 American jobs each year. In addition, a recent analysis \nthat I referred to earlier found that the program also costs consumers \n$3.5 billion every year in the form of artificially high sugar prices. \nThese really are pretty startling numbers, but I wish to talk about how \nthis subsidy program affects just one of the small businesses in New \nHampshire.\n  We have a company called Granite State Candy Shoppe. It is a small \nfamily-owned candy manufacturing company in Concord, NH, the capital of \nNew Hampshire. Sugar is that company's most important ingredient. Jeff \nBart, who is the owner, tells me that the artificially high cost of \nsugar has forced the company to raise prices on their goods but, more \nimportantly, the subsidy has also prevented the company from hiring new \nworkers as quickly as it would like to. So while Granite State Candy \nShoppe would like to grow and expand, the sugar subsidy is really \nslowing down that expansion because of the high price of sugar. Granite \nState Candy Shoppe is just one of many companies that want to grow but \nare forced to slow down their expansion due to an outdated, unnecessary \ngovernment program that benefits relatively few sugar cane and sugar \nbeet growers nationwide.\n\n  High sugar prices also put American companies at a competitive \ndisadvantage with foreign manufacturers. Since foreign companies can \nget sugar so much cheaper, it is tempting for American companies to \nlook elsewhere to manufacture their candy. In fact, low sugar prices \nare a major selling point for foreign governments encouraging candy \ncompanies to relocate.\n  We just copied this cover of a brochure from Canada. It says:\n\n       Canada--North America's Location of Choice for \n     Confectionary Manufacturers.\n\n  Consider these hard facts. Sugar refiners import the vast majority of \ntheir raw materials at world prices. Canadian sugar users enjoy a \nsignificant advantage--the average price of refined sugar is usually 30 \nto 40 percent lower in Canada than in the United States. Most \nmanufactured products containing sugar are freely traded in the NAFTA \nregion. So we are losing these jobs to Canada and to other places--\n20,000 jobs a year--in businesses that need sugar as a major \ningredient.\n  This outdated program puts American companies at a competitive \ndisadvantage, and it should go. That is why I hope our colleagues, as \nthey are considering this amendment tomorrow morning to repeal the \nSugar Program, will decide to support it. I hope we will not have \nopposition to voting on the amendment from any of our colleagues in the \nSenate.\n  We have had consumer and business groups calling for the repeal of \nthe Sugar Program for years now. The Consumer Federation of America and \nthe National Consumers League have joined business groups such as the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers \nin support of this amendment. These groups support reforming this \nprogram because they recognize that these special interests are hurting \nconsumers and they are hurting American businesses.\n  So I hope all of my colleagues will support this amendment tomorrow. \nHelp us grow small businesses and create those American jobs. Let's \nreform the Sugar Program. It is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I will take a few moments to speak about \nthe two amendments we will be voting on with motions to table tomorrow \nand urge that my colleagues, in fact, do vote to table these \namendments. I appreciate we have colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwho care about both of them, but I ask, in the interest of a strong \nagricultural policy and nutrition policy, that we not support the \namendments that are in front of us. But I do appreciate the fact that \nwe are beginning to talk about issues and amendments. This is very \nimportant.\n  We have many amendments and ideas that Members want to bring up. We \nare going to do our level best, within the framework we have to deal \nwith in terms of procedure, to be able to bring up as many different \ntopics and have as much opportunity for people to debate as possible \nbecause we want to move forward on this very important bill that we all \nknow would reduce the deficit by over $23 billion. It has major \nreforms. Yet it will strengthen agricultural policy--nutrition policy, \nconservation policy--and maintain and support 16 million jobs. That is \nwhy we are here.\n  I wish to take a moment to talk about our American sugar policy. We \ngrow a lot of sugar beets in Michigan. Our first sugar policy goes back \nto 1789 in this country. I don't think either one of us was here. The \nPresiding Officer certainly was not here. Nobody was here. But in 1789 \nwe began the first sugar policy. Our modern policy can be traced back \nto the Sugar Acts of 1934, 1937, and 1948. Sugar is not similar to \nother commodities. Both sugarcane and sugar beets must be processed \nsoon after harvest--which is a key factor for them--using costly \nprocessing machinery.\n  If farmers need to scale back production because of a sudden drop in \nprice,\n\n[[Page S3967]]\n\nthe processing plant shuts down and may never reopen. Because this \nprocessing is so capital intensive, it is imperative we give producers \na stable marketplace so they do not experience a constant boom and \nbust, which is what we would see without the stability of the program \nwe have today.\n  The current U.S. sugar policy has been run at zero cost to taxpayers \nfor the last 10 years. Let me just say this again--zero; zero cost to \nthe American taxpayer for the last 10 years. This policy helps defend \n142,000 American jobs and $20 billion in economic activity every year: \nzero cost, 142,000 jobs, $20 billion in economic activity every year.\n  Two things come to mind. Even with our sugar policy, the United \nStates interestingly is the second largest net importer of sugar behind \nonly Russia. This is important because our policy has been viewed as a \nprotectionist policy. Yet we are still an importer. We import sugar, \nthe second highest only to Russia. What we are talking about is \nallowing a stable marketplace for American producers.\n  The price of sugar for consumers is among the lowest in the developed \nworld. Despite many debates to the contrary, in the European Union \nprices are 30 percent higher than in the United States. When we look at \nthe retail prices for countries such as France, Finland, Japan, Norway, \nand so on, U.S. sugar prices are actually very low. Again, zero cost to \nthe taxpayer, and we are maintaining a stable price for our sugar beet \ngrowers and protection for our sugar beet and sugarcane growers. We are \ncreating jobs and, at the same time, this is where we fall, with the \nblue line being the USA.\n  I know there are colleagues on both sides of the aisle who care about \nthis. I argue our sugar policy is one that makes sense. It has made \nsense for the last 10 years at zero cost. I hope we will vote to \ncontinue to support this policy, which is a very important part to many \nregions of the country, an important part of the bill that is in front \nof us. This policy is supported by a host of corporations, including \nthe American Sugar Alliance, the International Sugar Trade Coalition. \nWe have the support of our country's two largest agricultural trade \norganizations--the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National \nFarmers Union. It has made sense. It has zero cost, and I am hopeful \ncolleagues tomorrow will support continuing this program.\n  Let me talk about another amendment now that goes to a lot of \ndiscussion on the floor and that goes to the nutrition parts, which is \nthe majority of the bill that is in front of us.\n  All across the country the recession has devastated families. \nCertainly, I can speak for Michigan, where we have people who paid \ntaxes all their lives, they have worked very hard, they continue to \nwork very hard, and never thought in their wildest dreams they would \nneed help putting food on their tables for their children. They have \nhad to do that during this recession, in a temporary way, to help them \nget through what, for them, has been an incredibly difficult time.\n  We know the No. 1 way to address that is jobs. We want to make sure, \nin fact, we are creating jobs, supporting the private sector \nentrepreneurial spirit to bring back manufacturing, making things, \ngrowing things, creating jobs. But we also know, as this has been slow \nto turn around for many families, that we have Americans who have \nneeded some temporary help. That is what SNAP, the Supplemental \nNutrition Assistance Program, is all about.\n  The amendment tomorrow that we will be voting on would turn this \nprogram into an entire block grant, making it much less effective in \nresponding to needs--frankly, block granting and then cutting over half \nthe current levels of support and funding needed to maintain help for \nthose who are currently receiving SNAP benefits. Reductions at that \nlevel could exceed the total amount of supplemental nutrition help \nprojected to go to families in 29 of our smallest States and \nterritories over the next 10 years. It is extremely dramatic and makes \nabsolutely no sense. I hope we will join together in rejecting this \napproach.\n  One of the strongest features of the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program is that, in fact, it can respond quickly when we \nhave a recession or economic conditions that warrant it, when we have a \nnationwide recession, when we have a plant closure in a community. We \nhave seen way too many of those, although we are now celebrating the \nfact that we have plants opening and retooling and expanding. But we \nhave gone through some very tough times with plant closures where \nfamilies have needed some temporary help. The important thing about the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is that it is timely, it is \ntargeted, and it is temporary. Approximately half of all of those new \nfamilies who have needed help are getting help for 10 months or less, \nso this is actually a temporary program.\n\n  We have seen over the years that families receiving supplemental \nnutrition assistance are much more likely to be working families. This \nis important. We are talking about working families who are working one \njob or one, two, or three part-time jobs and trying to hold it together \nfor their families while working for minimum wage. By about the second \nor third week of the month, there is no food on the table for the \nchildren. So being able to help families who are working hard every day \nto be able to have that temporary help has been life and death, I would \nsuggest, for many families. This is actually a great American value to \nhave something like this for families who need it.\n  According to the CBO--the Congressional Budget Office--we know the \nnumber of families receiving supplemental nutrition assistance is \nactually going to go down over the next 10 years. It is going to go \ndown because we are seeing the unemployment rate go down, and it tracks \nthe same. In fact, in this bill we build in savings over the life of \nthe farm bill because it is projected that the costs are going to go \ndown--not by some arbitrary cuts but by actually having it go down \nbecause the costs go down. When people go back to work, they don't need \nthe temporary help anymore. There are savings in this bill by the fact \nthat the costs are going down because the unemployment rate is going \ndown, and that is the most significant thing.\n  Turning supplemental nutrition assistance into a block grant won't \nmake the program more efficient or more effective. Instead, we are \nlikely to see States shifting dollars out of SNAP to look at other \nbudget priorities in very tough times. If it is a block grant, they are \nnot required to use it for food to help families. We all know that \nStates are under tremendous pressure on all sides, so it is not even \nclear--it wouldn't be accountable in terms of where those dollars are \ngoing in terms of food assistance.\n  It is also harder to fight fraud and abuse across State lines with \nthis kind of approach. The Department of Agriculture has been working \nhard to accomplish this. We have already reduced trafficking by three-\nquarters, 75 percent, over the last 15 years, and we want to be able to \ncontinue to do that as well.\n  So we know that nutrition assistance is a lifeline to the families \nwho need it, but let me conclude by saying that I also want to make \nsure every single dollar goes to the families who need it. That is why \nthis reform bill, this bill that cuts $23 billion on the deficit, also \nfocuses on waste, fraud, and abuse in the nutrition title because we \nwant to make sure every dollar goes to those families. It is to ensure \nthat every family and every child who needs help receives help, and we \nwant to make sure that not one dollar is abused in that process.\n  So what do we have in the underlying bill? Well, we have had at least \ntwo cases in Michigan where we have had lottery winners who, amazingly, \ncontinue to get food assistance, which is outrageous. We stopped that, \nperiod. Lottery winners would immediately lose assistance. And \nhopefully we wouldn't have to say that, but the way it has been set up, \nwe have to make that very clear. It would end misuse by college \nstudents who are actually able to afford food and are living at home \nwith their parents. Students going to school are not those who would be \nthe focus of getting food assistance help, so we would end the misuse \nby college students. We would cut down on trafficking. We don't want \nfolks taking their food assistance card and getting cash or doing \nsomething else with it that is illegal. We prevent liquor and\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\ntobacco stores from becoming retailers because we want people going \ninto the grocery store or farmers market and being able to get healthy \nfood with their dollars. We also deal with a gap in standards that has \nresulted in overpayment of benefits as it relates to States. So we deal \nwith what has been an effort by some States to go beyond legislative \nintent, and we address that in a very strategic way.\n  The bottom line is that we are making sure we increase the integrity \nin the food assistance program. We increase the integrity and the \naccountability because we want every single dollar to go for help for \nthose families who worked all their lives, paid taxes, and now find \nthemselves in a place where the plant closed or where they lost their \njobs and need some help on a temporary basis to put food on the table.\n  Let me just share one more time where the dollars go in terms of \nchildren and adults. Nearly half of those who are getting help right \nnow are children; 47 percent of those who get food help are children. \nThen we have those who live with children, who are another 24 percent, \nsenior citizens are 8 percent, and disabled people are another 9 \npercent. So the vast majority we are talking about are children, \nfamilies, parents caring for children, the disabled, or seniors.\n  The amendment we will be voting on tomorrow is an extreme amendment \nthat would take away temporary help for families and children who need \nit. Rather than taking that approach, we take the approach of \naccountability. So as we look one more time at accountability, we can \nsee we are tightening all of the areas where there has been abuse. We \nwant every dollar to go where it should go, but at the same time we \ndon't want to forget the children or the families of this country who \nare counting on us.\n  We have several different kinds of programs that relate to disasters \nin the farm bill. We have one called crop insurance where if there is a \nweather disaster or price disaster, we want to be there. We don't want \nany farmer to lose the farm because there are a few days of bad weather \nor some other kind of disaster beyond their control. It is called crop \ninsurance, and we strengthened risk management tools in this bill.\n  Well, there is another kind of disaster assistance in this bill, and \nthat is for families across this country. It is for children, it is for \nseniors, and it is for the disabled. It is called the nutrition title, \nand that is why it is there in case of a family disaster. We have too \nmany middle-class families who are asking for help now. They are \ngrateful, didn't want to ask, and mortified they have to ask, but they \nare in a situation where they need temporary help, and that is why it \nis here.\n  The good news is that with the unemployment rate going down, the \nassistance is going down. The budget will be going down through the \nlife of this farm bill and the costs will be going down because people \nare going back to work. That is the way it should be.\n  I would urge tomorrow that we vote against what I consider to be a \nvery extreme amendment that would cut and block grant the nutrition \nprogram and vote instead to support what we have done to increase the \naccountability and integrity of our food assistance programs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is a great privilege to be here tonight \nwith the senior Senator from Colorado because the topic I come to the \nfloor to talk about tonight is the West. Similar to the Presiding \nOfficer, I have been thinking a lot about our home State of Colorado \nbecause we currently have a terrible wildfire burning just west of Fort \nCollins. Susan and I and the girls went up to Jamestown this weekend--I \nthink I told the Presiding Officer this earlier--and dropped them off \nat camp, and that is far away from where this fire is. It is on the \nother side of Estes Park. But even from there, we could see an \nincredible plume of smoke, and in the 45 minutes or so we were there, I \nwould say the volume of that plume of smoke increased by three-or \nfourfold and we could tell something terrible was going on.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows better than anybody in this Chamber, \nthis devastating fire has destroyed over 100 structures and has \ntragically claimed one life and endangered many others. In fact, as we \nstand in this Chamber tonight, there are many endangered by this fire. \nAt over 43,000 acres and growing, it is the third largest fire in \nColorado's history.\n  Today, I think I can say for both of us, our thoughts go out to the \nfamily who lost a loved one and to the hundreds of firefighters who are \nbravely working on the ground as we are here tonight. We wish them well \nand we wish them success in battling this blaze.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, wildfires are simply part of life in \nthe West. Managing our land to improve resiliency needs to be a focus \nof ours in this Congress. That is why I am pleased, as a member of the \nCommittee on Agriculture, to say the farm bill reauthorizes stewardship \ncontracting, which allows our Federal land management agencies to \nimplement high priority forest management and restoration projects. \nMuch of the Presiding Officer's career has had to do with these \nprograms. I thank him for his support, and I have been pleased to be \nable to carry on his work as a member of the Agriculture Committee. \nThis is a critical tool for initiatives that restore and maintain \nhealthy forest ecosystems and provide local employment. The Presiding \nOfficer, I think, was on the floor maybe yesterday talking about the \nimportance of this to our timber industry in Colorado and across this \ncountry.\n  Another truly western aspect of this bill I would like to focus on \ntonight is conservation and specifically the stewardship of our western \nlandscape. In my travels around Colorado, I have been heartened to see \nover and over farmers and ranchers arm in arm with conservation groups \nand with sportsmen, all in the name of proper stewardship of the land, \nof protecting our open spaces. They all share the recognition that \nkeeping these landscapes in their historical, undeveloped state is an \neconomic driver--as family farms, as working cattle ranches; for \ntourism, for wildlife habitat, and to preserve our rural way of life \nand our rural economies.\n  Every citizen knows the American West is a destination for those \nseeking wide-open spaces--a ``home on the range,'' as they say, a way \nof life that is focused on working the land and the wise stewardship of \nour natural resources. We also know that as we have grown as a country, \nthere has been increasing development pressure on this way of life and \non the landscape. That pressure is exactly why the farm bill's \nconservation title is so vital to people in the West.\n  I serve as chairman of the Conservation Subcommittee of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, and through the dozens--literally dozens--of \nfarm bill listening sessions I have held over the last 18 months, \nfarmers and ranchers were always talking about the importance of \nconservation; conservation of their way of life and conservation of \ntheir land, particularly the use of conservation easements which help \nlandowners voluntarily conserve the farming and ranching heritage of \ntheir land, a heritage that is so important to our State and to the \nentire West.\n  So I wished to spend a few minutes sharing some of the stories \nColoradans have shared with me and, maybe more important than that, \nshowing our colleagues what this looks like. Of course, we live in the \nmost beautiful State of all 50 States, in Colorado. This photo is from \nthe Music Meadows Ranch outside Westcliffe, CO, elevation 9,000 feet. \nOn these beautiful 4,000 acres, Elin Ganschow raises some of the finest \ngrass-fed beef in the country. Thanks to the Grassland Reserve Program, \nElin's ranch now has a permanent conservation easement. So this \nbeautiful land will likely always have someone running cattle on it.\n  This photo I have in the Chamber is from the San Luis Valley, where \nmy predecessor, Ken Salazar, is from. Fifteen different conservation \neasements--finalized by the Colorado\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\nCattlemen's Agricultural Land Trust--protect nearly all of the private \nland over a 20-mile stretch in the valley.\n  The great work of the Cattlemen's Agricultural Land Trust, aided by \nthe programs in the farm bill conservation title before us, is \nprotecting our western way of life in Colorado.\n  This beautiful picture is also from the valley. This is not a movie \nset, by the way. This is how we live our lives in the great State of \nColorado and why these programs have been so important.\n  Finally, I want to share one more Colorado story about preserving our \nState's fruit orchards. Most people do not know this, as I have \ntraveled the country--and I imagine Senators Isakson and Chambliss from \nGeorgia might even be surprised to hear--Colorado is a national leader \nin the production of peaches. This picture is of a peach orchard in \nPalisade.\n  My friends from California might also be interested to know that \nColorado has a burgeoning wine industry as well. In Colorado's Grand \nValley, pictured here, conservation programs have been efficiently \nemployed to protect 14 family farms growing peaches and wine grapes \namong other things.\n  The Federal investments made available to protect these lands have \nnot only ensured they will stay in agricultural production, but the \nresources provided from the Natural Resource Conservation Service, \nNRCS, help these family farms acquire new land to plant and new \nequipment to plant it.\n  Mr. President, as you can see--and as you already know--conservation \nis an integral part of what we are all about in the West. It helps \ndefine who we are. Sometimes people only focus on conserving public \nland in its undeveloped state, and that is an important endeavor in \nColorado and across the West. But private land conservation--the type \naided by the farm bill--is critical for so many reasons: to protect the \nagricultural heritage of the land, and for wildlife habitat: elk, \nbighorn sheep, pheasant, Colorado cutthroat trout--the list goes on and \non--so many of the prized species that are important to our Nation's \nsportsmen and nature lovers.\n  Finding open landscapes and the species that inhabit them are a \nfundamental part of what it is to be in the West. We need to preserve \nthese open spaces. That is what this title does. I strongly support \nthis new conservation title as reported out of the committee on a \nbipartisan vote.\n  I know some would look to amend this bipartisan consensus, to cut \nconservation resources in the name of deficit reduction or to apply it \nto some other purpose. I am the first to say we need to cut our \ndeficit. We need to put the entire budget under a microscope--including \nagriculture--to cut waste and eliminate redundancies. And, by the way, \nwe have.\n  This committee--the Senate Agriculture Committee--under the \nleadership of the chairwoman and the ranking member, is the only \ncommittee I am aware of in this entire Congress--the House or the \nSenate--that has actually come up with a bipartisan consensus on \ndeficit reduction. I thank the ranking member and the chairwoman for \ntheir leadership, for setting a model, an example for the other \ncommittees that are working--or should be working--to get our deficit \nunder control.\n  I might say, $6.4 billion of those cuts do come from conservation, \nnot all of which I like. But we made difficult compromises at the \ncommittee level. We have a more efficient conservation title that won \nsupport from both sides of the aisle, and we ought to move this bill \nforward.\n  I know there has been a little bit of the usual back-and-forth about \namendments that are not necessarily related to the topic at hand, and \nwe have a habit of doing that in the Senate. I hope there can be an \nagreement reached by the leadership so we can move this critically \nimportant bill forward.\n  Again, at a time when so much partisan bickering is going on around \nthis place, to have seen the fine work that was done by this \ncommittee--Republicans and Democrats working together--to strengthen \nthis commodity title, create real deficit reduction, and actually end \ndirect payments to producers--one of the most significant reforms in \nagricultural policy that we have had around this place in decades--it \nwould be a shame--worse than a shame; it would be terrible--to let that \nwork go to waste.\n  With that, Mr. President, the hour is late. I am going to stop so we \ncan close. I thank the Presiding Officer very much and say again what a \nprivilege it was to be able to talk about our home with him in the \nchair.\n  So with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/12/senate-section/article/S3969-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BENNET.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mr. Delford \nMcKnight of Laurel County, KY, for his lifetime of contributions in \nbusiness as well as his many years of public service to the State of \nKentucky. Delford McKnight is the founder of McKnight & Associates, a \nsuccessful industrial construction company that built and renovated \nnumerous structures in Laurel and surrounding counties.\n  Born in 1946, Mr. McKnight grew up on a small family farm 6 miles \nfrom London, KY. He attended Bush Elementary School and Bush High \nSchool, where he gained an interest in agriculture and construction. \nTaking classes in agriculture and woodworking, as well as other college \nprep classes, he earned the title ``Boy Most Likely to Succeed'' from \nhis senior class.\n  After graduating high school, Delford went on to attend the \nUniversity of Kentucky for 1 year before leaving to pursue a career in \nconstruction. In 1964, he married his first wife, Helen Owens McKnight. \nThe couple moved to Lexington, where they ran a local Laundromat and \nmanaged an apartment complex. On the side, Delford also worked for a \nconstruction company. In 1965, the two moved back to their hometown, \nwhere Mr. McKnight took a job with the Hacker Brothers construction \nfirm.\n  Three years later, Delford opened his first construction business, \nMcKnight Construction and Blueprint Company, in London, KY, today known \nas McKnight & Associates. This construction firm is responsible for \nbuilding and renovating many of the buildings in the community, \nincluding the Clay County Vocational School, the Board of Education \nbuilding in Manchester, and the first building of the Laurel Campus of \nSomerset Community College. Along with these, Mr. McKnight also built \nNorth Laurel Middle School, as well as Hunter Hills Elementary School \nand the new Bush Elementary School. In the early 1970s, McKnight & \nAssociates got the contract for the Kentucky Fried Chicken building in \nLondon, and later renovated Sanders Cafe and the Corbin KFC.\n  Aside from his construction work, Mr. McKnight also became involved \nwith several other business ventures. He was the first to bring the \nidea of self-storage units to southeastern Kentucky, opening the first \nself-storage facility there in 1976. He also founded Lee-Mart Rent-to-\nOwn Stores, which later sold to Aaron's, Inc., and he co-founded \nCumberland Valley Office Suppliers, Inc., a retail office supply store. \nAfter becoming involved with the London-Laurel County Tourist \nCommission, Delford developed the idea of the ``World Chicken \nFestival'' in 1989 to highlight Colonel Sanders's cooking worldwide, a \nfestival that is still joyously celebrated to this day.\n  Mr. McKnight has held many leadership positions throughout Kentucky. \nHe is a past secretary of the Laurel County Chamber of Commerce, the \nfirst president of the Southeastern Kentucky Home Builders \nAssociation--from which he received the Time Award, and the current \ndirector of First National Bank & Trust in London, Kentucky. He also \nserved as a\n\n[[Page S3970]]\n\nmember of the Cumberland Private Industry Council, the Cumberland \nValley ADD Board, and the London-Laurel County Tourist Commission. Mr. \nMcKnight serves as a member and chairman of the 13th Regional \nVocational Advisory Council and was a 25-year member on the Corbin Tri-\nCounty Joint Industrial Development Authority. He was also honored by \nthe Laurel County Homecoming Festival for his service to the community \nin 2007.\n  In 1989, Delford completed construction on his ``dream executive \nhome'' in London, Kentucky, and he recently completed the construction \nand landscaping on his second home in Venice, Florida. He has recently \nquietly retired, although he still helps with management decisions \nregarding his investments and business interest. Delford has been \nmarried to Lottie Gail since January 2001 after his first wife, Helen, \ndied of cancer. Delford and Lottie Gail have a combined family of 5 \nchildren and 12 grandchildren.\n  Delford is still an active member of the Laurel community today, \nserving as a deacon and Sunday school teacher at United Baptist Church, \na member of the Laurel County Chamber of Commerce, a member of the \nLaurel County Vocational Advisory Council, and a member of the London-\nLaurel County Tourist Commission.\n  At this time I ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing Mr. Delford McKnight for his many contributions to the \nLaurel County community and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. An article \nfrom the Laurel County-area publication the Sentinel-Echo recently \nhighlighted Mr. McKnight's success and accomplishments. I ask unanimous \nconsent that said article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sentinel-Echo, Apr. 30, 2012]\n\n                  Taking Chances Paid Off for McKnight\n\n                           (By Nita Johnson)\n\n       Variety and challenges could well describe the life of \n     Laurel native Delford McKnight.\n       ``I always like a challenge,'' McKnight said, ``and I like \n     variety.''\n       While his office is testimony to a variety of collectibles \n     and what-nots, so is his life's work.\n       With his roots in carpentry and farming, McKnight graduated \n     from Bush High School and attended the University of \n     Kentucky.\n       ``I went for a year, quit, and got married,'' he said.\n       He and his wife, Helen Owens McKnight, who died from cancer \n     in 2000, ran a Laundromat and managed a rental apartment in \n     Lexington while Delford also worked for a commercial \n     construction company.\n       In 1965, the McKnights returned to their hometown, where \n     Delford landed a job with Hacker Brothers construction firm. \n     Four years later, McKnight and partner Harold McPhetridge \n     launched McKnight and Associates, which has constructed and/\n     or renovated many of the buildings in the county.\n       His first ``big'' job came with the construction of the \n     Clay County Vocational School, then getting the contract to \n     build the Board of Education building in Manchester. He has \n     since overseen the renovation of the first building of the \n     Laurel campus of Somerset Community College, the former \n     Interstate Coal offices on the property now known as College \n     Park. His company built the former administration building, \n     now known as the McDaniel Learning Center. He built North \n     Laurel Middle School, Hunter Hills and the new Bush \n     elementary schools as well as having his hand in school \n     construction in Clay and Perry counties. McKnight and \n     Associates landed the contract for the Eastern Kentucky \n     University site in Clay County and the University of Kentucky \n     site in Harlan.\n       Though he credits his family background of carpentry and \n     farming for sparking his interest in the construction \n     business, he said the shop and vocational agriculture classes \n     in high school solidified his choice of careers.\n       ``I was raised on a farm and I think I could have been a \n     farmer just as easily as I could do construction,'' he said. \n     ``But I knew more about commercial construction than about \n     building houses, so that's what I pursued. I took college \n     prep classes in high school but I've utilized the skills in \n     agriculture and shop classes more than any college prep class \n     I had.''\n       A big believer in education, McKnight encourages students \n     to pursue a field they enjoy and to bask in the opportunities \n     they receive through their education and training courses.\n       ``Get as much education as you possibly can, whether it's \n     job training or vocational training or whatever you're \n     interested in,'' he continued. ``You always need to continue \n     to learn. Find something you like to do and pursue it.''\n       McKnight's career choice also led to his involvement with \n     community activities. In the early 1970s, his firm landed the \n     contract for the Kentucky Fried Chicken building in London. \n     Later on, he was involved in the renovation of Harland \n     Sanders's first restaurant--Sanders Cafe and the Corbin KFC. \n     He also built the London-Laurel County Tourism office and \n     became familiar with board members for that organization. \n     When he kept hearing about increasing tourism in Kentucky \n     through festivals, it was he who approached then-tourism \n     director Ken Harvey and long-time board member Caner Cornett \n     with the idea of the World Chicken Festival that highlighted \n     Sanders's achievements worldwide.\n       But being one of the ``firsts'' involved in the highly \n     ranked fall festival is just one more of McKnight's \n     ``firsts.''\n       While a student at UK in 1963, McKnight was one of those \n     freshmen who challenged the football team to a snowball fight \n     that has now become a tradition. Though he does not to this \n     day recommend anyone challenge a UK football player in any \n     form of physical challenge, he still laughs about the \n     experience.\n       He was the sole sixth-grade student at the one-room Langnau \n     School before having to attend Bush Elementary the following \n     year as one of 20 other seventh-grade students.\n       He was the first to bring the idea of storage buildings to \n     London--a challenge for both his crews as well as a business \n     venture.\n       ``I kept seeing these storage buildings in bigger towns and \n     wondered if there would be a need for that in London,'' he \n     explained. ``Self-storage actually began in California. The \n     ones I built were used as an experiment here, mostly to keep \n     my men working. We had a lull after building the (McKnight) \n     apartments and I mainly just wanted to keep the men working \n     so we built the storage units. It was one of the first ones \n     east of the Mississippi and was unheard of in small towns, \n     but now look around and see how many storage buildings there \n     are around here.''\n       McKnight's love of variety also earned him a spot in the \n     March/April 1991 edition of Kentucky Builder for his uniquely \n     styled home in London. He has carried that variable interest \n     into the design of his home in Florida that he shares with \n     wife of more than 11 years, Lottie Gail.\n       ``I've had a good life but I've always been lucky to have \n     great employees, most of whom have worked all their lives in \n     this business. It's the people who keep you in business--not \n     just the customers, but the people who work with you.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/12/senate-section/article/S3970-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3970-S3972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    AMENDMENTS TO REGULATIONS ADOPTED BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES AND \n                             ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, Today I wish to recognize an \nunsung hero of the U.S. intelligence community and upstanding San \nFranciscan, Mr. Andrew Liepman, who is retiring from the U.S. \nGovernment after 30 years of service.\n  I came to know Andy when he joined the National Counterterrorism \nCenter, or NCTC, as the Deputy Director of Intelligence in 2006. He has \nserved in that position and as Principal Deputy Director for the past 6 \nyears. Andy has been a friend to the Senate Intelligence Committee and \na dedicated leader of our Nation's counterterrorism efforts. I am sorry \nto see him leave the NCTC and the government but wish him the very best \nas he plots his future course.\n  Andy has had a distinguished career in the intelligence community \nsince he joined the CIA in 1982. He served in multiple positions at the \nCIA, at the Office of Near East and South Asian Analysis, the Office of \nIraq Analysis, and the Office of Terrorism Analysis in the \nCounterterrorism Center. He also worked in a variety of assignments \noutside the CIA before coming to the NCTC, including time at the \nDepartment of State, the Nonproliferation Center, and the National \nIntelligence Council.\n  But it was during his time at the NCTC that Andy came to be one of \nthe Nation's top counterterrorism officials and a true leader of the \nintelligence community. He has worked closely with the NCTC's three \nDirectors: ADM Scott Redd, Michael Leiter, and now Matt Olsen. And he \nhas diligently kept the Senate Intelligence Committee informed on the \nterrorist threat--as a hearing witness and as a briefer to Senators and \nstaff and also on the phone to describe imminent or breaking \ncounterterrorism operations.\n  When the committee has had to resolve a problem in the \ncounterterrorism arena, whether getting information or fixing processes \nthat weren't working, Andy was usually the person to solve it.\n  He has served with a direct, frank professional manner, although Andy \nhas quite the reputation for being a lively and fun boss as well.\n  Mr. Liepman's legacy is the strength and reputation of the National \nCounterterrorism Center and particularly its Directorate of \nIntelligence. Since its creation in 2005, the NCTC has developed into a \nworld-class analytic organization. It produces thousands of reports a \nyear, from hour-to-hour situational reports when terrorist threats are \nunfolding, to daily analyses, to detailed, comprehensive products. The \nNCTC leads interagency reviews and speaks for the intelligence \ncommunity on key intelligence questions. It produces tailored reports \nto answer policy questions--I recently requested one myself, on whether \nthe Haqqani Network in Pakistan meets the criteria to be named a \nforeign terrorist organization.\n  Under Andy's leadership, along with the Directors with whom he has \nworked, the National Counterterrorism Center has also grown to fill the \nrole for which it was created. Among other things, the NCTC now \nincludes Pursuit Groups, formed after the Christmas Day 2009 attempted \nairline bombing, to make sure that no terrorism lead goes unchecked. \nThe center is the single repository of the government's definitive \nterrorism databases, which supports the various watchlists that keep \nsuspected terrorists from boarding a plane or crossing the border. The \nNCTC plays a key role in coordinating the government's preparation and \nresponse to terrorist events, enhancing border and transportation \nsecurity, and sharing terrorism-related intelligence with other \nintelligence agencies, the rest of the Federal Government, and with \nState, local, and tribal partners.\n  A lasting reflection of Andy's work is the NCTC workforce itself. \nMany of its\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\nanalysts and operators are detailed from around the intelligence \ncommunity, and these positions have become valued assignments. With the \nlarge growth of intelligence personnel working on counterterrorism \nsince September 11, 2001, Andy has been a teacher, mentor, and \nsupervisor for a generation of analysts. People across the intelligence \ncommunity would seek out positions working for Andy and at the NCTC, \nand his efforts to develop them into expert professionals is a key \nreason that the NCTC is capable of the work it does today.\n  I understand that after 30 years in government service and 6 years in \nthe grueling environment of the NCTC, it is time for Andy to move on. I \nam pleased that he will have some time with his family, his mother \nMarianne, and his two brothers, who all live in California. It has been \na long time since Andy graduated from the University of California at \nBerkeley--with a degree in forestry, no less--and I wish him well as he \nheads back to California and wherever else his future may lead.\n  Mr. President, the intelligence community is filled with men and \nwomen who serve this Nation with dedication and skill and who are never \nproperly recognized for their efforts and their contribution. I am \npleased to be able to honor one of them today and give thanks on behalf \nof the committee for his career of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/12/senate-section/article/S3973-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO DAVE COTE\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment of the \nSenate's time to extend a 60th birthday greeting to a friend of mine, \nand a friend of the Senate as an institution, a voice in the private \nsector who has been a terrific public citizen, and a visionary in the \nbusiness community who has always kept his eye on the future of his \nindustry even when the present is extraordinarily challenging: \nHoneywell International CEO Dave Cote.\n  On July 19, Dave will reach a milestone--he will be 60 years old. \nZero to 60--and anyone who knows him can attest that as he enters his \nsixties, Dave is just getting started.\n  Mr. President, Dave Cote exemplifies the best of what can be \naccomplished in corporate America--a one-man innovative force pushing \nus ahead in the global economy and, along the way and at the same time, \nproof positive that improving the health of our planet can be a job \ncreator and a generator of economic activity.\n  Under Dave's leadership, Honeywell has become a world leader in \ndeveloping and producing technologies and products that save energy and \nstrengthen the environment. From pioneering green jet fuels to \nreengineering wind turbines, from advanced energy metering to home \nsolar panels, Honeywell is leading the way to the clean energy \neconomy--an economy that could generate 4.5 million jobs over the \ncourse of a decade and save us tens of billions of dollars in energy \ncosts.\n  Long before many other corporate leaders recognized that profit and \nenvironmental protection can go hand-in-hand, Dave was pushing for \nalternatives to hydrofluorocarbons--HFCs--potent greenhouse gases. Now, \nthe rest of the world is catching up. Just recently, Secretary Clinton \nannounced she was making HFC reduction a priority through the Climate \nand Clean Energy Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate \nPollutants, and Honeywell is there, ready to race ahead with the \nalternatives we need. For Dave Cote, that is typical--because Dave is \nalways one step ahead.\n  I say this having had the chance to work unbelievably closely with \nhim over the last couple of years. The sheer number of emails and phone \ncalls we've exchanged, not to mention his regular presence in the \nForeign Relations Committee's room in the Capitol, reflect his energy \nand his interest in trying to get Washington to deal in facts and \nrespond to reality. They also exemplify why I love working with him--he \nis a roll-up-your-sleeves, no drama, get-it-done kind of guy. It also \ndoesn't hurt that he is also a big Red Sox fan--he has Boston jerseys \nadorning his office at Honeywell--and he loves riding motorcycles--you \ncan find him tooling around the Jersey suburbs on his Harley most \nweekends.\n  In 2009 and 2010, Dave, Joe Lieberman, Lindsey Graham, and I spent \nlong hours working together on an effort around a comprehensive climate \nchange bill. And when we needed someone to help convey to some of our \nmore skeptical colleagues the importance of acting quickly on this \nissue, we knew that Dave was one of the best, if not the best, in the \nbusiness community to do exactly that. When we convened a group of CEOs \nto meet with other Senators in June of 2010, as part of the lead-up to \ndesigning the climate change bill, Dave stepped forward as a leading \nbusiness voice in the discussion. And when we finally introduced the \nAmerican Power Act, Dave was right by our side.\n  I turned to Dave again last fall when I was serving on the Select \nCommittee on Deficit Reduction. He was proud of his own service as one \nof the Republican members of the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Commission, \nwhich had put together a bold blueprint of its own to wrestle with the \ntough choices of the deficit and our national debt. I agreed completely \nwith Dave's view that we needed to act rather than put off doing \nsomething about our deficit. He said--and I quote--``The faster we act, \nthe less painful it will be for everyone.'' But more than any specific \npolicy, what I admired most was Dave's sincerity about the issue--his \nfrequent, encouraging text messages and emails during the long hard \nslog of the so-called Super Committee, always exhorting me and the \nDemocratic and Republican members of the Committee to go the extra \nmile, put ideology aside, and do what was right for our country. Rather \nthan a ``moment of politics'' for the Congress, Dave urged us to act \nresponsibly and reach a ``moment of truth.''\n  Mr. President, 60 is an age where many feel it's appropriate to start \nslowing down. But anybody who has ever met Dave knows that is not going \nto happen--he is anything but predictable or conventional, and he is \nnot about to slow down, and that is good news for our country when it \ncomes to this always thoughtful, always earnest public citizen.\n  My hope--and my belief--is that Dave Cote will spend his sixties the \nsame way he has spent his last decades: proving every day that doing \nthe right thing can also be good business and good for our country.\n  I wish Dave a very happy birthday, and I look forward to working with \nhim for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/12/senate-section/article/S3973-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3973-S3974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FLOYD WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, the end of May marked the end of an \nera at the Internal Revenue Service. Floyd Williams, a fellow Arkansan, \nhas served as the Director of Legislative Affairs at the IRS for the \nlast 16 years. On May 31, 2012, Floyd served his last day with the IRS, \nand I rise today to thank him for his many years of service to our \nNation.\n  Floyd began his government service many years ago serving as a \ncongressional page for the late, great Senator from Arkansas, J. \nWilliam Fulbright. Captivated by the energy of Washington, Floyd spent \nmost of his adult life and professional career in the District of \nColumbia. During breaks from his undergraduate education at the \nUniversity of Virginia, Floyd worked as a member of the grounds crew \nfor the Architect of the Capitol, as a document clerk in the Senate \nDocument Room, and as a Senate doorkeeper. After earning his juris \ndoctor from the University of Arkansas, he returned to Washington, \nwhere he worked as a Capitol police officer while obtaining an LLM from \nGeorgetown University.\n  Floyd began his professional career in 1972 at the IRS as a tax law \nspecialist in the Individual Income Tax Branch before working as a \nlegislative attorney for the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. \nHe spent several years in the private sector as senior tax manager at \nCoopers and Lybrand, vice president and legislative counsel for the \nNational Association of Home Builders, and senior tax counsel for the \nTax Foundation. Floyd returned to government service at the Treasury \nDepartment, where he served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nLegislative Affairs and Public Liaison (Tax and Budget) and previously \nas Senior Tax Advisor for Public and Legislative Affairs. After his \ntenure with the Treasury Department, he returned to the IRS as Director \nof Legislative Affairs, a role he has held for the last 16 years.\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\n  As someone who continues to claim Fayetteville, AR, as his hometown, \nFloyd Williams has been a great asset to me, my staff, and Arkansas \nover the years. I will certainly miss his insight and depth of \nknowledge, and I wish him all the best in his retirement. Thank you, \nagain, Floyd, for your many years of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/12/senate-section/article/S3974-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    125TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED WAY\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I would like to \nrecognize the 125th anniversary of United Way and honor their \nextraordinary achievements since their founding 125 years ago in \nDenver, CO.\n  In 1887, a Denver woman, along with local religious leaders, \nrecognized the need for community-based action in order to address the \ncity's growing problem with poverty. In Denver they established the \nfirst of what would become a worldwide network of organizations called \nUnited Way. Their goal was simple: create a community-based \norganization that would raise funds in order to provide economic relief \nand counseling services to neighbors in need. During their first \ncampaign in 1888, this remarkable organization raised today's \nequivalent of $650,000.\n  Now, 125 years after its founding, United Way has become a \ncelebrated, worldwide organization committed to improving communities \nfrom the bottom up, through cooperative action and community support in \n41 countries across the globe. United Way forges public-private \npartnerships with local businesses, labor organizations, and 120 \nnational and global corporations through the Global Corporate \nLeadership Program and brings an impressive $5 billion to local \ncommunities each year. United Way effectively leverages private \ndonations in order to finance innovative programs and initiatives that \nprofoundly impact communities throughout Colorado, the United States, \nand the world to advance education, income, and health.\n  The success and strength of the partnerships between United Way and \nAmerica's workers cannot be overstated. Nearly two-thirds of the funds \nfor United Way come from voluntary worker payroll contributions and the \nLabor Letters of Endorsement Program championed by the AFL CIO \nencourages affiliates and their members to give their time and \nresources to United Way campaigns. Just one powerful illustration of \nthis partnership is the National Association of Letter Carriers' \nNational Food Drive, a cooperative effort with the U.S. Postal Service, \nAFL CIO, and United Way, which has become the world's largest 1-day \nfood drive.\n  United Way has strengthened bonds and built a foundation of \ncollaboration and partnership in our communities. Its founders could \nnever have imagined the ultimate breadth and reach of this group, \ngrowing from a local support organization to a globally recognized \nforce for good. United Way is an indispensable part of Colorado's \nsocial fabric, and I am proud to recognize and honor this historic \nanniversary.\n  There are 14 local United Way organizations leaving an indelible mark \nthroughout Colorado. I want to take a moment to recognize each of them \nfor their tremendous role as cornerstones of their communities: \nFoothills United Way, Boulder; Pikes Peak United Way, Colorado Springs; \nMoffat County United Way, Craig; Mile High United Way, Inc., Denver; \nUnited Way of Southwest Colorado, Durango; United Way of Eagle River \nValley, Eagle; United Way of Morgan County, Inc., Fort Morgan; United \nWay of Mesa County, Grand Junction; United Way of Weld County, Greeley; \nUnited Way of Larimer County, Inc., Fort Collins and Loveland; Pueblo \nCounty United Way, Inc., Pueblo; United Way of Garfield County, Rifle; \nRoutt County United Way, Steamboat Springs; and Logan County United \nWay, Sterling.\n  To all of the employees and partners of United Way, I join my Senate \ncolleagues in recognizing and applauding your legacy of inspirational \nservice. This 125th anniversary is a milestone deserving of \ncelebration, and I commend your tireless pursuit to advance the common \ngood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/12/senate-section/article/S3974-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 10:17 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker had \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 3261.

McCain, Mr. \n        Durbin, and Ms. Collins):\n  S.J. Res. 43. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import \nrestrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss events in the \ncountry of Burma. Every year since 2003, I have come to the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate to introduce the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, and \nevery year introduction of this bill has been accompanied by a somber \nmessage to the Senate: that reform in Burma is nowhere in sight. That \nis what I have said every year going back to 2003.\n  This year, I am pleased to say that though the bill's language is the \nsame, the message is far different, as is the legal effect of the \nlegislation. In a remarkable turnabout of events over the past 18 \nmonths, Burma has made dramatic changes for the better. In response to \nthese developments, the administration recently decided it will ease \nmany of the economic sanctions against Burma through exercise of its \nwaiver authority. As a result, this year's Burmese Freedom and \nDemocracy Act would effectively renew only a handful of the sanctions \nagainst the regime and would preserve the administration's flexibility \nto use its waiver authority.\n  In 2008, the Burmese junta put in place a new Constitution--a very \nflawed document. It does not ensure civilian control of the military. \nIn fact, the charter may only be amended if over 75 percent of the \nParliament vote in favor of such changes and one-fourth of the seats in \nParliament are reserved for the military.\n  In November 2010, Burma held an election under this new charter, \nwhich was universally derided as being neither free nor fair. The party \nof Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi--the National League \nfor Democracy--refused to participate due to the unfairness of the \nelectoral process.\n  Restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly were manifest, and \nthere was a prohibition against political prisoners, such as Suu Kyi, \nrunning for office. Not surprisingly, the junta-supported party won \nover three-quarters of the nonappointed parliamentary seats. The new \ngovernment took office on April 1, 2011.\n  Shortly after this seemingly unpromising election, some signs of \nchange began to appear. Suu Kyi was freed after years under house \narrest. By July 2011 she was permitted to leave Rangoon for the first \ntime since her release. In August she visited the new capital, \nNaypyitaw, and met with the new President, Thein Sein.\n  In September 2011 the government lifted its prohibition against major \nnews Web sites and dropped anti-Western slogans from state \npublications. That same month the regime announced it would suspend \naction on a controversial dam to be constructed by China in Kachin \nState. The project was strongly opposed by democracy advocates and \nethnic leaders.\n  As part of its reforms, the legislature enacted a bill that permitted \nSuu Kyi to participate in the April 1, 2012, by-election and made it \npossible for her party to reregister, after having technically lost its \nparty status for boycotting the November 2010 balloting.\n  In January of 2012 a score of political prisoners were released and a \npreliminary cease-fire agreement was reached with the Karen, appearing \nto end one of the longest running ethnic disputes in the world.\n  In April 2012 Burma held a by-election to replace lawmakers who had \nassumed Cabinet roles. For the first time since 1990, the NLD \nparticipated in the election. Of the 45 seats that were open, the NLD \ncontested 44 and won 43.\n  Suu Kyi herself won a seat in what was clearly a dramatic victory for \nthe opposition. This spring, for the first time in a quarter of a \ncentury, Suu Kyi was granted a passport and traveled outside Burma. \nThus, in a mere 18 months, Suu Kyi has gone from political prisoner to \nMember of Parliament. That in and of itself is a remarkable change, and \nit reflects more broadly the wide-ranging reforms that have occurred in \nthe country.\n  In response to the Burmese Government's efforts, on May 17 the State \nDepartment announced that it would undertake a number of administrative \nsteps to ease sanctions against Burma. These include removing both the \ninvestment ban and the financial services ban against Burma, except in \ntransactions involving bad actors. In addition to suspending certain \neconomic sanctions, the administration announced that it would exchange \nfull Ambassadors with Naypyitaw.\n  Mr. President, I support each of these steps taken by the State \nDepartment.\n  What caused the Burmese Government to initiate these democratic \nreforms? It is hard to know for certain, but sanctions seem to have \nplayed an important part in bringing the government around. No country \nlikes being\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\nviewed as a pariah, and the Burmese regime seems no different.\n  When I visited Burma back in January, the one thing I heard from all \nthe government officials with whom I met--the President, the Foreign \nMinister, the Speaker of the Lower House--they all said: We want the \nsanctions removed.\n  Suu Kyi herself publicly stated a few months ago that ``to those who \nask whether or not sanctions have been effective, I would say yes, \nvery, very confidently, because this government is always asking for \nsanctions to be removed. . . . So, sanctions have been effective. If \nsanctions had not been effective this would not be such an important \nissue for them.'' All of that is from Suu Kyi herself.\n  So some Senators may reasonably ask why are we moving this sanctions \nbill again if Burma has made such dramatically positive steps. Well, \nthere are several reasons. Let me lay them out.\n  First, the Burmese Government still has not met all the necessary \nconditions to justify a complete--a complete--repeal of all existing \nsanctions. Despite the unmistakable progress made by the Burmese \nGovernment, now is not the time to end our ability either to encourage \nfurther government reform or to revisit sanctions if that became \nnecessary. As Suu Kyi herself has cautioned, the situation in Burma is \n``not irreversible.'' Serious challenges need to be addressed.\n  Violence in Kachin State remains a serious problem. Numerous \npolitical prisoners remain behind bars. The constitution is still \ncompletely undemocratic. And the regime's relationship with North \nKorea, especially when it comes to arms sales with Pyongyang, remains \nan issue of grave concern.\n  As I noted, renewing the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act would \nleave intact the import ban against Burmese goods, thus maintaining \nleverage the executive branch can utilize to help prompt further \nreform. Reauthorizing this measure would permit the executive branch, \nin consultation with Congress, to calibrate sanctions as necessary, \nthus preserving its flexibility.\n  Second, the renewal of this sanctions bill will not affect--will not \naffect--the administration's current efforts to ease sanctions as \nannounced on May 17. Let me repeat that renewing the Burmese Freedom \nand Democracy Act will leave undisturbed the process for suspending \nsanctions announced 3 weeks ago. In part for this reason, the State \nDepartment supports renewal of this measure. In fact, a vote for \nreauthorization of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act should be seen \nas a vote in support of the administration's easing of sanctions and a \nvote to support reform efforts in Burma.\n  As a practical matter, renewal of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy \nAct would entail, No. 1, extending for another year the ban against \nBurmese imports; No. 2, continuing authority for financial services \nsanctions but leaving in place the authority the administration needs \nto proceed with the easing--the easing--of such restrictions; and No. \n3, leaving untouched the administration's ability to ease the \ninvestment ban, which is part of a separate bill.\n  Finally, renewal of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act has \ncontinued bipartisan support in Congress and the support of Suu Kyi and \nthe democratic opposition in Burma.\n  There are, unfortunately, too few issues where the administration has \nsought to work with Congress in a bipartisan manner--mighty few, in \nfact--but on the issue of sanctions reauthorization, the State \nDepartment and I are in full agreement. I also know that my \nlongstanding partner on Burma on the other side of the aisle, Senator \nFeinstein, shares my sentiments about reauthorizing this measure. As \nfor Burma's democratic opposition, I spoke with Suu Kyi just a few days \nago. She told me she believes the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act \nshould be renewed.\n  If Burma stays on the path it seems to be on to reform, it will \nrequire significant help in reforming its economy and in developing \nbusiness practices that encourage enduring foreign direct investment \nand corporate responsibility. A great deal of work must be done as \nBurma looks ahead to hosting the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nin 2014. For the first time in a half a century, Burma seems--seems--to \nbe on the right path to reform, and reauthorization of the Burmese \nFreedom and Democracy Act places the United States squarely on the side \nof reform and of reformers.\n  For the reasons I have laid out, I believe a renewal of this measure \nis the right step to take. Burma has made great strides over the past \n18 months, and Congress should recognize those strides. At the same \ntime, Congress should not be fully satisfied with recent reforms, as \nmuch more work remains to be done.\n  In closing, I am introducing the renewal of the Freedom and Democracy \nAct, originally passed in 2003, for myself; Senator Feinstein, with \nwhom I have worked on this over the years and referred to in my \nremarks; Senator John McCain, who has been very active in this area and \nmet with Suu Kyi this past year; Senator Durbin; and Senator Collins, \nwho had the opportunity to meet with Suu Kyi just the week before \nlast--all of whom are active and interested in this issue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, I express \nmy appreciation--really from our country--for his tireless efforts in \nfocusing attention on what has been going on in Burma. He has come to \nthe floor and given numerous statements to focus attention on this \nissue. It took a while to get some traction, but finally he got some \ntraction, and that is why progress was made in Burma.\n  I appreciate his mentioning Senator Feinstein. She has also been very \nfocused on this. But no one has been to the floor more than Senator \nMcConnell talking about this issue. As a result of that, we have made \nprogress. It has been slow, but it has been deliberate, and I think we \ncan see a new day for that country.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Nevada.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This joint resolution and the amendment made by this joint \n     resolution shall take effect on the date of the enactment of \n     this joint resolution or July 26, 2012, whichever occurs \n     first.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today once again with my friend \nand colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, to introduce a joint \nresolution to renew the import ban on Burma for another year. We are \nproud to be joined by Senators McCain and Durbin in this important \neffort.\n  Congressman Joe Crowley and Congressman Peter King have introduced \nthis resolution in the House and I thank them for their leadership and \nsupport.\n  Over the past year, we have seen some remarkable changes in Burma \nafter years of violence and repression.\n  But the government of Burma still has a lot of work to do to \ndemonstrate to us, the international community, and, above all, the \npeople of Burma that it is truly committed to reform, democratization, \nand national reconciliation.\n  We should renew this ban for another year as an incentive to the \ngovernment of Burma to continue on the path it has undertaken and take \nadditional actions.\n  I have been involved in the struggle for freedom and democracy in \nBurma for 15 years.\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\n  In 1997, former Senator William Cohen and I authored legislation \nrequiring the President to ban new U.S. investment in Burma if he \ndetermined that the government of Burma had physically harmed, re-\narrested or exiled Aung San Suu Kyi or committed large-scale repression \nor violence against the democratic opposition.\n  President Clinton issued the ban in a 1997 Executive Order.\n  In 2003, after the regime attempted to assassinate Aung San Suu Kyi, \nSenator McConnell and I introduced the Burmese Freedom and Democracy \nAct of 2003, which placed a complete ban on imports from Burma. It \nallowed that ban to be renewed one year at a time.\n  It was signed into law and has been renewed annually since then. It \nis set to expire on July 26, which is why a renewal of that ban is now \nbefore us today.\n  But unlike past years, we have some good news to report.\n  Burma has begun to take some significant steps towards embracing \ndemocracy, human rights, and the rule of law.\n  This is welcome news after so many years of inaction coupled with \ndespotic military rule.\n  How did we get to this point?\n  Recall that in 1990 Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy \noverwhelmingly won the last free parliamentary elections in Burma, but \nthose results were annulled by the military junta, then named the State \nLaw and Order Restoration Council or SLORC.\n  These events marked the beginning of more than two decades of \nviolence, oppression, and human rights abuses.\n  In 2008, the ruling military junta, renamed the State Peace and \nDevelopment Council, pushed through the ratification of a new \nconstitution, which was drafted without the input of the democratic \nopposition, led by Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  Elections for the new parliament were held in November 2010, but Suu \nKyi and her National League for Democracy were prohibited from \nparticipating.\n  The Union Solidarity and Development Party, comprised of ex-military \nofficials, won approximately 80 percent of the seats. The new \nparliament elected former General and Prime Minister, Thein Sein, as \nPresident.\n  Following the elections, Suu Kyi was finally released from house \narrest, after being in prison or house arrest for the better part of 20 \nyears.\n  While I was pleased that Suu Kyi was free, I was deeply concerned \nthat nothing had really changed for the people of Burma.\n  Suu Kyi and her party were blocked from participating in the \npolitical process. The military maintained its grip on the government \nand the economy. Democracy advocates and human rights activists \nremained in prison. Violence against ethnic minority groups continued \nunabated.\n  Yet, in the past year we have seen more positive change than we had \nin the past 20 years.\n  Indeed, Burma's new government has taken a number of significant \nactions in an effort to rejoin the international community.\n  Hundreds of political prisoners were released.\n  New legislation broadening the rights of political and civic \nassociations has been enacted; and negotiations with ethnic minority \ngroups have begun and some cease-fires have taken effect.\n  In addition, Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy, NLD, were \nallowed to compete in by-elections for 45 open seats in parliament in \nApril 2012.\n  Suu Kyi and the NLD won 43 of the 44 seats they contested.\n  For those of us who have been inspired by her courage, her dedication \nto peace and her tireless efforts for freedom and democracy, it was a \nthrilling and deeply moving event. Years of sacrifice and hard work had \nshown results the people of Burma had spoken with a clear voice in \nsupport of freedom and democracy.\n  The U.S. has responded to this reform process in a number of ways.\n  Secretary Clinton traveled to Burma last December and announced the \ntwo countries would resume full diplomatic relations.\n  Following the April parliamentary elections, the administration \nannounced that it would nominate Derek Mitchell to be the first U.S. \nambassador to Burma in 22 years and suspend sanctions on investment and \nfinancial services.\n  I supported these actions. It is entirely appropriate to acknowledge \nthe steps Burma has already taken and encourage additional reforms.\n  Some may ask then: why stop there? Given the reforms, why not let the \nban on imports simply expire?\n  The fact of the matter is, the reforms are not irreversible and the \ngovernment of Burma still needs to do more to respond to the legitimate \nconcerns of the people of Burma and the international community.\n  First, it must address the dominant role of the military in Burma \nunder the new constitution.\n  The military is guaranteed 25 percent of the seats without elections \nand remains independent of any civilian oversight.\n  In addition, the Commander-in-Chief of the military has the authority \nto dismiss the government and rule the country under Martial Law.\n  It goes without saying that such powers are incompatible with a truly \ndemocratic government.\n  Second, Burma must stop all violence against ethnic minorities. I am \nparticularly concerned about reports that the Burmese military is \ncontinuing attacks in Kachin State, displacing thousands of civilians \nand killing others.\n  Third, the government must release all political prisoners.\n  I applaud the decision of the Government of Burma to release hundreds \nof political prisoners, including a number of high-profile democracy \nand human rights activists.\n  Yet, according to the State Department, hundreds more remain in \ndetention.\n  Unfortunately, the government of Burma maintains there are no more \npolitical prisoners. We must keep the pressure on Burma until all \ndemocracy and human rights activists are free and able to resume their \nlives and careers.\n  As we debate renewing the import ban, it is important to consider the \nadvice and counsel of Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratic opposition.\n  For her part, Suu Kyi has said that while she does not oppose \nsuspending sanctions, the international community must be cautious. \nSpeaking via Skype to an event in Washington D.C. last month she said:\n\n       I sometimes feel that people are too optimistic about the \n     scene in Burma. You have to remember that the democratization \n     process in Burma is not irreversible. I have said openly that \n     we can never look upon it as irreversible until such time \n     that the military commits itself to democratization solidly \n     and efficiently.\n\n  I understand that Suu Kyi has spoken to Senator McConnell directly \nabout this matter and she supports renewing the import ban for another \nyear.\n  I believe that renewing this ban will help keep Burma on the path to \nfull democratization and national reconciliation and support the work \nof Suu Kyi, the democratic opposition, and the reformists in the ruling \ngovernment.\n  It will give the administration additional leverage to convince the \nBurma to stay on the right path.\n  The administration will still have the authority to waive or suspend \nthe import ban as it has suspended sanctions on investment and \nfinancial services if the Government of Burma took the appropriate \nactions.\n  If we let the import ban expire, however, and Burma backslides on \nreform and democratization, we would have to pass a new law to re-\nimpose the ban.\n  By passing this joint resolution, we ensure that the administration \nhas the flexibility it needs to respond to events in Burma has it as \ndone so with financial services and investment.\n  Suu Kyi herself has argued that ``sanctions have been effective in \npersuading the government to go for change.'' I think renewing the \nimport ban will push it to go further.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution.\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/12/senate-section/article/S3982-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 489--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE \n APPOINTMENT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF AN OUTSIDE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO \n INVESTIGATE CERTAIN RECENT LEAKS OF APPARENTLY CLASSIFIED AND HIGHLY \nSENSITIVE INFORMATION ON UNITED STATES MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE PLANS, \n                        PROGRAMS, AND OPERATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Brown of \nMassachusetts, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Portman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Graham, Mr. \nCornyn, Mr. Burr, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Paul, Mr. \nBoozman, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Rubio, \nand Mr. Hoeven) submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 490\n\n       Whereas Brittany Wilkinson, the first Youth Ambassador of \n     the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation, joined other \n     Youth Ambassadors of the United Mitochondrial Disease \n     Foundation in working tirelessly to raise awareness about \n     mitochondrial diseases;\n       Whereas mitochondrial diseases result from a defect that \n     reduces the ability of the mitochondria in a cell to produce \n     energy;\n       Whereas, as mitochondria fail to produce enough energy, \n     cells cease to function properly and eventually die, leading \n     to the failure of organ systems and possibly the death of the \n     affected individuals;\n       Whereas mitochondrial diseases can present themselves at \n     any age, and mortality rates vary depending upon the \n     particular disease;\n       Whereas the most severe mitochondrial diseases result in \n     the progressive loss of function in multiple organs, \n     including the loss of neurological and muscle function, and \n     death within several years;\n       Whereas mitochondrial diseases are a relatively newly \n     identified group of diseases, first recognized in the late \n     1960s, and diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases is extremely \n     difficult;\n       Whereas there are more than 100 identified primary \n     mitochondrial diseases, but researchers believe there are \n     several hundred other types of unidentified mitochondrial \n     diseases and further research is necessary to help identify \n     those diseases;\n       Whereas mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with many \n     diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, \n     amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism, diabetes, cancer, and \n     many other diseases associated with aging;\n       Whereas research into primary mitochondrial diseases can \n     provide applications to biomedical research and a window into \n     our understanding of many other diseases, including possible \n     treatments and cures for diseases such as Parkinson's \n     disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, \n     autism, diabetes, cancer, and many other diseases associated \n     with aging;\n       Whereas researchers estimate that one in 4,000 children \n     will develop a mitochondrial disease related to an inherited \n     mutation by 10 years of age, and recent studies of umbilical \n     cord blood samples show that one in 200 people could develop \n     a mitochondrial disease in their lifetime;\n       Whereas researchers also believe that those numbers could \n     be much higher, given the difficulty associated with \n     diagnosing mitochondrial disease and the many cases that are \n     either misdiagnosed or never diagnosed;\n       Whereas there are no cures for mitochondrial diseases, nor \n     are there specific treatments for any of those diseases;\n       Whereas human energy production involves multiple organ \n     systems, and therefore primary mitochondrial diseases \n     research involves many Institutes at the National Institutes \n     of Health;\n       Whereas, according to the National Institutes of Health, \n     more than $600,000,000 is being spent on research related to \n     mitochondrial functions, of which $18,000,000 is being spent \n     on actual primary mitochondrial diseases research;\n       Whereas the National Institutes of Health has taken an \n     increased interest in primary mitochondrial diseases and has \n     sponsored a number of activities in recent years aimed at \n     advancing mitochondrial medicine, including incorporating \n     research into functional variations in mitochondria in the \n     Transformative Research Awards Initiative;\n       Whereas, in March 2012, the National Institutes of Health \n     convened a 2-day symposium entitled ``Translational Research \n     in Primary Mitochondrial Diseases: Obstacles and \n     Opportunities'', which brought together leading government \n     and private sector researchers and drug developers to share \n     information related to primary mitochondrial diseases, \n     develop systems to facilitate future collaboration, survey \n     obstacles, needs, and priorities of primary mitochondrial \n     diseases research, and develop mechanisms to enhance \n     translation of basic science discoveries to diagnostics and \n     therapeutics; and\n       Whereas, as a consequence of the symposium, a white paper \n     has been developed that identifies current research \n     challenges and impediments and a suggested course of action \n     to address those challenges: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of September 16, 2012, as \n     ``Mitochondrial Disease Awareness Week'';\n       (2) reaffirms the importance of an enhanced and coordinated \n     research effort aimed at improving the understanding of \n     primary mitochondrial diseases and the development of \n     treatments and cures;\n       (3) commends the National Institutes of Health for its \n     efforts to organize the symposium entitled ``Translational \n     Research in\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\n     Primary Mitochondrial Disease: Obstacles and Opportunities'' \n     to improve the understanding of mitochondrial diseases and to \n     enhance collaboration and chart a course for the future with \n     respect to research on mitochondrial diseases;\n       (4) encourages the National Institutes of Health to place a \n     greater priority on research into primary mitochondrial \n     diseases, to continue to explore the connections between \n     mitochondrial dysfunction and other systemic diseases, and to \n     promote collaboration and coordination among the Institutes \n     of the National Institutes of Health and with other \n     organizations; and\n       (5) encourages the National Institutes of Health to \n     consider the recommendations and address research directions \n     identified in the white paper developed from the symposium \n     described in paragraph (3), including--\n       (A) enhanced emphasis on research regarding basic \n     mitochondrial physiology, variations in mitochondrial \n     function in different body tissues, and improvements in the \n     manipulation of mitochondrial DNA;\n       (B) supporting research that will provide the basis for \n     drug development, including improved mouse models, efforts to \n     achieve breakthroughs in in vivo research capability, \n     consensus development around assays, and next generation \n     sequencing;\n       (C) expansion and support of stable, long-term patient \n     registries and biospecimen repositories in collaboration with \n     patient advocacy groups to promote enrollment and ultimately \n     pave the way for natural history trials; and\n       (D) the establishment of a working group to develop a \n     system for the continued interaction among the Institutes \n     within the National Institutes of Health and with other \n     organizations and the establishment of a website on research \n     on primary mitochondrial diseases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/12/senate-section/article/S3983-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 491--COMMENDING THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE 44TH \n  INTERNATIONAL CHEMISTRY OLYMPIAD AND RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF \n   EDUCATION IN THE FIELDS OF SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND \n             MATHEMATICS TO THE FUTURE OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. Boozman, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Alexander, and \nMs. Murkowski) submitted the following resolution;

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NUCLEAR PROGRAM OF IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since at least the late 1980s, the Government of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran has engaged in a sustained and well-\n     documented pattern of illicit and deceptive activities to \n     acquire nuclear capability.\n       (2) The United Nations Security Council has adopted \n     multiple resolutions since 2006 demanding the full and \n     sustained suspension of all uranium enrichment-related and \n     reprocessing activities by the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran and its full cooperation with the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on all outstanding \n     issues related to its nuclear activities, particularly those \n     concerning the possible military dimensions of its nuclear \n     program.\n       (3) On November 8, 2011, the IAEA issued an extensive \n     report that--\n       (A) documents ``serious concerns regarding possible \n     military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme'';\n       (B) states that ``Iran has carried out activities relevant \n     to the development of a nuclear device''; and\n       (C) states that the efforts described in subparagraphs (A) \n     and (B) may be ongoing.\n       (4) As of November 2008, Iran had produced, according to \n     the IAEA--\n       (A) approximately 630 kilograms of uranium hexaflouride \n     enriched up to 3.5 percent uranium-235; and\n       (B) no uranium hexaflouride enriched up to 20 percent \n     uranium-235.\n       (5) As of November 2011, Iran had produced, according to \n     the IAEA--\n       (A) nearly 5,000 kilograms of uranium hexaflouride enriched \n     up to 3.5 percent uranium-235; and\n       (B) 79.7 kilograms of uranium hexaflouride enriched up to \n     20 percent uranium-235.\n       (6) On January 9, 2012, IAEA inspectors confirmed that the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran had begun \n     enrichment activities at the Fordow site, including possibly \n     enrichment of uranium hexaflouride up to 20 percent uranium-\n     235.\n       (7) Section 2(2) of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, \n     Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111 \n     195) states, ``The United States and other responsible \n     countries have a vital interest in working together to \n     prevent the Government of Iran from acquiring a nuclear \n     weapons capability.''\n       (8) If the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran were \n     successful in acquiring a nuclear weapon capability, it would \n     likely spur other countries in the region to consider \n     developing their own nuclear weapons capabilities.\n       (9) On December 6, 2011, Prince Turki al-Faisal of Saudi \n     Arabia stated that if international efforts to prevent Iran \n     from obtaining nuclear weapons fail, ``we must, as a duty to \n     our country and people, look into all options we are given, \n     including obtaining these weapons ourselves''.\n       (10) Top leaders of the Government of the Islamic Republic \n     of Iran have repeatedly threatened the existence of the State \n     of Israel, pledging to ``wipe Israel off the map''.\n       (11) The Department of State has designated Iran as a state \n     sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and characterized Iran as the \n     ``most active state sponsor of terrorism''.\n       (12) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     provided weapons, training, funding, and direction to \n     terrorist groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and Shiite \n     militias in Iraq that are responsible for the murders of \n     hundreds of United States forces and innocent civilians.\n       (13) On July 28, 2011, the Department of the Treasury \n     charged that the Government of Iran had forged a ``secret \n     deal'' with al Qaeda to facilitate the movement of al Qaeda \n     fighters and funding through Iranian territory.\n       (14) In October 2011, senior leaders of Iran's Islamic \n     Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force were implicated \n     in a terrorist plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's Ambassador \n     to the United States on United States soil.\n       (15) On December 26, 2011, the United Nations General \n     Assembly passed a resolution denouncing the serious human \n     rights abuses occurring in the Islamic Republic of Iran, \n     including torture, cruel and degrading treatment in \n     detention, the targeting of human rights defenders, violence \n     against women, and ``the systematic and serious restrictions \n     on freedom of peaceful assembly'' as well as severe \n     restrictions on the rights to ``freedom of thought, \n     conscience, religion or belief''.\n       (16) President Barack Obama, through the P5+1 process, has \n     made repeated efforts to engage the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran in dialogue about Iran's nuclear program and \n     its international commitments under the Treaty on the Non-\n     Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, \n     and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March 5, 1970 \n     (commonly known as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'').\n       (17) Representatives of the P5+1 countries (the United \n     States, France, Germany, the People's Republic of China, the \n     Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom) and \n     representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran held \n     negotiations on Iran's nuclear program in Istanbul, Turkey on \n     April 14, 2012, and these discussions are set to resume in \n     Baghdad, Iraq on May 23, 2012.\n       (18) On March 31, 2010, President Obama stated that the \n     ``consequences of a nuclear-armed Iran are unacceptable''.\n       (19) In his State of the Union Address on January 24, 2012, \n     President Obama stated, ``Let there be no doubt: America is \n     determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and \n     I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal.''\n       (20) On March 4, 2012, President Obama stated ``Iran's \n     leaders should understand that I do not have a policy of \n     containment; I have a policy to prevent Iran from obtaining a \n     nuclear weapon''.\n\n[[Page S3986]]\n\n       (21) Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated, in December \n     2011, that it was unacceptable for Iran to acquire nuclear \n     weapons, reaffirmed that all options were on the table to \n     thwart Iran's nuclear weapons efforts, and vowed that if the \n     United States gets ``intelligence that they are proceeding \n     with developing a nuclear weapon then we will take whatever \n     steps necessary to stop it''.\n       (22) The Department of Defense's January 2012 Strategic \n     Guidance stated that United States defense efforts in the \n     Middle East would be aimed ``to prevent Iran's development of \n     a nuclear weapons capability and counter its destabilizing \n     policies''.\n       (23) On April 2, 2012, President Obama stated, ``All the \n     evidence indicates that the Iranians are trying to develop \n     the capacity to develop nuclear weapons. They might decide \n     that, once they have that capacity that they'd hold off right \n     at the edge in order not to incur more sanctions. But, if \n     they've got nuclear weapons-building capacity and they are \n     flouting international resolutions, that creates huge \n     destabilizing effects in the region and will trigger an arms \n     race in the Middle East that is bad for U.S. national \n     security but is also bad for the entire world.''\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms that the United States Government and the \n     governments of other responsible countries have a vital \n     interest in working together to prevent the Government of \n     Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability;\n       (2) warns that time is limited to prevent the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons \n     capability;\n       (3) urges continued and increasing economic and diplomatic \n     pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran until the Government \n     of the Islamic Republic of Iran agrees to and implements--\n       (A) the full and sustained suspension of all uranium \n     enrichment-related and reprocessing activities and compliance \n     with United Nations Security Council resolutions;\n       (B) complete cooperation with the IAEA on all outstanding \n     questions related to the nuclear activities of the Government \n     of the Islamic Republic of Iran, including the implementation \n     of the additional protocol to Iran's Safeguards Agreement \n     with the IAEA; and\n       (C) a permanent agreement that verifiably assures that \n     Iran's nuclear program is entirely peaceful;\n       (4) expresses the desire that the P5+1 process successfully \n     and swiftly leads to the objectives identified in paragraph \n     (3), but warns that, as President Obama has said, the window \n     for diplomacy is closing;\n       (5) expresses support for the universal rights and \n     democratic aspirations of the people of Iran;\n       (6) strongly supports United States policy to prevent the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran from acquiring a \n     nuclear weapons capability;\n       (7) rejects any United States policy that would rely on \n     efforts to contain a nuclear weapons-capable Iran; and\n       (8) joins the President in ruling out any policy that would \n     rely on containment as an option in response to the Iranian \n     nuclear threat.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed as an authorization for the use of force or a \n     declaration of war.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2347.

A vote on \n     final passage of the resolution shall be taken on or before \n     the close of the 15th session day after the resolution is \n     reported by the committee or committees to which it was \n     referred, or after such committee or committees have been \n     discharged from further consideration of the resolution.\n       (d)(1) In the Senate, when the committee or committees to \n     which a joint resolution is referred have reported, or when a \n     committee or committees are discharged (under subsection (c)) \n     from further consideration of a joint resolution described in \n     subsection (a), it is at any time thereafter in order (even \n     though a previous motion to the same effect has been \n     disagreed to) for a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n     the joint resolution, and all points of order against the \n     joint resolution (and against consideration of the joint \n     resolution) are waived. The motion is not subject to \n     amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or \n     disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to \n     the consideration of the joint resolution is agreed to, the \n     joint resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the \n     Senate until disposed of.\n       (2) In the Senate, debate on the joint resolution, and on \n     all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, \n     shall be limited to not more than 2 hours, which shall be \n     divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the \n     joint resolution. A motion to further limit debate is in \n     order and not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to \n     postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n     other business, or a motion to recommit the joint resolution \n     is not in order.\n       (3) In the Senate, immediately following the conclusion of \n     the debate on a joint resolution described in subsection (a), \n     and a single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate, the \n     vote on final passage of the joint resolution shall occur.\n       (4) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the \n     application of the rules of the Senate to the procedure \n     relating to a joint resolution described in subsection (a) \n     shall be decided without debate.\n       (e) In the House of Representatives, if any committee to \n     which a joint resolution described in subsection (a) has been \n     referred has not reported it to the House at the end of 15 \n     legislative days after its introduction, such committee shall \n     be discharged from further consideration of the joint \n     resolution, and it shall be placed on the appropriate \n     calendar. On the second and fourth Thursdays of each month it \n     shall be in order at any time for the Speaker to recognize a \n     Member who favors passage of a joint resolution that has \n     appeared on the calendar for at least 5 legislative days to \n     call up that joint resolution for immediate consideration in \n     the House without intervention of any point of order. When so \n     called up a joint resolution shall be considered as read and \n     shall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled \n     by the proponent and an opponent, and the previous question \n     shall be considered as ordered to its passage without \n     intervening motion. It shall not be in order to reconsider \n     the vote on passage. If a vote on final passage of the joint \n     resolution has not been taken by the third Thursday on which \n     the Speaker may recognize a Member under this subsection, \n     such vote shall be taken on that day.\n       (f)(1) If, before passing a joint resolution described in \n     subsection (a), one House receives from the other a joint \n     resolution having the same text, then--\n       (A) the joint resolution of the other House shall not be \n     referred to a committee; and\n       (B) the procedure in the receiving House shall be the same \n     as if no joint resolution had been received from the other \n     House until the vote on passage, when the joint resolution \n     received from the other House shall supplant the joint \n     resolution of the receiving House.\n       (2) This subsection shall not apply to the House of \n     Representatives if the joint resolution received from the \n     Senate is a revenue measure.\n       (g) If either House has not taken a vote on final passage \n     of the joint resolution by the last day of the period \n     described in section 12302(b)(2), then such vote shall be \n     taken on that day.\n       (h) This section and section 12304 are enacted by \n     Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such is \n     deemed to be part of the rules of each House, respectively, \n     but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be \n     followed in that House in the case of a joint resolution \n     described in subsection (a) and superseding other rules only \n     where explicitly so; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the Constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n\n     SEC. 12304. CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL PROCEDURE FOR NONMAJOR \n                   RULES.\n\n       (a) For purposes of this section, the term ``joint \n     resolution'' means only a joint resolution introduced in the \n     period beginning on the date on which the report referred to \n     in section 12302(a)(1)(A) is received by Congress and ending \n     60 days thereafter (excluding days either House of Congress \n     is adjourned for more than 3 days during a session of \n     Congress), the matter after the resolving clause of which is \n     as follows: ``That Congress disapproves the nonmajor rule \n     submitted by the ___ relating to ___, and such rule shall \n     have no force or effect.'' (The blank spaces being \n     appropriately filled in).\n       (b)(1) A joint resolution described in subsection (a) shall \n     be referred to the committees in each House of Congress with \n     jurisdiction.\n       (2) For purposes of this section, the term submission or \n     publication date means the later of the date on which--\n       (A) the Congress receives the report submitted under \n     section 12302(a)(1); or\n       (B) the nonmajor rule is published in the Federal Register, \n     if so published.\n       (c) In the Senate, if the committee to which is referred a \n     joint resolution described in subsection (a) has not reported \n     such joint resolution (or an identical joint resolution) at \n     the end of 15 session days after the date of introduction of \n     the joint resolution, such committee may be discharged from \n     further consideration of such joint resolution upon a \n     petition supported in writing by 30 Members of the Senate, \n     and such joint resolution shall be placed on the calendar.\n       (d)(1) In the Senate, when the committee to which a joint \n     resolution is referred has reported, or when a committee is \n     discharged (under subsection (c)) from further consideration \n     of a joint resolution described in subsection (a), it is at \n     any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion \n     to the same effect has been disagreed to) for a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution, and all \n     points of order against the joint resolution (and against \n     consideration of the joint resolution) are waived. The motion \n     is not subject to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or \n     to a motion to proceed to the consideration of other \n     business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion \n     is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of the joint \n     resolution is agreed to, the joint resolution shall remain \n     the unfinished business of the Senate until disposed of.\n       (2) In the Senate, debate on the joint resolution, and on \n     all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, \n     shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be \n     divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the \n     joint resolution. A motion to further limit debate is in \n     order and not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to \n     postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of \n     other business, or a motion to recommit the joint resolution \n     is not in order.\n       (3) In the Senate, immediately following the conclusion of \n     the debate on a joint resolution described in subsection (a), \n     and a single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate, the \n     vote on final passage of the joint resolution shall occur.\n       (4) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the \n     application of the rules of the Senate to the procedure \n     relating to a joint resolution described in subsection (a) \n     shall be decided without debate.\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\n       (e) In the Senate the procedure specified in subsection (c) \n     or (d) shall not apply to the consideration of a joint \n     resolution respecting a nonmajor rule--\n       (1) after the expiration of the 60 session days beginning \n     with the applicable submission or publication date, or\n       (2) if the report under section 12302(a)(1)(A) was \n     submitted during the period referred to in section \n     12302(d)(1), after the expiration of the 60 session days \n     beginning on the 15th session day after the succeeding \n     session of Congress first convenes.\n       (f) If, before the passage by one House of a joint \n     resolution of that House described in subsection (a), that \n     House receives from the other House a joint resolution \n     described in subsection (a), then the following procedures \n     shall apply:\n       (1) The joint resolution of the other House shall not be \n     referred to a committee.\n       (2) With respect to a joint resolution described in \n     subsection (a) of the House receiving the joint resolution--\n       (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     joint resolution had been received from the other House; but\n       (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the joint \n     resolution of the other House.\n\n     SEC. 12305.

Mr. BOOZMAN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 3240, to reauthorize agricultural programs \nthrough 2017, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the \ntable; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n TITLE __--FARM, RANCH, AND FOREST LAND PRIVATE PROPERTY PROTECTION ACT\n\n     SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Farm, Ranch, and Forest \n     Land Private Property Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The founders realized the fundamental importance of \n     property rights when they codified the Takings Clause of the \n     Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which requires that \n     private property shall not be taken `for public use, without \n     just compensation.\n       (2) Rural lands are unique in that they are not \n     traditionally considered high tax revenue-generating \n     properties for State and local governments. In addition, \n     farm, ranch, and forest land owners need to have long-term \n     certainty regarding their property rights in order to make \n     the investment decisions to commit land to these uses.\n       (3) Ownership rights in rural land are fundamental building \n     blocks for our Nation's agriculture industry, which continues \n     to be one of the most important economic sectors of our \n     economy.\n       (4) In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. \n     City of New London, abuse of eminent domain is a threat to \n     the property rights of all private property owners, including \n     rural land owners.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the use of eminent domain for the purpose of economic \n     development is a threat to agricultural and other property in \n     rural America and that the Congress should protect the \n     property rights of Americans, including those who reside in \n     rural areas. Property rights are central to liberty in this \n     country and to our economy. The use of eminent domain to take \n     farmland and other rural property for economic development \n     threatens liberty, rural economies, and the economy of the \n     United States. The taking of farmland and rural property will \n     have a direct impact on existing irrigation and reclamation \n     projects. Furthermore, the use of eminent domain to take \n     rural private property for private commercial uses will force \n     increasing numbers of activities from private property onto \n     this Nation's public lands, including its National forests, \n     National parks and wildlife refuges. This increase can \n     overburden the infrastructure of these lands, reducing the \n     enjoyment of such lands for all citizens. Americans should \n     not have to fear the government's taking their homes, farms, \n     or businesses to give to other persons. Governments should \n     not abuse the power of eminent domain to force rural property \n     owners from their land in order to develop rural land into \n     industrial and commercial property. Congress has a duty to \n     protect the property rights of rural Americans in the face of \n     eminent domain abuse.\n\n     SEC. _03. PROHIBITION ON EMINENT DOMAIN ABUSE BY STATES TO \n                   CONFISCATE FARM, RANCH, OR FOREST LAND.\n\n       (a) In General.--No State or political subdivision of a \n     State shall exercise its power of eminent domain over farm, \n     ranch, or forest land, or allow the exercise of such power by \n     any person or entity to which such power has been delegated, \n     over property to be used for economic development or over \n     property that is used for economic development within 7 years \n     after that exercise, if that State or political subdivision \n     receives Federal economic development funds during any fiscal \n     year in which the property is so used or intended to be used.\n       (b) Ineligibility for Federal Funds.--A violation of \n     subsection (a) by a State or political subdivision shall \n     render such State or political subdivision ineligible for any \n     Federal economic development funds for a period of 2 fiscal \n     years following a final judgment on the merits by a court of \n     competent jurisdiction that such subsection has been \n     violated, and any Federal agency charged with distributing \n     those funds shall withhold them for such 2-year period, and \n     any such funds distributed to such State or political \n     subdivision shall be returned or reimbursed\n\n[[Page S3990]]\n\n     by such State or political subdivision to the appropriate \n     Federal agency or authority of the Federal Government, or \n     component thereof.\n       (c) Opportunity To Cure Violation.--A State or political \n     subdivision shall not be ineligible for any Federal economic \n     development funds under subsection (b) if such State or \n     political subdivision returns all real property the taking of \n     which was found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have \n     constituted a violation of subsection (a) and replaces any \n     other property destroyed and repairs any other property \n     damaged as a result of such violation. In addition, the State \n     must pay applicable penalties and interest to reattain \n     eligibility.\n\n     SEC. _04. PROHIBITION ON EMINENT DOMAIN ABUSE BY THE FEDERAL \n                   GOVERNMENT TO CONFISCATE FARM, RANCH, OR FOREST \n                   LAND.\n\n       The Federal Government or any authority of the Federal \n     Government shall not exercise its power of eminent domain \n     over farm, ranch, or forest land to be used for economic \n     development.\n\n     SEC. _05. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.\n\n       (a) Cause of Action.--Any (1) owner of private farm, ranch, \n     or forest land whose property is subject to eminent domain \n     who suffers injury as a result of a violation of any \n     provision of this title with respect to that property, or (2) \n     any tenant of property that is subject to eminent domain who \n     suffers injury as a result of a violation of any provision of \n     this title with respect to that property, may bring an action \n     to enforce any provision of this title in the appropriate \n     Federal or State court. A State shall not be immune under the \n     11th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States from \n     any such action in a Federal or State court of competent \n     jurisdiction. In such action, the defendant has the burden to \n     show by clear and convincing evidence that the taking is not \n     for economic development. Any such property owner or tenant \n     may also seek an appropriate relief through a preliminary \n     injunction or a temporary restraining order.\n       (b) Limitation on Bringing Action.--An action brought by a \n     property owner or tenant under this title may be brought if \n     the property is used for economic development following the \n     conclusion of any condemnation proceedings condemning the \n     property of such property owner or tenant, but shall not be \n     brought later than seven years following the conclusion of \n     any such proceedings.\n       (c) Attorneys' Fee and Other Costs.--In any action or \n     proceeding under this title, the court shall allow a \n     prevailing plaintiff a reasonable attorneys' fee as part of \n     the costs, and include expert fees as part of the attorneys' \n     fee.\n\n     SEC. _06. REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS TO ATTORNEY GENERAL OR THE \n                   SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.\n\n       (a) Submission of Report to Attorney General.--Any (1) \n     owner of private farm, ranch, or forest land whose property \n     is subject to eminent domain who suffers injury as a result \n     of a violation of any provision of this title with respect to \n     that property, or (2) any tenant of farm, ranch, or forest \n     land that is subject to eminent domain who suffers injury as \n     a result of a violation of any provision of this title with \n     respect to that property, may report a violation by the \n     Federal Government, any authority of the Federal Government, \n     State, or political subdivision of a State to the Attorney \n     General or the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       (b) Investigation by Attorney General.--Upon receiving a \n     report of an alleged violation, the Secretary of Agriculture \n     shall transmit the report to the Attorney General. Upon \n     receiving a report of an alleged violation from either a \n     property owner, tenant, or the Secretary of Agriculture, the \n     Attorney General shall conduct an investigation, in \n     cooperation with the Secretary of Agriculture, to determine \n     whether a violation exists.\n       (c) Notification of Violation.--If the Attorney General \n     concludes that a violation does exist, then the Attorney \n     General shall notify the Federal Government, authority of the \n     Federal Government, State, or political subdivision of a \n     State that the Attorney General has determined that it is in \n     violation of the title. The notification shall further \n     provide that the Federal Government, State, or political \n     subdivision of a State has 90 days from the date of the \n     notification to demonstrate to the Attorney General either \n     that (1) it is not in violation of the title or (2) that it \n     has cured its violation by returning all real property the \n     taking of which the Attorney General finds to have \n     constituted a violation of the title and replacing any other \n     property destroyed and repairing any other property damaged \n     as a result of such violation.\n       (d) Attorney General's Bringing of Action to Enforce \n     Title.--If, at the end of the 90-day period described in \n     subsection (c), the Attorney General determines that the \n     Federal Government, authority of the Federal Government, \n     State, or political subdivision of a State is still violating \n     the title or has not cured its violation as described in \n     subsection (c), then the Attorney General will bring an \n     action to enforce the title unless the property owner or \n     tenant who reported the violation has already brought an \n     action to enforce the title. In such a case, the Attorney \n     General shall intervene if it determines that intervention is \n     necessary in order to enforce the title. The Attorney General \n     may file its lawsuit to enforce the title in the appropriate \n     Federal or State court. A State shall not be immune under the \n     11th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States from \n     any such action in a Federal or State court of competent \n     jurisdiction. In such action, the defendant has the burden to \n     show by clear and convincing evidence that the taking is not \n     for economic development. The Attorney General may seek any \n     appropriate relief through a preliminary injunction or a \n     temporary restraining order.\n       (e) Limitation on Bringing Action.--An action brought by \n     the Attorney General under this title may be brought if the \n     property is used for economic development following the \n     conclusion of any condemnation proceedings condemning the \n     property of an owner or tenant who reports a violation of the \n     title to the Attorney General, but shall not be brought later \n     than seven years following the conclusion of any such \n     proceedings.\n       (f) Attorneys' Fee and Other Costs.--In any action or \n     proceeding under this title brought by the Attorney General, \n     the court shall, if the Attorney General is a prevailing \n     plaintiff, award the Attorney General a reasonable attorneys' \n     fee as part of the costs, and include expert fees as part of \n     the attorneys' fee.\n\n     SEC. _07.
