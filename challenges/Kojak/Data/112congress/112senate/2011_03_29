It is an innovation bill, and the programs this \nbill covers have done some tremendously important things for the \ncountry.\n  With the CR, I spoke with the White House this morning, and there are \nconversations going on with the White House and the Republican \nleadership in the House, and I think this matter, with a little bit of \ngood fortune, could move down the road in the next day or two to get us \nto a point where we could have something done so there doesn't have to \nbe a government shutdown. I certainly hope that is the case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1907-7", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as lawmakers return to Washington \nthis week, we did so against the backdrop of many world crises. From \nrecovery efforts in Japan, to battles everywhere from Afghanistan to \nLibya, to an unfolding economic crisis in Europe, the scope and \nintensity of world events in recent months has been nothing short of \nbreathtaking.\n  Yet in the middle of all this, it is important we not lose sight of \nthe struggles and concerns of so many around us here at home. At a time \nwhen roughly 1 in 4 American homeowners owes more money on their \nmortgage than their home is worth, at a time when nearly 1 in 10 \nworking Americans is looking for a job, at a time when the Federal debt \nhas reached heights none of us could have even imagined just a few \nyears\n\n[[Page S1908]]\n\nago, now is not the time to lose focus on the paramount issue on the \nminds of Americans every day, and that is the very real crisis we face \nwhen it comes to jobs.\n  Americans look around them and they see neighbors and friends \nstruggling to find work. Yet all they seem to get from the White House \nare policies that handcuff small businesses with burdensome new \nregulations and redtape and that create even more uncertainty about the \nfuture, including the administration's inexplicable and inexcusable \ninaction on trade deals that would level the playing field with our \ncompetitors overseas.\n  They are tired of it. Americans are tired of the White House paying \nlipservice to their struggles while quietly promoting effort after \neffort, either through legislation or some backdoor regulation, that \nmakes it harder, not easier, for businesses to create new jobs. But the \nadministration outdid itself last week, when the President told a \nBrazilian President the United States hopes to be a major customer in \nthe market for oil that Brazilian businesses plan to extract from new \noil finds off the Brazilian coast.\n  We can't make this stuff up. Here we have the administration looking \nfor just about any excuse it can find to lock up our own energy \nresources here at home, even as it is applauding another country's \nefforts to grow its own economy and create jobs by tapping into its \nenergy sources.\n  For 2 years, the administration has canceled dozens--dozens--of oil \nand gas leases all across America. It has raised permit fees. It has \nshut down deepwater drilling in the gulf. It would not even allow a \nconversation about exploring for oil in a remote 2,000-acre piece of \nland in northern Alaska that experts think represents one of our best \nopportunities for a major oil find. It continues to press for new \nregulations through the Environmental Protection Agency that would \nraise energy costs for every business in America and lead to untold \nlost jobs for more American workers.\n  In other words, in the midst of average gas prices approaching $4 a \ngallon and a chronic jobs crisis, the White House plans to make the \nclimate for job growth worse. That is why Republicans, led in the \nSenate by Senator Inhofe, have proposed legislation to prevent the new \nenergy tax from ever taking effect without congressional approval. The \nWall Street Journal has called the amendment we are proposing ``one of \nthe best proposals for growth and job creation to make it onto the \nSenate docket in years.''\n\n  Our amendment would assure small businesses across the country that \nthey will not be hit with yet another costly new job-stifling burden by \nDemocrats in Washington. It will give voters the assurance that a \nregulation of this kind, which would have a dramatic impact on so many, \ncould not be approved without their elected representatives standing \nand actually voting for it. At a time of rising energy prices, it would \nprevent Democrats in Washington from adding even more pressure to \nenergy prices than they already have out of fealty to special interests \nthat would rather we buy our energy from overseas than find and use the \nbountiful resources we already have right here at home.\n  I wish to thank Senator Inhofe, once again, for leading us on this \nissue. His bill, upon which my amendment is based, has 43 cosponsors. \nHe deserves the credit. He has been a fierce and tireless advocate not \nonly for American energy but also against new EPA regulations that \nwould sidestep the legislative process. I thank him for his work, along \nwith the great work Senators Murkowski and Barrasso have done, in \neducating the American people about these issues.\n  At a time when Americans are looking for answers on the economy, this \namendment is as good as it gets from Washington. By voting for it, we \nwould be saying no to more regulations and redtape and we would be \nsaying yes to American job creators and to the jobs they want to \ncreate. I urge my colleagues in both parties to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1908-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to speak on the current state of \npartisan budget negotiations.\n  For weeks now, the offices of the Senate majority leader, the House \nSpeaker, and the White House have been engaged in serious talks seeking \na long-term budget agreement. It has been a long hard process. There \nhave been a lot of fits and starts in the negotiations. But it is no \nexaggeration to say that as of last week talks were on a smooth path \ntoward a compromise. The Speaker's office was negotiating in good \nfaith. The parties significantly narrowed the $51 billion gap on how \nmuch spending should be cut. House Republican leaders had agreed to \ncome down from H.R. 1 and meet us halfway. We could begin to see light \nat the end of the tunnel.\n  But suddenly, at the end of last week, House Republicans did a \nstrange thing: They pulled back from the talks. They changed their \nminds about what level of spending cuts they could accept. We were on \nthe verge of a potential breakthrough, and they suddenly moved the \ngoalposts. We felt a little bit like we were left at the altar. Not \nonly did they abandon the talks, they started denying that they were \never close to a deal in the first place. Majority Leader Cantor issued \na statement Friday saying that reports that progress was being made \nwere ``far-fetched.'' It was as if they decided that even the \nappearance of a looming compromise was a political liability. It was \nsurreal.\n  It is no surprise what happened. The headline of today's story in the \nNational Journal says it all:\n\n       With Revolt Brewing, GOP Backs Off Deal.\n\n  Let me repeat that because that is really what is going on here and \nthe news of the day in the last few days:\n\n       With Revolt Brewing, GOP Backs Off Deal.\n\n  The story reads:\n\n       Concerned about a revolt by the conservative, tea party-\n     wing of the party, GOP leaders have pulled back from a \n     tentative deal to cut roughly $30 billion in cuts from \n     current spending levels. The influence that tea-party \n     conservatives now exercise over the process put the chances \n     of a compromise seriously in doubt.\n\n  The story continues:\n\n       The GOP pulled back from that agreement last week after \n     House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., and Majority Whip \n     Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., warned House Speaker John Boehner, \n     R-Ohio, that the deal would trigger a revolt from tea-party \n     conservatives.\n\n  In other words, as soon as House Republican leaders took one step \ntoward compromise, the tea party rebelled, so they took two steps back.\n  The National Journal story describes an offer that was put on the \ntable by the White House that would have met House Republicans halfway. \nThe offer falls squarely in the ballpark of Congressman Ryan's original \nbudget proposal with roughly $70 billion in spending cuts compared to \nthe President's budget request. This is a significant move in the \nRepublicans' direction. These are more cuts than many on our side might \nsupport, but it shows how seriously the White House is about wanting a \ncompromise to avert a shutdown. If they are planning to reject such an \noffer, it is clear they won't take ``yes'' for an answer and are \nseeking a shutdown. The Republican leadership in the House, with the \ntea party breathing down their back, won't take\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\n``yes'' for an answer and won't support the original proposal made by \nBudget Chairman Ryan of roughly $70 billion in spending cuts. We know \nCongressman Ryan is hardly a liberal or a moderate. It shows how far to \nthe right the Republican leadership is being forced to move by the tea \nparty.\n  This level of spending cuts was good enough for House Republicans \nearlier this year when Hal Rogers released his original proposal. But \nthe tea party hollered, and House Republicans were forced to double \ntheir proposed spending cuts to an extreme level of $61 billion. When \nthat happened, Hal Rogers said the House was moving beyond what was \nreasonable and into territory where they could never get a deal. Tom \nLatham of Iowa agreed that in forcing H.R. 1 to go from $30 billion to \n$60 billion in cuts, the tea party was forcing Republicans to go beyond \nwhat was ``enactable.'' These are conservative Republicans saying that \nthe present House proposal is not enactable, cannot pass. Just as the \ntea party forced mainstream Republicans into extreme territory before, \nthey are doing so again. Anyone who looks at this objectively sees that \nis what is happening.\n  The Speaker has said all along that he wants to avoid a shutdown at \nall costs. I believe him. He is a good man. The problem is, a large \npercentage of those in his party don't feel the same way. They think \n``compromise'' is a dirty word. They think taking any steps to avert a \nshutdown would mean being the first to blink. So Speaker Boehner is \ncaught between a shutdown and a hard place. He has caught a tiger by \nthe tail in the form of the tea party. There is even a tea party rally \nplanned for later this week to pressure the Speaker not to budge off \nH.R. 1.\n  To try to mask the divisions on their own side, Republicans have \nresorted to lashing out in a knee-jerk way at Democrats. Their latest \ntrick is trying to accuse Democrats of not having our own plan. That is \na diversion. It rings hollow. The only proposals that have been made \nthat would actually avoid a government shutdown are numerous \ncompromises that Democrats have offered Republicans.\n  I would like to remind my House friends, as they all know, the Senate \nneeds 60 votes to pass a bill. We can't pass anything without \nRepublican agreement. Yet our Senate Republican colleagues are nowhere \nto be found. Since the Senate rejected the Republican job-killing \nbudget proposal that would cost Americans 700,000 jobs a month ago, \nRepublicans have not moved an inch off their plan.\n  Speaker Boehner knows, when it comes to averting a government \nshutdown on April 8, it is the tea party, not the Democrats, that is \ncausing the trouble. At this point, the only hurdle left to a \nbipartisan deal, the only obstacle in the way is the tea party. But for \nthe tea party, we could have an agreement that reduces spending by a \nhistoric amount. We could have a deal that keeps the government open.\n  A tea party rebellion may hurt House Republican leadership \npolitically, but a shutdown will hurt Americans, all Americans, much \nmore. It is time for House Republican leaders to rip off the bandaid. \nMr. Speaker, it is time to forget the tea party and take the deal. \nThere are only 10 days left before the current CR expires. There is no \nnew stopgap being prepared by House Republicans. It seems the only \nviable proposal is the one the Speaker walked away from. So the Speaker \nfaces a choice: Return to the deal he was prepared to accept before the \ntea party rebelled last week or risk a shutdown on April 8. I think we \nknow what the right answer is. It is clear. The Speaker has a choice: \nAppease the tea party and shut down the government or take the right \nand principled stand and move the government forward by coming to a \nreasonable compromise between both parties that cuts the budget \nsignificantly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1909-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1909-S1910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             REPEAL OF 1099\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, it feels a bit like deja vu standing \nhere today discussing the ongoing saga of the 1099 repeal. Two weeks \nago, I offered amendment No. 161 to the small business bill.\n  If we read all the press releases and the public statements, it \nappears that absolutely nobody could possibly oppose repeal of the 1099 \nrequirement in section 9006 of the health care bill. Yet once again the \nother side is attempting to delay or derail the 1099 repeal by offering \na second-degree amendment. I might have been open to a second-degree \namendment when we started this process many long months ago. But now we \nare approaching the 1-year anniversary since we began fighting to \nrepeal this unnecessary mandate. It had no place in the health care \nbill in the first place.\n  I can't help but question why on Earth we are still swinging and \nmissing at this one. Is it a lack of support in my caucus? The answer \nto that is no. Support amongst Republicans is absolutely unanimous. \nLack of Republican support certainly has not held this up.\n  I ask myself if there is a lack of bipartisan support that is holding \nup the effort. The answer to that is also no. My colleague, the junior \nSenator from West Virginia, has cosponsored the last several versions \nof this repeal legislation in the Senate. Together, Senator Manchin and \nI have secured dozens of Democrats who strongly support the repeal, and \n76 Democrats voted for identical 1099 repeal in the House of \nRepresentatives. Bipartisan support is enormously, if not unusually, \nstrong.\n  Might our problem be a lack of support from the White House? The \nanswer to that is also no. The President has publicly called for repeal \nof this 1099 mandate on several occasions in press conferences. He even \nreferenced it in his State of the Union Address.\n  Is it possible there is still confusion about how our small \nbusinesses feel about the mandate? That is not the case. The chorus of \njob creators opposing this mandate is almost deafening: the chamber of \ncommerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, the American \nFarm Bureau Federation. I could go on and on listing organizations \narguing for its repeal.\n  Has it been a controversial pay-for that has slowed down progress? \nInterestingly enough, an almost identical budgetary offset passed this \nChamber unanimously only 4 months ago. Requiring someone to repay what \nwas given to them erroneously is, plain and simple, good government.\n  Even Secretary of Health and Human Services Sebelius noted that \nrepayment of improper subsidies is ``fair for recipients and all \ntaxpayers.'' So arguments about the pay-for simply are hollow excuses \nto justify inaction.\n  Our job creators are seeing it for what it really is. It is more \nnonsense. It astounds me that we can seemingly pass benchmark after \nbenchmark without going over the finish line. How can we make so much \nimportant progress only to be stymied again and again by some silent \nopposition?\n\n  My friends across the aisle have often complained about the slow pace \nof the Senate. They have blamed the other side of the aisle for \npreventing progress. Well, my side of the aisle has been ready for a \nlong time to repeal this job-killing mandate. I want you to know we \nstand ready to vote.\n  Considering the high unemployment rates plaguing our country, it \nseems absolutely incomprehensible that we would waste even another day \nwithout addressing this mandate in the health care bill. Our job \ncreators have watched dueling amendments and proposals and \ncounterproposals. Well, that has gone on for 1 year.\n  I first circulated a Dear Colleague letter asking for cosponsors of \nthis 1099 repeal in June of last year. When we introduced it in July, \nwith 25 cosponsors, well, small businesses cheered. It gave them hope \ncommon sense would prevail in Congress and that partisanship is \nsometimes set aside to simply do the right thing.\n  But now they see there is yet again a delay tactic in the form of a \nsecond-degree amendment to the 1099 repeal. They have been frustrated \ntime and time again--when it failed to advance in September and \nNovember and appeared stalled well into the new year.\n  Today, we have a simple choice: We can pass my amendment with strong \nbipartisan support and demonstrate we have the 60 votes necessary for \nthe House version or we can pass the second-degree amendment and push \nthis repeal off into limbo into Never Never Land yet again. We can \nactually fix the problem in a bipartisan way or we can continue to kick \nthis can down the road.\n\n[[Page S1910]]\n\n  If we pass the second-degree amendment, quite simply, what we have \nvoted yes to do is delay the repeal of the 1099 amendment and \neventually we are going to flirt with disaster on this and it will not \nget done.\n  We need to focus all our energy on helping our job creators grow and \ncreate more jobs, not force them into worrying about hiring more \naccountants. Pardon my boldness but there is no reason to delay. An \nidentical version of my amendment passed the House with large \nbipartisan support: 314 to 112. I urge my colleagues, with all I have, \nto oppose the second-degree amendment my friend from New Jersey is \nproposing.\n  Let's be clear. This latest distraction from 1099 repeal is just \nthat--it is a distraction. We all know it is not truly about a study to \nlook at health care costs. If we want to do a study, put the amendment \non some other piece of legislation. This is about derailing and \ndelaying the 1099 repeal because if the second-degree amendment passes, \nit says: Instead of sending this to the President to become law, we \nneed to go back to the drawing board.\n  While the proponents of the second-degree amendment will claim it is \ninnocuous, make no mistake, it is designed to obliterate this amendment \nbecause of a budgetary offset. Again, I remind us, a similar offset was \npassed unanimously recently by the Senate. Just like a Politico article \nfrom yesterday noted: ``Senate Democrats are working on an amendment \nthat could kill the [Republicans' pay-for in the future].''\n  If the second degree passes, then we are essentially adding nearly \n$25 billion to our debt over the next 10 years. While some may preach \nthe virtues of pay-as-you-go rules, when it comes right down to it, \nthey will undermine virtually any fiscally responsible pay-for.\n  So here we are again crossing the same bridge we have crossed so many \ntimes before. In fact, the Senate refused this idea when we rejected \nthe Baucus amendment that repealed 1099 but was not paid for. That \namendment fell 23 votes short of passage because it fiscally did not \nmake sense.\n  So why are we still here aimlessly walking around in circles when we \nought to be marching straight ahead? Why are we proposing to send this \nbipartisan legislation back to the House? Because that is what will \nhave to happen, when it ought to go directly to the President's desk \nfor signature.\n  Our vote today can send a message that we have all the votes \nnecessary to get this done and get it on the President's desk and \neverybody can celebrate: our job creators, Democrats, Republicans, \nIndependents.\n  The logic of the second-degree amendment is absolutely baffling. Here \nwe are in the ninth inning and somehow our pay-for has become magically \nunacceptable, even after a similar pay-for was approved unanimously by \nthe Senate before. Where were all the objections? Where was the demand \nfor further study when we unanimously approved a similar offset for the \ndoc fix legislation?\n  Let me be very clear: A vote in favor of the second degree is a vote \nagainst our business and job creators. My amendment has been waiting \nfor a vote for 14 days now, and the repeal has been pending for nearly \n1 year. Isn't enough enough?\n  The time for delay and further study must be over. Let's pass my \namendment today by an overwhelming vote of the Senate. Let's reject the \nsecond degree. Let's get this piece of legislation to the President for \nhis signature and we can all celebrate. Small businesses, our job \ncreators, deserve no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1910-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1910-S1912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GOVERNMENT SPENDING\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, government funding is set to expire \nnext week on April 8. We are in the midst of the 2011 fiscal year that \nends September 30, and the Congress has only appropriated money through \nApril 8. If Congress does not act by that time, the government would \nshut down.\n  Congress needs to act, but Congress needs to listen to the American \npeople and listen to the financial experts whom we have dealt with and \nreduce spending and reduce the surging deficit we face this year, last \npredicted to be $1.4 trillion. Nothing has ever been seen like it \nbefore, and it has to be addressed. There is no way around it.\n  So we have this deadline hanging over our heads, and the reason is, \nmy colleagues in the Democratic leadership in the Senate will not agree \nto the kind of substantial but realistic spending reductions the House \nof Representatives has sent to us. The House has sent us a budget plan \nthat I think will work. But what we hear is, the sky will fall if we \ntrim the $61 billion from a $3.7 trillion budget--$3,700 billion that \nwe spend--if we reduce that spending by $61 billion, somehow this will \ncause the country to sink into oblivion.\n  The American people know better than that. That is not realistic. Of \ncourse, we can cut those kinds of numbers out of this huge budget we \nhave, and the American people will be better off for it.\n  As ranking member on the Budget Committee, I have looked at the \nnumbers, and that $61 billion reduces the baseline of Federal spending \nby $61 billion this year, but over 10 years--because it is a baseline \nreduction--it would save $860 billion. This is the kind of small but \nsignificant step that does make a difference.\n  People say: It does not make any difference. Why don't we just \nincrease spending? Why do we cut spending at all? Of course, we have to \nreduce spending. The American people know the borrowed money and \noverspending of the past 2 years have failed to produce what it \npromised. Instead, all that has been achieved through this massive \nsurge in Federal spending, through the stimulus package and other \nprograms, is a crushing debt burden that weakens our economy and is a \ndrag on our economy, as expert witnesses have told us. It threatens our \neconomic future. Alan Simpson, former Republican Senator, and Erskine \nBowles, formerly the Chief of Staff to President Clinton, were \nappointed by President Obama to cochair the debt commission. The fiscal \ncommission reported to us, and jointly they submitted a written \nstatement that said if the United States fails to act, it faces ``the \nmost predictable economic crisis in its history.'' This is a real \nwarning. They said such a crisis could arrive in as soon as 1 or 2 \nyears.\n  People have been saying: Oh, we are on the wrong track. If we do not \nget off it, in 3 or 4 or 5 years, we are going to have a crisis. More \nand more people are warning us that crisis is sooner. Mr. Bowles said: \nIn 1 year, give or take a little bit, we will have a crisis. Mr. \nSimpson said: I think within 1 year.\n  The American people rightly expect their elected leaders to confront \nthis threat with seriousness and candor. But the President has never \nonce looked the American people in the eyes and told them the truth \nabout the financial crisis we face. Has he ever discussed those kinds \nof words with the American people, that we face an actual crisis? We \ncould have a debt problem that hits us very quickly, just like the one \nin 2008 that put us in a deep recession. We are in a fragile recovery \nnow, and we need to keep that recovery going. The last thing we need to \ndo is have another recession, or some sort of other financial collapse \nthat puts more people out of work and weakens an already struggling \neconomy. It is not necessary this occur.\n  The President and his Budget Director have, instead of being truthful \nwith us, falsely boasted to the American people that under their budget \nwe will ``live within our means'' and ``not add more to the debt'' and \nthat ``we're not going to spend any more money than we're taking in.'' \nHe submitted his 10-year budget to the Congress, and that is what he \nsays his budget will do. But not one of those statements is true--not \none.\n  When the budget was announced, Mr. Bowles, whom the President \nappointed to head the debt commission, said it is nowhere close to what \nwe need to be doing to get our house in order. In fact, the \nCongressional Budget Office finds this: that our annual deficits never \nonce fall below $748 billion. I was saying $600 billion before based on \nthe President's estimates of his budget. Now the Congressional Budget \nOffice has done an independent analysis of the President's budget, and \nthey say the lowest single annual deficit, in 10 years, would be $748 \nbillion.\n\n[[Page S1911]]\n\n  Is it going down, you ask? Is this budget going to put us living \nwithin our means and live on what we take in? In the outyears, the \ndeficits out 7, 8, 9, 10 years of the President's budget, they are \ngoing up. In the 10th year, the budget deficit is $1.2 trillion--a \n$1,200 billion deficit that year.\n  You might ask: What do those numbers mean? We spend, this year, about \n$3.7 trillion through September 30. We take in $2.2 trillion. This is \nwhy we are on an unsustainable path and we have to get off of it. It is \nnot a partisan matter; it is a matter of facing reality. We still have \nMembers of the Senate in denial. We have the majority leader down here \ncomplaining that he might not get money for his cowboy poetry festival \nin Nevada. Give me a break. This country is headed on the path of great \ndanger and we need to turn around.\n\n  Imagine the fate a CEO would face if, in the process of asking for \nshareholders to buy company stock, he declared, ``We are not adding to \nthe debt,'' while his accountants were telling him the company's debt \nwas on a path to double, as our debt is. The President even nominated a \ndeputy director for OMB, Heather Higginbottom, who has no budget \nexperience and who attempted to defend these claims before the Budget \nCommittee last week. I don't know, maybe they couldn't find anybody \nwith experience who would take the job. The best I can tell, she has \nnever had a single business course or an economics course, never \nmanaged any kind of organization on budget, ever. She majored, I think, \nin political science and campaigned for President Obama and Senator \nJohn Kerry.\n  We need some seriousness here. We in Congress are not stepping up to \nthe plate, frankly. We are not taking the kind of decisive action \nneeded to curb our rising debt. And the majority leader, my good \nfriend, Senator Reid--which is a tough job, I have to tell my \ncolleagues; it is a tough job--but now he is saying the problem is \nthere is a division within the Republican Party. You see, we have these \nextremists over here, the new Republicans who got elected the last \nelection promising to do something about spending and they are out of \ntouch. They are extremists. There are some good Republicans over here. \nThey have been here a long time, and we know how to get along and cut \ndeals and we are going to take care of this thing. You just have to \nkeep these people under control.\n  I might remind the leader that every single Republican either voted \nfor the $61 billion in cuts or called for more cuts. There is no \ndivision in the Republican Party about the need to have reasonable and \nsignificant reductions in the expenditures. There is essentially \nunanimous Republican agreement that we ought to cut $61 billion or more \nfrom this year's discretionary budget. By contrast, the majority leader \nlost nearly one-fifth of his caucus on his proposal, which was \nbasically to do nothing--reduce spending by $4 billion. Ten Members or \nmore defected. They knew that wasn't enough, even under pressure from \nthe President and from the majority leader. So it is clear where the \nmomentum lies.\n  I wish to repeat again, though: This is not and cannot be seen as a \npartisan squabble. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve talked to us a \nfew weeks ago, and he submitted a written statement to the Budget \nCommittee. This is what Mr. Bernanke said. He talked about the \nCongressional Budget Office debt projections. I have made some \nreference to those and how dangerous they show our path to be.\n  This is what Chairman Bernanke said:\n\n       The CBO projections, by design, ignore the adverse effects \n     that such high debt and deficits would likely have on our \n     economy. But if government debt and deficits were actually to \n     grow at the pace envisioned in this scenario, the economic \n     and financial effects would be severe. Diminishing confidence \n     on the part of investors that deficits will be brought under \n     control would likely lead to sharply rising interest rates on \n     government debt and potentially to broader financial turmoil. \n     Moreover, high rates of government borrowing would both drain \n     funds away from private capital formation and increase our \n     foreign indebtedness, with adverse long-run effects on U.S. \n     output, incomes, and standard of living.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       It is widely understood that the federal Government is on \n     an unsustainable fiscal path. Yet, as a nation, we have done \n     little to address this critical threat to our economy. Doing \n     nothing will not be an option indefinitely; the longer we \n     wait to act, the greater the risks and the more wrenching the \n     inevitable changes to the budget will be. By contrast, the \n     prompt adoption of a credible program to reduce future \n     deficits would not only enhance the economic growth and \n     stability in the long run, but could also yield substantial \n     near-term benefits in terms of lower long-term interest rates \n     and increased consumer and business confidence.\n\n  This is the head of the Federal Reserve, the man supposedly most \nknowledgeable about the economy of the United States of America. We are \nnot making this up.\n  We have a proposal from our Democratic majority in the Senate to do \nnothing, basically--to do zero, nada--despite this kind of warning.\n  We are living in a fantasy world if we don't think we can cut $61 \nbillion from this budget. My friend John McMillan, just elected the \ndirector of Agriculture and Industries in Alabama, is facing a critical \ncrisis in his department. I saw the headline in the paper. He has 200 \nemployees. He is going to have to lay off 60 of them. Cities and \ncounties are doing this kind of thing all over the country. Do we think \nthe State of Alabama will cease to exist if that happens? It is sad \nthat they have that kind of challenge before them. We don't have to do \nthat much right now, but if we took those kinds of steps--something \nsignificant--we could make a bigger difference than a lot of people \nrealize in the debt we are facing.\n  Governor Cuomo in New York and Governor Christie in New Jersey and \nGovernor Brown in California and others all over the country are making \nreal, significant alterations in the level of spending, while we worry \nabout protecting the cowboy poetry festival in Nevada.\n  Remember this--people have forgotten this. Since President Obama took \noffice, Congress has increased discretionary spending on our non-\ndefense Federal programs by 24 percent. We didn't have the money for \nthat. We never should have increased spending that much. It was a big \nerror. But we know what they said: Don't worry, we are making \ninvestments in the future. But you have to have money to make \ninvestments. If you don't have money, how can you make investments? All \nof this increase was borrowed. We are in huge debt and when we increase \nspending, we have to borrow the money to increase spending. Every penny \nis borrowed. We did an $800 billion stimulus package. Every penny was \nborrowed. We pay $30 billion-plus a year interest on that borrowed \nmoney for as long as I am alive and longer, no doubt. There is no plan \nto pay off that debt. I know people are talking and they are working \nthings out and they said they are going to try to reach a compromise so \nwe don't have to shut down the government, and I certainly hope that is \ntrue. But I do not believe we need any tax-and-spend compromise. I will \nnot support that. I don't think the American people will support it, \neither. They know we spend too much. They know we have ramped up \nspending $800 billion with the stimulus package, that nondefense \ndiscretionary spending has gone up 24 percent in 2 years, and they know \nwe can reduce Federal spending without this country sinking into the \nocean. That is what they expect us to do. That is what Governors and \nmayors are doing, county commissioners are doing, all over my State and \nall over America.\n\n  We have to recognize that Washington is spending too much--not taxing \ntoo little. How can we ask Americans to pay more in taxes when \nWashington is not even willing to cut $61 billion?\n  I have a proposition for my colleagues who wish to raise taxes before \nwe consider asking the American people to pay another cent in taxes: \nWhy don't we first drain every cent of waste from the Federal \nbureaucracy? We will never truly dig ourselves out of this crisis and \nput this Nation on a real path to prosperity unless we bring our \nspending under control. America's strength is measured not by the size \nof our government but by the scope of our freedoms and the vigor and \nvitality of the American people and their willingness to invest and \nwork hard for the future. That is what makes us strong. Endless \nspending, taxing, and borrowing is a certain path to decline, and we \nare on that path today, and we must get out of it.\n  We know the threat. We know what we need to do. The economy is trying\n\n[[Page S1912]]\n\nto rebound. So let's take some good steps today. Let's pass this $61 \nbillion reduction in spending this fiscal year. It will amount to about \n$860 billion over 10 years. It will be a very significant first step. \nThat is what is before us today--not the other issues. We have to \ndecide what we are going to do about funding the government between now \nand September 30. That is the rest of this fiscal year. Let's take a \nfirm step on that. Let's begin to look at what we are going to do for \nnext year's budget and what we are going to do about our surging \nentitlement programs that are on an unsustainable course. We can do all \nof those things and leave our country healthy and vigorous and \nprosperous for the future. I truly believe that is the kind of thing we \nneed to be doing now.\n  I am baffled that we don't know why the President is not leading \nmore. He is not talking directly to the American people about why this \nis important. Is it just a political squabble to be ignored, with the \nPresident going to Rio and talking about Libya? Or is it true, as Mr. \nBernanke says, we are on an unsustainable path? Or is it true that Mr. \nErskine Bowles, the President's own director of the fiscal commission, \nsays that we are facing the most predictable economic crisis in this \ncountry's history, and he said it could happen within 2 years? Are we \nmaking this up?\n  The American people get it. They say, What is going on in Washington? \nYou have to get your house in order. That is what this past election \nwas about. People understand we need some action and some leadership, \nbut we are not getting it. I truly believe if we could get together and \nif we could get a bipartisan effort to look at this $61 billion--we \ncould disagree on how to reduce that spending; maybe the Republicans \nhave this idea and the Democrats have this idea--let's work all of that \nout. But let's reach an agreement that actually reduces spending by \nenough to make a difference. Then the world would say, Wow, now the \nCongress is beginning to take some steps. That was a nice, good, strong \nfirst step. Now if they will stay on that path, maybe the United States \nis going to get on the road to prosperity again and stay out of this \ndangerous debt crisis area we are in today and get on the right path to \nprosperity. This country is ready to grow. It is ready to rebound. It \njust needs a clear signal from Washington, in my opinion.\n  America's leaders, those of us in this Congress, have no higher duty, \nno greater moral responsibility, than to take all appropriate steps to \nprotect the good people we serve from the clear and present danger we \nface.\n  It is time to get busy about it, Madam President. I believe if we act \nstrongly and with clarity the American people will not only support it \nbut they will be happy with it, and it will make a positive difference \nfor our country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later, as we move to the bill on small \nbusiness, I will be offering, I hope, a second-degree amendment to the \namendment offered by Senator Johanns, and I speak today on behalf of \nmiddle-class families and on behalf of small businesses.\n  I wish to start by saying that I fully support--as I have already \ndone in a series of votes--repealing the 1099 reporting requirement, \nbut I strongly believe we have to do so in a manner that does not--does \nnot--increase the burden on our small businesses and employees. The \namendment of Senator Johanns certainly helps only small businesses \nthrough the repeal of the 1099 provision, but--and this is less well-\nknown--I believe it actually hurts small business employees. It is a \ndouble-edged sword. The Johanns amendment risks driving up health \ninsurance costs and cutting health insurance coverage for small \nbusinesses.\n  As you know, the affordable care act provides tax credits to families \nwho earn under $74,000 per year to help them purchase health insurance. \nThose tax credits are set at the start of the year. At tax time, when \nfamilies actually report their annual income, the tax credits are \nreconciled with their annual household income to ensure they receive \nthe correct amount of assistance. But because income and other family \ncircumstances can change during the course of a year, individuals might \nend up getting excess tax credits even though the amount of the payment \nwas correct at the time.\n  For example, a family with an unemployed worker who secures a job at \na small business midway through the year--and, hopefully, can do so, as \nwe continue to work on this economy to have it grow--has rightfully \nreceived a tax credit while unemployed but could face a stiff tax hike \nto repay the amount of the subsidy because the family's annual income \nends up higher for the second half of the year. This family received \nthe correct amount and did nothing wrong. Let me say that again. These \nindividuals did nothing wrong. While unemployed, these individuals \nneeded those tax credits to be able to get health insurance. That is \nwhy we passed this reform, to help those very same middle-class working \nfamilies in need.\n  Now, under current law, we provide a reasonable repayment requirement \nif the tax credit an individual receives exceeds the amount they should \nhave received because of unexpected changes in income or family status. \nWe don't give them a pass, but we don't expect all families with an \nannual income of $70,000 to have $10,000 in savings to pay the surprise \ntax bill they will get in April, either. So we set caps on what they \nwould have to pay back depending on what they earn. The Johanns \namendment makes harmful changes to these repayments for middle-class \nfamilies. Under the Johanns amendment, some families could have to pay \nback as much as $12,000 in some cases, and that is too high a price. We \nshouldn't ask small business employees to take that much of a hit. They \nare the ones who are going to the exchanges to purchase coverage. They \nare the ones working for the mom-and-pop shop that doesn't offer \ncoverage.\n  My amendment isn't about these families alone, however, as difficult \na situation as they may be in. This amendment is about what the Johanns \noffset could do to health care costs and coverage for small businesses \nand for those who make their living from small businesses. This risky \noffset could drive up premiums and force more individuals to refuse \ncoverage. We are not talking about paying back tax credits; we are \ntalking about driving up the costs on families and small businesses, \nmany who have never even taken a tax credit to begin with.\n  My amendment would simply direct the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to decide the offset in the Johanns amendment and determine \nits effect on small business. What is so wrong about that--determining \nits effect on small business? We are trying to help small businesses by \neliminating the 1099 provision. Let's make sure we continue to help \nthem and not put extra costs on them. Specifically, we want to \ndetermine whether there is an increase in health insurance costs or a \ndecrease in health coverage for small businesses. If the study finds \neither, then current safe harbor provisions would remain in effect--the \nsame safe harbors we supported in the SGR bill, or the doc fix, in \nDecember.\n  Passing 1099 would not be affected. That would move forward. So the \nclaim that somehow, ultimately, 1099 wouldn't be eliminated is false. \nThe 1099 would not be affected. That would move forward. We would \neliminate that responsibility from small businesses. So you can be both \nfor my amendment and the Johanns amendment because it would still \nrepeal 1099.\n  Let me make it clear. We all want 1099 repealed, and I have voted in \na series of ways to do exactly that. My amendment does not in any way \naffect or delay the repeal of 1099. The only potential change my \namendment makes would be to the risky offset in the underlying \namendment and only if this study finds that it actually hurts small \nbusinesses.\n\n[[Page S1913]]\n\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have come to the floor \narguing that a study would simply delay repeal of 1099; that further \nstudying this risky offset would prolong the 1099 issue; that if we \njust passed the amendment without protecting small businesses, this \nbill can go right to the President. Well, we have actually passed 1099 \nrepeal already and shown we have the votes necessary to make this \nbecome law. It is not going to the President to become law in this bill \nbecause this bill hasn't even cleared the House.\n  At the same time, I have heard no mention of what this offset could \ndo to small businesses and their health care costs--not one word. I did \nhear that further studying the impacts it may have on small businesses \nwould only delay repeal of 1099. A simple read of my amendment would be \nenough to know that is incorrect. My amendment directs a study to be \ndone after--after--repeal of 1099 is signed into law. Let me make it \nclear. Nothing in my amendment slows down repeal of 1099.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are also trying to frame \nthis debate as either you are for or against small businesses. But they \nare helping and harming them at the same time with the Johanns \namendment. With this second-degree amendment, we can have a \nconversation about helping small businesses and ensuring that small \nbusiness employees will not get hurt at the end of the day.\n  Now, we haven't had the Joint Tax Committee determine a revenue score \nas yet, but it is important to point out that this amendment does not \nspend--does not spend--an additional dime. It simply protects small \nbusinesses from higher health care costs and coverage cuts.\n  If there is any revenue score associated with it, that would only be \ndue to the study finding that this offset drives up health care costs \nor drives down health coverage for small businesses. Would we not want \nto know that?\n  We are all here supposedly arguing to try to enhance the opportunity \nfor small businesses to have less burdens, to be able to grow, to be \nable to prosper, to be able to create jobs. Well, we certainly would \nwant to know--we certainly would want to know whether this offset \ndrives up health care costs associated with small businesses or drives \ndown the health care coverage for small businesses.\n  Why is anyone afraid of that? Why is anyone fearful of that? So to \nthose who may consider opposing my amendment, think of this: On the one \nhand, if you do not believe this offset will hurt small businesses, \nthere is no harm in voting for it because you believe the study will \nnot show premium increases or coverage cuts. So the offset would remain \nin place. If you believe my amendment would have a revenue score, then \nyou are assuming the offset hurts small businesses. It is one way or \nthe other, not a gray area.\n  The idea of protecting small businesses in this manner has precedent. \nI have a history working across the aisle to support small businesses, \nincluding cosponsoring a Republican amendment to the Wall Street reform \nbill which requires regulators to ensure new rules do not harm small \nbusinesses. We thought it was a good idea then to protect small \nbusinesses in the event new rules might unfairly impact them. I \nstrongly believe we should come together now to protect small \nbusinesses if this risky offset drives up health care costs on small \nbusinesses or forces cuts in their coverage.\n  I would just simply ask, who in the world, especially during these \nfragile economic times, would want to do anything that could raise \ncosts on small businesses? Let's protect them and the 1099 repeal by \nsupporting my second-degree amendment.\n  Now, I listened to my colleague from Nebraska with whom I have worked \non some bipartisan efforts on housing for the disabled. We get along \nvery well. I respect him, and actually I supported 1099 repeal as one \nof the 20 Democrats who voted for his amendment in November and other \nissues such as housing for the disabled. So it is with some regret that \nwe find ourselves in a different view.\n  There have been questions raised about the sincerity of our \nopposition to the manner in which the offset is included in the \nSenator's amendment. The Senator from Nebraska says an almost identical \noffset was passed unanimously by the Senate just 4 months ago. I think \nour definitions of ``almost identical'' are very different.\n  Yes, it is true we made changes in the payback tax to pay for the doc \nfix in December, but that provision was very different from the one we \nare debating today. The one today, unlike before, removes protections \nwe included in December in the doc fix to protect families from \nunlimited tax liability which could be as high as $12,000. I mean, you \nare talking about taxing these families, through no fault of their own. \nWhat family of three making $74,000 annually, gross, can afford an \nunexpected $12,000 tax bill in April? I cannot think of many. But that \nis exactly what could happen under the Senator's amendment.\n  That was not the case--not the case--in the provision that was \nenacted at the end of last year in the doc fix. We provided a phaseout \nthat would have avoided this clip and thus tax shock on middle-class \nfamilies.\n  The Senator from Nebraska also said my second-degree amendment was \njust a delay tactic. That simply is not true. I and 80 of my colleagues \nhave already passed 1099 repeal in the Senate this year. So to question \nour support for 1099 repeal would be misleading.\n  My understanding is that the Johanns proposal is an amendment to the \nsmall business bill we are debating, which has not passed the House. So \nthis amendment we are debating today would not go directly to the \nPresident for his signature. It still needs to go through the whole \nprocess of the House. We are not delaying anything in that regard.\n  Finally, the only way there would be any revenue shortfall--I say to \nthose who would make the assertion that our amendment creates a revenue \nshortfall, well, then, what you have to be saying, if you make that \nstatement, is you believe the savings from the Johanns offset comes \nfrom increasing premiums and reducing coverage on those who earn it \nthrough making our Nation's small businesses run. That is not a \nproposition I think they want to assert.\n  So I will come back to the floor later to offer this second-degree \namendment. And because it works to both repeal 1099 and ensure there is \nnot a tax on our small businesses and small business employees or a \ndiminution of health care coverage, I am sure we will get the support \nof our colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1913-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, could I ask the Chair--I know we are \ndiscussing the bill. But do we have a time constraint? I understand \nthat at 12 o'clock there may be some additional commentary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no formal time constraints at this \ntime.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Let me try to recap for just a moment because it is my \nunderstanding there may be some colleagues coming down to the Senate \nfloor around 12 o'clock to pay tribute to an extraordinary woman and \nextraordinary American, Geraldine Ferraro, whom we lost this week. I \nmost certainly want to be respectful to the Members who are coming to \nthe floor to pay tribute to our former colleague and an extraordinary \nleader. But let me remind colleagues we are still trying to get to this \nbill, an important bill for the country, an important bill to help put \nthis recession in our rearview mirror, an important bill that gives us \nyet one more very carefully crafted tool to help create jobs on Main \nStreet, in rural areas, in suburban areas, and in urban areas all \nacross this country; that is, the 8-year reauthorization of the Small \nBusiness Innovation and Research Program and Small Business Technology \nTransfer Program.\n\n  This program is approximately 20 years old, first passed by Senator \nWarren Rudman, when a report found its way to Congress that said, \nalarmingly, agencies of the Federal Government, whether it was the \nDepartment of Defense or NASA or NIH, were not accessing the power and \nthe technology of the small business community; that when they went out \nto do research they were just looking at research offered by either \njust universities and we are very proud of the work that our \nuniversities do, but they were looking at large businesses. What did GE \nhave to offer? What did IBM have to offer?\n  It occurred to many Members of Congress at that time that there was a \ntremendous amount of brain power and agility and quickness and cutting-\nedge, innovative technologies resting in the minds and hearts and \ndreams of entrepreneurs and small businesses in America the taxpayers \nwere not benefiting from.\n  As you can imagine, people might think of all this technology coming \nout of New York or California. They might skip over a place such as \nMontana where the Presiding Officer is from or Louisiana where this \nSenator is from. So there were some very wise Members who said: Let's \ncreate a program that will direct at least a portion of the research \nand development funding of these large agencies so small businesses can \ncompete.\n  Now, these are grants not given out by formula or on a first-come/\nfirst-served basis. These grants and contracts are given out based on \nmerit, about what looks promising, about potential, and about what the \ntaxpayers need in terms of dealing with problems.\n  One thing that comes immediately to mind is the terrible tragedy \nunfolding in Japan as we speak with the potential meltdown, the process \nof a nuclear reactor melting down. Some of the technology being \ndeployed to that situation, which is technology developed in the field \nof robotics, was developed, a portion of it, through this SBIR Program. \nSo that makes very relevant the debate that we are having on the floor \ntoday.\n  When people go home and now are turning on their televisions or \nlistening to their radios or over the Internet following those \nunfolding dramatic developments in Japan, they know that one of the \ncompanies that has been deployed and some of the material from the \nUnited States actually was developed through this program. So that is \njust one of a thousand examples that Senator Snowe and I have provided \nin terms of testimony before the Small Business Committee to the \nCongressional Record, and in our numerous speeches on the floor to talk \nabout the importance of this program.\n  I would like, as the manager of this bill--I am not sure it is going \nto be possible, but I would most certainly like to have this bill voted \non and passed by the end of this week. I am not sure the leadership has \ndecided that is something that is possible. But I would like to send a \nstrong bill over to the House--hopefully, a bill that does not have \namendments on it that would warrant a Presidential threat of a veto--\nand get this bill passed through the House and then passed on to the \nPresident so he can sign it and send a very positive signal for his \nagenda and all of our agendas for innovation--having America be the \nbest educated, the best competitors in the world in terms of the \neconomy, and giving our small businesses yet another tool.\n  We have worked on reducing the abuses in the credit card industry. We \nhave worked on capital access through a new lending program. We have \nreduced fees, reduced taxes to the tune of $12 billion to our small \nbusinesses throughout the country in the last Congress. We want to \ncontinue to work on lowering taxes where we can, eliminating \nregulations and supporting programs like this that work.\n  Let's eliminate or modify those programs that are not working, and \nlet's step up our support and reauthorize the programs that are. The \nassessments done and the reviews of this program by the independent \nresearchers have been very positive across the board and outstanding.\n  Senator Snowe and I have taken into consideration those many reports \nin the drafting of this bill and made some changes to the program so \nthat as it moves forward for the 8 years it will even be better.\n  One of my key goals and objectives is to make sure States such as \nLouisiana or Mississippi or Montana or Wyoming, States that have not \npreviously been awarded many of these grants, know we have stepped up \nsome technical assistance and help so we can find the best technology \nin this country to apply to some of our most pressing problems, \nregardless of whether they are in the big cities and big places such as \nNew York, Los Angeles, CA. But we need our entrepreneurs around the \ncountry to benefit by a program that they have access to as well.\n  So I am pleased that we can get back on the small business innovation \nand research bill and small business technology transfer bill. Senator \nSnowe and I will be coming to the floor periodically during the day to \ncontinue to move this bill along.\n  I see my colleague, the Senator from Maryland, who is scheduled to \nspeak in just a few minutes. So at this time I will yield the floor. \nAgain, I hope, and I thank our colleagues for their cooperative nature \nthat they have been working in in terms of trying to get our bill \npassed that will be so important to so many people in all of our \nStates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1914-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1914-S1920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING GERALDINE FERRARO\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be permitted to speak for 5 minutes each on the \nsubject of Geraldine Ferraro: Senators Boxer, Hutchison, Stabenow, \nShaheen, Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We come to the floor with a heavy heart and great \nsadness. Geraldine Ferraro, a former Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, a Congresswoman from New York who was the first woman \nto be nominated by a major party for Vice President, has lost her \ngallant and persistent fight against cancer and has passed away.\n  I thank the leadership for offering the resolution noting the many \ncontributions she made to America and to express condolences to her \nfamily.\n  For we women, before 1960, Gerry was a force of nature, a powerhouse. \nShe changed American politics. She changed the way women thought of \nthemselves and what we believed we could accomplish.\n  On July 11, 1984, when Walter Mondale called Gerry Ferraro and asked \nher to be his Vice Presidential running mate, an amazing thing \nhappened. They took down the ``men only'' sign on the White House. For \nGerry and all American women, there was no turning back, only going \nforward.\n\n[[Page S1915]]\n\n  America knows Gerry as a political phenomenon. I knew her as a dear \nfriend and colleague. We served in the House together in the late \n1970s. She left in 1984 to run for Vice President, and I left in 1986 \nto run for the Senate. We were among the early-bird women in the House \nof Representatives. And as early birds, we were not afraid to ruffle \nsome feathers. We had some good times and passed some good legislation. \nIt must be historically noted that when Gerry came to the House in \n1979, only 16 women were there. In 1984, when she left, we had moved to \n23. But in 2011, on the day of her death, 74 women now serve in the \nHouse, 50 Democrats, 24 Republicans, and 26 of those women are women of \ncolor.\n  In the Congress, Gerry was a fighter. She was a fighter for New York. \nShe fought for transit, for tunnels. She loved earmarks, earmarks that \nwould help move her community forward. She also fought for the little \nguy and gal. She was known for her attention to constituent services--\nthe senior getting a Social Security check, the vet who needed his \ndisability benefits, the kid from a blue-collar neighborhood like \nherself who wanted to go to college. And she fought for women. She \nfought for our status and she gave us a new stature.\n  When the campaign was over, she continued for all of her life to be a \nsource of inspiration and empowerment for women. In those early days of \nthe second wave of the American women's movement, the movement defined \nwomen on what we did not have, what we did not have access to. What was \nit we didn't have? Equal pay for equal work. It is hard to believe we \nwere not included in research protocols at NIH. And when it came to \nhaving access to credit, we could not get a loan or a mortgage in our \nown name in many circumstances. We needed a husband, a father, or a \nbrother to sign for it. But when Gerry was chosen for Vice President, \nshe showed us what we could be, what modern women in America had \nbecome. Women felt if we could go for the White House, we could go for \nanything. Gerry inspired.\n  On the night of July 19, 1984, in San Francisco at the Mosconi \nCenter, Gerry gave her acceptance speech. She became the first woman to \nbe nominated for Vice President for a major party. What a night. I was \nthere--the thrill, the excitement in the room, the turbo energy that \nwas there: 10,000 people jammed the Mosconi Center. Guy delegates gave \ntheir tickets away to alternates, to their daughters, to people who \nworked and helped out. They wanted to be there. People brought their \nchildren. They carried them. They put them on their shoulders to see \nwhat was about to occur.\n  When Gerry Ferraro walked on that stage, she electrified all of us. \nThe convention gave her a 10-minute standing and resounding ovation. We \ncouldn't sit down because we knew a barrier had been broken. And for \nthe rest, as she history, there would be more on the way.\n  The campaign was hard fought. She traveled over 55,000 miles, visited \n85 cities, campaigned her heart out. But it was not meant to be. The \nticket lost to Reagan-Bush. But though she lost the election, she did \nnot lose her way. Gerry never gave up and never gave in. Her storied \ncareer continued: a teacher at Harvard, a U.N. Ambassador on human \nrights, always teaching, always inspiring, always empowering thousands \nof women here and around the world.\n  Then in 1998, she was diagnosed with blood cancer. Once again, she \nwas determined not to give up and not to give in. She began the \ngreatest campaign of her life. She began the campaign for her own life. \nShe fought her cancer. She not only fought her cancer, she also fought \nfor cancer victims. She forged a relationship with Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison as well as my friendship. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison will \ntell the story herself. Her brother Allan Bailey suffered from the same \ndisease as Gerry. They met through an advocacy group on multiple \nmyeloma. Allan Bailey and Gerry Ferraro joined hands and joined \ntogether and Kay Bailey Hutchison and I did, and we introduced the \nGerry Ferraro Research Investment and Education Act. I wanted it to be \nFerraro-Bailey, but Allan graciously said, Gerry is a marquis name. She \nwill attract a lot of attention, and we can get more money for research \nand more interest in this dreaded disease.\n  That legislation passed. It showed sometimes when we come together \nout of common adversity, we find common cause and we get things done. \nThat bill passed, and it is changing lives.\n  Gerry did various clinical trials. Often we talked. This is what she \nsaid to me during the last few weeks. She said: I am glad I could be in \nthose clinical trials. In many ways they helped me live. But we also \nknew the research would provide lessons so that others could live. Once \nagain, her mantra was: Never give up, never give in. She had toughness, \npersistence, tenacity, and unfailing optimism in the face of adversity.\n  I believe it came from her own compelling and often riveting story. \nIt was that personal story that brought us together. We were both from \nEuropean ethnic backgrounds: She Italian, my proud Polish heritage. We \ngrew up in neighborhoods that were urban villages. Her father owned a \nsmall neighborhood dime store. My father owned a grocery store, and \nthey were very much involved with their customers and community. We had \nstrong mothers who wanted to make sure we had good educations. When \nGerry's dad died, Gerry's mother took a job in the garment industry. \nShe sewed little beads on wedding dresses to make sure her brother and \nGerry had an education. Gerry did have that education. She went to \nMarymount. She became a scholarship girl because she was so smart and \nhad so much talent. She felt it was the nuns who played such a big part \nin her life. They coached her to be smart, and they coached her to be a \ngreat debater. They taught her about her faith. For her, her faith was \nabout the beatitudes, especially the one that said: Hunger and thirst \nafter justice.\n  The other day when Gerry and I were talking, she reminded me that not \nonly did she go to Marymount, but so did Lady Gaga. She said: I am just \nsorry I can't live to go to more alumni associations.\n  Then there was John, her beloved husband, a love story for the ages. \nI was there at the church over a year ago when they renewed their vows \nfor their 50th anniversary. Their vows were not just for a day or for a \nyear or a decade. They believed their vows were for an eternity. Gerry \nloved her husband, and she loved her children Donna, John, and Laura. \nShe was so proud of them--one a doctor, one an accomplished \nbusinessman, another a TV producer and also worked on Wall Street. And \nthe grandchildren, there were always the pictures and the stories of \ntheir many storied accomplishments.\n  Gerry Ferraro loved her family. She loved her extended family. That \nwent to her friends and her community. She loved America. Because she \nbelieved, as she said to me: Only in America, Barbara, could somebody \nwho started out in a regular neighborhood, whose father passed away, \nleaving a mother who taught her grit and determination, go on to run \nfor the Vice Presidency of the United States, to be an Ambassador for \nhuman rights, and to make a difference in the lives of her family and \nher community.\n  Gerry, we will miss you, but your legacy will live forever.\n  Mr. President, I now turn to the Senator from California, Barbara \nBoxer, and then to Senator Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so proud to be here with my \ncolleagues Senator Mikulski and Kay Bailey Hutchison because of a woman \nwho brought us all together despite any differences we might have, \nGeraldine Ferraro. I rise to pay tribute to Gerry.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski. Her remarks touched on every single point \nthat needs to be made about our friend. Gerry was a trailblazer. We all \nremember the first female Vice Presidential nominee of a major party, \nthe first in U.S. history. She cracked open that glass ceiling for \nwomen seeking higher office. It was a long time ago.\n  I just looked at an Associated Press photo of when Gerry arrived in \nSan Francisco to prepare for her speech at the convention. I was there \nwaiting for her to arrive--a much younger version of myself, I might \nsay. I don't remember what I said or did, but this picture tells a \nstory. We know the old saying: A picture says a thousand words. This \none says a million words. I have never\n\n[[Page S1916]]\n\nseen anyone as excited as I appear to be and was in this picture. Arms \nopen wide, body language, just incredulous that we had reached this \nmilestone, all the while knowing what a tough, tough time it would be \nfor Gerry, as it is for many women, whether they run for the Senate or \nfor Governor or for Vice President. It is a tough road still, \nespecially all these many years ago, more than 20 years.\n  Gerry was given a very hard time by the press. Gerry was given a very \nhard time by her opponent. She proved without question that women can \nstand up to the grilling. Women can stand up to the pressure. Women can \ngo toe to toe with anybody. I often say women are equal. We are not \nbetter or worse. We are equal. Gerry proved it. When her campaign took \na tough turn and a lot of others would have tried to contain the \nproblem, she stood there in front of the press and said: Here I am. You \nask me anything you want, and I will stay here hour after hour. They \nknew she meant it. She would have stayed there for days because that \nwas Gerry. She was open-hearted. She was straight from the shoulder. \nShe always said what was on her mind, and she did it in a way that was \nalso very appealing because you knew this was a woman who was willing \nto look you in the eye and not give you any song and dance. It was what \nit was. And for that she will be missed as a friend, as a colleague.\n\n  It is difficult today to imagine what it was like then. Now we see \nour women figures here in the Senate and in the President's Cabinet and \nin the Republican and Democratic Parties making a run for President and \nVice President. It is hard to imagine today that women were not \nactively engaged in the highest of offices. Frankly, that is Geraldine \nFerraro's abiding legacy because, as Senator Mikulski so eloquently \nstated, she did not win that race--it was a tough race; it was a very \ntough race--but she proved a woman could do this.\n  When Gerry spoke about change, she felt in her heart the history-\nmaking moment. I remember her in a white suit, as if it were yesterday. \nIn those years, TV people always said: Don't wear white. Gerry wore \nwhite.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. She was beautiful.\n  Mrs. BOXER. She was magnificent. And that smile and her \ntogetherness--at that moment in history, when not only was the whole \ncountry watching, the whole world was watching--it was an electric \nmoment. I want to read what she said that night. She said:\n\n       By choosing a woman to run for our nation's second highest \n     office, you sent a powerful signal to all Americans. There \n     are no doors we cannot unlock. We will place no limits on \n     [our] achievements.\n       If we can do this, we can do anything.\n\n  And those words resonated not just with people who were interested in \npolitics but with women who were in the corporate world; women who were \ngoing to law school--just a few in those years, now so many more; women \nwho just dreamed of going into health care, not as a nurse, although \nsome chose that--and some men do as well--but as physicians. This was \nsomething I truly believe changed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes, and \nthen turn it over to Senator Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. It is \ngoing to run us way past the recess time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, Mr. President, there was only one Gerry Ferraro, so \nI would go 5 minutes and turn it over to Senator Hutchison for as long \nas she would want.\n  After graduation from college, Gerry got a job as a second grade \nteacher at a public school in Queens. She applied to Fordham Law \nSchool. That is the law school my husband went to. She was accepted \ninto the night program, despite a warning--listen to this--from an \nadmissions officer that she might be taking a man's place. She got into \nlaw school. She was one of 2 women in a class of 179. Imagine, they \nsaid to her: You will be taking a man's place in law school. She \npersevered--one of just 2 women out of 179 students graduating in 1960.\n  Yes, she raised her family. She adored her family. There was not a \nsecond that went by without her saying to one of us, anywhere in \nearshot: I have to tell you about Laura, I have to tell you about John, \nI have to tell you about what my kids are doing.\n  Did my colleague want to ask a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask if the Senator from California will yield for a \nbrief statement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As long as it will not interrupt my statement.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will have a longer statement for the Record because I \nknow Senator Hutchison is waiting, but I want to make one or two \ncomments about Geraldine Ferraro.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, my image of Geraldine Ferraro is this young \nCongresswoman from California, with her arms outstretched, as you raced \ntoward one another in an iconic photograph of the two of you after she \nwon the Vice Presidential nomination. I will remember you and her in \nthat context forever. Second, it was my honor to serve with her in the \nHouse and to count her as a friend. Third, in this long, long battle \nshe had, this medical battle, she never failed to remind all of us that \nshe was indeed one of the fortunate ones who had the resources to be \nable to fight the battle, where many people did not.\n  I am going to miss Geraldine Ferraro. She was a great American.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very glad the Senator made that statement, and I \nappreciate it very much.\n  When Gerry worked as an assistant district attorney, she formed a \nSpecial Victims Bureau. She investigated rape, child and women abuse, \nand abuse against the elderly at a time when no one was talking about \nit.\n  She was elected to Congress. Senator Mikulski has gone into that, the \nwork on the Economic Equity Act. I was proud to work with both Senator \nMikulski and Gerry Ferraro on that and Senator Snowe and others.\n  I remember Senator Mikulski, Olympia Snowe, Gerry Ferraro, and \nmyself--we worked to open the House gym to women. It was a battle. We \nhad to resort to singing and everything else. We finally got into the \nHouse gym. We said, yes, women need to work out too. That is the way it \nwas then. We only had 24 women in the House and Senate. Now we have 88 \nof us.\n  I will skip over her time as a broadcaster and all the things she did \nthat Senator Mikulski talked about--her work in women's rights--but I \nwish to conclude with her brave spirit as she faced multiple myeloma, \nthe bone cancer that ultimately took her life. I wish to do it in this \ncontext.\n  I have a good friend now, whose name is Robin, and her mother is \nbattling the same kind of cancer Gerry was battling. As we know, Gerry \nwas given 4 or 5 years and went on, thank God, for much longer.\n  This woman lives far away from her daughter Robin. When Gerry passed, \nshe called her daughter and said: I need to see you. Will you come out \nand stay with me, as I battle this cancer?\n  Robin said: Well, what is it, mom? You are doing great.\n  She said: We just lost Gerry, and she was the one who kept my heart \nand soul together and my spirits up, and I knew she was there battling. \nNow that I have lost her, I don't know, I feel a hole, I am empty.\n  That is just the most eloquent thing I could say about Gerry. This \nwoman never met Geraldine Ferraro in person, but Gerry had that way \nabout her that she could reach you as if she was touching you. It is a \ntremendous loss, first and foremost for the family, whom she adored \nbeyond words, and, secondly, for all the rest of us who just need \nsomeone like that out there standing up and being brave and telling it \nlike it is and never giving up.\n  Mr. President, I am so honored I could be here with my colleagues, \nand I am proud to yield to Senator Hutchison for as much time as she \nneeds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Hutchison, the time is \nallocated as 5 minutes, but I know you want to speak and were a very \ndear friend. Please proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Boxer.\n  Mr. President, I do want to talk about this remarkable woman because \nI think, as has been mentioned before, her loss is being felt \nthroughout America for many different reasons. She was a trailblazer, \nand she was one of the great female role models of her generation.\n  I wrote a book in 2004 called ``American Heroines: The Spirited Women\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\nWho Shaped Our Country.'' It was to profile the women who were the \nearliest trailblazers in different fields--education, sports, politics, \njournalism. Then I interviewed contemporary women who were still \nbreaking barriers in those fields.\n  In the public service chapter, I profiled Margaret Chase Smith \nbecause she was the longest serving woman elected to the Senate in her \nown right at the time and she was a true trailblazer. I then \ninterviewed Sandra Day O'Connor, our first woman Supreme Court Justice, \nand Geraldine Ferraro, our first woman nominee for Vice President of a \nmajor party.\n  I asked Gerry Ferraro in my interview with her: What was your most \nimportant trait for success?\n  And she said:\n\n       I think the ability to work hard and, if something doesn't \n     work, to learn from the mistake and move on. That's what's \n     happened with my own life. It goes to the personal side from \n     watching my mother, who moved on after becoming a widow with \n     two kids to support. She was thirty-nine years old. . . . \n     Then I watched her move on and do whatever was necessary to \n     get the job of educating her children done. I'm exactly the \n     same way. I'll do whatever is necessary to get the job done, \n     whatever it is. And then if I do something that doesn't work, \n     then I go to the next goal.\n\n  I asked her what was her biggest obstacle. She almost laughed. She \nsaid:\n\n       I'm sixty-eight. The obstacles in my life have changed with \n     time. An obstacle when I was a kid was being in a boarding \n     school away from my mother because my father had died. I had \n     no choice. It wasn't like the boarding schools or the prep \n     schools of today. I was in a semicloistered convent. It was \n     lonely, and I had to work hard. I wanted to go to college, \n     but we didn't have the money for college, so I knew I had to \n     get top marks in order to get scholarships. That was my \n     obstacle then.\n       Money was always an obstacle when I was a kid. I taught \n     when I went to law school at night, because I couldn't afford \n     to go during the day. When I applied [for law school], they \n     would say things like, ``Gerry, are you serious, because \n     you're taking a man's place,'' you know. . . .\n       And then [after getting out of law school]--\n\n  As was mentioned earlier, she was one of only two women in her \nclass--\n\n       I was faced with the challenge of trying to find a job. I \n     interviewed at five law firms. I was in the top ten percent \n     of my class.\n\n  But she did not get a job offer. Well, I related to that because I \ngraduated from law school, after her, in 1967, and law firms in Texas \ndid not hire women then either. So I know how she felt as she went \nthrough obstacles and obstacles and obstacles. But she said: In the \nend, ``each thing was an obstacle that I had to get by'' at the time. \nBut she didn't have too many obstacles because she just picked herself \nup and kept right on going. She truly was an inspiration and a \ntrailblazer for women of our time.\n  Throughout her life as a public school teacher, as an assistant \ndistrict attorney, as a Congresswoman, and as a candidate for Vice \nPresident, Gerry Ferraro fought for the causes that were important to \nher. When she learned she had multiple myeloma, a somewhat rare blood \ndisease that is incurable, she drew upon that same fighting spirit. As \nshe waged the battle with her own disease, Gerry stepped into the \nspotlight because she knew if she talked about it, with her high \nprofile, she could bring help to others.\n  Her testimony before Congress was instrumental in the passage of a \nbill that Senator Mikulski, who is on the floor leading this effort \ntoday, and I cosponsored together in 2001 and 2002. Our legislation \ngave the research community the tools they need to discover what \ntriggers these deadly blood diseases, to devise better treatments, and \nto work toward a cure. In our bill, Barbara and I decided to name the \nGeraldine Ferraro Blood Cancer Education Program for Gerry Ferraro to \nraise awareness and spread the lifesaving information about myeloma, \nleukemia, and other forms of blood cancer. Gerry Ferraro was on the \nfloor of the House when her bill--our bill--passed the House of \nRepresentatives on April 30, 2002. Her daughter was in the gallery with \nmy staffer, and there was so much joy in her eyes and her demeanor.\n  But then Gerry Ferraro went about the business of fashioning the \neducation program. She consulted with the doctors at Harvard, at Dana-\nFarber, with Dr. Ken Anderson, her doctor. She consulted with him \nbecause she wanted an interactive Web site because she knew that \ndoctors all over the country were searching for information on the \ntreatment of this disease because they were so unaware at the time of \nwhat you could do to help patients.\n  Well, this is personal to me because my brother Allan also has \nmultiple myeloma, and I got involved in this because I watched him \nbravely fight like Gerry Ferraro was doing. And my brother is a great \npatient. He is tough like Gerry. He is fighting like Gerry. And he is \ndoing really well. But we knew how hard it was because we watched Allan \nfight this disease and take many of the same drugs and have the same \ndoctor consultations as Gerry. So Gerry and Allan knew each other and \ntraded information, and the patients with these diseases do that. They \nreach out, they help each other because they know it is the person with \nthe experience who knows how you feel when you just don't feel as \nthough you can get up in the morning. People such as Kathy Giusti, who \nwas also a good friend of Gerry Ferraro's, and Ken Anderson, they \ntraded information, and it helped all of them to know they had that \nkind of support.\n\n  So she was an inspiration. Her dignity and grace in fighting multiple \nmyeloma will be one of the trademarks in her life, along with the other \ngreat trailblazing she has done.\n  Just last month, the women of the Senate pulled together to return \nthe encouragement. We knew Gerry was having a hard time, and we took a \npicture of the women of the Senate, we all signed it around the edges \nand we sent it to her, saying: Thanks for being our champion. Thanks \nfor all you do for the women of our country.\n  Gerry was not just a champion for women running for public office, \nshe was a champion for women to succeed in every field, in every \nsector. She took the first powerful swing at the glass ceiling. She \nwill not be here to see the woman President who is sworn into office, \nwho will finish the breaking of that glass ceiling. But we will all be \nstanding on the shoulders of Gerry Ferraro, and certainly that first \nwoman President will as well, because she took those first steps, such \nas so many of the early trailblazers in all the different sectors. The \nfirst ones don't see their success, but what they do by showing the \ndignity and the courage and the tenacity and the grace does prepare the \nway for the next generation or the next woman to move to the next \nlevel, and that is what Gerry Ferraro has done for all the women of our \ncountry.\n  I will always remember her friendship. I appreciate her leadership. \nWe will all miss her on a personal level, but we will always remember \nin the bigger picture what she did for this country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Mikulski. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor to Senator Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my good friends \nand esteemed colleagues, Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and \nSenator Barbara Boxer of California, as we honor a compatriot of ours \nfrom the House of Representatives, an electoral trailblazer, and \npolitical torchbearer--the incomparable and courageous, Geraldine \nFerraro, who passed away last Saturday after a brave and resilient 12-\nyear battle with cancer.\n  As this august body will hear many times over, Geraldine was a \npioneering champion and a dynamic force for women and women's rights, a \nstalwart legislator and colleague of all three of ours in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, and always a dear friend through more than \nthree decades. As America's first female Vice-Presidential nominee for \na major party, Geraldine has forever secured a legendary position along \nthe timeline of American political history, as Walter Mondale selected \nher as his running mate in the 1984 Presidential election.\n  (Ms. MIKULSKI assumed the Chair.)\n  While America was learning about Geraldine on the national stage, \nBarbara Mikulski, Barbara Boxer, and I knew her as a legislative, \nsister-in-arms, if you will, as all of us served together in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. Geraldine and I were members of the same \nHouse freshman class that began service in January 1979 that brought \nthe total number of women in the 96th Congress in the House to 16.\n\n[[Page S1918]]\n\n  And all four of us fought for myriad causes, most especially those \naffecting America's women. Looking back, I take enormous pride, as I \nknow both Senators Mikulski and Boxer do, that we spoke as women first, \nnot as Republicans or Democrats, that women's issues transcended \npartisan lines for us. The fact was, we just couldn't afford to draw \npartisan lines with women underrepresented in Congress. And that idea \nis what drove our agenda at the bipartisan Congressional Caucus for \nWomen's Issues, which I cochaired for over 10 years in the House of \nRepresentatives and where Geraldine Ferarro was also at the vanguard in \namplifying issues for literally generations of women.\n  Our adherence to working together--and to the ideal of principle over \npolitics--became our foundation. We determined if we didn't act, who \nwould? And we started to make a difference for women, and not a moment \ntoo soon. Indeed, there was indeed a time in America when our laws \nspecifically worked against women, when economic equality pertained \nonly to economic equality among men--not women, when our laws didn't \nreflect the changing, dual responsibilities of women who were \nincreasingly working as well as caring for a family.\n  Well, we weren't going to accept the status quo any longer, and \ncertainly Geraldine was not one to ever countenance the notion of \n``that's just the way it is.'' To the contrary. We confronted these \ndisparities for women head on and introduced a package of laws that \nopened the doors of economic opportunity for the women of America by \nrevising laws and giving women the tools required to succeed. That \npackage was the multifaceted Economic Equity Act. Among a litany of \nprovisions, we called for a study of the government's pay practices, \nsought to ensure equal credit for women in business ventures, and \nbattled with Geraldine Ferraro who led the effort to end pension award \ndiscrimination against women who were discovering upon their husband's \ndeath that, unbeknownst to them, they had been left with absolutely no \npension benefits.\n  And in a group of women legislators that was not, shall we say, \ncomprised of shrinking violets, no one gave greater voice to these \nissues, no one demonstrated more passion in their advocacy, and no one \npressed for remedies to right these wrongs with more verve or skill \nthan Geraldine Ferraro. She was a bulwark against injustice and a \ncherished champion for fairness in an America where women were \nincreasing their roles in American life and their presence in the U.S. \nworkplace and economy.\n  On a personal note, I can't help but think that part of our mutual \nbond was that we came from similar backgrounds. Our families immigrated \nto this great land--hers from Italy and mine from Greece. Our heritages \nspoke to the very best of our Nation's mosaic and the American dream \nwhere anything is possible and the only limits you have are those you \nplace on yourself. Indeed, the New York Times mentions how Geraldine's \nmother crocheted beads on wedding dresses to send her to the best \nschools. My Aunt Mary worked the 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. night shift at a \ntextile mill in Lewiston, ME, to earn money to ensure my cousins and I \nreceived a good education. Although Geraldine and I didn't agree on \neverything, we shared an unequivocal determination to make a lasting \ndifference on issues for women and working families--an unerring focus \nthat surmounted politics and party labels.\n  Not surprisingly, more than 30 years later, Geraldine's legacy lives \non through the 74 women serving the other body today, as well as the 17 \nwomen currently serving in the Senate. How fitting it is that on the \nMonday after she passed away, my 16 Senate women colleagues and I \nsubmitted a resolution advocating for women's rights in North Africa \nand the Middle East. We have the moral high ground in that clarion call \nin no small part because of Geraldine's historic leadership and legacy.\n  In closing, I can't help but recall the great Lady Astor, who was the \nfirst woman to ever serve in the British House of Parliament. In fact, \non the day she took her seat in that distinguished body, a Member of \nParliament turned to her and said, ``Welcome to the most exclusive \nmen's club in Europe.'' Demonstrating the kind of moxie and sense of \nobligation that were hallmarks of America's Geraldine Ferraro, Lady \nAstor responded ``it won't be exclusive for long.'' she said. ``When I \ncame in, I left the door wide open!''\n  Geraldine Ferraro espoused and exemplified what Lady Astor so \nmemorably articulated--that it is not enough to break old barriers and \nchart a new course, you have to ensure that others are able to traverse \nit as well. Geraldine spent a lifetime making certain that the path she \nhelped pave was available and accessible to every woman with the \ncourage and will to travel it. And so, today, it is a privilege for me \nto extol this remarkable woman whose indelible imprint upon the \npolitical and public policy arenas will be felt for generations to \ncome.\n  At this most difficult of times, our thoughts and prayers remain with \nher husband of 50 years, John--as well as their children, Donna, John \nJr., and Laura and Geraldine's grandchildren. May they be comforted by \nthe knowledge that so many share in their profound sense of loss, as \nwell as the memory of a trailblazing woman who, above all else, was an \nadoring and beloved mother and grandmother who leaves an indelible mark \nupon her family, as well as an entire Nation.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I know we are about to recess, but I \nwish to take a minute or two to add my voice to all the women in the \nSenate who have been here today and thank the Presiding Officer for her \nleadership for encouraging us to honor Geraldine Ferraro.\n  I remember being on the floor of the 1984 Democratic Convention when \nshe gave her acceptance speech for the Vice President of the United \nStates, and it was electric listening to her. It epitomized for me, and \nI am sure every woman there, the fact that women could do anything.\n  Geraldine Ferraro worked tirelessly on behalf of human rights and \nwomen's rights around the globe. She dedicated her public service to \nthe ideals of respect and equality and she lived a career that called \non all women to challenge the glass ceilings of the world. I think it \nis particularly important because just because one woman breaks the \nglass ceiling doesn't mean opportunities are open to every woman, and \nshe understood that and continued to encourage all the ceilings across \nthe world to be broken for women.\n  Gerry's life was a powerful example for all of us who are honoring \nher today and for our daughters and granddaughters. We thank her for \nleading the way. She will be missed.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to reflect on the life \nand legacy of Geraldine Ferraro who lost her heroic battle with cancer \non Saturday.\n  Geraldine Ferraro was first elected to public office in 1978 to \nrepresent Queens in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  As a member of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, she \npushed to improve mass transit around La Guardia Airport.\n  Later, she would cosponsor the Economic Equity Act, which was \nintended to accomplish many of the aims of the never-ratified equal \nrights amendment.\n  In 1984, former Vice President and a distinguished Member of this \nbody, Walter Mondale, chose Gerry to join him as his Vice Presidential \nrunning mate, the first woman to be placed on a national ticket.\n  I was privileged to serve as the mayor of San Francisco in 1984 where \nthe Democratic Party held its convention that election year.\n  Twenty-seven years later, as I look back on that time, I realize what \nan important and historical moment her selection was to American \npolitics.\n  I recall the emotion and enthusiasm of people--men and women--at the \nMoscone Center in San Francisco when Gerry took the podium.\n  Sixty-four years after women won the right to vote, Geraldine Ferraro \nrepresented a new beginning for our politics. It was an amazing \nfeeling.\n  While the election didn't go the Democrats' way that year, Gerry's \nselection was a victory for a generation\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\nof young women who saw that anything is possible and no position in \ngovernment has a ``men only'' sign on the door.\n  As the first Vice Presidential nominee of a major party, she not only \nput a crack in the glass ceiling that year, she demonstrated the \ndedication and the competence of women in the political arena.\n  I didn't know her well, but I do know her experiences well.\n  I know how tough it was as a woman running for political office--only \nto find out everyone else was discussing the style of your outfit.\n  I know how tough it was to be one of the first elected officials to \nspeak using phrases like, ``As a mother,'' or ``If I were pregnant . . \n.''\n  I know how tough it was as a woman debating men in political debates \nand then when it was over, debating a dozen reporters.\n  I know how tough it was as a woman who fought and won for change to \nlive to see other women make a dozen other cracks in that glass \nceiling.\n  But the same ideals Geraldine Ferraro fought for during her public \nlife are the same ideals we fight for today.\n  It would be another 24 years after that night in San Francisco before \nanother woman from a major party was nominated for Vice President.\n  And even though Hillary Rodham Clinton came close to being nominated \nin 2008 as the Democratic Presidential candidate, a woman has yet to \noccupy the Oval Office.\n  There are only 16 other women besides myself serving in the U.S. \nSenate. In the 435 Member House, just 71 are women. And just six States \nhave women Governors.\n  Despite these statistics today, Geraldine Ferraro's career and \nexample gave women across the country hope and heart.\n  At the time when Gerry Ferraro and I were in office, people had \nreservations about women in office. So the press pushed you further and \nfurther--just to see how smart you were or how you would react.\n  When I was mayor, I had to do more homework than my counterparts; I \nhad to be prepared for every possible question--more questions and \ndetail than my counterparts.\n  There was a judgment that women were not effective. But that judgment \nof effectiveness has changed.\n  It took some time, but women in office have shown we are capable of \noffering legislation, working to pass it, and being just as effective \nas our male counterparts.\n  Geraldine Ferraro gave it her all. She gave women everywhere an \nexample of determination. She continued that drive when she supported \nother women in national office.\n  And she will continue to give us all hope and heart for decades to \ncome in her place in history.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today to honor the life, \nachievements, and legacy of Geraldine Anne Ferraro, who paved the way \nfor aspiring women leaders and politicians across the Nation and the \nworld to reach the highest positions of power.\n  Geraldine dedicated her life to defending women's and children's \nrights and helping the less fortunate, whether in public service, as an \nattorney, as a Congresswoman, or as Ambassador to the United Nations \nCommission on Human Rights. Her career was a turning point for women in \npolitics, and an inspiration for women everywhere.\n  In the early 1950s, when women were not expected to attend college, \nGeraldine was already breaking through the ``glass ceiling.'' The \ndaughter of Italian immigrants, she worked her way through college and \nin 1956 became the first woman in her family to receive a college \ndegree. In 1960, she graduated with honors from law school, where she \nwas one of only 2 women in her graduating class of 179 students. She \nbecame a strong advocate for abused women and for the poor while \nserving as assistant district attorney for Queens County, NY, where she \nheaded a new bureau that prosecuted sex crimes, child abuse, and \ndomestic violence.\n  Her passion to change America for the better took her all the way to \nthe U.S. Congress, where she fought for equal pay, pensions, and \nretirement plans for women. She was also a leader on environmental \nissues. In 1984, she led passage of a Superfund renewal bill and called \nfor improvements in the handling of environmental site cleanups.\n  Geraldine will be remembered not only as a pioneer for women's and \nchildren's rights but for human rights around the world. As the U.S. \nAmbassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Geraldine \nsupported the Commission's decision to condemn anti-Semitism as a human \nrights violation. And in 1995, she led the U.S. delegation in the \nhistoric Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.\n  But what Geraldine will forever be remembered for is that she made \npossible what was previously unthinkable, that a woman could be a \ncandidate for Vice President of the United States. When former Vice \nPresident and Presidential candidate Walter Mondale selected Geraldine \nFerraro to be his running mate in 1984, she became the only Italian \nAmerican to be a major-party national nominee as well as the first \nwoman.\n  In 1984, Geraldine fought a tough race, venturing into unchartered \nterritory and blazing a trail. Even though Geraldine lost that race, \nshe went where no woman had ever been before, teaching us that ``when \nwomen run, women win.''\n  A tireless champion for women in the political arena, Geraldine \nhelped women politicians gain a stronger voice and run for public \noffice. It is because of Geraldine that women today, including myself, \ncan go even farther than before. Generations of female politicians will \nforever stand on her shoulders.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, an incredible woman died this week after \na long and hard-fought battle with cancer.\n  Geraldine Ferraro led a trailblazing life, constantly achieving and \nproving the naysayers wrong.\n  She was one of two women in her graduating class from Fordham law \nschool, taking night classes after teaching all day.\n  She was an attorney in a male-dominated New York District Attorney's \nOffice.\n  She was the first woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives \nfrom New York's 9th District in Queens--a district that most people \nassumed would not elect her, not because she was a woman but because \nshe was a Democrat.\n  If she had done nothing more, Gerry Ferraro would have earned her \nplace in history.\n  But then, on July 11, 1984, just 64 years after American women won \nthe right to vote, Geraldine Ferraro agreed to be Walter Mondale's \nrunning mate in his race for the White House--the first time in history \nthat a woman had ever run on the Presidential ticket of a major \npolitical party.\n  ``I didn't pause for a minute'' she later wrote.\n  It's hard for many people today, particularly young people, to \nunderstand what a revolutionary act it was for Geraldine Ferraro to \nagree to break that barrier. Less than 20 years earlier, want ads in \nAmerican newspapers were still segregated into ``men's jobs'' and \n``women's jobs''--and believe me, Vice President of the United States \nwas not listed under ``women's work.''\n  As a result of Gerry Ferraro's courage, the doors of opportunity \nswung open for millions of women--not just in politics, but in every \nprofession.\n  She said often that ``[c]ampaigns, even if you lose them, do serve a \npurpose . . . [the] days of discrimination are numbered.'' She was \nright.\n  For the last 12 years of her life, Gerry Ferraro fought a terrible \nblood cancer called myeloma. Once again, she was a pioneer, using a new \ndrug which enabled her to live well beyond her physicians' initial \nestimate.\n  Each injection cost over $1,000 and she went to twice weekly \ntreatments. She was always aware that she was fortunate to be able to \nafford those life-extending treatments. Even when times were the worst, \nGerry Ferraro was an eloquent and energetic advocate for more funding \nfor cancer research, and for help for the 50,000 Americans who are \nliving with cancer and can't afford the treatments for their illness.\n  Gerry's mother taught her the first lessons about being a strong and \nindependent woman.\n  When Geraldine was just 8 years old, her father died. She saw her \nwidowed,\n\n[[Page S1920]]\n\nimmigrant mother work long hours as a seamstress so that she could \nafford to send her children to good schools. She was living proof for \nGerry that, with hard work, you can make a good life for your children \nin America. She never forgot what her mother did for her and kept her \nmaiden name after she married as a sign of respect.\n  Gerry Ferraro was a true egalitarian. When she learned that because \nshe was married she was paid less than male attorneys, she quit and ran \nfor Congress. She fought for the equal rights amendment and cosponsored \nthe Economic Equity Act to end pension inequality.\n  President Clinton appointed her to the United Nations Commission on \nHuman Rights, and later the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations \nCommission on Human Rights.\n  I had the opportunity to serve with Gerry in the House of \nRepresentatives in a very difficult time, and I am honored to have \ncalled her my friend. I offer my deepest condolences to her husband \nJohn, her children Donna, Laura and John Jr., and her eight \ngrandchildren. Geraldine's passing is a deep loss for so many people, \nbut her hard work and accomplishments will continue to live.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, America's favorite people are pioneers. We \nare a nation that celebrates those who first touched the moon, \ndiscovered the technologies that changed the world, and fought for what \nis right before everyone else.\n  We believe in the brave and admire those who believe in their own \ndreams--those who pursue them fearlessly, who leave a trail for the \nrest of us to follow and a legacy to emulate.\n  This week, America honors a woman we will always remember for \nbreaking one of the highest glass ceilings in history. For two \ncenturies, in election after election, Americans went into voting \nbooths and saw lots of Williams and Johns and Jameses on the ballot. \nThen, in 1984, they saw the name Geraldine.\n  As the first woman on a major Presidential ticket, Geraldine Ferraro \ncontinued America's proud pioneer tradition. It wasn't the first time \nshe led the way. Congresswoman Ferraro worked her way through law \nschool at a time when few women did so. When the people of Queens, NY, \nelected her to the House of Representatives she was 1 of only 16 women \nMembers. There was only one at the time serving in the Senate. Today \nthere are 76 women serving in the House--one of whom was the first \nwoman Speaker of the House--and 17 in the Senate.\n  I served in the House of Representatives with Congresswoman Ferraro \nand am deeply saddened by her death. She was an inspiration to my \ndaughter and nine granddaughters, and to all of us who believe in our \nNation's eternal pursuit of equality. On behalf of the people of \nNevada--a State settled, built, and strengthen by pioneers--I honor the \nmemory of my friend, Geraldine Ferraro.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1920-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to talk about our \nNation's financial troubles. Over the years, I have supported a \nbalanced budget amendment, spending caps, and spending cuts. Recently, \nwe had a proposal to fund the government for the remainder of the \nfiscal year, and I voted against it because I felt we needed to do more \nthan the amendment proposed.\n  The fact is, we need to do much more. I agree Congress should cut \nexpenses. But taking whacks at only 12 percent of the budget--that part \nof the budget that is the so-called discretionary spending portion \noutside of Defense, that is not part of the mandatory spending, such as \nall the entitlement programs, and that is only 12 percent of the budget \nand includes funding for education and roads and bridges and medical \nresearch and NASA and environmental research--even if we whacked all \nthat, it is still not going to solve the problem.\n  Cutting this domestic discretionary spending alone is barely a \nbandaid, let alone a real cure.\n  What we need is a comprehensive long-term package. For example, when \nAmerican families fall on hard times, they just do not cut back on \neating out or going to the movies. The American family is forced to \nmake wholesale lifestyle sacrifices. Or take, for instance, when a \ncompany, a corporation, faces the threat of bankruptcy. They do not \nonly cut salaries or stop buying office supplies, they go in and \nrestructure entire delivery schemes and future investments.\n  In the same way, we just cannot focus on slicing what is the \nconversation that is going on down in the House of Representatives \nright now, slicing one small part of the budget, which is discretionary \nspending, because that is not going to reduce the annual deficit and \nget at the national debt. We have to do more.\n  Even if we cut huge swaths of discretionary spending, including the \nprograms that help those who need it the most, our expenses for all the \nother programs in government, mandatory programs, are still growing \nexponentially. So everything has to be on the table.\n  Now, how in the world are we going to do this in the next few days? \nBy the time the clock runs out on April 8, where we are faced with \nfunding the government for the remaining 6 months of this fiscal year, \nhow are we going to do it? What would it look like if our debt keeps \ngrowing?\n  Well, the Federal Government is going to have to start writing huge \nchecks to our creditors. Who is a creditor? China is a creditor, and we \nare having to write for them huge checks on interest payments alone. We \nwill not have anything left to pay for things that we promised to our \npeople, and no one else will want to lend us any more money.\n  The money people have spent their lives paying in to Social Security \nmay not come back to them unless we can solve this budgetary crisis. \nBonds that have been bought and held for decades will go down in value \nif we cannot meet our debt obligations. Of course, if we do not get to \nthe point that we can pay our debts, then the stock market could even \nhave a worse crash than we had last time.\n  So if we do not address this pending debt crisis now, our children \nand grandchildren could be sorely affected by the financial condition \nof this country in the future.\n  Every economist we have listened to lately has said that we need to \nprovide certainty to our creditors and to the markets. In other words, \nthey need to know that we will get our debt under control before \ninterest payments skyrocket and overwhelm our obligations. No one knows \nhow long we have before our creditors get nervous and start to make it \nharder for the United States to borrow money. But they all agree we \nhave to put into place a long-term plan instead of waiting to act until \nthe crisis is upon us. The crisis is coming. It is coming on April 8. \nThat is the first crisis.\n  Assuming that we can get through this and get the government funded \nfor the remaining 6 months of the fiscal year--until the end of \nSeptember--the next crisis that is coming is the debt ceiling--probably \nin early June--that has to be raised in order for the government to pay \nits obligations.\n  And then we are going to have to have a plan for next year's budget, \nthe fiscal year that starts October 1, in order to get the votes to \nincrease the debt ceiling. So between now and June, first in a couple \nof weeks, and then in a couple of months, we are going to have to \ndevise a comprehensive plan.\n  I am going to support cuts across the board. I am going to support \ncuts in discretionary spending. But I also want\n\n[[Page S1921]]\n\nto see cuts in what we call tax expenditures, which are equivalent to \nspending, but are nothing more than outrageous tax breaks to big \ncorporations that make billions of dollars in profits each year. For \nexample, some of the royalty payments that are not being paid by oil \ncompanies for their privilege of extracting oil from Federal lands, \nparticularly those lands in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. There are \ncorporations that ship massive amounts of jobs overseas, and they get \ntax breaks for it.\n  There is also money made by U.S. citizens that is being held offshore \nin foreign accounts, which is not reported to the United States, and \ntax is not being paid on that income. So there is plenty of opportunity \nto tighten up.\n  Another place that we can tighten up is to implement the changes that \nwe made in the health care bill that cut the fraud that plagues \nprograms like Medicare and Medicaid. It is costing us billions and \nbillions of dollars.\n  So there are tireless efforts that are being made by a lot of \nSenators right now trying to work together to draft a comprehensive \nplan. I came to the Senate to fight for my State and for our country, \nand if we continue to allow a debt crisis to happen when, in fact, we \nhad the opportunity to avoid it, it is going to be far more reckless \nthan casting a vote that is going to be disliked by some. I am ready to \nstand and have that fight. Yet we should not have to. We should, as the \nGood Book says, ``Come, let us reason together.'' Then we can find a \ncomprehensive solution to this budgetary crisis.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I would like to take time today to address the ongoing \nsituation in Libya. Last night, the President made a strong defense of \nour military action in Libya. I welcome his remarks, and I appreciate \nthat he explained why this intervention was both right and necessary, \nespecially in light of the unprecedented democratic awakening that is \nnow sweeping the broader Middle East.\n  There has been much criticism of the President's handling of the \nsituation in Libya--some legitimate, some not. But the fact is, because \nwe did act, the United States and our coalition partners averted a \nstrategic and humanitarian disaster in Libya.\n  Even as we seek adjustments to U.S. policy where appropriate to \nensure that we accomplish the U.S. goal as stated by the President of \nforcing Qadhafi to leave power, I believe the President's decision to \nintervene in Libya deserves strong bipartisan support in Congress and \namong all Americans.\n  It is worth remembering, especially for the critics of this \nintervention, exactly what we would be facing in Libya now had we not \ntaken action. Just over 1 week ago, Qadhafi was bearing down on \nBenghazi, a city of 700,000 people, and the main seat of the Libyan \nopposition, as well as the provisional government that has now emerged.\n  Qadhafi pledged in his words: No mercy for these people. He pledged \nto go house to house, to crush everyone opposed to him. Had we not \ntaken action in Libya, Benghazi would now be remembered in the same \nbreath as Srebrenica, a scene of mass slaughter and a source of \ninternational shame.\n  Libyan refugees would now be streaming into Egypt and Tunisia \ndestabilizing those critical countries during their already daunting \npolitical transitions. If we had allowed Qadhafi to slaughter Arabs and \nMuslims in Benghazi who were pleading for the U.S. military to rescue \nthem, America's moral standing in the broader Middle East would have \nbeen devastated. Al-Qaida and other violent extremists would have \nexploited the resulting chaos and hopelessness. The forces of \ncounterrevolution in the region would have gotten the message that the \nworld would tolerate the violent oppression of peaceful demonstrations \nfor universal rights. This would have been a dramatic setback for the \nArab spring which represents the most consequential geopolitical \nopportunity in centuries.\n  That is why Libya matters and why we were right to intervene. Yes, \nthere are many other places in the world where evil resides, where \nmonsters brutalize civilians. The United States cannot and should not \nintervene in all of these places. But we were right to do so in Libya \nbecause of the unique position this country now occupies at a moment of \nhistoric change in the Middle East and North Africa. This does not mean \nwe should take the same actions toward other countries in the region as \nwe have toward Libya.\n  Each of these countries is different. Their challenges and situations \nare different. When governments, both friend and foe, use force and \noppression to crush peaceful demands for universal rights, we need to \nbe clear in our condemnation, and we need to support the aspirations of \nall people who seek greater freedom, justice, and economic opportunity.\n  But let's be clear. Qadhafi's brutal and vicious slaughter of fellow \nArabs and Muslims has set Libya completely apart from other countries \nin the region, and it warranted the decisive military response we and \nour international partners have taken. While some believe the President \nshould have sought a congressional authorization for the use of force, \nor even a formal declaration of war prior to taking military action in \nLibya, I think his actions were in keeping both with the constitutional \npowers of the President and with past practices, be it President \nReagan's action in Grenada or President Clinton's action in the \nBalkans.\n  Had Congress taken even a few days to debate the use of force prior \nto acting in Libya, there would have been nothing left to save in \nBenghazi. That is why our Founders gave the President the power as \nCommander in Chief to respond swiftly and energetically to crises. What \nwe need now is not a debate about the past; that can come later. Many \nof us who wanted a no-fly zone at the time still are convinced that \nthis could have been over by now. But the fact is, it is in the past.\n  What we need is a forward-looking strategy to accomplish the U.S. \ngoal--as articulated by the President--of forcing Qadhafi to leave \npower. We have prevented the worst outcome in Libya, but we have not \nyet secured our goal. As some of us predicted, U.S. and coalition \nairpower has decisively and quickly reversed the momentum of Qadhafi's \nforces, but now we need to refine U.S. strategy to achieve success as \nquickly as possible.\n  As every military strategist knows, the purpose of employing military \nforce is to achieve policy goals. Our goal in Libya is that Qadhafi \nmust go, and it is the right goal. But let's be honest with ourselves: \nWe are indeed talking about regime change, whether the President wants \nto call it that or not. While I agree with the President that we should \nnot send U.S. ground troops to Libya to remove Qadhafi from power, that \nis exactly what Libyan opposition forces are fighting to do. They are \nnow on the outskirts of Qadhafi's hometown of Surt, and they appear to \nhave no intention of stopping there.\n  Thus far, U.S. and coalition airpower has cleared a path for the \nopposition to advance. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 authorizes \nthe use of ``all necessary measures'' to protect civilians in Libya. As \nlong as Qadhafi remains in power, he will pose an increasing danger to \nthe world, and civilians in Libya will not be safe.\n  Ultimately, we need to be straight with the American people and with \nourselves. We are not neutral in the conflict in Libya. We want the \nopposition to succeed, and we want Qadhafi to leave power. These are \njust causes. And we must therefore provide the necessary and \nappropriate assistance to aid the opposition in their fight. That \ncertainly means continuing to use air power to degrade Qadhafi's \nmilitary forces in the field, and I am encouraged by the fact that we \nare now bringing in AC-130 and A-10 attack aircraft to provide more \nclose-in air support.\n\n[[Page S1922]]\n\n  This is the Libyan people's fight, but we need to continue to help \nmake it a fairer fight, until Qadhafi is forced to leave power. I was \nvery encouraged today to hear our ambassador to the United Nations \nsuggest that the United States may provide arms to the opposition. We \nshould also provide them, if requested and as appropriate, with \nresources, command and control technology, communications equipment, \nbattlefield intelligence, and training. We need to take every \nresponsible measure to help the Libyan opposition change the balance of \npower on the ground.\n  Yes, it has been documented that many eastern Libyans went to fight \nin Iraq, Many met their end there too. But Libyans are not rising up \nagainst Qadhafi now under the banner of al-Qaida. To the contrary, they \nhave largely pledged their support to the Transitional National \nCouncil, which is based in Benghazi, and representative of tribes and \ncommunities across Libya. The leaders of this council are not unknown \nto us. They have met with senior administration officials, including \nthe Secretary of State, as well as other world leaders. Their \nsupporters are brave lawyers, students, and human rights advocates who \njust want to choose their own future free from Qadhafi. They have \ndeclared their vision for Libya as, quote, ``a constitutional \ndemocratic civil state based on the rule of law, respect for human \nrights and the guarantee of equal rights and opportunities for all its \ncitizens.'' If these moderate, democratic forces do not succeed in \nLibya, we know exactly who would fill the void: the radicals and the \nideologues. We have seen this movie before.\n  We cannot make the assumption that time is on our side. It is not. \nPerhaps Qadhafi's regime will crack tomorrow. I hope it will. But hope \nis not a strategy. If our strategy does not succeed in forcing Qadhafi \nto leave power sooner rather than later, we run the risk of a prolonged \nand bloody stalemate. That is not in America's interest or in the \ninterest of the Libyan people. The risks are still too high of \nrepeating a similar outcome from the first gulf war--where we had \ncrushing sanctions and a no-fly zone in place, but still Saddam Hussein \nmanaged to hold onto power, threaten the world, and brutalize his own \npeople for another 12 years. And only then, it took an armed invasion \nto remove him from power. That is not a definition of success in Libya. \nAnd it certainly is not a limited mission. It is a recipe for a costly \nand indefinite stalemate. We must avert that outcome.\n  Our mission in Libya is going well, but we have not yet accomplished \nour goal. I am extremely thankful and grateful for our many friends and \nallies, especially our Arab partners, who are contributing to this \nmission. However, none of this is a substitute for sustained U.S. \nleadership. If our goal in Libya is worth fighting for, and I believe \nit is, then the United States must remain strongly engaged to force \nQadhafi to leave power. Nothing less is desirable or sustainable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB.

Mr. President, I was originally going to call up a pending \namendment, No. 215, the Rockefeller amendment. I am informed that \namendment is at present the subject of some negotiation and a consent \npackage. I do wish to speak briefly today in support of the amendment \nfiled by Senator Rockefeller and on his behalf, since he is away from \nthe Senate today attending the funeral of a close friend.\n  Like Senator McConnell, I have expressed deep reservations about the \nconsequences of unilateral regulation of greenhouse gases by the EPA. \nIn my view, this will result in long and expensive regulatory processes \nthat could lead to overly stringent and very costly controls on carbon \ndioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. This regulatory framework \nis so broad and potentially far-reaching that it could eventually touch \nnearly every facet of this Nation's economy, putting unnecessary \nburdens on industry and driving many businesses overseas through \npolicies that have been implemented purely at the discretion of the \nexecutive branch and absent a clearly stated intent of the Congress.\n  Our farms, factories, transportation systems, and power-generating \ncapacity all would be subject to these new regulations. This \nunprecedented, sweeping authority over our economy at the hands of the \nEPA is at the heart of the concern expressed by Senator McConnell, and \nultimately, whichever way one ends up voting on his amendment, that \ncommon concern defines this debate.\n  It is not a new concern for me. When this administration declared in \nNovember of 2009 that the President would sign a politically binding \nagreement at the United Nations framework on climate change in \nCopenhagen, I strongly and publicly objected. I sent a letter to the \nPresident stating:\n\n       Only specific legislation agreed upon in the Congress or a \n     treaty ratified by the Senate could actually create such a \n     commitment on behalf of our country.\n\n  I have also expressed on several occasions my belief that this \nadministration appears to be erecting new regulatory barriers to the \nsafe and legal mining of coal resources in Virginia and other States. \nMy consistent message to the EPA is that good intentions do not in and \nof themselves equal clear and unambiguous guidance from Congress. We \ncan see this in the approach the EPA has taken or attempted to take on \nthe regulation of coal ash, on regulating industrial and commercial \nboilers, on approving new levels of ethanol into gasoline, and, most \nimportantly, its overreach to regulate greenhouse gases from stationary \nsources. I have repeatedly raised these issues with the administration \nand my colleagues in the Senate.\n  In examining this issue, I have also reviewed carefully the Supreme \nCourt's holding in Massachusetts v. EPA.\n  My opposition to the EPA's present regulatory scheme with respect to \ncarbon dioxide or stationary sources stems in part from my reading of \nthis case. I am not convinced the Clean Air Act was ever intended to \nregulate or to classify as a dangerous pollutant something as basic and \nubiquitous as carbon dioxide. I say that as one of the few Members of \nthis body who are engineers.\n  To quote one of the most influential Supreme Court Justices from the \nlast century, Justice Cardozo:\n\n       The legislation which has found expression in this code is \n     not canalized within the banks that keep it from overflowing.\n\n  The case Justice Cardozo was commenting on dealt with a different \nissue but the constitutional precept still applies. Congress should \nnever abdicate or transfer to others the essential legislative \nfunctions given to it and it alone by the Constitution.\n  The sweeping actions the EPA proposes to undertake clearly overflow \nthe appropriate regulatory banks established by Congress, with the \npotential to affect every aspect of the American economy. Such action \nrepresents a significant overreach by the executive branch.\n  Notwithstanding these serious concerns with what I view as EPA's \npotentially unchecked regulation in a number of areas important to the \neconomy, I do have concerns about the McConnell amendment for a number \nof reasons.\n  First, the McConnell resolution would jeopardize the progress this \nadministration has made in forging a consensus on motor vehicle fuel \neconomy and emission standards. The Obama administration has brokered \nan agreement to establish one national program for fuel economy and \ngreenhouse gas standards. This agreement means that our beleaguered \nautomotive industry will not face a patchwork quilt of varying State \nand Federal emission standards. Significantly, this agreement is \ndirectly in line with the holding in Massachusetts v. EPA which dealt \nwith motor vehicle emissions. In fact, it dealt with new car motor \nvehicle emissions.\n  Both in the Clean Air Act and in subsequent legislation enacted by \nthe Congress, there has been a far greater consensus on regulation of \nmotor vehicle emissions than on stationary sources with respect to \ngreenhouse gas emissions. It has been estimated that these new rules, \nwhich are to apply to vehicles of model years 2012 to 2016, would\n\n[[Page S1923]]\n\nsave 1.8 billion barrels of oil and millions of dollars in consumer \nsavings. That agreement, however, and the regulations that would \neffectuate it rest upon enforcement of the Clean Air Act, which would \nessentially be overturned by the McConnell amendment.\n  We have before us a different but equally effective mechanism to \nensure that Congress and not unelected Federal officials can formulate \nour policies on climate change and on energy legislation. The \nRockefeller amendment, which I have cosponsored, would suspend EPA's \nregulation of greenhouse gases from stationary sources for 2 years. \nThis approach would give Congress the time it needs to address \nlegitimate concerns with climate change and yet would not disrupt or \nreverse the progress made on motor vehicle fuel and emission standards.\n  The majority leader had previously assured me and Senator Rockefeller \nof his commitment to bring the Rockefeller amendment to the floor. I \nvery much appreciate his stated intention to do so. I hope we will have \nthe opportunity to vote on this measure within the next day or so.\n  Finally, let me say that I share the hope of many Members of this \nbody from both sides of the aisle that we can enact some form of energy \nlegislation this year. I have consistently outlined key elements I \nwould like to see in an energy package. I have introduced legislation, \nalong with Senator Alexander, to encourage different forms of energy \nlegislation that would in and of themselves help produce a cleaner \nenvironment and more energy independence. We should all be exploring \nthose types of mechanisms that will, at the same time, incentivize \nfactory owners, manufacturers, and consumers to become more energy \nefficient and to fund research and development for technologies that \nwill enable the safe and clean use of our country's vast fossil fuels \nand other resources.\n\n  The second thing I would say--just as a comment--since I was shown a \nletter earlier today from the Chamber of Commerce strongly suggesting \nthe only viable alternative in this debate is the McConnell amendment, \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter that was \nsent last September by the Chamber of Commerce and more than a dozen \nother business entities, associations in support of the Rockefeller \namendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 14, 2010.\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye,\n     Chairman, Senate Appropriations Committee, U.S. Capitol, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Vice Chairman, Senate Appropriations Committee, U.S. Capitol, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Cochran: Unless \n     Congress acts this Fall new Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) rules regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under \n     the Clean Air Act will go into effect on January 2, 2011. The \n     rules impose a significant burden across the U.S. economy, \n     including the sectors that will create jobs and lead us in \n     our economic recovery. It is Congress' prerogative to enact a \n     national climate policy, not the EPA's. Fortunately, there \n     are opportunities for Congress to exercise its prerogative \n     prior to the end of the legislative session.\n       We urge your strong support for measures to temporarily \n     restrict EPA's authority to implement the GHG rules affecting \n     stationary sources, and to give Congress the time necessary \n     to consider the appropriate regulatory approach for those \n     sources.\n       According to EPA, as many as six million of America's \n     industrial facilities, power plants, hospitals, agricultural \n     and commercial establishments eventually will be subject to \n     these rules, at a considerable cost and burden on jobs, state \n     resources and the ability to move forward on a national \n     climate policy. State implementing agencies have no guidance \n     on issuing the required permits, the measures needed to \n     comply are not known, and both state implementing agencies \n     and covered commercial facilities will be left in a bind. \n     There is the very real prospect that investments by \n     businesses across the entire economy--the investments that \n     will drive economic recovery and job creation--will be \n     delayed, curtailed or, even worse, cancelled.\n       The appropriations process can ensure that the potentially \n     damaging impacts of EPA's rules are postponed for a two or \n     three year period pending Congressional action. Indeed, the \n     approach would allow any restrictions on funding in a manner \n     that still allows EPA's rules on motor vehicles to continue \n     in effect unchanged. More importantly, the appropriations \n     process provides Congress an important oversight and \n     management tool that will inform the further development of a \n     national climate policy. Other approaches, such as a \n     codification of EPA's ``tailoring'' rule to ease the \n     potential burden on smaller businesses have been suggested. \n     Unfortunately, the vast majority of American businesses \n     affected by the GHG rules will not be protected by a simple \n     codification of EPA's rules.\n       Representatives Nick Rahall and Rick Boucher and Senator \n     Jay Rockefeller have introduced legislation (the Stationary \n     Source Regulations Delay Act, H.R. 4753 and S. 3072, \n     respectively) to place a two year moratorium on the EPA's \n     actions to regulate GHGs from stationary sources.\n       Senator Rockefeller has received a commitment from Majority \n     Leader Harry Reid to hold a vote on his bill in September. We \n     support the concept of a two-year postponement and urge your \n     strong support as an appropriate legislative measure is \n     developed and considered. Simply, a two-year moratorium will \n     prevent the negative economic impacts anticipated from the \n     EPA GHG rule.\n       In short, American businesses, investment, and jobs need \n     your active support. We urge you to support efforts to \n     postpone EPA regulation of GHG emissions from all stationary \n     sources through targeted amendments to relevant \n     appropriations measures or legislation based on the Rahall/\n     Boucher or Rockefeller bills.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Chemistry Council, American Farm Bureau \n           Federation, American Forest & Paper Association, \n           American Frozen Food Institute, American Petroleum \n           Institute, American Iron and Steel Institute, Ball Clay \n           Producers Association, CropLife America, International \n           Diatomite Producers Association, Industrial Minerals \n           Association--North America, Missouri Forest Products \n           Association, National Association of Chemical \n           Distributors, National Association of Manufacturers, \n           National Association of Oilseed Processors, National \n           Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, National \n           Industrial Sand Association, National Lime Association, \n           National Mining Association, National Petrochemical & \n           Refiners Association, Society of Chemical Manufacturers \n           and Affiliates, The Aluminum Association, The \n           Fertilizer Institute, Treated Wood Council, U.S. \n           Chamber of Commerce.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 183\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say to my good friend \nfrom Virginia, I agree with everything he said up to the last 3 \nminutes, because we have something that needs to be talked about. I \nwould only make reference to the letter that has been entered into the \nRecord that, yes, did make that statement, that if the choice is to do \nnothing at all or to have the Rockefeller amendment, it is better to \ndelay something bad for 2 years. But that is not the choice.\n  The choice is--and he has referred to it as the McConnell amendment; \nthat happens to be the bill I introduced and is now offered as an \namendment to the Small Business Act--and it is one that will actually \nresolve the problem.\n  I think it is necessary to set the record straight as to what the two \nalternatives are. I call them covers. This is kind of a term that is \nused inside these Halls when someone is wanting to vote against \nsomething that people at home want and they give them something else to \nvote for so we can offer cover--something that normally is \nmeaningless--such as these two cover votes.\n  The cap-and-trade agenda--I think we all understand--is destroying \njobs in America and certainly decreasing our domestic energy supply. As \na consequence, the consumers are going to pay more for their gas, for \ntheir electric bills, in a tax on affordable energy. But it can be \nstopped. It can be stopped by the passage of the Energy Tax Prevention \nAct of 2011 or, as we are looking at it now, that same bill being \nencompassed as an amendment called amendment No. 183 to the Small \nBusiness Act.\n  Let me go back, if I could, kind of in history to make sure people \nunderstand where we are today and how we got here. Many years ago, back \nin the 1990s, they came forward--and this was during the Clinton-Gore \nadministration--with the Kyoto treaty. They went to Kyoto, Japan, and \nsaid: We want to join with all the other countries and we want to \nreduce emissions from CO2. This was a treaty you would sign \non to and most of the European countries did and many others did.\n  I might add now, many years later, none of them that signed on to it \nwere able to accomplish any kind of reduction, meaningful reduction in \nemissions. But nonetheless, we had that.\n  I can remember standing at this podium and saying back then that we \nare not going to ratify any agreement that\n\n[[Page S1924]]\n\nis made at Kyoto that does not affect the developing countries the same \nas the developed countries. In other words, if it is not going to cover \nChina, Mexico, and different countries in Africa, then we do not want \nto be the only ones this affects because it is going to be a very \npunitive situation. Secondly, we were not going to ratify any kind of a \ntreaty that was an economic hardship on our country. We successfully \nstopped it.\n  Then, in 2003, they started introducing legislation that would do by \nlegislation what the Kyoto treaty would have done, but it would only \naffect the United States of America. At that time, Republicans were the \nmajority. I was the chairman of the committee that is called the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. We had the jurisdiction over \nthis issue. So I almost unilaterally was able to stop this legislation \nfrom taking place. We had the same legislation that came up again in \n2005, 2007, 2008, and 2009, and it has been before us for votes now in \nthe Senate seven different times. Each time we defeated it. I might \nadd, we defeated it by a larger margin each time we defeated it.\n  It is kind of interesting because I have had so many people say to \nme: Inhofe, what if you are wrong? What if CO2 is damaging \nto the environment? What if it causes some of these problems people say \nit does? Well, I have to say, the science has been mixed. The science \nhas been cooked in many cases. The United Nations came up with the \nIPCC, which was the science that was used to base all these new \nprograms on, and it has been pretty much scandalized in the climategate \nsituation. But, nonetheless, that is something we do not need to talk \nabout. The point is, we were able to stop any legislation.\n  Why did we want to stop legislation that puts restrictions on \nCO2? Well, one reason is--and it came up very clearly, and I \nalways give my appreciation to Lisa Jackson. Lisa Jackson is the Obama-\nappointed Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. I asked \nher the question some time ago in a public hearing, live on TV. I \nasked: If we were to pass any of these pieces of legislation--at that \ntime I think it was the Waxman-Markey bill--would this have any \nmeaningful reduction in terms of CO2 emissions in the world? \nThe answer was, no, it would not because this would only apply to the \nUnited States of America. If we do it here, we will take all the \nfinancial hardship of doing it; however, as we lose our manufacturing \nbase, they will go to other countries where there are less emission \nrequirements. China is a good example. China's doors are open now to \ntry to say: Come, we are cranking out three to four coal-fired \ngenerating plants in China every week. So, manufacturers, come here. We \nhave the energy you need. So they were then able to do it.\n  When the Obama administration came in, with a strong majority in both \nthe House and the Senate, they said: All right, we will tell you what. \nSince you are not going to pass cap and trade, then we will do it \nthrough regulations.\n  What would cap and trade do to America? Granted, by everyone's \nadmission, it would not reduce emissions at all worldwide. So what \nwould it cost? Well, the cost was put together back during the Kyoto \ntreaty by the Wharton School at that time. Since then, MIT, CRA, many \nothers have come in. The range is always between $300 and $400 billion \na year.\n  I am not as smart as a lot of guys around here, so when I hear about \nbillions and trillions, I say: How does that affect people in my State \nof Oklahoma? So I have the math that I do. I say to the Presiding \nOfficer, I take the total number of people and families in my State of \nOklahoma who file a tax return, and then when they come up with \nsomething that is going to cost our Nation $300 to $400 billion, I do \nthe math. What that would amount to for my average family in Oklahoma \nwho files a tax return is $3,100 a year, and they do not get anything \nfor it.\n  Anyway, the President came in with the new majority, and he said: \nWell, if you are not going to pass this, we are going to go ahead and \ndo it by regulation. We will have the Environmental Protection Agency \ndo it by regulation.\n  To do that, they had to have what is called an endangerment finding; \nthat is, a finding that CO2 is an endangerment to health. \nThe courts never said we have to regulate CO2. They said: If \nyou want to, you can. That was the choice of this administration and of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency.\n  So I asked the question again at one of the hearings--this is of the \nsame Administrator Jackson; this was a year ago December--I said: I \nhave a feeling you are going to come up with an endangerment finding so \nyou have justification for regulating CO2 the same as if we \nwere passing legislation to do it. Her response was kind of a smile. I \nsaid: To have an endangerment finding, you have to base that on \nscience. What science are you going to base it on? She said: Well, \nprimarily, the IPCC. That is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange. That is the United Nations. They are the ones that started all \nthis fun stuff.\n  With that, it was not more than 2 weeks later that the scandal broke \nwith the recovery of some of the e-mails that were sent out by the IPCC \nthat they had, in fact, cooked the science. Nonetheless, there are \nlawsuits that are pending right now and all that to try to stop the EPA \nfrom regulating CO2.\n  They are doing other regulatory things right now. They are trying to \ndo regional haze regulation. They are trying to do regulation on ozone, \nchanging the standards, trying to do what they call boiler MACT, \nutility MACT, other regulations. But, nonetheless, this one we are \ntalking about today is the regulation of greenhouse gases.\n  This is what is happening right now. To keep them from doing it, I \nintroduced a piece of legislation called the Energy Tax Prevention Act \nof 2011. My good friend over in the House of Representatives, Fred \nUpton, has been a friend of mine for many years. He is the chairman of \nthe appropriate committee over there; the same as I am the ranking \nmember of the appropriate committee here. So we introduced together the \nUpton-Inhofe legislation or, if you are over on this side, I call it \nthe Inhofe-Upton legislation. That would take away the jurisdiction of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases. If we \ntake away the jurisdiction, they cannot do it. That is the ultimate \nsolution. That is the moment of truth, as we are going to read in \ntomorrow morning's Wall Street Journal. So they are taking that up. \nThey will pass it over there. But on a partisan basis over here, they \nwill try to kill it.\n\n  So what we have done is, Leader Mitch McConnell and I have offered an \namendment that encompasses my bill, the Energy Tax Prevention Act I \njust referred to, as an amendment on the Small Business Act. That is \nscheduled for a vote tomorrow morning. I hope it does happen.\n  The reason I am talking today--I have already covered this several \ntimes, and I am sure people are tired of hearing it--but they have \ncover votes that are coming up, and we know this is going to happen. \nBut why is it this administration wants to do something that is going \nto drive the energy costs of America upward?\n  This administration has said over and over again they do not want \ngas, they do not want oil, they do not want coal. And we cannot run \nthis machine called America without oil, gas, and coal.\n  There is a motivation here; that is, it has come from this \nadministration that they want to replace fossil fuels--oil, gas, and \ncoal--with what they call green energy. Someday that might happen. It \nwill be long after I am gone, I am sure. But they might have the \ntechnology to run this country on what they call renewable energy. \nRight now, we are going to use as much as we can. We are for wind \npower, we are for Sun power, solar power, all the other options. But, \nnonetheless, we still have to have fossil fuels to run the country.\n  Steven Chu, Secretary of Energy for the Obama administration, said:\n\n       Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline to the levels in Europe.\n\n  That is $8 a gallon. This is the administration saying we want to \nincrease the price of gasoline to be equal to what it is in Western \nEurope. So this is something that has been a policy of this \nadministration for a long time. In fact, President Obama himself said \nthat under the cap-and-trade plan--this is what they are trying to do\n\n[[Page S1925]]\n\nnow--``electricity prices would necessarily skyrocket.''\n  The President had it right. The point of cap-and-trade regulation is \nto make us pay more for energy bills, and the Obama administration and \nEPA are here to make that happen. In a recent editorial, the Wall \nStreet Journal calls the Energy Tax Prevention Act, my bill, ``one of \nthe best proposals for growth and job creation to make it onto the \nSenate docket in years.''\n  Why is that? It is because the EPA's regulations will raise energy \nprices and strangle economic growth. As the National Association of \nManufacturers stated:\n\n       At a time when our economy is attempting to recover from \n     the most severe recession since the 1930s, [EPA] regulations \n     . . . will establish disincentives for the long-term \n     investments necessary to grow jobs and expedite economic \n     recovery.\n\n  That is the National Association of Manufacturers. The families, the \nworkers, and the consumers are all going to feel the pain.\n  In a study that Charles River Associates International did, they \nestimate that EPA's cap-and-trade regulations could increase wholesale \nelectricity costs by 35 to 45 percent. What we are talking about is--\neveryone understands--if they are able to do these regulations, the EPA \ndoing what the legislature refused to do; that is, regulate the \nemissions of fossil fuels, it will increase electricity prices about 40 \npercent.\n  What do we get in return? I think we have already mentioned we do not \nget anything for this because it would drive our jobs elsewhere, and it \nwould only affect the United States of America.\n  The claims that the Energy Tax Prevention Act--that is the amendment \nwe will be voting on tomorrow--would undermine health protections or \nfuel economy standards are disingenuous on their face. The amendment \ndoes not touch EPA's authority to regulate criteria or hazardous air \npollutants. What is more, both emissions of CO2 and real \npollution have been in steady decline. Yet instances of asthma have \nbeen on the increase. So as the emissions decline, the instances have \nactually increased. Carbon dioxide emissions do not cause asthma, \neither directly or indirectly, and they do not harm public health.\n  The Energy Tax Prevention Act is not about asthma and public health, \nbut it is about protecting jobs.\n  By the way, there is a very well respected scientist by the name of \nRichard Lindzen from MIT, and he wrote a letter to me which I received \na couple of days ago--well, it was actually a little bit longer than \nthat.\n\n       As to the impact of increasing CO2 on general \n     welfare, there is widespread agreement that modest warming \n     should improve welfare for the U.S. Under the circumstances, \n     we are in the bizarre situation of declaring something to be \n     a pollutant when the evidence suggests that it is beneficial.\n\n  In other words--I hesitate saying this. I am the first one to admit I \nam not a scientist, but certainly Professor Lindzen is. He says, Here \nwe are talking about reducing something that is not a problem certainly \nto health.\n  Then the other thing having to do with the Highway--this was \nmentioned by the Senator from Virginia a few moments ago--that somehow \nthis is going to impair our standards of lowering gas consumption. The \namendment doesn't prohibit the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration from setting fuel economy standards. It stops the EPA \nfrom regulating carbon dioxide from tailpipes after 2016. So the \nregulation would have no effect on that whatsoever. That is not done by \nthe EPA; that is done by the National Highway Safety Administration, \ncalled NHTSA.\n  The vote comes down to a simple choice: Are you for jobs and \naffordable energy or President Obama's strategy of energy taxes and \nbureaucratic regulations? Of course, when you look at the things that \nare coming along--I mentioned when I started talking that there is \nsomething called ``cover,'' that if there is something out there that \nthe people at home are clamoring for, that they want--in this case they \nwant this amendment that will stop the EPA from regulating greenhouse \ngases--then if they can vote for something else that does nothing, they \ncan say, Well, I voted for this. It is called cover.\n  The Rockefeller vote would be nothing, except kicking the can down \nthe road for 2 years, and in the meantime the regulation goes on.\n  Under the Baucus amendment, this is something that is called the \ntailoring rule. It is a little more complicated because when you talk \nabout the emissions that we are concerned with that the EPA would be \nregulating, they would be on any emissions that would affect all the \nfarmers, the schoolhouses, and everybody else. Well, the Baucus \namendment would exempt some of these smaller ones. However, if you \nlisten to the Farm Bureau, which has been very helpful in this all \nalong--I think I have their quotes here. Yes. Listen to this, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, a recent quote, just this year:\n\n       Farmers and ranchers would still incur the higher costs of \n     compliance passed down from utilities, refiners and \n     fertilizer manufacturers that are directly regulated as of \n     January 2, 2011.\n\n  So if the Baucus amendment passes, it is going to still be \nregulated--the refiners, the manufacturers--and that is going to be \npassed down and it is going to increase the cost of power and energy \nand that is why the Farm Bureau is so emphatic. In fact, I just left \nthe Farm Bureau a couple of minutes ago before I came here, talking \nabout this very subject.\n  The manufacturers feel the same way. The Industrial Energy Consumers \nof America wrote the Baucus approach:\n\n       does not solve the underlying problem that regulating \n     [greenhouse gases] under the Clean Air Act is very costly for \n     manufacturing, will impact global competitiveness and \n     encourage capital investment outside the United States.\n\n  Why would that be? Because if China ends up with all the jobs, then \nthey are the ones who would be getting the investment.\n  The only way to stop the higher costs of compliance, which the Farm \nBureau fears, is to pass the Energy Tax Prevention Act which is now \nSenate amendment No. 183.\n  The contrast couldn't be starker. I was told that tomorrow morning we \nmay see the moment of truth going on--and I think it is going to be in \nthe Wall Street Journal--that people are going to realize there is only \none way to stop this massive tax and regulation increase that will \ncome. It won't be by the Rockefeller amendment and it won't be by the \nBaucus amendment. It will be by the Inhofe-McConnell amendment that \nhopefully will be voted on tomorrow and that will take out from the \njurisdiction of the EPA the ability to regulate greenhouse gases. That \nis what we are hoping will happen, and I think when people realize it, \nthey are not going to be fooled by some of these what I refer to as \ncover votes.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to talk a little bit about the \nMcConnell amendment that I think we will vote on on the floor of the \nSenate this week. This is the amendment that really clarifies whether \nCongress ever intended to give the Environmental Protection Agency the \nauthority to regulate greenhouse gases. They have a finding that gives \nthem that authority, but the people who were involved in passing that \nlaw initially say that wasn't the intention of the law; that if it is \nthe intention of the law, the Congress should step up and clarify that.\n  I think this amendment clearly expresses the view of the American \npeople that the Congress should do its job, not leave it to the \nregulators to do the job. Senator McConnell has brought that amendment \nto the floor. It is an amendment that Senator Inhofe has worked on \nregarding this topic for a long time. Senator Barrasso has also worked \non this topic.\n  I am convinced that as the ballots are cast and the votes are made \nthis week on this bill and on this amendment, Senators from both \nparties are going to say: No, that is not the job of the EPA. It is not \nwhat the Congress intended EPA to do.\n  This is a great example of the Congress trying to step up and make \nthe point that the regulators should not be\n\n[[Page S1926]]\n\nable to do by regulation what the legislators are unwilling to do by \nlegislation.\n  This issue was discussed last year--the cap-and-trade law that passed \nthe House in the last Congress. People around America looked at it and \nsaid that higher prices were not the way to get more efficient energy \npolicies. The way to get more efficient energy policies is to look for \nways to produce more American energy, to have a marketplace that has \nmore choices than the ones we have now. As people looked at this issue, \nthey said: Let's find more American energy of all kinds, and let's be \nconservationists and encourage that we use that energy as efficiently \nas possible, and let's also be out there researching and investing in \nthe future so that we know what we want our energy picture to look like \na generation from now--not that we blindly rush in and think high \nprices will solve our energy problems.\n  We all know that the President of the United States, before the \nelection in 2008, in talking to the editorial board of the San \nFrancisco Chronicle, made the comment that under his energy policies, \nenergy prices would necessarily skyrocket. The President has looked at \nthis economy closely--I hope--over the last 2 years of his Presidency, \nand clearly every signal from the administration now is that they have \nconcerns about $4-a-gallon gasoline, even though there are people in \nthat advisory group who at one time said gas prices should be as high \nas the gas prices in Europe and that is the way to solve our use of \ngasoline. We don't live in Europe. We live in a country that is large, \nexpansive, and requires travel and commerce. So high gas prices are not \nthe answer to our transportation problems, and higher utility bills are \nnot the answer to our energy problems.\n  In fact, as people looked at the potential of cap and trade on \nutility bills, they looked at how much of our utilities come from coal. \nOf course, cap and trade--and the EPA regulations that would try to \nimpose cap and trade by regulation--cap and trade is particularly \nfocused on coal-based utilities. From the middle of Pennsylvania to the \nwestern edge of Wyoming, 50 percent of the electricity in the country \ncomes from coal. Mr. President, in your State and my State, a \nsignificant majority of the electricity comes from coal. In Missouri, \nit is 82 percent of the electricity that comes from coal.\n  In our State, the utility providers got together--the rural electric \ncooperatives, the municipal utilities, the privately owned and publicly \nowned--and funded a study with which nobody ever found fault. Nobody \nhas challenged the study. In that study, in our State the average \nutility bill would go up about 80 percent in the first 10 years under \ncap and trade. It would come close to doubling in the first 12 years. \nFor many utility customers, it would double. If the average bill is \ngoing to go up 80 percent, for many customers out there, their bill \nwould double in 10 years, and for the average customer, it would double \nin about a dozen years. Who benefits from that?\n  At a hearing the other day with the EPA Administrator, I talked about \na visit I had last fall with someone who explained to me that he was an \nhourly employee at a company--by that point, with the discussion of cap \nand trade, almost all Missourians knew our utility bills would double \nin about 10 years--and he said: If my utility bill doubles, that is a \nbad thing. If my retired mother's bill doubles, that is worse. If the \nutility bill at work doubles and my job goes away, then the other bills \ndon't matter that much because I can't pay mine and help my mom pay \nhers.\n  That individual has a Ph.D. in common sense, if not economics. That \nis what happens if we allow these bills to go up. Because of that \ndiscussion, I stand here today absolutely confident that, in the \nforeseeable future, Congress will not impose that penalty on our \neconomy. If the Congress won't impose that penalty on our economy, we \nshould not let regulators impose that penalty on our economy.\n  What the McConnell amendment does--again, with the hard work of \nSenators Inhofe, Barrasso, and others--is simply redefine the authority \nor maybe reemphasize the definition Congress thought it was giving the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and it says: You can't regulate these \ngreenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. It doesn't stop the Clean Air \nAct's provisions to protect clean air in every way that was anticipated \nuntil the recent determination that somehow EPA had the authority to \nalso regulate greenhouse gases, but it does refocus the EPA on the \nintention of the Clean Air Act, not their expansion of the Clean Air \nAct.\n\n  By the way, the EPA has no ability to expand the Clean Air Act. That \nis the job of the Congress of the United States. Fine, if we want to \nhave that debate. In fact, we had that debate last year. The House \npassed a bill that would have done what the EPA's new sense of their \nown mission would do, and I think the American people spoke pretty \nloudly about that. Because of that, the last Congress didn't pass that \nbill. The House of Representatives passed a bill, but the Senate didn't \npass that bill. This Congress isn't going to pass that bill either, and \nI would predict that the next Congress won't pass that bill.\n  Why won't they pass the bill? Why won't we pass a bill in this \nCongress? Why won't the next Congress pass a bill? They know it has a \ndevastating impact on our economy; and if the Congress doesn't want \nthere to be a devastating impact on our economy, we also shouldn't want \nthe Environmental Protection Agency to do something that would have a \ndevastating impact on our economy.\n  In fact, when we look at the economies around the world, the \neconomies that have the greatest problems with air and water are the \neconomies that failed; the economies where, at some point, those \ncountries decide, ultimately, they are going to do whatever it takes to \nget back to where they can have jobs that allow families to live.\n  The EPA is bound, and should be bound, by what the Congress initially \nintended with the Clean Air Act, not what the EPA thinks today is their \njob--and particularly if it is not a job that everybody in this \nbuilding knows the legislators will not do. If the legislators won't do \nit, the legislators shouldn't let the regulators do it, and this simply \nclarifies that.\n  I urge my colleagues this week to vote for this amendment, to make it \nclear to the Environmental Protection Agency that they have plenty of \nthings to do and many things that we will support them as they do, but \nthis isn't one of them. This hurts our economy. It is not their \nmission. It was not the intention of the Clean Air Act. This amendment \nallows that to be reinforced once again by the Congress, the group that \nis supposed to pass the laws. Laws aren't supposed to be passed by \nregulators. I suppose they are intentionally determined to be \nimplemented by regulators but not created by regulators or created by \nthe administration. That is our job.\n  This bill reemphasizes our job. Again, it doesn't let the regulatory \ngroup do a job that increases the utility bill, that doubles the \nelectric bill in Missouri, and raises the electric bill for the vast \npreponderance of Americans, for people retired, on a fixed income. \nClearly, jobs will go away if those electric bills are raised, and they \nwill not go to other places in the United States in most cases; they \nwill go to other countries that care a whole lot less about what comes \nout of the smoke stack than we do.\n  So if the EPA is allowed to do with greenhouse gases what it says it \nwants to do, we will lose the jobs and the problem will get greater \nbecause these jobs will go to countries that care a whole lot less \nabout emissions than we do.\n  Let's let the legislators do their job. I encourage my colleagues to \nvote for this amendment this week as they think about how we approach \nthis important issue--about our economy, about our jobs, about our \nfamilies and our future.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, rightfully so, the focus in this Congress \nis\n\n[[Page S1927]]\n\nvery much about the economy and job creation, and it is appropriate \nthat we have before the Senate a piece of legislation dealing with \nsmall business. We know small business and entrepreneurship is a path \nto job creation.\n  We are spending a lot of time in this Senate, in the House, and in \nWashington, DC, discussing the economy, and one of the things that is \nfront and center today is the need for us to be much more responsible \nin our spending habits. In my view, the Federal Government is \nfinancially broke. Rightfully so, we ought to pass a continuing \nresolution that reduces spending for the remaining 6 months of this \nfiscal year. We ought to quickly move to a budget and to an \nappropriations process that allows for the give-and-take, the \nconsideration of those things that we can afford to spend money on, the \nthings that are appropriately the role of the Federal Government, and \nfind those places in which we can again significantly reduce spending. \nThat is an important aspect of whether we are going to get our economy \nback on track and jobs created.\n  I think often we write off what happens in Washington, DC. The \nAmerican people see us as just Republicans and Democrats having one \nmore battle about spending and deficits. These are things I have heard, \ntopics I have heard discussed my entire life coming out of Washington, \nDC. The reality is, this is an important issue at an important time in \nour country's history. In the absence of an appropriate resolution of \nthis spending issue, in my view, the standard of living Americans enjoy \ntoday will be reduced, inflation will return, the value of the dollar \nwill be diminished, and the standard of living we have become \naccustomed to as Americans, as I say, will be diminished. But worse \nthan that, the opportunity for our children and grandchildren to pursue \nthe American dream will be less than what we want it to be, certainly \nless than what I experienced as an American growing up in this country.\n  Yes, it is no fun for us, as elected officials, to talk about what \nneeds to be cut, spending that needs to be reduced. I certainly stand \nwilling to work with my colleagues and with the President and others to \nsee we accomplish that goal of reducing spending, and the consequences \nof that being a better budget picture and a reduced deficit. But there \nis a positive aspect of what we can do to reduce our budget deficit \nthat goes beyond just cutting spending; that is, to create jobs, to \ncreate economic expansion.\n  The optimism this country needs can be restored by decisions we make \nin the Congress. Those decisions revolve around a business or an \nentrepreneur, a small business man or woman's decision that it is time \nto expand their plant, it is time to invest and put in more equipment, \nthat it is time to hire an additional employee.\n  In my view, one of the reasons that is not happening is the tax \nenvironment that has been created, the uncertainty that we have with \nwhat our Tax Code is going to be, the lack of access to credit, the \nuncertainty our bankers and other financial lenders face in determining \nwhether they can make a loan to a creditworthy customer, and especially \nthe one I want to talk about briefly today, which is the regulatory \nenvironment in which the business community finds itself.\n  This effort by the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate \ngreenhouse gases, in my view, is very negative toward job creation in \ntwo ways: One, it increases the cost of being in business, and that \noccurs at a time in which we don't expect other countries to abide by \nthe same regimen that we may create--that our Environmental Protection \nAgency may create--around the world, that we would not expect other \ncountries to abide by those same rules and regulations the EPA is \nputting in place.\n  That means, once again, American workers, American business is at a \ncompetitive disadvantage in comparison to those who make decisions \nabout where plants are located, and we lose access to world markets \nbecause someone else can sell something cheaper than we can because of \nrising costs of production.\n  So even if there is an effort that excludes agriculture or small \nbusiness from this legislation, the cost of production goes up, because \nin addition to the direct effect of having those regulations apply to \nyour business, there is the indirect increase in cost related to fuel \nand energy costs--electricity and gas.\n  Clearly, to me, if you care about job creation, you would make \ncertain that the Environmental Protection Agency does not head down the \npath that it is going, because of the increased cost of being in \nbusiness and the consequence that has for American business to be able \nto compete in a global economy.\n  The second aspect of that is, and I think it is one of the real drags \non today's recovery from the recession, is the uncertainty. No business \nperson feels comfortable today in making a decision to expand or to put \nmore people to work, to hire an additional employee, to invest in plant \nor equipment, because they do not know what the next set of regulations \nis going to do to their bottom line.\n  So with the uncertainty of this issue, we have had the drag upon our \neconomy with the thought that Congress might pass the legislation \nlabeled cap and trade. It became clear when the Senate adjourned at the \nend of 2010 that that was not going to happen. But then the uncertainty \nbecame, but what is the Environmental Protection Agency going to do?\n  As I visit plants, facilities across Kansas and talk to family owners \nof small businesses, manufacturers, the most common question I get from \na business owner is, what next is government going to do that may put \nme out of business? It is unfortunate. It seems as though government is \nno longer even neutral in regard to the success of a business in the \nUnited States but has become an adversary.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the McConnell amendment. I think it \nis a clear statement that the Environmental Protection Agency cannot do \nwhat it intends to do. It eliminates the uncertainty that a business \nperson faces, and it reduces the cost of being in business in a way \nthat says, we are going to grow the economy and put people to work.\n  We are going to have a lot of conversation on the Senate floor, we \nare going to have discussions with the administration, with our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives, about what spending we are \ngoing to cut. And those are difficult conversations. But I come back to \nthe point that we as Americans have the opportunity to be optimistic. \nWhat we need to do for us to have a bright future, what we can do to \nhave a positive conversation with the American people about what good \nthings are yet to come, revolves around the fact that we will get rid \nof onerous regulations that serve no valid purpose in improving our \nenvironment and create great uncertainty and ever increasing costs for \nbeing in business.\n  We can have this conversation in a vacuum. But the reality is, our \neconomy does not operate in a vacuum. Our business folks in Kansas and \nacross the country have to compete in a global economy. This \nlegislation that Senator McConnell and Senator Inhofe have offered \neliminates that uncertainty, reduces the cost of being in business, and \nallows us to have optimism about the future of the American economy \nand, most importantly, optimism for the people who sit around their \ndining room table wanting to make certain they either can keep a job or \nfind a job.\n  I see the McConnell amendment as that moment of optimism. The message \nwe send to the American worker, to those who are employed and to those \nwho are unemployed, that this Senate understands that unless we get rid \nof the impediments toward growing an economy, we have little optimism \nabout the future of job creation.\n  The McConnell amendment sends that message. It does it in a way that \nmakes a lot of sense for the American economy and for the American \nworker.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1927-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1927-S1928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado.

JONES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe Commonwealth's finest, the late Mr. Reid S. Jones. A native of \nPulaski County, KY, Reid was a prime example of a man who was a true \nAmerican hero and who valued his faith, his family, and his community.\n  A rich tradition of business success and pride in hard work and \nachievement always seemed prevalent throughout the history of Reid's \nfamily, so it came as no surprise when Reid began to exhibit early \nsigns of entrepreneurial instincts. As a young boy, members of his \nhometown witnessed Reid leading a small goat down a road from the \ncountry store operated by his parents to a local family farm as he \ntried to make a sale. It was this ambition and drive that made Reid S. \nJones a leader, a war hero, and a guiding force for all who knew him.\n  Reid, who passed away on April 15, 2005, joined the U.S. Army in 1944 \nat a crucial point during World War II. Eighteen years old, Reid felt a \nstrong desire to serve and protect his country as well as to defend the \nrights and freedoms of others. He courageously fought in the Battle of \nthe Bulge, one of the deadliest battle for American forces of the war. \nReid's leadership got him promoted to the rank of staff sergeant, and \nhe remained in Germany for a short time after the war to help begin the \nreconstruction process.\n  After returning home from the war to his new bride Elva Sears, Reid \nreceived a bachelor's degree from Union College in Barbourville, KY. He \ndecided to further his dedication for educational excellence and became \na history teacher, principal, and basketball coach for the Pulaski \nCounty and Somerset City school systems. His firm yet compassionate \ncharacter made Reid well-respected by his peers and fondly remembered \nby his former students. Later in the 1960s he became a district sales \nmanager for the Fram Corporation, an automotive product brand best \nknown for their oil filters. His eye for detail and strong ambition to \nget things done earned him frequent recognition for exceeding sales \nquotas and helped him play an instrumental role in placing Fram \nproducts in Wal-Marts across the southeastern United States.\n  Reid's ``jack of all trades'' ability eventually led him to open his \nown automotive businesses, as well as become a 32nd-degree Mason, a \nmember of the Oleika Shriners Temple, and the board of directors of the \nFirst United Methodist Church.\n  In addition to serving his community through business and educational \nwork, Reid deeply cherished the relationships he had with his friends \nand family. He has often been remembered through the strong friendships \nhe formed with members of the Somerset community, as he met daily with \nfriends at his automotive businesses for coffee and southern \nstorytelling. His dedication to public service and education, led his \nwife, along with his daughter, Dr. Sonya Jones, to establish The Jones \nEducational Foundation, to provide scholarships and assistance for \npeople of south-central Kentucky and beyond who seek greater education \nand who show effort and ability.\n  There is no doubt that because of Reid's character, his dedication to \nfamily and friends, and his contributions to higher education and the \nbusiness community, that his town, the Commonwealth, and the country \nhave been forever changed for the better.\n  The Commonwealth Journal recently published an article about Mr. Reid \nS. Jones and a contribution that his daughter made to the Jones \nEducational Foundation on behalf of his dear friend, the late James \nEastham. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Commonwealth Journal, Jan. 30, 2011]\n\n   Foundation launches Reid S. Jones Memorial Fund With Contribution \n                     Honoring James `Onion' Eastham\n\n       The Jones Educational Foundation Inc., a 501(c)3 not-for-\n     profit corporation based in Somerset, has launched the Reid \n     S. Jones Memorial Fund with a $1,000 contribution made by Dr. \n     Sonya Jones honoring the late James Arthur ``Onion'' Eastham.\n       According to Dr. Jones, president and CEO of The Jones \n     Foundation, the donation is intended to pay tribute to the \n     friendship between James ``Onion'' Eastham, a man who was \n     regarded highly in the Somerset community, and her father.\n       Further, the fund is meant to honor veterans from all the \n     wars in which the United States has fought. The initial \n     donation honors veterans who served in the European and \n     Pacific theaters of World War II.\n       ``I had been thinking about the Foundation setting up a \n     fund for veterans in Dad's name ever since I made a donation \n     in his memory to help restore the Soldiers and Sailors \n     Memorial building at Union College,'' Dr. Jones said.\n       Reid Jones graduated from Union in 1989. He went on to do \n     graduate work in education at Eastern Kentucky University.\n       ``When Mr. Eastham passed away in late December, I knew it \n     was time,'' Dr. Jones added. ``Dad thought so much of his \n     friend that I felt he would want me to do something special \n     to honor Onion's memory.''\n       Reid Sievers Jones (April 24, 1926 to April 15, 2005) \n     entered the U.S. Army at a crucial point in the history of \n     World War II. He was stationed in Germany, and he fought in \n     the Battle of the Bulge. He was a survivor in what has been \n     called ``one of the bloodiest battles'' of World War II.\n       Conducted in the dense mountainous region of Belgium, the \n     Battle of the Bulge was Adolf Hitler's last major offensive \n     against the Allies. The battle ran from Dec. 16, 1944, until \n     Jan. 25, 1945.\n       When he enlisted in the Army as a private, Reid Jones was \n     18 years of age. He married Elva Sears on Dec. 30, 1944, \n     shortly before shipping out to the European front. He was \n     promoted to the rank of staff sergeant and remained in \n     Germany for a short time after the war to help begin the \n     process of reconstruction.\n       James ``Onion'' Eastham (Sept. 22, 1923, to Dec. 28, 2010) \n     served in the Asiatic-Pacific theater where he was awarded \n     two bronze stars for duty at and during the Luzon and \n     Southern Philippine campaigns. He also received the \n     Philippine Liberation Ribbon with a bronze star for duty \n     involving combat with the enemy.\n       Reid Jones and Onion Eastham were ``two of a kind,'' said \n     Jimmy Eastham, son of the former Somerset City Council member \n     who served as staff sergeant and crew chief aboard a B-25 \n     bomber in the United States Marine Corp.\n       Jones and Eastham both were salesmen after the war. Jones \n     worked for many years for Fram Corp. and Eastham for the \n     Morton Salt Co. The two men liked to get together and engage \n     in the high art of Southern storytelling. Both formed strong \n     friendships with other men in the Somerset community.\n       ``Dad and Onion Eastham were part of a group of men who \n     convened initially at Dad's car lot out on East Mt. Vernon \n     Street, then at Dad's automotive parts store on Ogden Street \n     in the building now owned by Dr. Byron Owens,'' Dr. Jones \n     said.\n       ``After Dad retired from Fram, he devoted most of his time \n     to the automotive business and our family's business and our \n     family's rental properties,'' Dr. Jones continued.\n       ``When Dad closed one automotive parts store housed in the \n     same building with Mother's antiques and collectibles, he and \n     his buddies met for coffee at the Sugar Shack over on the \n     strip,'' she said.\n       Meeting for coffee was part of their ``daily routine,'' \n     said Jimmy Eastham.\n       From time to time, the group also included Bobby Claunch, \n     Howard Eastham, Ledger Howard, Penny Starnes, Don Stone, Jim \n     Williams and Bob Williams in addition to Reid Jones and Onion \n     Eastham.\n       Like his father, Jimmy Eastham served as a member of \n     Somerset City Council. He and the Eastham family have given \n     their enthusiastic endorsement to the Reid S. Memorial Fund \n     with Dr. Jones' cornerstone contribution in memory of James \n     ``Onion'' Eastham.\n       ``It is a good idea to establish the fund even if it \n     weren't done in the name of my father,'' Eastham said.\n       Both Reid Jones and James Eastham were ``very patriotic,'' \n     according to Virginia Eastham, mother of Jimmy, Lisa (Bandy) \n     and Wayne Eastham.\n       When Reid Jones returned from the war, he worked first as a \n     teacher and principal in the Pulaski County and Somerset City \n     school systems. He is remembered, particularly by former \n     students at Shopville High School as a firm teacher who was \n     not afraid to exercise discipline when he thought it was \n     needed.\n       Later, in the 1960s, he joined Fram Corp., based in \n     Providence, R.I., as a district sales manager. Frequently, he \n     was recognized for exceeding sales quotas. He was \n     instrumental in placing Fram products in Wal-Marts across the \n     southeastern United States.\n       Reid Jones was a 32nd degree Mason and a member of Oleika \n     Shriners Temple in Lexington. He served on the board of \n     directors of First United Methodist Church.\n       In addition to being an influential member of Somerset City \n     Council, James ``Onion'' Eastham was a member of the Somerset \n     Masonic Lodge #111 and a long-standing member of the Kiwanis \n     Club. He was also a member of First Baptist Church where he \n     taught Sunday school and served as chair of a building \n     committee for the church's new sanctuary.\n\n[[Page S1929]]\n\n       As a member of Somerset City Council from 1964 to 1982, \n     Eastham played an active role in helping to establish \n     Somerset Community College and finding a location for what is \n     now Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital. He considered running \n     for mayor, but his job as a regional salesman for Morton Salt \n     Co. created time constraints that caused him not to seek \n     office.\n       According to Clarence Love, city clerk during the years \n     Eastham served on council, ``he was very conscientious.'' In \n     Love's opinion, Eastham was an ``excellent councilman.''\n       Jimmy Eastham said he thought his father most likely would \n     be remembered most for ``standing for what he believed in.''\n       The Reid S. Jones Memorial Fund was established, first and \n     foremost, to help veterans with educational issues.\n       ``A veteran might return from Afghanistan ready to go to \n     law school and need some assistance,'' Dr. Jones said. ``Or, \n     a veteran might return and want to become a law enforcement \n     officer or a mechanic.''\n       As interest on the fund grows, money will be awarded to \n     veterans who demonstrate great potential for success in \n     professional and vocational arenas.\n       Primarily, the Reid S. Jones Memorial Fund intends to honor \n     ``the warrior spirit,'' Dr. Jones said, ``the spirit of \n     courage and bravery'' that has helped keep the United States \n     free.\n       The Reid S. Jones Memorial Fund is now open for tax-\n     deductible contributions.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nimpressive accomplishments of a remarkable men's basketball team in the \nCommonwealth, the Bellarmine University Knights.\n  On March 26, the Knights made school history by winning the 2011 \nNational Collegiate Athletic Association Division II basketball \nchampionship. By defeating the Brigham Young University-Hawaii \nSeasiders 71 to 68, Bellarmine brought home its first national \nchampionship title in any sport. Senior guard Justin Benedetti \ndescribed the atmosphere in the MassMutual Center in Springfield, MA, \nwhere the championship game was held to be like a home game for the \nKnights, as many fans traveled to fill the crowd of nearly 3,000.\n  The morning following their championship win, hundreds of fans, \nalumni, and students cheered as the team returned to campus and filed \noff the bus holding high their national trophy. I applaud not only the \nteam's athletic achievement, but also the teamwork and sportsmanship on \ndisplay as they represented my hometown, Louisville, and our \nCommonwealth in front of the country's basketball fans.\n  A state that honors basketball will honor the 2011 Bellarmine Knights \nteam as among the best for seasons to come. Fans will remember a team \nof unselfish players whose only goal was to win. And they will remember \nhead coach Scott Davenport, who taught his players to play basketball \nthe way it was meant to be played.\n  Coach Davenport built this team around talented local players--the \nentire roster hails from Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio. A Louisville \nnative, he led his Knights to a 33-2 overall record this year on their \nway to the Division II championship. He can now add this collegiate \nchampionship to the one he earned coaching the Ballard High School \nBruins of Louisville, KY, to the State championship in 1988. It is no \nwonder he was recently named the 2011 Schelde North America/Division II \nBulletin Coach of the Year. I would like to extend my sincere \ncongratulations to Scott Davenport upon receiving this distinguished \nhonor.\n  Family members, friends, and the Louisville community are justifiably \nproud of this team's achievement and the recognition they have earned. \nThis season was a special one for Bellarmine University that we will \nremember for a long time to come.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Bellarmine \nUniversity Knights men's basketball team upon earning their first \nnational title. I wish them continued success both on and off the \ncourt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1929-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1929-S1931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE RALLY\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, on Saturday, March 26 several hundred \nmedical students from across the country came to our State Capital in \nMontpelier, VT, to rally in support of Vermont going forward with a \nMedicare for All Single Payer health care system.\n  These young people were absolutely clear in understanding that for \nthem to be the great physicians and nurses that they want to be, our \nhealth care system must change. They believe, as I do, that health care \nis a right and not a privilege and that a single payer program is the \nmost cost-effective way of achieving that goal. I am very pleased to \nsubmit for the Record the statement of principle signed by these \nmedical school students.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       As medical students from around the country converge this \n     weekend on the steps of the State House to support Vermont's \n     movement toward a single-payer health system, we want to \n     contribute additional perspectives on our state's discussion \n     of Health Care Reform.\n       As the Vermont legislature considers Health Care Reform, \n     we, a group of UVM medical students who are invested in the \n     future of Vermont, believe that current and future health \n     care legislation should work toward the following goals:\n       1. Ensure that every Vermonter has health care coverage \n     through a sustainable system that maintains a desirable \n     environment in which to practice medicine.\n       2. Replace the current fee for service system that both \n     limits access to physicians and compromises the quality of \n     care given to patients.\n       3. Empower Vermont to retain and attract high quality \n     physicians to ensure adequate health care for future \n     Vermonters.\n       Our proposals to help meet these goals are:\n       1. Initiate a program that reduces the tuition of out-or-\n     state students to in-state levels in exchange for commitment \n     to practice in Vermont after training is complete.\n       2. Improve funding for the existing loan repayment program \n     through Vermont AHEC to encourage primary care providers to \n     practice in under-served areas of the state.\n       3. Address the current inequity in the ``provider tax'' \n     such that out of state providers treating Vermont patients \n     contribute fairly to the Vermont Medicaid program.\n       4. Simplify the administrative burden upon the provider by \n     developing a system that has a single payer with best-\n     practice guidelines as opposed to the current fee-for-service \n     system.\n       By addressing these issues in upcoming legislation, we are \n     of the opinion that the quality of health care in Vermont \n     will improve. A sustainable system that addresses many of the \n     national problems with medicine will encourage a strong \n     physician population throughout the state, as well as secure \n     Vermont's future as the healthiest state in America.\n       As medical students who will inherit the reform currently \n     being debated in Montpelier, we are committed to help shape a \n     sustainable universal health care system. It is our great \n     hope that these changes will be enacted to enable us to \n     provide the best care possible to our future patients.\n       Larry Bodden, Calvin Kagan, Bud Vana, Ben Ware, John \n     Malcolm, JJ Galli, Vanessa Patten, Nick Koch, Uz Robison, \n     Pete Cooch, Rich Tan, Bianca Yoo, Prabu Selvam, Dave Reisman, \n     Adam Ackrman, Nazia Kabani, Stas Lazarev, Sara Staples, \n     Therese Ray, Kelly Cunningham, Hannah Foote, Laura Sturgill, \n     Megan Malgeri, Kati Anderson, Serena Chang, Caitlan Baran, \n     Leah Carr, Mariah Stump, Daniel Edberg, Franki Boulos, \n     Chelsea Harris, Vinnie Kan, Mairin Jerome, Jimmy Corbett-\n     Detig, Dan Liebowitz, Laura Caldwell, Damian Ray, Mei Lee \n     Frankish.\n       The University of Vermont does not endorse this \n     organization or their position in connection with this or any \n     other political campaign, policy position or election.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to discuss an amendment entitled \n``the Greater Accountability in the Treasury Small Business Lending \nFund Act of 2011.''\n  As ranking member of the Senate Small Business Committee, it is my \nresponsibility to ensure that small businesses have access to \naffordable credit. In this regard, I have worked on a bipartisan basis \nwith Senator Landrieu, chair of the Small Business Committee, to \ninclude provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that \nenhanced the SBA's 7(a) and 504 loan programs. Those measures resulted \nin a 90-percent national increase in SBA lending at a crucial time in \nour Nation's lending crisis. I also authored provisions, recently \nenacted into law, to increase the SBA's maximum loan limits for its \nmicroloan, 7(a), and 504 loans, to make the SBA more relevant to the \nneeds of today's borrowers. Additionally, I have been supportive of \nefforts to increase the arbitrarily imposed cap on member business \nlending at credit unions--at no cost to taxpayers--so that credit \nunions can play\n\n[[Page S1930]]\n\na greater role in helping to address the problems that small businesses \ncontinue to face in accessing credit.\n  But, unfortunately, I was unable to vote in favor of the Small \nBusiness Jobs Act of 2010, even though it included many of my \npriorities, due to my significant concerns with the Treasury Small \nBusiness Lending Fund--SBLF or lending fund--provisions included into \nthat bill. I opposed the inclusion of the lending fund for several \nreasons. While I will not reiterate all of those here, I will discuss a \nfew of them briefly.\n  First, the lending fund is essentially an extension of the Troubled \nAssets Relief Program, TARP, which was terminated by the Dodd-Frank \nWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This fact was confirmed \nby the bipartisan Congressional Oversight Panel for TARP in its May \nOversight Report.\n  Second, it is possible that instead of promoting quality loans, the \nlending fund could encourage unnecessarily risky behavior by banks. \nUnder the current law, the Treasury Department lends funds to banks at \na 5-percent interest rate, which can be reduced to as low as 1 percent \nif the institutions in turn increase their small business lending. If \nthe banks fail to increase their small business lending, the interest \nrate they pay could rise to a more punitive 7 percent. This could lead \nto an untenable situation where banks would make risky loans to avoid \npaying higher interest rates--a behavior known as ``moral hazard.''\n  Third, I still believe that the lending fund could put taxpayer \nresources at risk. The score for the Small Business Lending Fund is \nconvoluted. The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, score for the lending \nfund listed it as raising $1.1 billion over 10 years, based on a cash-\nbased estimate. However, the very same CBO score highlighted that if \nCBO were permitted to base its score on a fair-value estimate, which \naccounts for market risk, the score would be a $6.2 billion loss. In \nfact, the CBO score stated:\n\n       Estimates prepared on a ``fair-value'' basis include the \n     cost of the risk that the government has assumed; as a \n     result, they provide a more comprehensive measure of the cost \n     of the financial commitments than estimates done on a FCRA \n     [Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA)] basis or on a cash \n     basis. CBO estimates that the cost of the SBLF on such a \n     fair-value basis (that is, reflecting market risk) would be \n     $6.2 billion.\n\n  While I favor outright repeal of the Small Business Lending Fund, I \nknow that will be very difficult--and likely impossible, given that the \nmajority party in the Senate and the President strongly supported its \nenactment. And so I am focusing my efforts on making as many \nimprovements to the fund as possible, a responsibility that all of us \nin Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, should be able to \ncoalesce around.\n  We undoubtedly have a shared responsibility to ensure that taxpayer's \ndollars, in this case $30 billion for the Small Business Lending Fund, \nare used in a transparent, prudent, and responsible manner. If we \nfoster an environment in which banks are free to make risky loans to \navoid higher interest rates, if we permit banks to accept loans without \nany formal guarantee of repayment, we fail our responsibility to our \nconstituents and do a disservice to our Nation's 30 million small \nbusinesses.\n  The following is a description of some of the amendment's provisions. \nOne section would require that banks that receive Small Business \nLending Fund distributions, must--within 10 years--repay the money they \nreceive. While the current law directs that within 10 years of \nreceiving the funds, the banks should repay them to the Treasury \nDepartment, it also gives discretion to the Treasury Secretary to \nextend--even indefinitely--the period of time that banks have, to repay \nthe government. Again, this is a commonsense provision to ensure that \ntaxpayer's dollars do not go to waste.\n  Another provision would establish a sunset of 15 years for the Small \nBusiness Lending Fund. Under the current law, no such end date exists. \nThe Lending Fund must not be authorized to continue in perpetuity.\n  The amendment would also prohibit, moving forward, banks that have \nreceived TARP distributions from also obtaining small business lending \nfunds. Under the current law, banks that have received money through \nthe TARP program remain eligible to receive small business lending \nfunds as well, unless they default on TARP repayment. My provision is \nnot inferring that banks who received TARP funds are bad actors, or \nthat they are being penalized for participating in the program. Rather, \nit is a simple recognition that the Federal government should be \nlimiting the frequency with which it subsidizes private banks with \ntaxpayer funds at favorable interest rates. This crucial amendment will \nprohibit banks from ``double dipping'' into taxpayer funds.\n  Another provision would provide that the Small Business Lending Fund \ncease operations if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is \nappointed receiver of 5 percent or more of any eligible institutions. \nIt is essential that the lending fund is not a bailout and if there are \nstrong indications that this fund has serious systemic difficulties, it \nmust be halted until the problems within the program are corrected.\n  Another provision would provide that only healthy banks participate \nin the Small Business Lending Fund. This amendment prevents banks who \napply for the SBLF from counting expected SBLF funds as tier 1 capital \nin order to artificially strengthen their capital position in order to \nreceive government funds. This provision ensures that banks would have \nto stand on their own two feet, rather than being able to count the \nanticipated future receipts of taxpayer funds, when determining if the \nbanks are healthy enough to be provided those funds in the first place.\n  My amendment would also help ensure that regulators have more \nmeaningful controls over the Small Business Lending Fund. For there to \nbe meaningful controls over the SBLF, it is essential that all bank \nregulators, whether State or Federal, have a real voice in the lending \nfund's ability to lend to regulated banks. This amendment gives State \nbank regulators the ability to determine whether or not a bank which \nthey regulate should receive capital investment through the SBLF \nprogram. The current lending fund only gives State bank regulators an \nadvisory role over whether or not a bank they regulate will receive \nSBLF funds. As this fund is targeted towards community banks, most of \nthe banks applying for this program will be regulated at the State \nlevel. If we are really going to include State regulators and make this \nan inclusive regulator process, it is essential that State regulators \nhave the power to affect a bank's application.\n  And my amendment would also establish an appropriate benchmark for \nassessing changes in small business lending by recipients of capital \ninvestments under the Small Business Lending Fund. As it is currently \nwritten, the SBLF uses 2008 as a benchmark year to determine how much \nbanks will have to increase their lending to small firms. My concern is \nthat 2008 was a true low mark for small business lending. This \nbenchmark shortchanges small businesses. Using 2007, or some other \nmeasure, as a benchmark may increase the number of loans, banks \nparticipating in the SBLF program would have to make to small firms.\n  This legislation is not a silver bullet, and I recognize that we \nshould continue to vet these issues further. But it does attempt to \ndeal with many of the significant problems that I have with the lending \nfund. Regrettably, these are precisely the types of issues that could \nhave been resolved, had the lending fund received hearings and been \nproperly vetted in the Senate--as one would expect of any legislative \nproposal of this magnitude.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the section by section of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nThe Greater Accountability in the Treasury Small Business Lending Fund \n                             Act (``Act'')\n\n       *This Act revises the Department of Treasury (``Treasury'') \n     Small Business Lending Fund (``Lending Fund'') program \n     established in H.R. 5297, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 \n     (``Jobs Act'').\n\n     SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This legislation shall be referred to as ``the Greater \n     Accountability in the Lending Fund Act of 2011.''\n\n     SEC. 2. REPAYMENT REQUIREMENT.\n\n       This section requires that financial institutions that \n     receive Lending Fund distributions must--within 10 years--\n     repay the\n\n[[Page S1931]]\n\n     money that they receive. Under current law, the Secretary of \n     Treasury (``Secretary'') has the authority to postpone, \n     indefinitely, repayment.\n\n     SEC. 3. SUNSET ON THE LENDING FUND.\n\n       Under existing law, the Lending Fund is authorized to exist \n     forever. This section requires that the Lending Fund sunset \n     within 15 years of the date that the Lending Fund was \n     enacted.\n\n     SEC. 4. TRIGGER TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS.\n\n       This section prohibits the Secretary from making any new \n     purchases (i.e. prohibits the Secretary from providing \n     additional money, through the Lending Fund) if the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Corporation is appointed receiver of 5 \n     percent or more of the number of eligible financial \n     institutions that have obtained a capital investment under \n     the Lending Fund program.\n\n     SEC. 5. DISALLOWING FUTURE LENDING FUND PURCHASES OF \n                   FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE \n                   TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM (``TARP'').\n\n       This section prohibits--as of the date of this Act being \n     enacted--the Secretary from making additional purchases, \n     through the Lending Fund, of a financial institution (i.e. \n     providing money to a bank) that participated in the TARP \n     program. This section would end the double-dipping practice \n     of financial institutions that have previously received \n     taxpayer funds, at low (subsidized) interest rates, through \n     TARP, doing so again, through the Lending Fund.\n\n     SEC. 6. ALLOWING ONLY ``HEALTHY'' FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO \n                   PARTICIPATE IN THE LENDING FUND.\n\n       Under current law, when determining whether a bank is \n     financially sound, for the purpose of receiving Lending Fund \n     dollars, the Secretary can take into consideration what the \n     bank's strength would be after receiving the funds. This \n     section changes the law to require that the Secretary \n     determine whether a bank is financially stable, without being \n     able to include future Lending Fund distributions into the \n     equation. Therefore, a bank must be stable on its own, \n     (without regard to future Lending Fund dollars), in order to \n     be approved to participate in the program.\n\n     SEC. 7. ENSURING THAT REGULATORS HAVE MORE MEANINGFUL \n                   CONTROLS OVER THE LENDING FUND.\n\n       This section requires that the Secretary must obtain \n     prudential regulators' approval--rather than consultation--\n     before an individual applicant financial institution can \n     receive distributions through the Lending Fund program.\n\n     SEC. 8. BENCHMARK ADJUSTMENT.\n\n       This section changes the benchmark by which a financial \n     institution's small business lending has increased from the \n     current level (the 4 full quarters immediately preceding the \n     date of the Jobs Act being enacted) to a new benchmark of \n     calendar year 2007. This section addresses concerns that the \n     Lending Fund may reward banks that would have increased their \n     lending even in the absence of government support, as the \n     Fund's incentive structure is calculated in reference to \n     lending levels, which were low by historical standards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1931-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1931-S1932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL INSTANT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the intent of the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System, NICS, Improvement Act of 2007 is to \nincrease compliance with existing law in order to prevent guns from \ngetting into the hands of those with mental health concerns who might \ncause harm to others.\n  Unfortunately, the initial draft of this legislation would have \nexpanded the existing classes of people forbidden by statute from \npossessing or purchasing a weapon to include people who simply had \ntrouble managing their finances or other personal affairs. This \nexpansion of existing law would have legitimized overly broad \nregulations that included people who have never been found to be a \ndanger to themselves or to others.\n  This is problematic because these overly broad regulations have \nallowed for the criminalization of veterans who needed help managing \nthe benefits they received for serving our country. These veterans lost \ntheir constitutional right to bear arms without committing a crime, \nwithout going before a court of law, and without being found to be a \npossible danger to themselves or anyone else. Furthermore, they lost \ntheir rights without their knowledge, and without a way to restore \nthem.\n  For this reason I did not consent to H.R. 2640 until these concerns \nwere adequately addressed.\n  Nobody wants firearms in the hands of individuals who are a danger to \nthemselves or to others, but this desire for safety must be adequately \nbalanced with a respect for our Constitution and the right to bear \narms. While I favor keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and \nthose who are a danger to themselves or to others, I was concerned that \nthis bill would unnecessarily and unfairly hurt our veterans and other \nlaw-abiding Americans.\n  The initial version of this bill codified overly broad regulations \nfor what it means to be ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' to \ninclude individuals who are in no danger to themselves or to others, \nbut cannot manage their own finances or other personal affairs. These \nregulations were determined independent of congressional intent and are \noverly inclusive.\n  As a result of this definition, Americans who have never committed a \ncrime and are of no danger to themselves or to others have been \nunfairly included in NICS. Once added to this list, it has been nearly \nimpossible for an individual to remove their name from this list, \nmeaning they are prohibited from owning a firearm for the rest of their \nlife.\n  Among those unfairly added are up to 140,000 veterans who receive \nbenefits for their service to our country, because they cannot manage \ntheir own affairs. This bill would have made this overly inclusive \ndefinition law.\n  Fortunately, Senator Schumer and I were able to work together to \nerase all mention of this definition in the bill. The term \n``adjudicated as a mental defective'' is not defined in law. By not \ncodifying these overly inclusive regulations, Congress and the Bureau \nof Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Enforcement have a another chance to \ndevelop regulations for what ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' \nmeans to more accurately protect the second amendment rights of law-\nabiding citizens.\n  Additionally, we made several other changes to improve this bill. The \nbill now ensures: Veterans are notified when they are added to this \nlist to ensure they do not knowingly violate Federal law and also lets \nthem know when they enter into a determination process that could lead \nto them being added to this list; those who believe they have been \nunfairly added to NICS have their applications for removal from this \nlist processed; those who previously were adjudicated as a mental \ndefective but no longer pose a threat to society are cleared from this \nlist; a State program exists that allows those wrongfully included on \nthis list to appeal their inclusion; and that compensation is available \nfor those who prove they were wrongfully included on NICS in court.\n  These changes strike a much healthier balance between ensuring the \nsecond amendment rights of our veterans and other law-abiding citizens \nand removing guns from those who are a threat to our society.\n  It is also important for Americans to realize that this bill, if \nenacted earlier, would not have prevented the tragic Virginia Tech \nshootings. This bill does not change Federal law regarding who should \nbe added to NICS. States still have to decide to what extent they will \nreport those adjudicated as a mental defective to the national list.\n  Under existing law, the Virginia Tech gunman already was considered a \nmentally dangerous person and should not have been allowed to purchase \na weapon. At the time of the shootings, he was prohibited from \npurchasing any guns because two different judges found him to be a \ndanger to himself or others. Additionally, the gunman should have been \nbarred from buying a gun because he had been involuntarily committed \nfor mental treatment.\n  He should have been reported to NICS because of a law passed last \ndecade that required States to report people like him to the Federal \nsystem so that they would be prohibited from purchasing weapons. \nUnfortunately, because of a communications breakdown among Virginia \nauthorities, this did not occur.\n  Since the Virginia Tech tragedy, several States have begun submitting \nthese records to NICS and added hundreds of thousands of persons to the \ndatabase without any additional Federal law being passed. According to \nthe Washington Post, nearly 220,000 names have been added to this FBI \nlist of people prohibited from buying guns because of mental health \nproblems--a more than double increase in only 7 months.\n  While the intent of this legislation is good, Congress owes it to all \nAmericans to pass legislation that is necessary and does not have \nunintended\n\n[[Page S1932]]\n\nconsequences that compromise the rights of law abiding citizens.\n  I am thankful for the opportunity for my concerns to be addressed and \nbelieve this bill is much improved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1932-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      REMEMBERING DR. ALFRED KAHN\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate's Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, I \npay tribute to a giant of antitrust law and economics, the economist \nand legal scholar Alfred E. Kahn, who passed away on December 27, 2010, \nat the age of 93.\n  A scholar at the forefront of public utility deregulation, Dr. Kahn \nwas perhaps best known as the ``father of airline deregulation.'' His \nwork in the Carter administration in the 1970s to deregulate the \nairline industry led the way for dramatic reductions in airline fares, \nsaving consumers billions, when he spearheaded passage of the U.S. \nAirline Deregulation Act of 1978 as chair of the now-defunct Civil \nAeronautics Board. While a highlight of his career, this was just one \nof many of Dr. Kahn's achievements--throughout his life he was an \noutstanding advocate for consumers, against monopoly and unnecessary \ngovernment interference in the private market, and for the creative and \nvigorous enforcement of antitrust law.\n  Born on October 17, 1917, in Paterson, NJ, the son of Russian \nimmigrants, Alfred Edward Kahn graduated from New York University, \nfirst in his class, at the age of 18 and received a Ph.D. from Yale \nUniversity. In the early 1940s, Dr. Kahn worked at the Brookings \nInstitution, in the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, \nand for the War Production Board as an economist.\n  During World War II, Dr. Kahn served as an Army economist for the \nCommission on Palestine Surveys. Soon after the war, he spent 2 years \nas a professor at Ripon College in Wisconsin, before beginning his \nesteemed career at Cornell University, which, other than the time he \nspent in public service, would last until his death.\n  Before stepping onto the national political scene, Dr. Kahn served as \nhead of the New York State Public Service Commission, the State's \nregulator for electricity, gas, water, and telephones. From there, \nseeking to use deregulation as a means to stimulate economic growth, \nPresident Carter tapped Dr. Kahn to serve as chairman of the now-\ndefunct Civil Aeronautics Board in 1977. The CAB was entrusted with \neconomic regulation of the airlines--including the routes carriers \ncould fly and the fares they could charge.\n  At the time of his appointment, Dr. Kahn professed to know little \nabout the airline business, referring to airplanes as ``marginal costs \nwith wings.'' However, he was a quick study, and the industry was ripe \nfor change. Substantial investments had recently been made in wide-body \naircraft, and industry players wanted access to new routes and new \npassengers. Though slight in physical stature and viewed purely as an \nacademic and not someone who could wield much influence, Dr. Kahn was \nable to take on the industry and persuade the establishment that \nexcessive government regulation had long-harbored inefficiency and was \nfacilitating artificially inflated fares.\n  Through various avenues, including the press, CAB proceedings, and \ntestimony in Congress, Dr. Kahn was the intellectual leader and primary \nadvocate of deregulating the airline industry, highlighting that many \nplanes were flying half full at fares many could not afford. Less than \n2 years after assuming his post at the CAB, Congress passed and \nPresident Carter signed into law the Airline Deregulation Act. This \nlandmark legislation was the first complete dismantling of a Federal \nregulatory scheme since the 1930s. In all, Dr. Kahn testified before \nU.S. House and Senate committees more than 70 times in his career. He \ntestified before our Antitrust Subcommittee several times, always \neloquently and honestly, with impressive candor and penetrating \ninsight.\n  In later years, Dr. Kahn steadfastly defended his work on airline \nderegulation by pointing out that more Americans were flying with \ngreater choice at lower rates than ever before. In a 1998 essay in the \nNew York Times, Dr. Kahn admitted that even though the ``resulting \ncompetitive regime has been far from perfect, it has saved travelers \nmore than $10 billion a year.'' For Dr. Kahn, the deregulation of the \nairline industry had one powerful effect: empowering the consumer \nthrough competition. This was perhaps the signal achievement of his \noutstanding career. Throughout his life, he stood for consumers against \nentrenched monopolies, for innovation against the established economic \norder, and for unleashing the dynamism and creativity of an unfettered \nfree market and excessive and heavyhanded regulation.\n  Not only a brilliant economist and legal scholar, Dr. Kahn will be \nremembered for his sharp wit and humor. Dr. Kahn famously created a \nbuzz with his initiative to eliminate government ``bureaucratese'' when \nthe Washington Post published a copy of his memo calling for his staff \nto use ``plain English'' and ``quasi-conversational, humane prose'' in \ntheir writing. Following his time in Washington, Dr. Kahn returned to \nchair the economics department at Cornell, where he would author more \nthan 130 academic papers and 8 books.\n  Upon his passing, I want to express my gratitude to Dr. Alfred Kahn \nfor his contributions to the antitrust and regulatory economics fields \nand for his service to the American people and offer my deepest \ncondolences to his wife and family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1932-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PLUM LAKE, WISCONSIN\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Senator Johnson and I congratulate \nthe residents of the town of Plum Lake in Vilas County, WI, as they \ncelebrate the 100th anniversary of their town's founding. Plum Lake \ncomprises the communities of Sayner and Star Lake, both of which have \nlong traditions as vacation destinations because of the friendly people \nand the magnificence of the lakes and forests, as well as the abundance \nof fish and game. Folks looking to escape the day to day grind can \nretire to this beautiful area year round to hunt, fish, water and snow \nski, and hike along nature trails. Visitors are often surprised to \ndiscover that the town's slogan, ``Birthplace of the snowmobile,'' \nreflects its invention there by Carl Eliason in 1924.\n  The town of Plum Lake was officially formed by an ordinance passed by \nthe Vilas County Board on January 5, 1911. The ordinance went into \neffect April 1, 1911, creating the new town from territory detached \nfrom the town of Arbor Vitae. The first town meeting was held in Sayner \non April 14, 1911.\n  In the 19th century, Plum Lake was the center of a vibrant lumber \nindustry, which eventually gave way to tourism. Two years before the \nfounding of the town, in the summer of 1909, Herb Warner and others \nbegan construction on one of Wisconsin's oldest golf courses, the Plum \nLake Golf Club, which opened in 1912. Plum Lake also boasts one of \nWisconsin's oldest summer camps, Camp Highlands, which began when Harry \nO. Gilette, a University of Chicago Laboratory School headmaster, \nbrought 10 boys to a remote point on Plum Lake for a summer in the \nwilderness in 1904.\n  Today, Plum Lake maintains both its majestic views and its place as a \nprime vacation destination. We are very proud to represent this \ncommunity and we congratulate the town of Plum Lake on this historic \nmilestone. We join with all Wisconsinites in expressing our pride in \nthe treasures of our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1932-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:24 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1079.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 659. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprotect Medicare beneficiaries' access to home health services under \nthe Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nfrom Washington in introducing legislation, the Home Health Care Access \nProtection Act of 2011, to prevent future unfair administrative cuts in \nMedicare home health payment rates.\n  Home health has become an increasingly important part of our health \ncare system. The kinds of highly skilled and often technically complex \nservices that our Nation's home health agencies provide have helped to \nkeep families together and enabled millions of our most frail and \nvulnerable older and disabled persons to avoid hospitals and nursing \nhomes and stay just where they want to be--in the comfort and security \nof their own homes. Moreover, by helping these individuals to avoid \nmore costly institutional care, they are saving Medicare billions of \ndollars each year.\n  That is why I find it so ironic--and troubling--that the Medicare \nhome health benefit continually comes under attack.\n  The health care reform bill signed into law by the President last \nyear includes $40 billion in cuts to home care over 10 years. Moreover, \nthese cuts are a ``double-whammy'' because they come on top of $25 \nbillion in additional cuts to home health imposed by the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services through regulation in the last several \nyears.\n  These cuts are particularly disproportionate for a program that costs \nMedicare less than $20 billion a year. This simply is not right, and it \ncertainly is not in the best interest of our nation's seniors who rely \non home care to keep them out of hospitals, nursing homes, and other \ninstitutions.\n  The payment rate cuts implemented and proposed by CMS are based on \nthe assertion that home health agencies have intentionally ``gamed the \nsystem'' by claiming that their patients have conditions of higher \nclinical severity than they actually have in order to receive higher \nMedicare payments. This unfounded allegation of ``case mix creep'' is \nbased on what CMS contends to be an increase in the average clinical \nassessment ``score'' of home health patients over the last few years.\n  In fact, there are very real clinical and policy explanations for why \nthe average clinical severity of home care patients' health conditions \nmay have increased over the years. For example, the incentives built \ninto the hospital diagnosis-related group--or DRG--reimbursement system \nhave led to the faster discharge of sicker patients. Advances in \ntechnology and changes in medical practice have also enabled home \nhealth agencies to treat more complicated medical conditions that \npreviously could only be treated in hospitals, nursing homes, or \ninpatient rehabilitation facilities.\n  Moreover, this unfair payment rate cut is being assessed across the \nboard, even for home health agencies that showed a decrease in their \nclinical assessment scores. If an individual home\n\n[[Page S1935]]\n\nhealth agency is truly gaming the system, CMS should target that one \nagency, not penalize everyone.\n  The research method, data and findings that CMS has used to justify \nthe administrative cuts also raise serious concerns about the validity \nof the payment rate cuts. For example, while changes in the need for \ntherapy services significantly affect the case mix ``score,'' the CMS \nresearch methodology disregards those changes in evaluating whether the \npatient population has changed. Moreover, the method by which CMS \nevaluates changes in case mix coding is not transparent, does not allow \nfor true public participation, and is not performed in a manner that \nensures accountability to Medicare patients and providers in terms of \nits validity and accuracy of outcomes.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will establish a reliable \nand transparent process for determining whether payment rate cuts are \nneeded to account for improper changes in ``case mix scoring'' that are \nnot related to changes in the nature of the patients served in home \nhealth care or the nature of the care they received. This process will \nstill enable the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enact rate \nadjustments provided there is reliable evidence that higher case mix \nscores are resulting from factors other than changes in patient \nconditions. The legislation will also prevent the implementation of \nfuture Medicare payment rate cuts in home health until the Secretary is \nable to justify the payment cuts through the improved process set forth \nin the bill.\n  Home health care has consistently proven to be a compassionate and \ncost-effective alternative to institutional care. Additional deep cuts \nwill be completely counterproductive to our efforts to control overall \nhealth care costs. The Home Health Care Access Protection Act of 2011 \nwill help to ensure that our seniors and disabled Americans continue to \nhave access to the quality home health services they deserve, and I \nencourage all of my colleagues to sign on as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Coburn, \n        Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 660.

A bill to promote industry growth and competitiveness and to \nimprove worker training, retention, and advancement, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Selecting \nEmployment Clusters to Organize Regional Success, SECTORS, Act, which \nSenator Sherrod Brown and I are introducing. This legislation would \namend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to establish an industry or \nsector partnership grant program administered by the Department of \nLabor.\n  The SECTORS Act provides grants to industry clusters--interrelated \ngroup of businesses, service providers, and associated institutions--in \norder to establish and expand sector partnerships. By providing \nfinancial assistance to these partnerships, this legislation would \ncreate customized workforce training solutions for specific industries \nat a regional level. A sector approach is beneficial because it can \nfocus on the dual goals of promoting the long-term competitiveness of \nindustries and advancing employment opportunities for workers, thereby \nencouraging economic growth. Existing sector partnerships have long \nbeen recognized as key strategic elements within some of the most \nsuccessful economic development initiatives throughout the country. \nUnfortunately, current federal policy does not provide sufficient \nsupport for these critical ventures.\n  As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Senate Task Force on Manufacturing, one \nof my key goals is to ensure that manufacturers have access to a \ncapable workforce. Unfortunately, manufacturers across the country have \nraised significant concerns about whether the next generation of \nworkers is being trained to meet the needs of an increasingly high-tech \nworkplace.\n  In fact, in my home State of Maine, the manufacturing sector has shed \nan alarming 26,200 jobs in the past ten years, or 1/3 of the State's \nmanufacturing employment. And since the beginning of 1990, our state \nhas lost 43,000 jobs. It is therefore critical that we as a Nation \nprovide unemployed manufacturing workers the training needed to excel \nas our manufacturing sector becomes increasingly technical. This \nlegislation provides a crucial link between establishing worker \ntraining programs and fostering new employment opportunities for those \nwho have been affected by the manufacturing industry's decline. By \npromoting this innovative partnership, we will take a crucial step \ntoward rejuvenating our economy.\n  Throughout the country, sector partnerships are being used to promote \nthe long-term competitiveness of industries and to advance employment \nopportunities. For example, the State of Maine has created the North \nStar Alliance Initiative. The Alliance has brought together Maine's \nboat builders, the University of Maine's Advanced Engineered Wood \nComposites Centers, Maine's marine and composite trade association, \neconomic development groups, and investment organizations for the \npurpose of advancing workforce training.\n  Our Nation's capacity to innovate is a key reason why our economy, \ndespite difficult times, remains the envy of the world. Ideas by \ninnovative Americans across the spectrums of professions and industries \nhave paid enormous dividends, improving the lives of millions \nthroughout the world. We must continue to encourage all avenues for \nadvancing our nation's economic well-being if America is to compete at \nthe vanguard of innovation.

A bill to authorize the United States Marshals Service to \nissue administrative subpoenas in investigations relating to \nunregistered sex offenders; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce \nand speak in favor of the Finding Fugitive Sex Offenders Act of 2011, \nwhich would give administrative subpoena authority to the Director of \nthe U.S. Marshals Service for the investigation of sex offenders who \nhave failed to register as required by the Sex Offender Registration \nand Notification Act. The language of the bill is the product of \nbipartisan negotiations during the last Congress, which was included in \na broader child crimes bill last year that passed both the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate, but did not become law.\n  To understand the need for this bill, it is important to understand \nthe history of recent child crimes legislation in Congress. When the \nAdam Walsh Act, which I cosponsored, was enacted in July 2006 to create \na more uniform and enforceable sex offender registry system, over \n150,000 convicted sex offenders were believed to be unregistered and \nmissing from the various state sex offender registries. A key component \nof the Walsh Act, one requested by John Walsh himself, was to give the \nU.S. Marshals Service primary enforcement authority to locate and \narrest unregistered sex offenders who had crossed state lines or had \nearlier been convicted under federal law. The Walsh Act, however, did \nnot provide the Marshals Service with administrative subpoena authority \nto perform these investigations, which can span jurisdictions and move \nquickly. The Finding Fugitive Sex Offenders Act will fix this gap in \nthe law and grant the Marshals Service this long-needed authority.\n  It is very surprising that this authority does not already exist in \nlight of the hundreds of administrative subpoena authorities that are \nin place for various federal agencies, including the EPA, the DEA, the \nFBI, the CFTC, and even the Appalachian Regional Commission. In March \n2006, the Congressional Research Service reported that ``[t]here are \nnow over 300 instances where federal agencies have been granted \nadministrative subpoena power in one form or another.'' In reality, \nthat number is even higher. According to the Department of Justice's \n2002 Report to Congress on the Use of Administrative Subpoena \nAuthorities by Executive Branch Agencies and Entities, the Office of \nLegal Policy ``identified approximately 335 existing administrative \nsubpoena authorities held by various executive branch entities under \ncurrent law.'' Most of these authorities are for civil enforcement or \nregulatory compliance--matters far less critical and time-sensitive \nthan locating a fugitive sex offender who has intentionally evaded \nregistering his location or place of employment to avoid detection by \nlaw enforcement.\n  There is no reason why the Marshals Service should not have this type \nof authority. In these fast-moving investigations across state lines, \nlaw enforcement simply cannot afford delays, especially on weekends and \nholidays when U.S. Attorney's Offices are closed and grand jury \nsubpoenas are unavailable. Assistant Attorney General Rachel Brand \nexplained the delays and limitations of traditional grand jury \nsubpoenas in fast-moving investigations when she testified before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee on another administrative subpoena proposal \nin June 2004:\n\n       Although grand jury subpoenas are a sufficient tool in many \n     investigations, there are circumstances in which an \n     administrative subpoena would save precious minutes or hours. \n     . . . For example, the ability to use an administrative \n     subpoena will eliminate delays caused by factors such as the \n     unavailability of an Assistant United States Attorney to \n     immediately issue a grand jury subpoena, especially in rural \n     areas; the time it takes to contact an Assistant United \n     States Attorney in the context of a time-sensitive \n     investigation; the lack of a grand jury sitting at the moment \n     the documents are needed (under federal law, the `return \n     date' for a grand jury subpoena must be on a day the grand \n     jury is sitting); or the absence of an empaneled grand jury \n     in the judicial district where the investigation is taking \n     place, a rare circumstance that would prevent a grand jury \n     subpoena from being issued at all.\n\n  The reality is that sex offenders often fail to register precisely so \nthey can evade detection and move to a new place where they won't face \nscrutiny. During the hearings and floor debates on the Adam Walsh Act, \nthe Senate heard of the heart-breaking tragedies caused when sex \noffenders knowingly evaded registration so they could disappear from \ndetection. Senators from Washington and Idaho went to the floor to \ndescribe the registry failures and disappearance of Joseph Duncan, who \nshortly after his release from custody in 2005, absconded from \nMinnesota\n\n[[Page S1937]]\n\nand traveled across the country to Idaho, where he kidnapped Dylan and \nShasta Groene from their home in the middle of the night. In the course \nof the kidnapping, he murdered the children's mother, brother, and the \nmother's boyfriend by beating them to death with a framing hammer. He \nthen took the children to remote campgrounds across the state line into \nMontana, where he brutally abused them and later killed Dylan. As one \nSenator explained during the debate: ``Joseph Duncan was essentially \nlost by three States. He moved from State to State to avoid capture. No \none knew where he was nor even how to look for him.''\n\n  A similar tragic story involved the convicted sex offender who killed \nFlorida 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford. John Couey had failed to tell \nauthorities that he was living in a trailer just feet from Jessica's \nhome. In 2005, he kidnapped Jessica from her bedroom and took her to \nhis home where he raped and killed her. Ernie Allen, the President of \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, cited Couey in \nhis congressional testimony in support of the Walsh Act, explaining \nthat he ``was not where he was supposed to be and [his] presence was \nunknown to the police or Jessica's family even though he lived 150 \nyards down the street from her and had worked construction at her \nelementary school.''\n  As the Lunsford and Groene cases demonstrate, some sex offenders \nevade the registry requirements because they want to offend again. In \nthese cases, time is law enforcement's enemy. According to the \nDepartment of Justice's guide for families with missing children, ``the \nactions of parents and of law enforcement in the first 48 hours are \ncritical to the safe recovery of a missing child.'' The Lunsford case \nillustrates how vital it is for law enforcement to quickly locate sex \noffenders during a missing child investigation. John Couey reportedly \ntold law enforcement that he kept young Jessica alive for three days \nbefore he smothered her inside a plastic trash bag. In a case like \nJessica's, this type of authority literally could mean the difference \nbetween life and death.\n  This legislation has broad support. When I drafted this language last \nCongress, I shared it with the Marshals Service and lawyers who work in \nthe field of protecting children from exploitation. These professionals \nwere not only supportive, but also very clear about the need for this \nsubpoena authority.\n  I strongly support this legislation and am thankful to the broad \nbipartisan group, including Senators Blumenthal, Hatch, Klobuchar, \nGrassley, Whitehouse, Cornyn, Kyl, Graham, Lee, Collins, Thune, Coburn, \nBurr and Chambliss, who have agreed to cosponsor this legislation. I \nhope the full Senate will take up and pass this legislation soon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 671\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nand modify the railroad track maintenance credit; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nextend the Section 45G short line freight railroad tax credit.\n  Section 45G creates an incentive for short lines to invest in track \nrehabilitation by providing a tax credit of 50 cents for every dollar \nspent on track improvements. If this credit is allowed to expire at the \nend of the year, private-sector investments in infrastructure in our \ncommunities will fall by hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  ``Short line'' railroads are small freight rail companies responsible \nfor bringing goods to communities that are not directly served by large \nrailroads. Supporting small railroads allows the communities \nsurrounding them to attract and maintain businesses and create jobs. \nThe evidence of the success of this credit can be found in communities \nacross America.\n  This credit has a real impact for the people of my state. West \nVirginia is the second biggest producer of railroad ties in the \ncountry. Since the credit first was enacted, approximately 750,000 \nrailroad ties have been purchased above what would have otherwise been \npurchased with no incentive. Those railroad ties translate directly \ninto jobs. This credit does not create just West Virginia jobs, it \nbenefits manufacturers of ties, spikes, and rail all across America.\n  Over 12,000 rail customers across America depend on short lines. This \ncredit creates a strong incentive for short lines to invest private \nsector dollars on private-sector freight railroad track rehabilitation \nand improvements. Shippers rely on the high quality service these \nrailroads provide to get their goods to market. Unfortunately, this \ncredit is scheduled to expire at the end of 2011.\n  This bill would extend the 45G credit through 2017 and provide the \nimportant long-term planning certainty necessary to maximize private-\nsector transportation infrastructure investment. 54 Members of this \nbody sponsored legislation that extended this credit last Congress and \nI hope there will be similar support again this year.\n  I thank the Chair and ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation that will benefit small businesses throughout the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/29/senate-section/article/S1937-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1937-S1938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 111--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT CONGRESS \n   SHOULD REJECT ANY PROPOSAL FOR THE CREATION OF A SYSTEM OF GLOBAL \n                        TAXATION AND REGULATION\n\n  Mr. VITTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S.

Res. 114\n\n       Whereas Congresswoman Geraldine A. Ferraro served the \n     people of the Ninth Congressional District of New York for 6 \n     years;\n       Whereas Congresswoman Ferraro worked her way through law \n     school at Fordham University, at a time when very few women \n     did so;\n       Whereas Congresswoman Ferraro then joined the Queens County \n     District Attorney's Office, where she supervised the \n     prosecution of a variety of violent crimes, including child \n     and domestic abuse;\n       Whereas in 1978, New York's Ninth Congressional District in \n     Queens elected Congresswoman Ferraro to the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, where she was one of only 16 women members \n     of the House;\n       Whereas when she was nominated as the running mate of Vice \n     President Walter F. Mondale in the 1984 presidential race, \n     Congresswoman Ferraro became the first woman ever chosen to \n     run on the national ticket of either of the 2 major political \n     parties of the United States;\n       Whereas Congresswoman Ferraro's candidacy continues the \n     progress begun by women who achieved political firsts before \n     her and helped to tear down barriers to the full and equal \n     participation of women in national politics;\n       Whereas in January 1993, President Clinton appointed Ms. \n     Ferraro a United States Ambassador to the United Nations \n     Commission on Human Rights, a role from which she championed \n     the rights of women around the world; and\n       Whereas Geraldine Ferraro's 1984 bid for Vice President \n     helped our daughters join our sons in believing they could \n     achieve anything they set their minds to: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate recognizes that Geraldine A.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in response to the proposed debit interchange rule of \n     the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System mandated \n     by section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n     Consumer Protection Act, the Chairman of Board, the \n     Comptroller of the Currency, the Chairperson of the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Chairman of the \n     National Credit Union Administration Board have publicly \n     raised concerns about the impact of the proposed rule;\n       (2) while testifying before the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate on February 17, \n     2011, the Chairman of the Board stated in response to \n     questions about the small bank exemption to the interchange \n     rule, ``. . .there is some risk that the exemption will not \n     be effective and that the interchange fees available through \n     smaller institutions will be reduced to the same extent we \n     would see for larger banks'';\n       (3) the Acting Comptroller of the Currency, in comments to \n     the Board, cited safety and soundness concerns and stated, \n     ``. . .we believe the proposal takes an unnecessarily\n\n[[Page S1942]]\n\n     narrow approach to recovery of costs that would be allowable \n     under the law and that are recognized and indisputably part \n     of conducting a debit card business. This has long-term \n     safety and soundness consequences - for banks of all sizes. . \n     .'';\n       (4) the chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation stated in comments to the Board regarding the \n     proposed rule their concern that the small bank exemption \n     would not work, stating, ``. . .we are concerned that these \n     institutions may not actually receive the benefit of the \n     interchange fee limit exemption explicitly provided by \n     Congress, resulting in a loss of income for community banks \n     and ultimately higher banking costs for their customers'';\n       (5) the chairman of the National Credit Union \n     Administration Board, in comments to the Board, cited concern \n     with making sure there are ``meaningful exemptions for \n     smaller card issuers''; and\n       (6) all of the comments and concerns raised by the banking \n     and credit union regulatory agencies cast serious questions \n     about the practical implementation of section 1075 of the \n     Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, \n     and further study and consideration are needed.\n\n     SEC. 603. RULEMAKING AND EFFECTIVE DATES.\n\n       (a) Extension for Rulemaking Timelines and Revised \n     Effective Date.--Section 920 of the Electronic Fund Transfer \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 1693o-2) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(3)(A), by striking ``9 months after \n     the date of enactment of the Consumer Financial Protection \n     Act of 2010'' and inserting ``24 months after the date of \n     enactment of the Debit Interchange Fee Study Act of 2011'';\n       (2) in subsection (a)(5)(B)(i), by striking ``9 months \n     after the date of enactment of the Consumer Financial \n     Protection Act of 2010'' and inserting ``24 months after the \n     date of enactment of the Debit Interchange Fee Study Act of \n     2011'';\n       (3) in subsection (a)(8)(C), by striking ``9-month period \n     beginning on the date of the enactment of the Consumer \n     Financial Protection Act of 2010'' and inserting ``24-month \n     period beginning on the date of enactment of the Debit \n     Interchange Fee Study Act of 2011'';\n       (4) in subsection (a)(9), by striking ``12-month period \n     beginning on the date of the enactment of the Consumer \n     Financial Protection Act of 2010'' and inserting ``30-month \n     period beginning on the date of enactment of the Debit \n     Interchange Fee Study Act of 2011'';\n       (5) in subsection (b)(1)(A), by striking ``1-year period \n     beginning on the date of the enactment of the Consumer \n     Financial Protection Act of 2010'' and inserting ``24-month \n     period beginning on the date of enactment of the Debit \n     Interchange Fee Study Act of 2011''; and\n       (6) in subsection (b)(1)(B), by striking ``1-year period \n     beginning on the date of the enactment of the Consumer \n     Financial Protection Act of 2010'' and inserting ``24-month \n     period beginning on the date of enactment of the Debit \n     Interchange Fee Study Act of 2011''.\n       (b) Earlier Rulemaking Voided; New Rulemaking Required.--\n     Any regulation proposed or prescribed by the Board pursuant \n     to section 920 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (as \n     amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \n     Protection Act) prior to the date that is 6 months after the \n     date of completion of the study required under section 604 \n     shall be withdrawn by the Board and shall have no legal \n     effect.\n\n     SEC. 604. STUDY.\n\n       (a) Study Required.--Not later than 12 months after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the study agencies shall \n     jointly submit a report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \n     and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on \n     Financial Services of the House of Representatives regarding \n     the impact of regulating debit interchange transaction fees \n     and related issues under section 920 of the Electronic Fund \n     Transfer Act.\n       (b) Subjects for Review.--In conducting the study required \n     by this section, the study agencies shall examine the state \n     of the debit interchange payment system, including the impact \n     of section 920 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act on \n     consumers, entities that accept debit cards as payment, all \n     financial institutions that issue debit cards, including \n     small issuers, and debit card networks, and shall \n     specifically examine--\n       (1) the costs and benefits of electronic debit card \n     transactions and alternative forms of payment, including \n     cash, check, and automated clearing house (ACH) for \n     consumers, merchants, issuers, and debit card networks, \n     including--\n       (A) individual consumer protections, ease of acceptance, \n     payment guarantee, and security provided through such forms \n     of payments for consumers;\n       (B) costs and benefits associated with acceptance, \n     handling, and processing of different forms of payments, \n     including labor, security, verification, and collection where \n     applicable;\n       (C) the extent to which payment form impacts incremental \n     sales and ticket sizes for merchants;\n       (D) all direct and indirect costs associated with fraud \n     prevention, detection, and mitigation, including data breach \n     and identity theft, and the overall costs of fraud incurred \n     by debit card issuers and merchants, and how those costs are \n     distributed among those parties; and\n       (E) financial liability and payment guarantee for debit \n     card transactions and associated risks and costs incurred by \n     debit card issuers and merchants, and how those costs are \n     distributed among those parties;\n       (2) the structure of the current debit interchange system, \n     including--\n       (A) the extent to which the current structure offers \n     merchants and issuers, particularly smaller merchants and \n     issuers sufficient competitive opportunities to participate \n     and negotiate in the debit interchange system;\n       (B) an examination of the benefits of allowing interchange \n     fees to be determined in bilateral negotiations between \n     merchants and issuers, including small issuers directly;\n       (C) mechanisms for allowing more price discovery and \n     transparency on the part of the consumer; and\n       (D) the ability of new competitors to enter the payment \n     systems market and an examination into whether structural \n     barriers to entry exist; and\n       (3) the impact of the proposed rule reducing debit card \n     interchange fees issued by the Board entitled, ``Debit Card \n     Interchange Fees and Routing'' (75 Fed.

Res. 114\n\n       Whereas Congresswoman Geraldine A.
