Madam President, later today, as I noted yesterday, \nthe Senate will have a rare opportunity. For those who have supported \nthe health care spending bill in the past, it is an opportunity to \nrevisit your first vote, to listen to those who have desperately been \ntrying to get your attention, to say, yes, maybe my vote for this bill \nwas a mistake, maybe we can do better, to listen to the small business \nowners who have been contacting our offices every single day and \ntelling us all the ways this bill keeps them from creating the jobs we \nneed, to show you have actually noticed most Americans don't want this \nbill, to show you are aware more people want it repealed than do not, \nto show you have noticed the townhalls in your States, to show you have \nnoticed the opposition to this bill continues to grow, to show you have \nnoticed the Federal court rulings that show this bill is \nunconstitutional at its core.\n  It is not every day you get a second chance on a big decision after \nyou know all the facts. This is that second chance.\n  For all of us who opposed the health care bill, today we reaffirm our \ncommitment to work a little harder to get it right; we can't afford to \nget it wrong. But let's not anyone hide behind the preposterous talking \npoint that repealing this bill would add to the deficit. Only in \nWashington would somebody claim that spending trillions of dollars on a \nbrand new government entitlement and a massive bureaucracy to go along \nwith it will save money.\n  I urge all my colleagues to move beyond party affiliation, to look at \nthe facts alone. If everyone in this Chamber did that, we would repeal \nthis bill right now, and then we would begin the work of achieving our \ncommon goal of delivering health care at a higher quality for lower \ncost. We would put in place the commonsense reforms people actually \nwant.\n  We also expect a vote later today that would clear away one of the \nmany impediments to job creation that was\n\n[[Page S432]]\n\nlayered into this bill. It turns out Senator Johanns did such an \noutstanding job of raising awareness about the 1099 requirement that \nour friends on the other side have basically co-opted the idea and are \nnow claiming it as their own. Actually, that is fine with us. It is not \na bad precedent, actually. We have a lot of other good ideas we would \nbe happy to share--not replacing one 2,700-page bill with another but \npassing commonsense reforms that people actually want.\n  The case against this bill is more compelling every day. Everything \nwe learn tells us it was a bad idea, that it should be repealed and \nreplaced. The courts say so, the American people say so, job creators \nsay so. It is time for those who passed this bill to show they noticed. \nLet's take this opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/02/senate-section/article/S432-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, if the American people want to understand \nthe difference between Democrats and Republicans, it is my suggestion \nthat they pay attention to what is happening on the Senate floor this \nweek. The two parties simply have different priorities. Democrats are \nfighting to modernize our Nation's air travel. Republicans are fighting \nto repeal the health care reform law, ignoring the 80 percent of \nAmericans who want them to leave it alone. In other words, Democrats \nwant to get passengers the rights they deserve. Republicans want to \ntake away patients' rights that they already have, rights that are \nsaving lives, saving money, and saving Medicare, just as we promised \nwhen we wrote this law.\n  What Republicans refuse to understand, or at least what they hope the \npeople do not realize, is that in America we give our citizens rights; \nwe don't take them away. That principle comes first and inspired the \ncountry's founding and has directed our evolution and defines our \npromise.\n  We as Senators have a choice. We can move forward or we can look \nbackward; we can make progress or we can stage a futile fight with the \nfuture. It is clear this week that while the American people and Senate \nDemocrats are looking ahead, Senate Republicans are looking for a way \nto distract the American people. This is what moving forward looks \nlike: Our bill to modernize our Nation's air travel will protect \nconsumers. It is a passengers' bill of rights. We know delays happen \nwhen we fly from the airports around the country. We try to fly \nsometimes. When we do, we want to make sure passengers are treated \nright. We want to make sure passengers have the right to timely and \naccurate information about their flight. We want to make sure \npassengers have the right to food, water, and access to restrooms when \nthey are forced to wait.\n\n  We want to make sure passengers have the right to know that while \nthey are sitting on an airplane that is on a tarmac--as I said here \nyesterday, 3\\1/2\\ hours in Dallas alone waiting for a gate--we want to \nmake sure passengers know the airline they are flying has a contingency \nplan to get them where they need to go.\n  This bill will also make flying safer and make it more efficient. It \nwill help prevent accidents on the runways. It will finally introduce \nGPS technology to our Nation's air traffic control system. Mongolia has \nGPS. We don't. In most every country in the world, they determine where \nairplanes are with GPS. They do it in the air. We are still doing it on \nthe ground. This bill will improve access to rural communities, which \nis important to Nevadans in rural cities such as Ely, NV, which is not \nnear a big metropolitan area, and would reduce delays in the first \nplace. That is what moving forward looks like, and that is why Senator \nRockefeller has worked for years to get this bill passed.\n  But there have been little side issues that have come up. The side \nissues are going to be debated on the floor and we will either pass \nthem or get rid of them and get this bill on the road to the \nPresident's desk. So what I have talked about is what moving forward \nlooks like. That is what we Democrats want to do.\n  This is what moving backward would look like: Republicans' symbolic \neffort to repeal the rights in the health care reform bill would put us \nall at risk. I am going to only mention a few of the things, but it \nwould let insurance companies, once again, stand in the way of a child \nand the medical care that child needs. It would take away that child's \nright to get health insurance and instead give insurance companies the \nright to use asthma or diabetes as the excuse to take away that care. \nIt would kick kids off their parents' health insurance. It would take \naway seniors' rights to a free wellness check. It would force seniors \nto pay more for their prescriptions. It would raise taxes on small \nbusinesses and add $1.5 trillion to our deficit.\n  That is what their amendment would do.\n  This is how health insurance worked before reforms became the law of \nthe land. We do not want to go back. Madam President, I am sure you \nhave had parents come to you with tears in their eyes, saying: Now my \nchild can get insurance. We don't want to have mothers say: What am I \ngoing to do? That is what they said in the past.\n  There is one more difference between Democrats and Republicans. We \nare fighting for jobs this week. Along with all the advantages in the \naviation modernization bill I mentioned a minute ago, it is also a jobs \nbill. It will create and protect at least 280,000 American jobs. That \nis why we are fighting so hard for this bill. This is a bipartisan \nbill. Let's get to passing it.\n  While the health care reform law is making sick Americans healthier \nand better, it is also helping unemployed Americans find work. A \nhealthier health care system is going to create hundreds of thousands \nof jobs a year for the next decade.\n  I went to GW University Hospital--I wasn't sick--to visit somebody \nthere. A woman--she must have been one of the administrators--said: Oh, \nI am so happy. She said: You know that health care bill you passed, we \nare going to hire 500 new physicians. I came back and told my staff \nthat and they said you must have it mixed up. Five hundred? I said: \nLet's find out her name and you call her. They called her. I was right. \nThat is what she told me, and she said that is because of the health \ncare bill we passed.\n  We are talking about this health care bill also helping unemployed \nAmericans find work. A healthier health care system is going to create \nhundreds of thousands of jobs a year for the next decade. That is what \nthey tell us. That is because when businesses do not have to spend much \non premiums, they can spend more on people--and healthier workers are, \nof course, more productive workers and that helps our economy at every \nlevel.\n  This is the difference between moving forward and moving backward. It \nis the difference between giving people rights and taking them away. In \nthe late days of the health care reform debate, my colleagues on the \nother side asked us to stop everything and start over. It is nothing \nmore than an excuse to keep insurance companies in charge of health \ncare in this country. The minority is again asking us to turn back the \nclock on the progress we made, turn health care back to the insurance \ncompanies. They can dig in their heels, try to slam on the brakes as \nhard as they want, but the course of our country goes in only one \ndirection. We move forward.\n  Madam President, as I announced earlier, Senator Paul is going to \ngive his maiden speech. I am sure his father is looking on through the \nmagic of all of the new communications we have to listen to his son \ngive a speech in the Senate. We are all anxious to hear him.\n\n[[Page S433]]\n\n  Senator Paul.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/02/senate-section/article/S433-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I am honored by the privilege of serving \nin the Senate. I am both honored and humbled by the responsibility of \ndefending our Constitution and our individual freedoms. I will sit at \nHenry Clay's desk. There is likely no legislator from Kentucky more \nfamous than Henry Clay. He was the Speaker of the House; he was a \nleader in the Senate. He ran for President four times and nearly bested \nJames Polk.\n  Henry Clay was called the ``Great Compromiser.'' During my \norientation, one of my colleagues came up to me and asked: Will you be \na great compromiser? I have thought long and hard about that. Is \ncompromise the noble position? Is compromise a sign of enlightenment? \nWill compromise allow us to avoid the looming debt crisis?\n  Henry Clay's life is at best a mixed message. His compromises were \nover slavery. One could argue that he rose above sectional strife to \nkeep the Union together, to preserve the Union. But one could also \nargue that he was morally wrong and that his decisions on slavery, to \nextend slavery, were decisions that actually may have even ultimately \ninvited the war that came, that his compromises meant that during the \n50 years of his legislative career he not only accepted slavery but he \naccepted the slave trade.\n  In the name of compromise, Henry Clay was by most accounts not a \ncruel master, but he was a master nonetheless of 48 slaves, most of \nwhich they did not free during his lifetime, and some of which were \nonly freed belatedly 28 years after his death.\n  He supported the fugitive slave law throughout his career. He \ncompromised on the extension of slavery. When he was the Speaker of the \nHouse, there was a vote on extending slavery into Arkansas. The vote \nwas 88 to 88. He came down, extraordinarily, from the Speaker's chair \nto vote in favor of extending slavery into Arkansas.\n  Before we eulogize Henry Clay, we should acknowledge and appreciate \nthe contrast with contemporaries who refused to compromise. William \nLloyd Garrison toiled at a small abolitionist press for 30 years, \nrefusing to compromise with Clay, with Clay's desire to send the slaves \nback to Africa. Garrison was beaten, chased by mobs, and imprisoned for \nhis principled stand.\n  Frederick Douglass traveled the country at the time. He was a free \nBlack man, but he traveled at great personal risk throughout the \ncountryside. He proved, ultimately, that he was the living, breathing \nexample that intellect and leadership could come from a recently freed \nslave.\n  Cassius Clay was a cousin of Henry Clay, and an abolitionist. In the \nHeidler's biography of Henry Clay they describe Cassius Clay as \nfollows: A venomous pen was his first weapon, and a Bowie knife his \nsecond weapon. He was so effective with the first weapon that he was \nwise to have a second weapon handy.\n  Cassius parted ways with his cousin Henry Clay, although they worked \ntogether on some things, and Henry Clay got him out of a few difficult \ntimes with the law. But they parted ways when Cassius Clay published a \nletter where Henry Clay seemed to be more in favor of emancipation than \nhe was publicly. They never spoke again after that. Henry Clay \ndisavowed the letter and condemned Cassius Clay.\n  Cassius Clay was an unapologetic abolitionist. He was an agitator. He \nmade people mad, particularly slave owners and slave traders. One night \nin Foxtown, he was ambushed by Squire Turner and his boys. They were \nslave traders. They came at him with cudgels and knives. They ambushed \nhim from behind and stabbed him in the back repeatedly. As he fell to \nthe ground, Tom Turner held his pistol to the head of Cassius Clay and \nfired. The gun misfired. He fired again and it misfired. He fired a \nthird time, and as it misfired for a third time, Cassius Clay was able \nto reach into his belt and pull his Bowie knife and gutted one of the \nTurner boys, killing him.\n  Cassius Clay refused to compromise. Cassius Clay was a hero, but he \nwas permanently estranged from Henry Clay. Henry Clay made no room for \ntrue believers. Henry made no room for the abolitionists. Who are our \nheroes? Are we fascinated and enthralled by the Great Compromiser or by \nCassius Clay?\n  Henry Clay came within 38,000 votes of winning the Presidency. He \nalmost beat James Polk. He lost one State. If he had won that one \nState, he would have been President. The State was New York, and he \nlost it because a small fledgling party, the Liberty Party, a precursor \nto the Republican Party, an abolitionist party, refused to vote for \nHenry Clay because of his muddled views on slavery. One could argue \nthat Clay's compromises ultimately cost him the Presidency.\n  Those activists who did not compromise--Garrison, Wendell Phillips, \nFrederick Douglass, Cassius Clay--are heroes because they said slavery \nis wrong and they would not compromise.\n  Today we have no issues, no moral issues, that have equivalency with \nthe issue of slavery. Yet we do face a fiscal nightmare, potentially a \ndebt crisis in our country. Is the answer to compromise? Should we \ncompromise by raising taxes and cutting spending, as the debt \ncommission proposes? Is that the compromise that will save us from \nfinancial ruin? Several facts argue against that particular compromise.\n  Government now spends more money than it ever has before. Raising \ntaxes seems to only encourage more spending. Government now spends one \nin four GDP dollars. Twenty-five percent of our economy is government \nspending.\n  Any compromise must shrink the government sector and expand the \nprivate sector. Any compromise should be where we cut Federal spending, \nnot where we raise taxes. The problem we face is not a revenue problem, \nit is a spending problem. It is spending that is now swollen to nearly \na fourth of our economy. The annual deficit is nearly $2 trillion.\n  Entitlements and interest will consume the entire debt, the entire \nbudget, if we do nothing. Within a decade, there will be no money left \nfor defense, no money left for infrastructure, no money left for \nanything other than the entitlements and interest if we do not tackle \nthis problem.\n  Many ask, will the Tea Party compromise? Can the Tea Party work with \nothers to find a solution? The answer is, of course there must be \ndialog and ultimately compromise. But the compromise must occur on \nwhere we cut spending.\n  Even across the aisle, we have Democrats who are now saying, you know \nwhat, it is a problem. We should not raise taxes in a recession. So we \nare finding some agreement. The compromise we as conservatives must \nacknowledge is that we can cut some money from the military. The other \nside, the liberals, also must compromise that they can cut some money \nfrom domestic spending. Freezing domestic spending, though, at 2010 \nlevels, as the President proposed in his State of the Union, does \nalmost nothing. In fact, it freezes inflated spending levels, and will \ndo nothing to avoid a crisis.\n  There is a certain inevitability to this debate, as the debt bomb \nlooms and grows perilously large. As long as I sit at Henry Clay's \ndesk, I will remember his lifelong desire to forge agreement. But I \nwill also keep close to my heart the principled stand of his cousin \nCassius Clay, who refused to forsake the life of any human simply to \nfind agreement.\n  Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I congratulate Senator Paul on his \nmaiden speech in the Senate, and applaud him for taking the opportunity \nto underscore the seriousness of the fiscal situation we are in.\n  Solving the Nation's fiscal problems will indeed require principled \nleadership, and I am confident Senator Paul\n\n[[Page S434]]\n\nwill play an important role in guiding us toward real solutions.\n  Senator Paul is a lawmaker to watch. He brings a keen intellect and \nrare passion to the job. He will be an important voice in this body in \nthe many debates to come.\n  I look forward to working with him on behalf of Kentuckians and all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 223, which the clerk will report \nby title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 223) to modernize the air traffic control \n     system, improve the safety, reliability, and availability of \n     transportation by air in the United States, provide for \n     modernization of the air traffic control system, reauthorize \n     the Federal Aviation Administration, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Stabenow amendment No. 9, to repeal the expansion of \n     information reporting requirements for payments of $600 or \n     more to corporations.\n       McConnell amendment No. 13, to repeal the job-killing \n     health care law and health care-related provisions in the \n     Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, this is, in fact, the aviation \nbill. As everybody knows, that is what we are doing; we are doing the \naviation bill. We are talking about health care, but secretly we are \ndoing the aviation bill. So I thought it would be interesting to talk \nabout the aviation bill, to sort of bring people's minds back to that \nvery important subject. It is interesting, because we want \ntransparency, no filling up of the tree, everybody could offer all of \nthe amendments they want. We immediately got amendments to repeal \nhealth care and other kinds of things but nothing about aviation. So as \nmanager of that bill, I am going to talk about aviation. I do not \nguarantee it will be a scintillating speech, but it is going to be \nabout aviation, because that is the bill we are on.\n  I rise to speak about--which I did a little bit yesterday--the \nmodernization of the Nation's air traffic control system. It is kind of \nimportant to New York and New Jersey.\n  I cannot emphasize enough to all of my colleagues the importance of \nthis issue to the United States. It is an issue I care deeply about, \none Senator Hutchison cares deeply about, one I am completely committed \nto getting done. We have to. It is a sine qua non. It will make air \ntraffic safer, more efficient, provide numerous economic and \nenvironmental benefits.\n  I touched on air traffic modernization in my opening statement \nyesterday. But I want to spend a short time, knowing that my colleague \nSenator Hutchison is here and wants to talk, on the air traffic \nmodernization. It just has to be discussed in a tiny bit greater detail \nso people understand how important it is.\n\n  There will be some technical stuff in here, and I apologize for that, \nbut people have to understand this. I know this subject is very \ntechnical. It is very confusing. It has lots of acronyms, unmemorable \nacronyms, but the technology will change aviation in truly amazing \nways, and it is of overwhelming importance to the country.\n  Every time I get in my car, I find it implausible that so many \nautomobiles navigate using more sophisticated global positioning \nsystems than aircraft. Well, that is amusing, except it is horrifying, \nactually. It is horrifying. We can do it in Detroit with automobiles \nthat sell for $15,000, $25,000, but we cannot do it on a multimillion-\ndollar aircraft because we have not decided to do it aggressively in \nour legislation. So we have to upgrade our system now or we are going \nto face absolutely enormous consequences.\n  I continue to believe that the modernization of our Nation's \nantiquated air traffic control system has to be one of the Nation's \nhighest priorities. We have fallen behind, as is now--it is actually \nkind of interesting. It has become a mantra: We have fallen behind \nMongolia. People like to talk about that. I am the original author of \nthat startling fact--this tiny little nation ahead of us. But it does \nnot make any difference. Everybody should steal the line because it \nmakes the point: They have it. They are building it from scratch. We do \nnot. So if we recognize the benefits of using the most advanced \ntechnology and if they do, perhaps it is something we might think \nabout.\n  The United States, of course, has a much larger and more complex \nairspace system than Mongolia or any other country in the world, but \nthis is precisely the problem: that we are so big and we are so \ncomplicated; there are 36,000 flights in a day. There are airplanes \nduring the day, all day long, all over the country, at different \naltitudes, coming in, avoiding weather, avoiding each other, facing \ndelays or not. Our aviation system actually moves 30,000 flights a \nday--I would say 36,000, but it says 30,000--and nearly 800 million \npeople per year--a lot tougher than Mongolia. But we face gridlock if \nwe do not make significant progress on modernization and make it very \nsoon. The FAA's most recent forecasts estimate demand for air travel \nwill be about 1 billion people within the next decade. That is a 40-\npercent increase. That is horrific.\n  Senator Isakson has just come on the floor. His airport in Atlanta is \none of the most complicated and busy in the entire world. He needs, as \ndo we all, an air traffic control system which is digitalized, which \nmakes communication between air traffic controllers and pilots much \nmore accurate so they can see terrain, they can see mountains, they can \nsee weather, all in streamingly live exactitude.\n  The economic downturn of the past several years has actually, in a \nquirky way, bought us some time to reform our system. We have declined \nto use it, but this will quickly change as the economy rebounds. Our \npresent air traffic control system is stretched to its limits already. \nAnyone who flies on a regular basis has experienced the system's \ncongestion and delay problems. We talked about that yesterday. We will \ntalk more. This system will not meet the projected growth of the next \ndecade.\n  So we have this choice. An industry that employs 11 million people \nand several more in indirect jobs, that traffics 800 million people \naround the country to all kinds of places large and small, very \ncomplicated--runway problems, gateway problems, all kinds of problems--\nif we do not have this up to speed, we are a nation in trouble and \npeople will start dying.\n  The Next Generation Air Transportation System, NextGen, will create \nsignificantly more capacity by allowing aircraft to move more \nefficiently and take more direct routes. I talked about that yesterday. \nIt is so important. Planes now, because of the sort of radar ground-\nbased system, wind their way to their destination, avoiding planes, \navoiding weather, and how quickly can they see it, how accurately can \nthey see it, are they aware of the altitude of other planes above them \nand below them? Probably not very accurate. So they don't take direct \nroutes. So these improvements, if they do take direct routes, will save \nour economy billions annually.\n  The technology will also allow the FAA to safely allow the closer \nspacing of aircraft. More aircraft can land and do so more safely \nbecause of the reality of the digitalization of everything is so clear \nto the pilot and to the air traffic controller. They are in sync for \nthe first time with a highly sophisticated system. And the Northeast \ncorridor probably will be the greatest beneficiary of all of that. It \nwill be.\n  Greater operational efficiency will also create substantial \nenvironmental benefits. Drastic reductions in fuel consumption--taking \nmore of a straight line from one place to another rather than going all \nover the place--saves a\n\n[[Page S435]]\n\nlot of fuel, and that means less carbon emissions, and it also \nsignificantly lowers noise emissions. Almost every community near an \nairport will greatly benefit from this effort, and this will also save \nairlines millions of dollars annually in fuel costs.\n  Airlines, you have to remember--people just assume they are always \nthere. Well, they are almost always in trouble financially. They merge. \nSometimes they merge not because they want to but because they have to \nbecause one of them is declining financially. They have to be able to \nmeet payroll.\n  Most importantly, NextGen will dramatically improve the safety--the \nsafety--of our air transportation system. It will provide pilots and \nair traffic controllers with better situational awareness. The military \nuses that term--SA it is called. It is called SA, situational \nawareness. Pilots and controllers will be able to see other aircraft \nand detailed weather maps and other things such as mountains in real \ntime. If they are flying low, they need to have a very good sense of \nwhat the terrain holds. So just as in battle, better SA--situational \nawareness--will save lives.\n  Modernizing our air traffic control system will require sustained \nfocus and a lot of money. Our bill takes concrete steps to make sure \nthe implementation of this system begins now. And there is some of it \nout there in a few airports, and where it is out there, it is working \nvery well, just as Senator Hutchison and I have described.\n  The bill directs the FAA to move forward on dedicated timelines to \nimplement key NextGen technologies. In particular, it requires clear \ndeadlines for the adoption of existing GPS navigation technology. All \nof this has to be calibrated. Carriers have been very excited about \nusing this; it is just that we have not made it available to them. And \nthey are a part of it because as we build it they are going to have to \nhave corresponding avionics and systems within their own cockpits, \nwhich they will pay for. They want to do that because they want to have \nthis safer system so they are not harassed so much and so they can save \nfuel and just do better in general. Why do something out of the 19th \ncentury when you can do it out of the modern era that will last for \nyears?\n  It also requires the FAA to move forward on developing air traffic \nprocedures to make certain airlines will reap the benefits of equipping \naircraft in their fleet.\n  These technologies are as follows. They are called area navigation \nand required navigation performance, RNP. That will permit aircraft to \nfly more precise routes in both the en route environment and enable \naircraft to land more efficiently and safely at airports. Our \nlegislation requires the FAA to develop the procedures that accompany \nthis technology at the Nation's 30 largest airports by 2014--Senator \nHutchison said that yesterday--and at all commercial airports across \nthis country by 2018, if we do our work here. Then the whole thing will \nbe done in the county by 2018 and all the biggest ones by 2014.\n  The bill accelerates the timeframe for the integration of automatic \ndependent surveillance-broadcast--ADS-B--technology by requiring the \nuse of ADS-B Out on all aircraft by 2015 and the use of ADS-B In on all \naircraft by 2018. This technology will significantly improve the safety \nof our system by providing pilots and air traffic controllers with more \nprecise information on their location. That is everything in air \ntraffic control--where people are, how high, how low, how close, how \nfar. The FAA has moved forward on the requirement for ADS-B Out for all \naircraft operating in our airspace, and we plan to work with them to \nmake sure this is a success.\n  The bill--coming to the end--takes further steps to make certain that \nimplementation of NextGen continues at the FAA, including the creation \nof an air traffic control modernization oversight board. Oh, wonderful, \nanother board. Well, this is a really complicated system, and you need \nto have an advisory group that oversees, gives oversight--as we in the \nCommerce Committee will do--of FAA's modernization activities.\n  It establishes a Chief NextGen Officer position at FAA. Oh, another \nperson to oversee something at FAA. Well, we have not done this. We are \nnot doing it. And to have an officer dedicated to that I think is very \nimportant.\n  It requires the development of processes to include representatives \nof Federal employees in the planning of NextGen projects. Why is that \nimportant? Because it means that people who are working the towers, who \nare actually involved in the system as it is now--and if you go out to \nother places--Herndon--you can see these enormous rooms of computers \nwith air traffic controllers and these sort of vague shapes. We want to \nturn those into precise shapes. That is what our bill would do.\n  It establishes a new process to make certain labor disputes at the \nFAA are adequately resolved through mediation and arbitration if \nnecessary.\n  So our future as the world's leader in aviation, our safety, our \neconomy--all depend on a successful modernization of our air traffic \ncontrol system. An FAA-funded study determined that our economy lost \n$33 billion in 1 year as a result of delays attributed to the air \ntraffic control system. That is not smart and it is not safe. Of this \ntotal, $8 billion was from the airlines themselves. They are not in the \nposition to lose $8 billion--an amount that would go a long way toward \ngiving them a healthier bottom line and making other improvements. The \nother $25 billion in losses was borne by the traveling public--they had \nto pay for it--and business.\n  So this overdue FAA reauthorization takes the necessary steps to make \ncertain we begin to implement this critical upgrade of our airspace \ntechnology right now. We must follow through on these efforts or face \ndramatic challenges. This is not a song and dance effort; this is life \nand death for the future of our air system, in literal terms and \nsymbolic terms.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I commend the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee. He and I have been working on this bill since 2007.\n  As we mentioned when we began consideration of the bill yesterday, \nthis is the 18th short-term extension we are on. I think any person in \nAmerica, any person who flies in America, any person who is subject to \nFAA regulation, and certainly any businessperson in America knows you \ncannot do long-term planning and ensure that your agency is doing its \nwork knowing what they can expect in support from Congress in short-\nterm extensions for over 4 years. That is not good business, it is not \ngood management, and it is certainly not the way government should \nrun. So I am in agreement with Senator Rockefeller, our chairman, that \nwe need to act on this bill. I hope it is going to be an effort that is \nbipartisan, that we will address the issues that have held up the bill \nin the past in a reasonable way so we can get on with, hopefully, a 3-\nyear authorization of the FAA, and especially so we can start next \nyear.\n\n  America is the premier user of air traffic control systems. Our \nsystem is based on the 1960s technology of ground operations and use of \nradar. We want to move to a satellite-based system that will increase \nthe capacity at our clogged airports--the bigger airports that have \nmore traffic than they can accommodate--and where the traveling public \nis in the most need. We need the efficiency and we need the modern \ntechnology. That is what this bill will set us on the path to do.\n  So I agree with the chairman in that respect, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on their amendments that pertain to this \nbill going forward.\n  I wish to take a few moments to speak to the amendment that is at \nhand, which is not an amendment about the FAA authorization, but it is \na very important amendment. Basically, it is Senator McConnell's \namendment that would repeal the health care reform that was passed over \na year ago. He is trying to say: Let's stop right now. We have seen \nevery signal that the concerns we had when we spoke against this bill \nin December of 2009 are coming home to roost. In fact, the concerns we \nraised are now being shown to be a huge problem in this country.\n  The health care reform bill that was passed cost $2.6 trillion. Over \n6,000 pages were added to the Federal Register to implement this law. \nAll of this\n\n[[Page S436]]\n\nindicates the bill does a whole lot more than my colleagues are \nreferencing right now in the floor debate because when I hear the floor \ndebate, the people who supported this bill are saying all we did was \nfix a few problems with our health care system that we all agree on. \nBut in reality, this is a bill that costs $2.6 trillion, $500 billion \nin new taxes on business and on individuals, and it cuts $500 billion \nout of Medicare, a program that isn't working to the maximum extent \npossible. It is certainly not considered the most efficient program. \nNow we are putting $500 billion out for a new government entitlement \nprogram that puts the Federal Government between patients and their \ndoctors.\n  Here are a few of the provisions that are in the 2,000 pages of the \nhealth reform law. First, if you don't buy government-approved health \ninsurance for you and your family, the health reform bill says you must \npay a new tax. That is the individual tax.\n  If you own a business and don't buy government-approved health \ninsurance, which is going to have a formula and a requirement for how \nmuch businesses have to pay and what has to be in it, then you must pay \na new tax. If business owners want to grow their employees over the 50 \nmark where it kicks in for businesses, then there will be costly new \nFederal regulations with which they will have to comply.\n  So here we are in an era where unemployment is at all-time highs, and \nwe are putting a cap on employees for businesses that are going to \nincur huge expenses if they go over 50. So if an employer is in the 40-\nto-45 range, they are looking very carefully at not going above 50. Is \nthat really what our economy needs right now? I don't think so.\n  What we want is to encourage businesses to hire. That is what every \none of us in this body should want, and we should be passing laws that \nwould ensure that businesses have the freedom to hire, not a stifling \neffect on that kind of effort. We need to get the government off the \nbacks of our job creators and not put up miles of redtape and more \nbureaucracy and more regulations and more taxes and fees that would \ncurb the ability to hire and still make a profit.\n  Next, it was said during the health care reform debate that if you \nlike your current health plan, you will be able to keep it. But \neverything that has happened since the bill passed says you can't keep \nit because even the administration is now admitting that when it issued \nthe rules that employers now have to follow when deciding what health \ncare plan it will offer, that because of health reform, by 2013 as many \nas 80 percent of small businesses will no longer offer the same health \ncare plans they offer today.\n  Families who rely on their health savings accounts or flexible \nspending accounts, which have been a wonderful boon for families to be \nable to put money aside before taxes to be able to use on the health \ncare expenses they have that are not covered by insurance, that is \nbeing used by more and more people--in the millions. But in the health \ncare reform bill there is now a restriction, a cap, on how much you can \nput aside, and you have to have a prescription drug to be able to pay \nfor it with your pretax dollars. You can no longer buy a bottle of \nTylenol or aspirin off the counter and have your health savings account \nhelp you pay for that. So here we are.\n  The Presiding Officer and I have children. Are we going to stop and \ncall the doctor or run and get a prescription if we have a health \nsavings account to buy aspirin or Tylenol? That is not helpful.\n  Why would we put a restriction on what people can set aside for their \nown health care costs? Why wouldn't we make it easier for them? \nInstead, the health care reform bill makes it harder to use those \npretax dollars. There is no reason for it. I will have an amendment \nthat will try to take the caps off and take the restrictions off so \nthat people can provide for their health care out-of-pocket expenses \nwith pretax dollars. That is the kind of incentive we need, not the \nopposite, which is in the health care reform bill.\n  If you are a woman under 50, whether you have access to routine \nmammograms is going to depend on a task force that was granted new and \nunchecked powers by the health care reform bill. The same task force \nthat is going to have that power has already given the indication that \nmammograms under the age of 50 are not necessary to be covered. The \nwomen of the Senate stood firm years ago when the Clinton \nadministration was trying to pass a health care reform bill to say we \nare absolutely not going to stand in the way of a woman and her doctor, \nknowing her history and her family, from having a mammogram whenever it \nis needed. There is not one person in this body who doesn't have a \nfriend or a relative who has had breast cancer before the age of 50 and \nprobably before the age of 40. So that is in the health care reform \nbill, and it needs to come out.\n  This week, another Federal court announced that the Federal \nGovernment could not force individual Americans to purchase a private \nproduct--even health care. The judge in the most recent case in Florida \nsaid when Congress passed health reform it exceeded its constitutional \npower and, therefore, the court voided the entire law. This is the \nsecond court that has found the health reform bill unconstitutional.\n  Now, this lawsuit is going through the judicial process. Yet even \nthough it is being appealed by the Obama administration, it will most \nlikely go to the Supreme Court of America. We shouldn't have to wait \nfor the Supreme Court to rule that this law is unconstitutional. We \nshouldn't have to wait for them to reassure the American people that \nCongress most certainly shouldn't be regulating anything and everything \njust because the Federal Government says so. We don't have to spend \nmillions more in taxpayer dollars implementing a bill that ultimately \ncould be struck down by the highest Court in the land.\n  The Senate has the opportunity, and I believe the responsibility, to \nsay: Moratorium. Let's wait until the Supreme Court has ruled on this \nenormous bill and the enormous cost that is being incurred for \nimplementation right now. Let's wait. Let's repeal this bill now and \nstart all over so we do not have to spend taxpayer dollars that we know \nare being borrowed to implement a bill that may be unconstitutional, \nand we have now had two Federal courts that have said so. Why not \nrepeal and support this amendment? Some of what is in the bill could be \nreenacted because it is good, but some of the things I have just talked \nabout should be repealed immediately.\n  Most certainly we could repeal items such as the 1099 which will be \nanother amendment we can vote on. That 1099 form is the biggest thing I \nhear about from my small businesses in this country, and certainly \nthose in Texas have said: What are you all doing up there? Well, of \ncourse, I am happy to say I didn't support this bill. But these are the \nkinds of things we can repeal today and start all over. We can take the \ngood parts of the Obama health care. Let's do away with the bad parts \ninstead of spending millions of dollars to make a mom have to get a \nprescription from a doctor to get Tylenol with her health savings \naccount.\n  The American people have made their opinion on this bill known loudly \nand clearly. They spoke at the ballot box: Enough is enough. That is \nwhat the voters said. Enough deficit spending; enough government \nintrusion into our businesses, our families, our lives, and our health \ncare decisions. The people of America support the repeal of this bill, \nand they will work with us to substitute responsible health care reform \nthat will allow them to have health savings accounts to provide for the \ncosts not covered, that will give them affordable coverage which we all \nwant to have, but not with the government prescription, not with a \ngovernment task force that can tell a woman that she doesn't need a \nmammogram before the age of 50. We don't need a task force to tell us \nthat. We need the doctor who is looking at this patient and her family \nhistory.\n  Those are the things that need to come out right now. Repeal and \nreplace. That is what this Senate could do, and we can move forward on \na bill that we can get a bipartisan consensus to pass that I think \nwould show the American people we heard what they said. We know we can \ndo better, and it is our responsibility to do so.\n  Thank you, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S437]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask if the Senator from the State \nof Washington would grant me 30 seconds to say one thing.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Of course, I will.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, yesterday Senator Hutchison raised \na very good point about slots. Slots are kind of the hidden problem in \nthe FAA bill. What I think I would like to put forward--and I wish she \nwere here to hear me--is that I recognize the majority of the \npopulation growth in this country, and, therefore, the need for more \nflights, is in the West. It is not in the East. That is extremely \nimportant. We deny it, but a lot of people are east coast centric, and \nwe have to learn how to be equally west coast centric.\n  So one of the things that occurs to me is that maybe we are thinking \ntoo much about airlines and not enough about the people who take those \nairlines to go to various places in the West.\n  It cannot stand that Los Angeles has a flight a day to DC. It cannot \nstand. They need at least four or five. They can bear that traffic.\n  I want to lay before the Congress--and the Senator from Texas made \nthis point yesterday and I totally agree with her--the growth of \npopulation in this country and the need for air flights, yes, is in the \nEast but it is more now in the West. As we go through this bill and \ncome to the matter of slots, it is important we keep that in mind and \nthat we think about the public flying as individuals, not necessarily \nis it United, is it USAir, is it American, is it whatever. It is the \nquestion, Can we get them to where they want to go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, will the Senator from Washington \nallow me to make a couple minutes response to the Senator from West \nVirginia?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I appreciate so much what the \nchairman has just said. That is a major statement because what he says \nis true. There is one flight from Washington National to California. \nThat is all we have, one direct flight. That is not fair. It is not \nfair to the people in the West, certainly in the largest State in \npopulation in America--California.\n  I hope what he has said will lead us to a table to negotiate this \nissue so we can be fair to the entire western half of the United \nStates, so that we are also taking into account the people who live in \nand around the Washington metropolitan area, which is what I think the \nWestern Senators have tried to do. But let's talk about it, let's get \nsomething on the floor, let's negotiate this because with that, this is \na bill that, with a few tweaks perhaps, ought to pass for the right \nreasons for our country and for the traveling public.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership, and I thank Senator Murray.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we are here today to debate the FAA \nreauthorization bill, very important legislation. It will create \nthousands of jobs and put in place the infrastructure for us to make \nsure we are competitive in the future.\n  It is disheartening to me that this bill has now been hijacked by a \npolitical debate, an amendment to repeal health care reform. Not every \nbill has to become political. Unfortunately, that is what we have today \nbecause we have an offer of an amendment to repeal health care reform. \nLet me speak to that amendment.\n  Last year, I watched as President Obama signed health care reform \ninto law with a young man by the name of Marcelas Owens. He stood just \na few feet away from the President. I met Marcelas a few months earlier \nat a rally in Seattle, and he told me a story that stayed with me \nthroughout the health care debate. I want to mention it again.\n  Marcelas, a little boy, came up to me at this health care rally. He \nleaned in close to me and he said he wanted to tell me about his mom \nnamed Tifanny. She was a single mom, working hard. She got sick and \nlost her job. Because she lost her job, she lost her health care. \nBecause she lost her health care, she lost her life. Little Marcelas \nlooked up at me and said: Please don't let this happen to any other \nlittle boy. Please pass health care.\n  I was proud when that health care reform law was passed and is now \nworking to make sure Marcelas and thousands of other little kids do not \nget into that terrible situation through which he has lived.\n  He was not alone. I heard from thousands of people from my home State \nof Washington who were demanding reform to the system we have. I heard \nfrom small business owners who wanted to cover their employees but they \ncould not continue to do it because of the skyrocketing premiums. I \nheard from moms and dads who wanted to cover their children but they \nwere getting rejected because their son or daughter had a preexisting \ncondition. I heard from seniors who were desperate because they had \nfallen into the doughnut hole. They did not know how they were going to \nafford the drugs they needed to take so that they could have dignity of \nlife in their senior years.\n  I heard from men and women in every part of my State, some barely \nholding on to their health insurance and a lot with no coverage at all. \nEach one of their stories had a common thread: The health care system \nwe have in this country did not work for them. It failed their families \none way or another, and they wanted it to change.\n  That is why I fought so hard with so many of my colleagues to reform \nthat broken health insurance system, to fight for our families who \nneeded help and were desperate and to level the playing field for \npeople who needed a little bit of support.\n  We got that done for our families, and we can never go back. We \ncannot go back to a time when millions of Americans stayed up at night \nworrying about what would happen to them and their families if they \nlost their job and their health insurance; when insurance companies put \nunreasonable and unfair lifetime caps on coverage for our families; \nwhen women were not able to get equal access to coverage; when small \nbusinesses could not afford health care; and when so many seniors who \ncould not afford it had to pay the full cost of expensive medications. \nWe cannot go back to that situation.\n  My question for Republicans today is, why would they want us to?\n  The changes we made require insurance companies to cover preventive \nservices with little or no cost sharing on the part of patients. It \ngives families access to new streamlined assistance to help them appeal \nservices they have been denied or not covered adequately, something so \nmany families got lost in prior to passage of this legislation.\n  It helps anyone who has ever been buried under a blizzard of forms \nfrom their insurance company and denials for coverage they need to \nhave. It helps our small businesses to afford care for themselves and \ntheir employees who are now getting a tax deduction. As they fill out \ntheir forms, they say: I did not know this was in the health care bill. \nAnd we are going to vote to take that away?\n  I ask, why do Republicans want to take away the benefits as part of \nthe business of the Senate as we just get started to get our economy \nback on track?\n  In my home State of Washington, the Republicans' plan would mean \nnearly 900,000 seniors who have Medicare coverage will be forced now to \npay more for regular checkups and important preventive services. It \nwould mean they will lose out on the 50-percent discounts on some of \ntheir prescription drugs. And it would mean that insurance companies \nwould no longer be required to allow young people to stay on their \npolicies until they are 26 and that, by the way, is going to be \nespecially harmful now when so many of those young people today are \nhaving trouble finding a job.\n  Our families are depending on the changes we made within this health \ncare reform law. It is why I supported reforming our health care \nsystem. It is why I fought so hard for so long to make sure it worked \nfor our families and small business owners. And it is why I am going to \nkeep fighting to make sure we do not go back to the way things were, \nthat we continue to make progress and do this right.\n  I am happy to work with anyone--Democrat or Republican--to improve\n\n[[Page S438]]\n\nthis law, but I will do everything I can to fight a full repeal that \nwill devastate our families and small business owners across America. I \nurge my colleagues to vote no against this full repeal of health care \nreform.\n  One final point. We hear so many people talking about the deficit \ntoday and how important it is that we get our hands around the budget \nand our budget deficit. It is astonishing to me that this first \namendment brought by the Republicans will cost our Federal Government \n$1.5 trillion and put us deeper into a deficit hole.\n  Progress is important. Getting our families back on track is \nimportant. Making sure that our economy is moving within the FAA bill \nwe are talking about on the floor is important. And it is important \nthat we continue to make sure the health care reform insurance system \nwe put in place works for our families. That is what I will be voting \non later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, yesterday I spoke on one of the reasons for \nthe repeal of this legislation; that is to say, the support for the \namendment to repeal the health care legislation that is pending before \nus. Today I wish to speak about a couple other reasons to support that \namendment.\n  One of the things that was said in the campaign to pass the health \ncare bill was that those who liked their current health care would be \nable to keep it. But as we know now and as we pointed out prior to the \nbill's passage, provisions in the law would cause many Americans and \nwill cause many Americans to lose their coverage. That is why the \nadministration is now giving out waivers for some of the bill's most \nburdensome provisions.\n  I wish to speak for a moment about these waivers the administration \nhas granted and the problems that the waivers reveal with the bill as a \nwhole.\n  So far, the administration has granted 729 waivers. All of these are \ntemporary. They protect companies and labor unions from one of the \nbill's most onerous mandates--the phasing out of annual caps on costs \npaid by insurers. Another four waivers were granted to States applying \non behalf of insurers. According to the administration, waivers may be \ngranted if the applicant can show that a ``large increase in premiums'' \nor a ``significant decrease in access to coverage'' would occur absent \na waiver.\n  So far, the waivers cover 2,283,106 people. That is more than 2 \nmillion people whom the administration has had to protect from its own \nbill.\n  All of these waivers were granted to limited benefit plans, or so-\ncalled mini-med plans. About 1.4 million Americans have these mini-med \nplans, including many part-time employees who work in the restaurant \nand retail industries. These plans are low cost and usually have an \nannual cap on costs the insurer would pay out.\n  Under the Obama plan, these plans would be outlawed. A phaseout on \nannual caps begins this year. Starting this year, plans cannot impose \nan annual limit of less than $750,000. That threshold gets \nprogressively higher, until 2014 when ObamaCare will prohibit annual \ncaps altogether.\n  What this does, of course, is create an incentive for employers who \ncurrently offer mini-med plans below the $750,000 threshold to drop \ntheir coverage completely until the employer mandate and penalties \nbecome effective in 2014. They can either comply with the requirements \nof the health care law or pay a fine for each employee.\n  The employees caught in this mess who currently have coverage through \nmini-med plans will have to hope in the meantime that their employer \ncan get a waiver; otherwise, those employees will have to wait until \n2014 and buy a government-approved policy from the new insurance \nexchanges or hope that their employer is in compliance with the many \nemployer requirements in the bill.\n  McDonald's, for example, which offers mini-med plans to many of its \nemployees, received a 1-year waiver. The company warned that absent a \nwaiver, 30,000 employees could lose their current coverage and would be \nleft ``without an affordable, comparably designed alternative until \n2014.''\n  It is not clear what will happen when the 1-year waiver expires. That \nis another part of the problem. The waivers are often given on the \ncondition that the recipient brings itself into compliance during the \nwaiver period. Whether the waiver renewals are available is unclear. As \nwith many other provisions of ObamaCare, the uncertainty for businesses \nsurrounding annual cap waivers is immense.\n  While the waivers are welcomed by those who benefit, they represent a \npoor way to run the government or health care. When the government \npicks which entities will have to abide by the law and which ones will \nnot, it is literally picking winners and losers. That is not the recipe \nfor objective or wise policymaking. It is called discrimination.\n  I will note that a large number of these waivers were being given to \nthe administration's political allies. Unions, for example, many of \nwhich praised the bill's passage, are a major beneficiary. Of the 733 \nwaivers granted, 182 went to unions. That is a quarter of all the \nwaivers, even though unionized workers make up only 7 percent of the \nprivate workforce.\n  Many of the unions applying for waivers are the very same that were \nfull of praise upon passage of ObamaCare. In its press release praising \npassage of the bill, the Service Employees International Union gushed \nthat ``it is a new day.'' About 6 months later, Local 25 SEIU applied \nfor a waiver from the annual limits limitation for 31,000 of its \nmembers. It was granted 2 weeks later. Apparently, it is a new day--\njust not for 31,000 SEIU members.\n  Similarly, when the bill was enacted, the American Federation of \nTeachers referred to it as an occasion where ``morality trumped \ngreed.''\n  Six months later, its New York City affiliate obtained a waiver \naffecting 351,000 individuals.\n  In the recent column in Forbes magazine, law professor Richard \nEpstein explains the dangers of administrative discretion related to \nwaivers and how the waiver process can undermine the rule of law:\n\n       Waivers are by definition an exercise of administrative \n     discretion that benefits the party who receives its special \n     dispensation. Nothing in Obamacare explains who should \n     receive these waivers or why. The dangers from this \n     uncertainty are enormous. . . . Without major steps to \n     overhaul or repeal Obamacare, government by waiver will \n     become standard operating procedure to the detriment of us \n     all.\n\n  This is a bill that was written behind closed doors, creates a huge \nuncertainty and problems for job-creating businesses and their \nemployees, and now waivers are being dispensed by the administration to \nprotect almost 2.3 million people from the very law it fought so hard \nto get passed.\n  These developments are yet more confirmation that the law is deeply \nflawed and one more reason why it should be repealed in its entirety.\n  The second issue I would like to speak to is the fact that under this \nlaw, there are substantial increased costs, but they are being masked \nby the way the bill has been written, and the calculations, therefore, \nsome have suggested, would actually result in a savings of $230 \nbillion. This is only plausible if you believe the way this bill was \nwritten was an honest way of stating its costs. It is not that the CBO \nhas done anything wrong in its calculations, it is that it was told how \nto calculate certain things. The bill's authors said: Never mind what \nthe reality or truth is, here is how you will calculate the cost of it. \nThe CBO, as a functionary, did exactly that to come up with a number.\n  But former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin recently cowrote an \narticle, along with Joseph Antos and James Capretta, explaining that \nthe bill's purported deficit reduction is based on ``budget gimmicks, \ndeceptive accounting, and implausible assumptions used to create the \nfalse impression of fiscal discipline.'' The fact is, repeal will not \nadd to the deficit. The bill itself is the budget buster, not repeal.\n  I am in favor of full repeal of the so-called Affordable Care Act. \nThere are many problems with this bill and many reasons to support \nrepeal. Today, I want to talk about cost.\n  A central talking point from the bill's supporters has been that the \nbill, intended to cover 32 million Americans, will reduce the deficit \nby about $230 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. \nTherefore, repeal\n\n[[Page S439]]\n\nwill increase the deficit by the same amount.\n  Maybe this sounds plausible--but only until you study these numbers \nmore closely. Only in Washington could the ``cost'' of repealing a \nmassive entitlement program add to the deficit.\n  This is not because of anything the Congressional Budget Office did \nwrong. Remember, when the Congressional Budget Office calculates these \nestimates, it is required to accept every assumption it is given, \nhowever unrealistic such assumptions are. That's how the authors of \nObamaCare got CBO to produce such a favorable number.\n  Indeed, former Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Holtz-\nEakin recently cowrote an article, along with Joseph Antos and James \nCapretta, explaining that the bill's purported deficit reduction is \nbased on ``budget gimmicks, deceptive accounting, and implausible \nassumptions used to create the false impression of fiscal discipline,'' \nand that repeal will not, in fact, add to the deficit. The bill itself \nis the real budget buster. Not repeal.\n  Let me walk through the false assumptions and gimmicks Holtz-Eakin \nand his co-authors describe.\n  First, as Republicans pointed out again and again before the bill's \npassage, the bill's original $938 billion pricetag does not reflect the \ntrue 10-year cost. That estimate was generated using 10 years of taxes \nto pay for 6 years of subsidies. Remember, while the taxes begin this \nyear, the subsidies don't kick in until 2014. So, the 10-year cost of \nthe bill's full implementation is actually about $2.3 trillion.\n  Second, there is an additional entitlement program within this new \nentitlement: the so-called CLASS Act, a new, government-run, \ngovernment-funded program for long-term care, intended to compete with \nlong-term care plans provided by private insurers.\n  Participants would pay into the system for 5 years before they start \ncollecting benefits. So, for at least the first 5 years, the program \nwould generate surplus receipts for the government. But eventually, \noutflows would exceed receipts. This is why the chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee referred to the CLASS Act as ``a Ponzi scheme, the \nkind of thing that Bernie Madoff would have been proud of.''\n  This is a bailout waiting to happen. As Holtz-Eakin, Antos, and \nCapretta write, ``CLASS Act hitched a ride on the Affordable Care Act \nfor one reason only: Premiums are collected in the first 10 years, but \nno benefits are provided. Voila, it creates the perception of a $70 \nbillion deficit reduction. . . . Only in Washington could the creation \nof a reckless entitlement program be used as an `offset' to grease the \nway for another entitlement program.''\n  Third, is the illusory savings from cuts made to Medicare's health-\ncare providers, which would bring payments below those made to Medicaid \nproviders. We know that the network of doctors and hospitals willing to \nsee Medicaid patients is constrained in part because of low \nreimbursement rates.\n  Accordingly, about 15 percent of America's hospitals and physicians \nwould have to stop seeing Medicare patients to help curtail their \nlosses, although the bill assumes that seniors would not see any change \nin their care. Holtz-Eakin, Antos, and Capretta write, ``The idea that \nMedicare could pay less than Medicaid is such sheer folly that Congress \nwill rapidly reverse course. The truth is these cuts cannot be relied \nupon for anything.''\n  In addition, the bill double counts these so-called Medicare \n``savings,'' claiming that they can both shore up Medicare's solvency \nand help pay for ObamaCare.\n  Fourth, ``a central CBO assumption'' about how many Americans will \nget federal health care subsidies ``could be disastrously off the \nmark.''\n  Today, about 111 million Americans are eligible for subsidies through \nthe new insurance ``exchanges'' if they don't have an employer-based \nplan. But the bill assumes that only 19 million would receive these \nsubsidies. This assumption fails to take into account the incentive the \nbill creates for certain employees to find their way onto the \nexchanges, rather than accept coverage from their employers, if \noffered. As the authors note, ``the new subsidies are so generous that \nlow- and moderate-income workers come out way ahead if they get paid in \ncash, not benefits, and move to the new entitlement.''\n  If only the 35 million lowest paid workers jump onto the new \nentitlement, Federal spending will rise by another $1 trillion in the \nfirst decade alone.\n  So, those are four reasons that the purported cost estimates for this \nbill are simply wrong or misguided. It's clear that the claims that the \nbill will reduce the deficit, or else increase it upon repeal, do not \nhold up upon close inspection. Repeal is not a threat to the budget; to \nthe contrary. The real budgetary threat is ObamaCare itself.\n  For these reasons, and many others, I support full repeal of this \nbill.\n  Again, there were four basic false assumptions that were built into \nthe legislation in the way it was drafted, which theoretically \ndemonstrate a savings of money through the adoption of the legislation, \nas the authors point out, but which actually result in not a savings \nbut an increase in the Federal budget deficit.\n  One of these has to do with the fact that taxes are collected for 10 \nyears, but costs only accrue over 6 years. Obviously, you are going to \nget some money that way. But after that first 6 years, you have to \ncount the costs as well as the revenue taken in.\n  Another is the inclusion of the so-called CLASS Act, which has been \ndescribed by some as a Ponzi scheme--actually, by the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee--because it collects all the money upfront and \ndoesn't pay out any benefits. Once you have to pay out benefits, there \nwill be a cost. That is a way to show that you are taking in money and \nyou are not spending it. But it is a dishonest way to write the bill.\n  Third, the way the cost of Medicare was calculated. The $500 billion \nsavings is not a savings at all but rather goes to pay for other parts \nof the bill. It doesn't help Medicare at all. It only works if, as the \nCongressional Budget Office said, Congress actually follows up with the \ncuts to hospitals and physicians, which nobody believes Congress would \nhave the courage to do.\n  Finally, there are the subsidies and exchanges calculations, which, \nas I pointed out in these comments, are woefully understated, as a \nresult of which it is likely we will have a significant budget deficit \nrather than a savings as a result of this legislation.\n  In fact, repeal of the bill is going to save taxpayers money. The \nlegislation is what costs money. Think about this: How can you cover an \nadditional 30 million people--or however many will be covered by this--\nwithout increasing costs? It can't be done. It would not be done under \nthis legislation. In addition to the reason I talked about yesterday--\nthe cost of Medicaid to the States--and the two points here today and \nthe fact that these waivers are being granted in a discriminatory way \nonly demonstrates that the underlying bill is not a good idea and that \nthe cost calculations are way off.\n  I hope my colleagues will take this opportunity to follow the advice \nof the American people and vote to repeal ObamaCare.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we, unfortunately, are in a period where \nwe are going to be redebating health care reform. We had long debates \non health care reform in the last couple years. I cannot think of \nlegislation that has occupied so much time in this body, as well as the \nother body. But, regrettably, we are going to redebate health care \nreform, even though legislation was passed last year, and even though \nthe legislation was signed by the President. The law is enacted. \nNevertheless, this body, regrettably, is going to spend, it looks like, \na lot of time redebating health care reform. Why? Basically, because \nthe other side of the aisle wants to do so--wants to not admit health \ncare reform is the law of the land. It wants to repeal it.\n  The other side knows there are not sufficient votes to repeal health \ncare reform. That is a well-known fact. The other side knows and those \nwho have covered health care debate reform know the votes are not \nthere. It is the law of the land, signed last year, and it will remain \nthe law of the land.\n  So then, you might ask, if it is the law of the land today and if \neverybody knows Congress will not repeal health care reform, why in the \nworld are we going to debate this for another who\n\n[[Page S440]]\n\nknows how many weeks, months or maybe even years? To be honest, I think \nit is because the other side thinks--and I will pick the charitable \nexplanation first. They don't like health care reform, for whatever \nreason, even though I strongly disagree with their reasons. But in \naddition to that, they think it is a political issue. They think they \ncan score political points by mentioning points which, in the main, are \nnot accurate but say them anyway, and they will say it over and over, \nand unless those points are refuted or those myths are busted, many of \nthe American people will start to believe some of that stuff.\n  There is another reason, which is a bit regrettable, and that is \nbecause there have been lawsuits filed in Federal district courts \naround the country, alleging that the law is unconstitutional--the \nhealth care law. It looks like those decisions will eventually make \ntheir way up to the Supreme Court of the United States, and I expect \nthe Supreme Court will not rule for, I don't know, maybe 1 year, which \nmeans we will further debate health care reform, waiting to see the \noutcome of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I heard one that I think is a very ill-advised argument a few minutes \nago, which is that because the Supreme Court has not yet decided on the \nconstitutionality of health care reform, we should, in effect, pass a \nmoratorium. We should forget the provisions of the law because we don't \nknow how the Court will rule.\n  That is one of the most specious and inadvisable arguments I have \nheard in a long time. That, in effect, means that whenever any law is \npassed and there is a lawsuit filed, that law is invalid because the \nsuit is filed. If we are to follow that line of reasoning, then anytime \nwe enact a law, anybody who doesn't like it could rush off and file a \nlawsuit, and that would mean we don't follow the law. I think the \nbetter course, by far, is to assume the law is the law of the land, \nuntil it is overturned on a statutory basis or a constitutional basis. \nThat is the way we should operate.\n  The Senator who suggested, about one-half hour ago, that we should \nenact a moratorium, in effect, I think should rethink her position. If \nshe wants that to be the precedent, I think she would recognize that \npretty soon the country could not function because anybody could file a \nlawsuit on maybe something passed 10 years ago. They could say: I don't \nlike that law, so I will file a lawsuit. Following the Senator's line \nof reasoning, we can't enforce that law because somebody doesn't like \nit. That makes no sense.\n  One of the myths that has been discussed many times, and as was said \nby the previous speaker in his argument for repeal of health care \nreform, is that repeal will save money. He thinks the health care bill \nadds to the deficit.\n  You and I have been around here long enough, Madam President. We have \nlived long enough to know that anybody can come up with any set of \nfigures or statistics that he or she wants. That is a fact of life. So \nif somebody asserts this and that, I think it is wise to see what that \nperson's authority is. Who says that? Where does that come from? Who \nverifies or validates that? We well know there is one organization that \nhas studied health care reform and has concluded that health care \nreform saves, I think, about $240 billion; it reduces the deficit by \n$240 billion in the first 10 years, and it reduces the deficit by north \nof $1 trillion in the next 10 years. That is the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  The CBO, I remind my colleagues--and for anybody listening--is a \nnonpartisan, professional organization that analyzes legislation for \nboth Republicans and Democrats for the House and the Senate. They are a \nvery professional outfit. They work very hard. No one has ever even \nhinted that this outfit, the Congressional Budget Office, is \nunprofessional or that it has a partisan bias. Nobody has suggested \nthat. Everybody knows they work very hard and do the best they can, \nunder difficult circumstances--I say ``difficult'' because it is \ndifficult to predict the future, to know exactly how any request they \nare given will actually score. It is a complicated process. You have to \nbuild models. It takes a long time to build a model and to know what \ngoes into the model.\n  I wish to make it very clear to anybody listening that repeal of the \nhealth care law will actually increase the deficit by about $240 \nbillion over 10 years and increase the deficit by over $1 trillion in \nthe next 10 years. That is what the CBO says. That is the organization \nthat all Members of Congress must live by. Different Members of \nCongress might have different points of view. They may belong to some \ndifferent organization--very liberal or very conservative--that has an \nax to grind, and they can come up with some other figure. But they \nusually have an ax to grind, a bias they want to perpetuate.\n  The one arbiter in the middle, which is professional, the one \norganization nobody has ever accused of being partisan or \nunprofessional is the CBO. They conclude, again--and they have written \nletters to us in the Congress--that repeal would essentially add about \n$\\1/4\\ billion to the deficit over 10 years. It would add; that is what \nrepeal would do. It will add to the deficit over $1 trillion in the \nnext 10 years.\n  That should end the argument right there because it is the one \nneutral professional organization that has looked at this. Other \norganizations can have their points of view, but the one that is \nprofessional, the CBO, has ruled, and we have to go by those numbers \nanyway in passing legislation here. That should be the end of the \nargument. That has been settled. That is what the effect of repeal \nwould be. That is it, as anybody knows when he or she is spouting off \nnumbers that are not the CBO's but some other organization--I don't \nknow which--maybe Heritage or some other organization. First of all, \nthey are not neutral. They are not unbiased. Second, we can't go by \nthose numbers anyway under the rules of the Senate. So it is kind of \nsilly, frankly. They may be scare tactics. That is one of the scare \ntactics used on this floor to try to score political points, but it is \ninaccurate. It is just plain simply inaccurate.\n\n  Now, a couple of other points. What do we spend on health care in \nAmerica today all together? We spend about $2\\1/2\\ trillion a year on \nhealth care, we Americans do. About half of that is public--that is \nMedicare, Medicaid, children's health insurance--and about half of that \nis private--the commercial insurance industry. That is the American \nway. That was the division before health care reform was enacted.\n  What is the division after health care reform was enacted? It is \nabout the same. It is about 50-50. So this is no government takeover. \nThis is no government takeover. It is still about the same. Maybe it is \na percentage point or so different, I don't know, but it basically is \nthe same. There is no government takeover. Half of it is still private \ncommercial insurance, as it always has been.\n  Also, in America we spend much more per person on health care than \nthe next most expensive country. I don't know the exact number. I think \nit is 50 percent, 60 percent more per person on health care than the \nnext most expensive country, but we are not 50 percent to 60 percent \nmore healthy per person than the next most expensive country.\n  In fact, all the international health care data ranked us pretty low. \nWe are not No. 1; we are not No. 2 in health care. We are way down \nthere. I have seen statistics--I haven't looked at it recently--that \nshow us being maybe 14th and 20th in terms of health. Our infant \nmortality rate is much higher than many countries. Our death rate is \nhigher than many countries. I don't know about our diabetes rate, but I \nexpect that is high compared to other countries, and maybe cardiac and \nother chronic care is high compared to other countries. But we are not \nNo. 1 in terms of health care. We are No. 1 in per capita cost of \nhealth care.\n  So I would think we should begin to reduce the rate of growth of \nhealth care expenditures in our country, and that is what this \nlegislation does. It starts to reduce the rate of growth of health care \ncosts in this country. That is probably why the Congressional Budget \nOffice reaches the conclusion that it actually reduces the deficit by \n$\\1/4\\ trillion over 10. It is probably why the Congressional Budget \nOffice says it reduces the deficit over $1 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. And it is probably also why the Congressional Budget Office says \nthat compared with prior law, I think it is 90 percent of Americans' \npremiums will be lower--90 percent of people's premiums will be lower.\n\n[[Page S441]]\n\n  Again, that is the Congressional Budget Office. That is a neutral \norganization. They do the best they can. They are professionals. Some \nMembers of Congress criticize them because they do not come to the \nconclusions they like. Other Members of Congress criticize the CBO \nbecause the CBO doesn't come up with the conclusions they like. It is \ntough what they do, but they have always been praised for doing the \nbest job they can, and they have never been criticized for any \npartisanship or unprofessionalism. They are a very good outfit.\n  I have had my problems with the head of CBO, Mr. Elmendorf. I have \ntalked to him many times on the phone. Most of the time it is saying: \nCan't you get your numbers to us more quickly? Why does it take so \nlong?\n  He does his best. He is very professional. He says: Senator, I am \njust doing the best I can. And I know he is, but still I am a little \nfrustrated, but I know he is, and I think he does a pretty decent job.\n  Now, you might ask: Why are American health care costs so high? Why \nis that? Why are American health care costs so high? Well, there are a \nlot of reasons for that. Essentially, it is waste. It comes down to \nwaste. There is a lot of waste in the American system, and this \nlegislation, among other things, is designed to root out a lot of the \nwaste.\n  What is some of the waste? I am not going to go into great detail, \nbut I am struck with an article written by Dr. Guandi on June 1, 2009, \nin the New Yorker magazine comparing El Paso, TX, with McCallum, TX. \nWhat conclusion did he reach? This is an article that many in the \nhealth care industry cite because most people think this fellow got the \nnub of the issue right.\n  Health care costs in El Paso are about half per person as compared to \nhealth care costs in McCallum, TX. They are both border towns so it has \nbeen adjusted for immigration and so forth. The outcomes in El Paso are \nhigher. People do better in El Paso than they do in McCallum, TX.\n  Why, one might ask. The basic conclusion of this article is that it \nis because of the way we in America reimburse doctors and hospitals and \nproviders. It is a way which allows a culture in a community to spend a \nlot of dollars on health care, if it wants to, and it is a way it \nallows a culture in a community to spend fewer dollars and focus more \non a patient, if it wants to. That is the culture of a community. That \nis because we pay providers in America; that is, doctors, hospitals, \nthe pharmaceutical companies, medical equipment manufacturers, and so \nforth, on the basis of quantity and volume, not on the basis of \nquality.\n  So there is a bias in the system. Doctors want to do the right thing, \nbut there is a bias for a doctor to order an extra procedure. There is \na bias to order an extra drug for this or that. There is a bias to get \nthis new equipment, and I might say, too, though it is awfully \ntechnical, but when we reimburse hospitals there is something called \nDRGs, the DRG purp, and it is according to procedure in a hospital, but \nit does not include the medical equipment. So there is no real fix on \nwhat is the cost of that medical equipment. So the medical equipment \nmanufacturers can charge virtually what they want, and they charge a \nlot.\n  We have read lots of stories about how you can go to Walmart and get \nthe same little small whatever it is for about one-tenth of the cost \nthat a hospital is going to charge, and it is because the providers are \npurchasing through DRGs. That is an example of a lot of the waste that \noccurs in the system.\n  Let me give another example. I think there are excessive procedures \nin America. You can do a lot with anecdotes, but this is one that I \nthink gives some indication of one of the problems we face in America.\n  I know a doctor, he is a neurosurgeon, and a very reputable, very \ngood one. He said to me: Max, you know, there is another neurosurgeon \ngroup that wanted me to join their practice. So I went to talk to them. \nWe talked a while. I have my own practice, and they have their \npractice. After a while, the negotiations kind of cooled a little bit. \nWhy? It turned out the group who was seeking to have my friend join \nthem did an audit on my friend's neurosurgical practice, and it was \nthat audit which kind of cooled the ardor of the group having my friend \njoin them. Why? Well, the group said: Our hit rate is 2 to 1, and your \nhit rate is only 20 to 1.\n  Those were the exact words they used--``hit rate.'' What does that \nmean? That means in the practice of the several neurosurgeons, for \nevery two patients they see, they perform one procedure. They have a \nhit rate of 2 to 1. My friend's hit rate is 20 to 1. For every 20 \npatients he sees, he performs 1 procedure. Those doctors in that group \nlove procedures. They want to do everything under the Sun. You have a \nback pain, it is an operation, a procedure, and all that; whereas, \noften you don't have to have the most expensive procedures.\n  But our system in America, because it compensates doctors and \nhospitals on the basis of volume and quantity, has a bias toward \nexcessive procedures. That is one reason we have waste in America \ntoday. Nobody disputes that. It is one reason we have waste in America \ntoday.\n  Something else. There is something called the Atlas study by a guy \nnamed Jack Wennberg. This is from a few years ago. He looked at health \ncare costs across the country, and what did he conclude? By the way, \nthis study has not been refuted in any significant way over the years. \nHe concluded basically--and I am exaggerating now--if a person lives, \nsay, in a Wheat Belt State, say Montana, the Dakotas, or the Northern \nPlain States, that person's health care costs per person are roughly \none-half of what they would be if that person were in a Sun Belt \nState--you know, Miami, Denver, Los Angeles, Phoenix, or Dallas. The \noutcomes in the Wheat Belt States versus the Sun Belt States are \nbetter. People have better outcomes; that is, they are cured better, \nfaster than are people in the Sun Belt States where the cost is twice \nas much per person.\n\n  Well, you might ask, why is that? The reason is because, basically, \nit is supply driven; that is, in the South there are a lot more doctors \nper person. There are a lot more hospitals per person. People like to \nlive in the South. They like the sunshine weather. When you have more \ndoctors and more hospitals, that is supply driven, and that tends to \npush up costs because those doctors and those hospitals want to do \nthings. They want to order procedures for their patients, to make them \nworthwhile, and that is what happens.\n  Now, most doctors around the country, including the South, are good \ndoctors. They want to do the right thing. But I can tell you, I have \nrun into individuals--one cataract surgeon, an ophthalmologist, told \nme--and I couldn't believe it because he was very upset--he was only \ngetting paid $2 million a year. Basically, he had people come in and \nrotated people in his office to do more cataract procedures--more \ncataract--and he was upset that he was only getting paid $2 million a \nyear.\n  So this health care bill is trying to address that basic problem, and \nit is called health care delivery reform. We are going to move slowly \ntoward reimbursing doctors and hospitals a little more on the basis of \nquality as opposed to quantity. It is hard to measure quality. How do \nwe measure quality? It is hard, very hard. But there are some \nprovisions in this legislation--which have been criticized by people \nunfairly--designed to help both the doctor and the patient have a \nbetter idea of what the right procedure is and how to get the highest \nquality health care. That is what it is designed to do. There are lots \nof names for it--bundling, ACOs, and all kinds of things--but that is \nthe whole purpose of it.\n  The key is this: It is not at all intended to tell the doctor or the \npatient what to do, as has been claimed. It is not that at all. Rather, \nit is just the opposite. It is to help the doctor and the hospital have \nbetter, more information so the doctor and the patient can decide for \nthemselves what procedures should next be performed or not. It is more \ninformation to the patient, it is more information to the doctor so the \npatient and the doctor can make their own decision.\n  There are implications by some on the other side of the aisle that \nthis legislation destroys or significantly undermines the doctor-\npatient relationship. There is not a whit of truth to that. It is just \nthe opposite. It helps with information to the doctors and information \nto the patients so they are\n\n[[Page S442]]\n\nin a lot better position to know what they should and should not do.\n  I have talked to a lot of doctors. They want to learn more. Right \nnow, the drug rep comes into their office and pedals this drug, and the \ndoctor wonders: Gee, is this the right drug? We are trying to get a \nlittle more objective source of information so that the doctor and the \nhospital and the patient have better information.\n  Let me go back to the earlier point. I mentioned that health care \ncosts, according to the Dartmouth study, are much lower in the Northern \nHigh Plains States than the Southern States. The Congressional Budget \nOffice--people don't like this because it is the Congressional Budget \nOffice. People on one side of the aisle may not like it because it is \nthe Congressional Budget Office. But they concluded that if the entire \ncountry's health care system were applied, nationwide, in the way that \nit is applied in Wheat Belt States; that is, Montana and other Northern \nHigh Plains States, the cost of health care in America would be reduced \nby 29 percent. Remember, the outcomes in the Wheat Belt States are \nbetter than are the outcomes in the Sun Belt States.\n  I said earlier that we spend $2.5 trillion on health care. Thirty \npercent of $2.5 trillion is a lot of money. What is that--north of $800 \nbillion a year? I do not stand here to say we are going to save all \nthat money, but I am saying that is some indication of some of the \nwaste that occurs in the current system. Others will say there is waste \nbecause too many doctors have to practice defensive medicine. I do not \ndeny that. I think too many docs do have to practice defensive \nmedicine, and that has to be addressed. But that is waste. That, by and \nlarge, is waste. It must be addressed.\n  I know there are other Senators who wish to speak, but there are a \ncouple of points I want to make.\n  Preexisting conditions is really a big deal. In my State of Montana, \nabout 425,000 people have preexisting conditions. That is nearly half \nthe population. That means that without health care reform, most of \nthose 425,000 would not get quality health insurance. They would not \nget health insurance--certainly not quality health insurance. They may \nget it, but they will have to pay too much in premiums to get coverage.\n  This legislation moves us toward that day where a health insurance \ncompany cannot deny coverage based on preexisting conditions. We have \nalready done it for kids. We have a pool for kids. In a couple of \nyears, all Americans will be able to get quality health insurance. They \nwill not be denied coverage based upon preexisting conditions.\n  What is the consequence today of denial based on preexisting \nconditions? Part of it is people do not have health insurance, but also \nit is this: In my State of Montana--this is true in all States--a lot \nof people go to the emergency room. They go to the doctor--they get hit \nby a truck or get cancer--and they don't have insurance. If you don't \nhave insurance, what do you do? You go to the ER, that is what you do. \nYou have a good ER doc, and he or she takes care of you, and you see \nanother doc.\n  If you can't pay the hospital bill because you don't have insurance, \nwhat happens? You get the care. But the cost of the doc, the ER doc, \nand the other physicians and the drugs in the hospital--somebody has to \npay for it. So who pays? All the rest of us who have health insurance, \nwe pay. It is all transferred to the rest of us who pay. Our health \ncare bills, our premiums, are higher today because of the people who do \nnot have health insurance. It is called uncompensated care. In Montana, \nthe bill is about $2,100 a year--the premium in Montana, $2,100, family \nhealth care premium in Montana, due to uncompensated care. If people \nhad health insurance, if the whole country had health insurance, we \nwould not have that cost transfer to the rest of us who have to pay for \nyou.\n  Then you say: Gee, how do you get those other people to pay for \nhealth insurance? That is one of the questions that comes up in this \nbill. It is an honest question. This bill says two things. People must \nhave health insurance. They can do two things. If they are poor, they \ncan go to Medicaid. That is expanded a little bit. Then there are \nissues such as, that costs too much, aren't States having to pay big \nbills, and so forth. The answer is, there is no increase in bills to \nthe States for 3 years. Then the match is reduced from 100 percent down \na little bit--that is after several years--which is much higher in \nFederal dollars than it is for other Medicaid. We can have that \ndiscussion and figure out ways to help States legitimately needing \nhelp. But still it is more insurance for people because if they need \nhealth care, those bills are not passed on to the rest of us.\n  The other way is to give assistance to people who cannot afford \nhealth insurance. It is through a rebate in the Tax Code. That is where \na lot of the money goes. But it is clear that some people who would \nhave too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to buy \nhealth insurance are going to need some assistance, so this legislation \nis designed to help those people get assistance, and the wealthier they \nare, the less assistance they get. Some say that is why this bill costs \nso much.\n  I think it is important to remind people here that according to the \nCongressional Budget Office--again, the neutral group that we trust. \nNobody questions their integrity. It says this bill does not cost a \nthin dime. A lot of people like to say it is $1 trillion. It does cost \n$1 trillion, but it raises $1 trillion, so on that basis it doesn't \ncost anything. The dollars are raised because the rates we pay \nproviders are cut back a little bit. There are also some fees on some \nof the providers. That is true. That is true. That is how this bill is \npaid for.\n  But let's remember, almost all those providers, all those people who \nare paying a little higher taxes, and all those groups whose \nreimbursement rate is a little lower favored the bill. They are in \nfavor of it. You might ask, why in the world do they favor this bill? \nThe answer is, because more people have insurance. If more people have \ninsurance, their margins might drop a little, but their volume will \nincrease. They can make money. They figure they are going to make money \nunder health insurance reform. Hospitals, pharmaceutical, medical \nequipment manufacturers, most of the insurance industry, you name it, \nthey think they can make some money.\n  I don't want to take too much of my colleagues' time here, although I \ndo have one other point, and that is Medicare. It is stated on this \nfloor: This hurts Medicare. It takes money out of Medicare. That is a \nred herring--a red herring in the sense that somebody says something \nthat on the face of it is true, but it is irrelevant to the main point. \nIt is true that reimbursement rates to providers is a little lower, but \nit is also true that this legislation extends the life of the Medicare \ntrust fund by about 120 years. The trust fund under this legislation is \nextended. The life of the trust fund is extended by 12 years compared \nto what it would be before this law was enacted. Some people want to \nrepeal that. They want to cut back the life of the Medicare trust fund.\n  What else do they want to cut back with repeal? Repeal gives many \nseniors--4 million Americans I think is the number--a drug benefit in \nthe doughnut hole of $250 a year. In my State of Montana, it is 9,000 \nMontanans. After a period of time, that doughnut hole will be closed, \nso seniors will not have to pay for excessive costs on prescription \ndrugs. Repeal would repeal that. Repeal would say: Oh, all you seniors, \n4 million seniors, we are going to send you a $250 bill. We want you to \npay $250, in effect, for drugs. We don't want you to get any break. \nThat is what repeal does. I don't think Americans want health care \nreform repealed--certainly those 4 million seniors do not want it \nrepealed.\n  I have a lot to say. I will finish up. All I ask is this. We are \ngoing to have this debate, regrettably, for about a year until the \nSupreme Court finally decides. I ask that we all stick with the facts. \nStick with the facts and don't indulge in histrionics, scare tactics, \nand so forth. ``Just get the facts, ma'am,'' because facts generally \ncontrol. You can't change facts. The fact is, what does CBO say? There \nare lots of facts here. I urge us to stick with the facts. We could \nargue what they mean, but let's stick with the facts. Let's not \nmanufacture the facts. You can't manufacture facts and have a good-\nfaith debate. I assume this is going to be a\n\n[[Page S443]]\n\ngood-faith debate, so let's stick with the facts.\n  I have one more small thing. A person once stood here years ago in \nthe Senate--it was Mike Mansfield from Montana. He was majority leader \nin the Senate for 17 years. No other leader served for as many years as \nMike Mansfield. I ran across a statement by him which he gave in 1989 \nto a bunch of wide-eyed students. I can't remember exactly what he \nsaid, but the main point of it is this--he was a very reasonable guy, \nrevered in Montana--in all efforts to be constructive, you have to \nlisten. Listen very well, very closely to the other person's point of \nview. He went on to say: You are not always right. They are not always \nwrong. The more you listen and the more they listen, you will see where \nyou are not right and you will see where they are not wrong. You also \nsee where you are right and they are wrong. But you have to listen to \ntry to find that common ground where somebody is right and somebody is \nnot right in an objective sense of the term and then use that \ninformation constructively and with knowledge and with good faith.\n  I ask all of us to do just that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, Senator Johanns be allowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I think any American who heard the \nexplanation of what ObamaCare does for Americans will realize that the \ncomplexity of the health care system, the importance of the patient-\nphysician relationship cannot be managed from the Federal level. I had \ndifficulty really determining exactly what was being said there.\n  I do want to talk about health care, but before I do, I need to make \na couple of comments about the FAA perimeter rule that is part of the \ndiscussion to which the health care amendment will be attached.\n  The perimeter rule is an antiquated policy adopted in the 1960s that \nprohibits aircraft flying in and out of Reagan National originating or \ndeparting anywhere beyond an arbitrary 1,250-mile limit. Congress \nimposed this limitation five decades ago in an attempt to help the \nDulles Airport in Virginia when it was first being opened. The \nrationale was that the best way to ensure growth at Dulles was to limit \nthe growth at National Airport, and so, by federal fiat, a short-haul \nairport was created at National and a long-haul airport created at \nDulles. At the time, Congress assumed government could create an \nefficient aviation system and the government would best decide prices, \nroutes, and schedules.\n  The perimeter rule is outdated today. Americans out West want to fly \ndirectly into downtown DC. Travelers from downtown DC do not want to go \nto Dulles to fly to the west coast. The government needs to do away \nwith the perimeter rule, just as it did with the regulation of the \naviation system long ago.\n  Dulles is now an international airport and can easily compete with \nNational or any other airport in the country. The Federal \ntransportation policy should be based on competition and consumer need, \nbut the existing perimeter rule is denying consumers choice in air \ntravel and frustrating market forces that could accommodate these \nconsumers.\n  Consumer choices in the markets should govern the schedule and \nflights out of Reagan National, not the Federal Government.\n  This week, President Obama gave a speech about health care--or \nactually I guess it was last week now. The speech was at a fancy hotel \nhere in Washington. He told jokes to make everyone laugh and sad \nstories to endear his audience further to his cause.\n  The President said, as he has many times before, his law will lower \nthe cost of health care. President Obama knows how to give a good \nspeech. He also knows how to tell it like it isn't. While President \nObama was busy selling his policies on the stump, others were busy \nanalyzing the real effects of his health care law. It is not limiting \ncost.\n  We have heard some of the figures given by the Democrats here from \nthe Congressional Budget Office. But we have to expose that they are \nplaying with numbers. If you tell the Congressional Budget Office to \ntake $500 billion from Medicare, which is already bankrupt and cannot \npay doctors to see patients, you take $500 billion and call that \n``savings'' that are created by ObamaCare, that is part of where they \nget their money. The other part is to raise taxes on a lot of health \ncare products and services and call that new revenue creating by \nObamaCare.\n  Any thinking American knows you cannot create a trillion-dollar new \nhealth care entitlement and it actually saves us money. When the \nCongressional Budget Office looks at our whole health care spending at \nthe Federal level, it tells us, without all of those funny assumptions, \nthat the Federal spending on health care is going to double over the \nnext 10 years. That is not saving us money.\n  This is the same office that found, without these funny assumptions, \nthat ObamaCare would cause premiums to rise an average of $2,100 per \nyear for families in the individual market. That is telling it like it \nis.\n  It was not that long ago that some of the country's largest insurance \ncarriers sent a letter to their enrollees warning them that ObamaCare \nwas going to drive up the cost of premiums. They told it like it is. \nThe Obama administration did not want this information to get out. So \nthe Department of Health and Human Services sent a letter back to the \ninsurance carriers saying their claims were not true, and HHS would \nhave zero tolerance for this type of misinformation. They want to keep \non telling it like it isn't.\n  Richard Foster, the Chief Actuary for Medicare, an independent \neconomic expert, recently testified before the House Budget Committee. \nHe was asked if it was true or false that Obama's health care bill \nwould lower cost. A true-or-false question. He said: I would say false \nmore than true. He told it like it is. False more than true is a very \npolite way of saying no, it will not lower health care costs. That \nclaim is false.\n  President Obama also promised that if you would like to keep your \nhealth care plan, you can keep it. Richard Foster was also asked if \nthose who liked their health care plans would be able to keep their \ncoverage. He said: Not true in all cases.\n  It certainly is not true if you live in one of the 34 States where \nhealth insurance insurers stop selling child-only policies. It is not \ntrue if you live in Colorado and have Aetna Insurance. Politico \nreported Monday evening that the health insurance carrier was pulling \nout of the individual markets. Many Americans will lose their health \nplans with ObamaCare.\n  But you can keep your health care plan if your union or company got \none of the 733 ObamaCare waivers so far. The waivers cover almost 2.2 \nmillion people. You can get your health care or you can keep it if you \nare a member of the six chapters of the Service Employees International \nUnion which got waivers, and whose political action committee spent \nmore than $27 million helping Barack Obama get elected, or if you are \none of the 8,000 members of the United Food and Commercial Workers \nUnion that got waivers. Their PAC has spent millions helping Barack \nObama and Democrats get elected.\n  These are the unions that supported cramming ObamaCare down the \nthroats of the rest of America. Even though labor unions represent less \nthan 7 percent of the private workforce, they have received 40 percent \nof the waivers. They do not want the health care they want other \nAmericans to have to accept. Most Americans do not play these political \ngames. They do not have lobbyists and PACs. But I think they should all \nget a waiver too.\n  I think we should name this repeal bill that we will vote on today \nthe Great American Waiver. Every Republican in the Senate is committed \nto repealing this bill. Every American gets a waiver when we repeal \nthis bill. Soon, we will have a vote to repeal ObamaCare here in the \nSenate. I strongly urge my colleagues to follow the House in repealing \nit and returning it to the sender in the White House.\n  I am aware the President currently in the White House might want to \nveto our repeal. There is, however, going to be a Presidential election \nin 2012, and this health care bill, this health care\n\n[[Page S444]]\n\nlaw, is going to be a defining issue in that election. 2012 is 2 years \nbefore the law will fully be implemented. We can get a supermajority to \noverturn his veto in the next election or we can get a new President \nwho will support its repeal. I think both outcomes are possible. Let's \nall go on record now showing where we stand. I suspect there are some \nDemocrats who might want to repeal this law before voters repeal them. \nThe question is, do they have the courage to break with their party?\n  For now, the President wants us to think his law can be fixed by \nmodifying it slightly. It cannot be fixed. Trying to fix it with a few \ngood ideas is like pouring a few glasses of fresh water into a polluted \nriver. ObamaCare cannot be fixed by tinkering with its provisions, \nbecause the basic premise is flawed.\n  This law is actively creating a government-controlled system that \nrelies on high taxes, less choices, and bureaucrats making health care \ndecisions for Americans. This is exactly what we are opposed to and why \nwe insist on a full repeal. A recent analysis by the Center for Health \nTransformation found it will give the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices 1,968 new powers. Last year the Joint Economic Committee found \nthat ObamaCare created 159 new Federal programs and bureaucracies to \nmake decisions that should be made between patients and their doctors.\n  If the Democrats and Federal bureaucrats are permitted to control our \nhealth care system, our Tax Code will look simple by comparison. Worst \nof all, in the rush to pass this legislation, none of its proponents \ncared if it was unconstitutional. They were not going to let the \nConstitution get in the way of their health care takeover. Even now, \nwhen asked about the constitutionality of the bill, the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services has said: I am leaving those arguments to our \nlegal team from the Department of Justice.\n  So far their legal team is losing. Two judges have told it like it \nis. ObamaCare has been ruled unconstitutional by judges in Virginia and \nFlorida. The Virginia court held that the individual mandate requiring \nevery American to purchase government-approved health insurance was \nunconstitutional. The Florida court ruled the entire bill was \nunconstitutional because of the individual mandate included in it. In \nhis decision handed down on Monday, Florida District Judge Roger Vinson \ncompared the law to a finely crafted watch in which one of the pieces \nis defective and must be removed.\n  But what happens to ObamaCare when you remove that one piece, which \nis clearly unconstitutional? The rest of the law falls to pieces--as \nthe judge might say: The watch will not work. Vinson wrote: ``I must \nconclude that the individual mandate and the remaining provisions are \nall inextricably bound together in purpose and must stand or fall as a \nsingle unit.''\n  An unconstitutional law that touches the most important personal \ndecisions Americans ever make must not stand. We must repeal the bill \nin its entirety. Because at the very heart of it, which makes all of \nthe other parts work, that very heart, that individual mandate, \nviolates the highest law of our land.\n  It is already failing Americans. Health care costs and premiums are \ngoing up, despite the false assumptions we hear on the other side. \nChoices and consumer control over the health care system are going \ndown. By continuing to follow a failing plan, the government is \nplanning to allow our health care system to fail.\n  Obama's broken promises are going to create a broken future for our \ncountry. If we do not fully repeal this bill, it is going to add nearly \nhalf a trillion dollars in new health care taxes and raise the Federal \nbudget deficit by more than $500 billion in the next 10 years, and \nnearly $1.5 trillion in the next decade.\n  Yet the President says this is going to save us money. We know this \nso-called Affordable Health Care Act for America does not live up to \nits label. We must repeal this bill and implement commonsense solutions \nthat will lower the cost of health care for consumers and make health \ninsurance available to everyone, even with preexisting conditions.\n  We should allow Americans to choose affordable plans across State \nlines, and we should end frivolous lawsuits that drive up costs, and \ngive equitable tax treatment to those who do not get insurance from \ntheir employer. ObamaCare does none of this. The facts and figures tell \nit like it is. President Obama tells it like it isn't. It is time for \nCongress to tell it like it is and repeal ObamaCare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I had an opportunity during the comments \nof my colleague Senator DeMint to sit here and listen to those. I wish \nto start my comments today by complimenting Senator DeMint. Those were \nvery thoughtful comments.\n  Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle are now \nacknowledging the problems with the health care law. It was a \nfascinating process, last September and October as we were leading up \nto the November elections, to see Members running to be on the other \nside of the aisle and saying, well, I would have done this differently, \nand if I get there, I will do that differently.\n  One such provision designated for repair is my legislation to repeal \nthe 1099 reporting mandate that is in the legislation. To be clear, I \nhave never argued that that was the start of the unraveling of the \nhealth care bill. I do not believe that for a moment. What I would say \nis this: That provision should have never been in the health care law.\n  I am very pleased to report today that that legislation, after two \nattempts to try to get it repealed, now has the support, bipartisan \nsupport, of 61 Senators. The President mentioned repealing this \nprovision in the State of the Union Address.\n  While there is bipartisan agreement on this provision that it needs \nto be taken out and repealed, the rest of the 2,700-page bill is still \nbursting at the seams with flawed provision after flawed provision. \nMonths and months ago, as this bill was making its way forward, each \none of us individual Senators had an opportunity to decide: Can this \nbill be changed enough to be saved? The conclusion I reached is there \nwere no amendments that could change this bill enough that I could ever \nsupport it. It is fatally flawed and you cannot repair the problems.\n\n  The catch phrase these days--the catchy slogan--is that we will \nrepair this bill. Well, this bill is beyond repair. We cannot tinker \naround the edges. We cannot just kick the tires and put some air in \nthem. A good detailing job on this bill will not save it. Even a major \noverhaul cannot get this bill back on the road. It needs to go back to \nthe factory. This bill is a lemon. It is simply beyond repair. That is \nwhy it is important for all of us to support Senator McConnell's \namendment to repeal the health care bill in its entirety.\n  Let me start out and say what courts are now acknowledging: This is \nan unconstitutional piece of legislation. The underlying foundation of \nthe health care law is predicated on a false premise: that the \nConstitution somehow allows us--us, here in Congress--to demand of \nevery private citizen that they buy a government-approved product or \nface a penalty.\n  Let me repeat that. The premise of this legislation--the false \npremise, the unconstitutional premise--is that somehow we, as elected \nrepresentatives, possess the constitutional power to force every \nindividual in America to buy a government-mandated and approved product \nor face a fine. That is an unconstitutional premise.\n  Recently, this fundamental flaw was exposed by court rulings in \nVirginia and Florida. As a lawyer, I have read both of them, first word \nto last word. I just finished reading the Florida decision yesterday. \nThese courts, in thoughtful opinions, found that this so-called \nindividual mandate was simply unconstitutional.\n  Judge Vinson, in his Florida ruling, said:\n\n       If Congress can penalize a passive individual for failing \n     to engage in commerce, the enumeration of powers in the \n     Constitution would have been in vain for it would be \n     ``difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power'' and \n     we would have a Constitution in name only.\n\n  You see, according to Judge Vinson's ruling, the entire health care \nlaw is unconstitutional because it is predicated upon the individual \nmandate. President Obama has argued that. Members have argued that on \nthe floor. Now there is\n\n[[Page S445]]\n\nthis attempt to extricate from that argument, and it will not work.\n  The law will continue to be debated in other courtrooms, but I \nbelieve we are looking forward to a day when the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States says to Congress: You went too far. You went beyond the \nConstitution of this great Nation.\n  However, the health care law is flawed, even beyond this \ncongressional overreach, this unprecedented congressional overreach. \nThe health care law double counts dollars, threatens the health care \ninfrastructure of this great Nation, and adds more individuals to a \nsystem I am very familiar with as a former Governor: the broken \nMedicaid system.\n  There is not a Governor in America who would come before any hearing \nof Congress and argue that the Medicaid system is anything but broken.\n  This bill is also paid for by over $500 billion in tax increases and \nover $500 billion in real cuts to Medicare.\n  Regardless of the claims to the contrary, Medicare cuts simply cannot \nbe counted twice. They cannot simultaneously reduce the deficit, extend \nthe solvency of Medicare, and then pay for this open-ended entitlement.\n  Well, I am sure any American out there would see the fallacy of \ntrying to say to them: Well, you can spend the same dollar twice. You \ncan, on one hand, pay for your mortgage and, on the other hand, use the \nsame dollar to make the car payment. No American would believe that. \nYou see, only in Washington could you get away with such Enron-type \naccounting. It is simply budget hocus-pocus.\n  Even the administration's own CMS concludes that the law's Medicare \ncuts ``cannot be simultaneously used to finance other federal outlays . \n. . and to extend the trust fund.''\n  I have long made the assertion that if Congress makes reductions in \nthe Medicare Program, then those dollars need to stay in the Medicare \nProgram, to shore up a program that is running out of money, not to pay \nfor a new health care entitlement. Instead, here is what we end up \nwith. These cuts to Medicare are going to have long-term consequences \nto seniors' access to physician and health care services.\n  Let me focus on my own State for a moment. Nebraska home health \nagencies. Under this bill, in just 5 short years, two-thirds of our \nhome health agencies will be operating in the red.\n  Nebraska nursing facilities, already stretched to the limit, will \nhave to endure $93 million in cuts. Does anyone want to argue that is \nnot going to force the closing of nursing homes in Nebraska? Of course \nit will.\n  Hospitals and hospice--major reductions in funding. Mr. President, \n35,000 Nebraskans who like and receive the advantages of Medicare \nAdvantage are going to see reductions in their benefits.\n  If Nebraskans are going to endure these cuts, and others across the \ncountry do the same, they should at least have the security of knowing \nthat the sacrifice they are being asked to endure is going to improve \nthe Medicare Program.\n  If all the tax increases and all the Medicare cuts were not enough, \nthe law's projected cost completely ignores the $115 billion it will \ncost to implement the legislation.\n  Around here, billions of dollars are thrown around. We, all of a \nsudden in the last 2 years, added new words to our vocabulary, \n``trillions.'' A program is not big enough unless it has a trillion-\ndollar pricetag anymore. Well, let us remind ourselves that those are \nhard-earned dollars to somebody out there trying to make a living.\n  This is not about funding trillion-dollar programs. This is about \npoor individuals in this Nation who are struggling to get by, nearly 20 \npercent of whom are underemployed or completely unemployed.\n  All these hidden costs will drive up the pricetag even more for this \nill-advised statute. However, one of the most troubling aspects of this \nso-called reform is its massive expansion of Medicaid. It simply heaps \nmore unfunded mandates onto State budgets. As a former Governor, I do \nnot know how Governors are doing it these days. They are in a financial \nmeltdown, with few exceptions, and here we are simply heaping more \nunfunded mandates onto State budgets that are already crumbling.\n  It puts--get this--16 million more people into the most broken part \nof the health care system: Medicaid. I can attest to the challenge of \ntrying to provide quality health services for those on Medicaid today, \nnot even addressing the millions to be added. Even now, our offices are \nflooded with frustrated individuals completely unable to find someone \nto provide health care services to them due to the lack of \nparticipation in the Medicaid Program.\n  You see, the story is this: 40 percent of doctors do not take \nMedicaid patients. Why? They cannot afford to. Ask any doctor, any \nhospital administrator in America: Could you keep your office or your \nhospital open on Medicaid reimbursement, and they would laugh at you. \nThey would say: Absolutely not. We would go broke.\n  So what is the government's solution to that problem? Put 16 million \nmore people into a broken system. It is not because they do not want to \ntreat these patients, you see. They do. But the Medicaid reimbursement \nrates would drive them into bankruptcy.\n  So instead of dealing with that problem--a very serious problem in \nterms of access for poor people--what do we do? We burden our States \nwith additional costs with this legislation. We saddle them with little \nflexibility through maintenance of effort mandates and totally \ndisregard the big question of how all these new eligible individuals \never have a chance of finding care.\n  According to a recent study, the Medicaid expansion is going to cost \nNebraska between $458 million and $691 million over 10 years, depending \nupon participation rates.\n  More shocking is that almost one in five Nebraskans will now be \nforced on Medicaid--a system where we cannot find them care. We are not \nunique. This is the true story in every State in the United States.\n  The impact on this Medicaid expansion could be profound to many \nhospitals because Medicaid-eligible individuals who are unable to find \nprimary care--and there will be millions of them--will turn to the \nemergency ward for their care.\n  Recently, the Centers for Disease Control reported detailed \nstatistics on nationwide emergency room usage. While only 14.1 percent \nof all households in the United States had Medicaid coverage, Medicaid \npatients comprised more than one-quarter--25.2 percent--of all ER \nvisits nationwide.\n  This preliminary May CDC report confirmed that the uninsured do not \nvisit the ER the most often, which is contrary to the arguments made on \nthe very floor I am standing. This preliminary May CDC report confirmed \nthat the uninsured do not visit the ER the most often; patients with \nMedicaid do. Specifically, more than 30 percent of Medicaid patients \nunder 65 visited the ER at least once, compared to fewer than 20 \npercent of uninsured patients and those with private insurance.\n  An ER physician put it best:\n\n       High utilization (of the ER) is no surprise; many patients \n     have difficulty finding primary care providers who take \n     Medicaid, so the ER is the only alternative.\n\n  So what does this new law do to solve this problem? Nothing. It \nexacerbates and exaggerates and compounds the problem. I could go on \nand on because the flaws in the law are so abundant and so severe that \nit cannot operate.\n  Let me wrap up with this thought: The people of America deserve \nbetter than this effort. The people of America deserve something better \nthan an unconstitutional attempt to say the Federal Government knows \nbetter than you. No mechanic could get this jalopy running again. They \nwould just scratch their head and say: Haul it to the junkyard.\n  This health care bill is so fatally flawed, it cannot be fixed. The \nonly option, contrary to what happened 1 year ago, is to go back and, \nin a bipartisan way, work to build solutions to the health care \nchallenges, a step at a time, for once and for all; instead of \ncompounding problems, solve them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I hear the requests of people on the \nother side of the political aisle to repeal a health reform bill that \nhas been put in place, received majority support in the House and in \nthe Senate when developed. Now what we are witness to\n\n[[Page S446]]\n\nis that within a bill that is planned for the continued support for the \nFAA, which takes care of the conditions under which our aviation \nstructure works, there is an amendment put in here that says: We want \nto repeal, recall the health care bill, the health reform bill that was \nsigned into law by the President of the United States.\n  We have heard that there are challenges in court, but we hear also \nthat there are verifications in the courts that say this bill, this \nact, does appear to be constitutionally sound. I am listening, and my \nvantage point is that I grew up in a very poor working-class family \nwith all of the ills that follow poverty. I see America through that \nkind of a prism.\n  I see an America whose intention is to be fair, to take care of our \ncitizens, to provide them with services, to make sure we have military \nforces to protect us from enemies, to make sure we have labor standards \nthat try to make conditions healthy for working people so their health \nis protected as they perform their tasks. There is an implicit promise \nthat says we are going to educate those in the early years for sure \nwith a reasonable education. In other words, there is a distribution of \nthe assets this country of ours holds to which almost everyone is \nentitled to.\n  We are not talking about differences in income or differences in \npersonal material wealth--housing, et cetera--that somehow others don't \nhave. I am not talking about that. I am a capitalist. I came up the \ncapitalist ladder, working hard, and I will talk about that in a \nminute.\n  So when I listen to the rhetoric that is delivered here on a \ncontinuing basis about government interference in keeping people alive, \nkeeping people healthy--why should the government interfere with \npeople's chances to be overcome by illness or injury? I consider it an \noutrage that some of our colleagues want to repeal a law that is \ndesigned to improve the lives of millions of Americans.\n  I think the push to repeal health care reform is the worst kind of \nhypocrisy coming from this place and the other end of the Capitol--here \nwith 100 people and the other side with 435 people. There are those who \nhave voted not to have this health care reform in the first place, and \nnow they are jumping on the opportunity to repeal a law that is \ndesigned to help people's health, to help kids grow healthily, to help \nfamilies be able to maintain a degree of functioning when illness \nstrikes their family, to provide services that increase longevity to \nour people. I, for one, speak well for that effort.\n  It is so hypocritical to me because the Senators who are advocating \nrepeal have access to the best health plan in our country. They get to \nwalk down the hall to a clinic with a half dozen doctors, competent and \nskilled people. There are health care aides who work there, \nprofessionals, and all they have to do is go in there and say: Doc, I \nfeel something here or I feel something here or I have this swelling \nhere, and they get care. We pay for it; not a lot but we pay for it. \nBut it is available. It is available. It is the kind of perk, I will \ncall it, that people across this country would be astonished to see how \nwell we treat those who make the laws in this country, those who have \nthe responsibility of taking care of our people, our constituents. They \nwould be astonished to see how easy it is to go into the clinic, and--\nyes, we will take you. You need some surgery and we will get you over \nto the hospital in short form and we are going to take care of this \nbefore your disease gets the better of you.\n  When people here--Senators, Congressmen--get sick, they just have to \nwalk down the hall to the Senate Physician's Office. They don't have to \nget in the car or anything like that. They don't know the worry or \nunderstand the worry that comes if medical bills overtake the \nopportunity to buy food or housing or even force people into \nbankruptcy.\n  Again, let me say this isn't simple rhetoric for me. I lived through \nthese conditions. Yet these people who are up for repeal are fighting \nto take away the lifeline the health care reform law has given to \nfamilies in need. I know firsthand what it is like when your family \ndoesn't have access to basic health care. I grew up in a family of \nmodest means in Paterson, NJ. It is a mill town. It was typically a \ncity that received immigrants on a regular basis. My father spent his \nshort life working in local silk mills, and he died of cancer at 43 \nyears of age when I was still a teenager. My mother was 37 when she \nbecame a widow.\n  I joined the Army. I enlisted in the Army. I attended college under \nthe GI bill. I was a soldier. I served in Europe during World War II.\n  As a consequence of the opportunity I had to get an education, I was \nable to join a couple of friends and start a company that is known \nacross the globe. The company is called ADP. We have more than 40,000 \npeople working around the world in more than 20 countries, three of us, \nfrom poor families. Two of them are brothers, and their father was a \nmill worker also. Because of the success I had in business, all my \nfamily had to do was worry about their good health and not back-\nbreaking medical bills. But I never forgot what it was like to see my \nmother working so hard behind the counter of the store to pay the \ndoctors, the pharmacies, the hospitals, to keep my father comfortable \nfor the 13 months he was in bed with cancer, robbing him of his life on \na daily basis.\n  That is why I was proud to vote for the historic health care reform \nlaw which is holding insurers more accountable and making our system \nmore sustainable.\n  I looked at the history of the health insurers because we see the \nhealth care bills constantly taking more of the GDP. But you wonder \nwhere the health care cost increases take place. I have looked at some \nof the companies. For instance, I took the year 2009. It was a tough \nyear for lots of people. Lots of bankruptcies, lots of foreclosures, \nlots of jobs lost in 2009.\n  CIGNA had profits of $1.4 billion 5 years earlier and about the same \nin 2009. The company's CEO got $18 million worth of salary, providing a \ncommodity service. Humana, in 5 years, went from $270 million worth of \nrevenues to $1.3 billion. The CEO got $6.5 million. United Health had a \nheck-of-a 5-year period. They started off with $2.4 billion worth of \nrevenues in 2004, and in 2009 it went to $3.8 billion. From $2.4 \nbillion to $3.8 billion, and the CEO got $9 million in salary, he got \nbig kickers at the end of the year. A company called WellPoint, in 2004 \nthey did $960 million worth of sales revenues. Five years later they \ndid $4.7 billion. The CEO got $13 million.\n  I look at that as we ponder where the money has gone to pay for \nhealth care in this country. So I see one place that a lot of it goes, \nand that is to the insurance companies.\n  Some of our colleagues want to recall this bill and remove the health \ncare protection from 30 million Americans--30 million people across \nthis country. Almost 10 percent of our population will lose health care \nif we repeal the bill that is now in place and is law. The fact is, \nrepealing the health care reform law would be an enormous step backward \nfor our country. It would hurt seniors, children, and small businesses, \nand our deficit would balloon, grow larger.\n  Repealing this law would raise drug costs for seniors by removing \nfrom them a 50-percent discount on drugs they purchase when they are in \nthe period of the doughnut hole. By the way, repeal of this law would \nserve to prevent us from totally closing that doughnut hole. Seniors \nacross the country, listen to the truth about what is being said: The \ndoughnut hole is going to be closed. It is roughly a $4,500 element in \npeople's income--or cost, rather.\n  This repeal would also give the biggest insurance companies more \npower over their patients to charge outrageous fees than ever before.\n  This means the insurers could once again reduce benefits, stop \ncoverage during a person's illness, and refuse to care for individuals \nand children stricken with preexisting conditions.\n  Repealing health care reform would also hurt young adults, who would \nno longer be able to stay on their parents' health plans until age 26. \nFor young adults--especially new college graduates facing a tough job \nmarket--staying on a parent's health insurance is the only reasonably \npriced insurance option available.\n  If health reform is repealed, small businesses will lose tax credits \nfor up to 35 percent of health insurance premium costs. It would \njeopardize the recent growth in the number of small\n\n[[Page S447]]\n\nbusinesses offering health insurance coverage to their employees.\n  This repeal effort is fiscally irresponsible because ending health \nreform would increase the deficit by at least $1 trillion when we are \nall looking at the deficit here and wondering what we can do to bring \nit under control. We cannot do it with the costs we have scheduled for \nhealth care.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much longer will he be?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. About 3 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. As a country, how could we repeal this law and then \nlook our children and grandchildren in the eye? We should be focused on \ngetting this critical jobs bill signed into law, not refighting last \nyear's partisan battles.\n  Make no mistake, Democrats are willing and eager to fix the parts of \nthe health care reform law that might need adjustment. I, for one, \nwould salute that kind of a review. But to repeal the entire law is an \nexample of outrageous overreach. Instead of meeting us halfway, our \ncolleagues on the Republican side are engaging in misguided political \nbattles. It is wrong, and we can't allow repeal of this law which is \nimproving the lives of millions of Americans.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona for permitting me a courteous \nextension of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, obviously we rise in support of the \namendment put forward by the Republican leader for repeal of the health \ncare bill. As we know, the House of Representatives has already acted \nin an overwhelming fashion. Neither the Senator from Wyoming nor I \nintend to go through all of the arguments we went through for nearly a \nyear here on the floor of the Senate. In the years I have been here, I \nhave never spent more time on any single issue, by far, than on the \nhealth care issue on the floor of the Senate.\n  One of the most important parts of this debate has been the overall \ncost--either savings or loss--if this legislation is repealed. Of \ncourse, the highly regarded Congressional Budget Office has determined \nthat there would be an overall increase in the cost of health care in \nAmerica if the bill were repealed. I think it is very important for us \nto recognize the valuable work the Congressional Budget Office does. \nThey are really one of the most important parts of the decisions we \nmake on legislation. But I think it is also very important to point out \nthat the Congressional Budget Office makes decisions directly related \nto the input and the parameters and the details of legislation they are \nsent. The Congressional Budget Office, most appropriately, does not \ndecide on policy; they are simply there as a budget office. So what I \nam saying is, garbage in, garbage out. If you are given a certain \ndatabase on which to make judgments of costs, then of course you are \ngoing to come out with basically predetermined results and analysis.\n  One of the numerous aspects or parts of the legislation that was not \ntaken into consideration by the CBO because of the way the legislation \nwas written is the so-called doc fix. The doc fix, as we all know, is \nin compliance with a reduction in Medicare payments to doctors that was \nmandated several years ago. Then we found out that doctors would stop \ntreating Medicare patients if they were deprived of the Medicare \npayments they needed in order to make up for the costs of the treatment \nthey provided to Medicare enrollees. We know that every single year we \nhave had to do the doc fix, which has not allowed the previously \nlegislated reductions in Medicare payments to physicians. So that is an \nadditional $208 billion over 10 years--that alone is $208 billion. \nNowhere is that put into the equation.\n  Then we have, of course, the so-called CLASS Act, which is a poorly \ndesigned Federal long-term care program. It was inserted at a point in \nthe debate that was never in the original bill passed through the HELP \nCommittee.\n  I ask my colleague, it is a program for long-term care where people \npay into the system in order to be eligible for long-term care \nbenefits, but over time that money comes back out--not in the timeframe \nthat was given to the CBO. There are a number of other provisions.\n  I ask my colleague from Wyoming what his assessment of the costs were \ntaking into consideration the doc fix, the CLASS Act, the envisioned \nMedicare cuts by $500 billion, and others, which are simply not going \nto happen. I would be interested in the Senator's total of the costs \nthat actually would be saved by repeal of this legislation.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. What we are trying to do is actually provide people \nwith the care they need, the doctors they want, at a cost they can \nafford. Yet, when we look at this health care law that--remember, it \nwas written behind closed doors in spite of the promises. That is why \npeople were so offended and are still opposed to this. We had votes in \nthe middle of the night, and there were all those special deals cut for \nSenators to get that 60th vote.\n  What I hear most about as I travel my State are the proposed cuts to \nMedicare. As the Senator mentioned, it was $500 billion. You talked \nabout the President having a commission to look at the debt. What that \ncommission said is that if you are going to take money from Medicare, \nwhich this law does--$500 billion--it doesn't do it to help strengthen \nMedicare or lengthen the life or the vitality of Medicare; it does it \nto start a whole new government program. It takes $155 billion from \nhospitals, $202 billion from the 11 million seniors on Medicare \nAdvantage, $15 billion from nursing homes, $40 billion from home health \nagencies, and $7 billion from hospices.\n  As my colleague from Arizona said--he mentioned the CLASS Act, which \nhas been called a Ponzi scheme that Bernie Madoff would be proud of. \nThe President's own debt commission says repeal that because, with the \nway that is set up in terms of taking the money in first so they can \ncount that as coming in, the obligations 10 years and beyond will \nbankrupt this country. Everyone on both sides of the aisle realizes \nthat. The bipartisan President's debt commission realized it to the \npoint that they put it in one of their recommendations. To hear our \ncolleagues and the last speaker talk about the fact that this may \nactually help with the deficit and with the debt, anybody who looks at \nthis over the long term and the nature of our country knows this will \nbankrupt the country.\n  I worry about the jobs in this country. We are at 9.4 percent \nunemployment. I know both of us as Senators are working to try to find \nways to make it easier and cheaper to create private sector jobs in \nAmerica. This health care law makes it more expensive and harder to \ncreate private sector jobs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Nowhere during the debate, I ask my friend, did I \nunderstand that there would be a very large use of ``waivers'' for \ndifferent companies, including unions, businesses, et cetera, and \nalready we have had well over 700 waivers granted to unions and others \nwho have sought relief from this legislation.\n  I am told that only entails about 1 percent of America's economy, but \nisn't that quite a remarkable repudiation of this legislation? I would \nhave liked to have heard during the debate: By the way, the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services is going to have to give well over 700 \nwaivers for people so they won't have to comply with this law. And the \nonly reason you give a waiver, obviously, is because the implementation \nof the law would be harmful to them. I am very interested in hearing my \ncolleague's comments about this so-called waiver business.\n  Along with that, the Governor of my State has written to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to give the State of Arizona a \nwaiver. I hope that, since the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nis in that business, she will grant that to my home State.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I would like to see every citizen in this country get a \nwaiver. I would like every State to have an opportunity to get waivers \nbecause last week the Secretary of Health and Human Services gave \nanother 500 new waivers. The total now is\n\n[[Page S448]]\n\n729 waivers. You can find them on the HHS Web site. It covers 2.2 \nmillion people.\n  It is interesting because before this bill was passed through in the \nmiddle of the night, labor unions publicly supported this health care \nlaw. Now there are 166 union benefit funds that are exempt and have \ngotten the waivers. They got the waivers. Unions now have 860,000 out \nof the 2.2 million waivers. Unions now have 40 percent of all the \nwaivers even though they are only 7 percent of the private sector \nworkforce in this country.\n  My question to my colleague is, if this law is so good, why do so \nmany people who supported it in the first place now say they don't want \nit to apply to them? Is it, as Nancy Pelosi said when she was Speaker \nof the House before the election--before the election that repudiated \nthis health care law and the way it was crammed down the throats of the \nAmerican public--didn't Speaker Pelosi say that first you have to pass \nit before you get to find out what is in it?\n  It seems to me, and I ask my colleague from Arizona, that as people \nknow more about what is in this law, it is less popular on a daily \nbasis. Yesterday, 58 percent of Americans, in a Rasmussen poll, said \nthey would like to have it repealed, and the numbers of people who \nthought all of us ought to be able to get waivers was even higher than \nthat.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague for his enormous contribution to \nthis debate and his knowledge and background in the medical profession.\n  There is one other issue I want to mention. Of course, I was pleased \nto hear the President, in the State of the Union Message, say that we \nought to look at the issue of medical malpractice reform. I can't tell \nthe number of times we have tried on this floor to have at least the \nbeginning of some kind of meaningful medical malpractice reform. I said \nto the Secretary of Health and Human Services at a hearing the other \nday that I hoped she would be making some proposals to us, to the \nCongress, so that we could obtain some kind of medical malpractice \nreform.\n  As we all know, sometimes as much as 20 to 30 percent of the cost of \nhealth care is accrued because of the physician's prescription for \nunneeded and unwanted and unnecessary tests for fear of the physician \nfinding himself or herself in court trying to defend the treatment of a \npatient. That, of course, is a huge portion of the additional costs in \nhealth care in America today.\n  I was pleased to hear the President of the United States say he \nwanted to examine and visit the issue of medical malpractice reform. I \nknow my colleague stands ready to work with him on that issue.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The President said the same thing in June of 2009 when \nhe visited and spoke to the American Medical Association. So when that \nissue didn't really come to the floor, as a number of us would have \nliked, in this health care law that was written, as I say, behind \nclosed doors, they asked Howard Dean, then-chairman of the Democratic \nNational Committee, why they don't include it, and he said: We can't \nstand up to the trial lawyers--who have such a remarkable influence on \nthe party on the other side of the aisle.\n  I am hoping that the President, in his statement in his State of the \nUnion Address, was sincere because it clearly did not follow through \nwhat he said in June of 2009 when he met with doctors from all across \nthe country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague. I thank the Senator from Maryland \nfor her patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nMaryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in very strong opposition \nto any attempt to repeal the health care reform bill. The Republican \nleadership has offered an amendment to repeal the Affordable Health \nCare Act. They are only keeping half of their promise. They went out \nthere and campaigned--and the tea party had a teapot boiling over--and \nthey said: We are going to offer a bill to repeal and to replace. Guess \nwhat they are doing today. One more hollow, symbolic, pander-to-the-\nmasses amendment. Their amendment offers a repeal, but it does not \noffer a plan or strategy to replace. Do you know why? They have no \nideas. They just want to pander to the crowd.\n  I want my colleagues to know that I am emphatically and unabashedly \nagainst the repeal of health care reform. But I want to say to my \ncolleagues, as I listened to this colloquy, every Senator has the right \nto rewrite legislation, but they do not have the right to rewrite \nhistory or to rewrite the facts.\n  I heard CBO criticized and being dismissed. But yet it was the \nRepublican Party who said we could not move anything, bring up \nanything, even get a Kleenex without getting a CBO score. Now they do \nnot want a CBO score. You cannot say I want a CBO score one day and \nthen make fun of it the next. Garbage in, garbage out.\n  Then second: Oh, they rewrote the bill in the middle of the night, \nsweetheart deals, whatever. I was on the HELP Committee. I chaired the \ntask force on quality. I went to several hearings in an open, public \nforum to get the best ideas to produce the best bill. In many of those \ninstances, very few of the other party even bothered to show up. So I \nam not real excited about their criticism.\n  Then we went into a markup of the bill, 4 weeks in the HELP \nCommittee, open, public markups in full view and on C-SPAN. Over 300 \namendments were dealt with--300 amendments. How is that secret? How is \nthat behind closed doors? How is that in the middle of the night? We \nworked in the middle of the night because there were so many \namendments. Fine, that is democracy. That is the way the legislative \nprocess works. But don't try to rewrite history. Don't try to rewrite \nfacts. And if you want to rewrite the bill, keep your promise, \nRepublican Party. If you want to repeal, then let's go to replace.\n  I want to hear their ideas for replacement. I challenge them right \nhere, right now, today on this amendment. Come in with other amendments \non your ideas for replacement. I want to know what it is they want to \ndo. I want to know which parts of the health care reform they want to \nrepeal and replace. What is it they want to repeal and replace?\n  How about this? No longer can big insurance deny coverage to a child \nwith a preexisting condition. Do they want to repeal that? And with \nwhat are they going to replace it? Do they want to repeal the part \nwhere we allow young people to stay on their parents' plans until they \nare 26? Do they want to repeal that? And with what do they want to \nreplace it?\n  We eliminated the cap on what an insurance company could pay out. Do \nthey want to repeal that cap--if you have cancer, if you need heart \nsurgery? And with what are they going to replace it?\n  I am proud of what we did in health care. It is an excellent bill. We \naccomplished four goals. First of all, we save and strengthen Medicare. \nWe end those punitive practices of insurance companies. We expanded \nuniversal access. And, guess what. We came up with quality and \nprevention measures that save lives and save money. This is what people \nwanted in health care reform. I heard it all over Maryland and heard it \nat hearings. I had roundtables, hearings, I was in diners, I held \nonline townhall meetings, phone calls, letters. Once they got the \nstraight information about what we did, they liked it.\n  Let's go to Medicare. We extended the solvency for a decade. We \nclosed the doughnut hole that has been so hard to swallow. Last year, \nmore than 32,000 Maryland seniors received a $250 rebate check to help \npay for prescription drugs. That is in the health care reform bill. If \nwe repeal it, do I have to call up 32,000 Marylanders and say give it \nback? Give it back; we repealed. Wow, I bet that is going to go over.\n  These same seniors will now get 50 percent off their brand-name drugs \nwhen they hit the prescription drug coverage cap. Are we going to \nrepeal that? And with what are we going to replace it?\n  Also, one of my favorite parts of this bill is ending the punitive \npractices of insurance companies, such as seeing a child denied \ncoverage because of chronic conditions because of asthma or juvenile \ndiabetes.\n  I also fought very long and hard, as everyone knows, for women. Did \nyou know, Mr. President, when we began our hearings on the bill, we \nfound out\n\n[[Page S449]]\n\nthat in many instances insurance companies charged women 25 to 40 \npercent more in their premiums simply because they were a woman, more \nthan guys with the same age and same health status? Are we going to \nrepeal that and bring back gender discrimination?\n  Also, we ended the despicable practice of just being a woman being \ntreated as a preexisting condition. Another point my hearing disclosed \nis that in seven States and the District of Columbia, women were denied \ncoverage for simply being a victim of domestic violence. They were \nabused by their partner, and they were then abused by the insurance \ncompany. Are we going to abuse them once again by repealing that \nprovision? Not if I can help it.\n  Then there were other issues also related to the whole issue of \nprevention. We offered a prevention amendment. When they tried to take \nour mammograms away from us, the Democratic women took to the floor--\nand good guys supported this bill and we passed it: preventive measures \nat no cost and no deductible in order to make sure we not only had our \nmammograms but that there were other preventive services.\n  Provision after provision--are we going to go back to that? I hope \nnot. If they are going to repeal, that is what they are repealing. They \nare really repealing the way we ended the punitive practices of \ninsurance companies. They are really repealing our attempt to make sure \nMedicare is solvent and close the doughnut hole for prescription drugs \nfor seniors and also get them better health evaluations. We also did \nother things.\n  I am so proud of this. We said to the insurance companies, 80 percent \nof what you collect has to go into health care. It cannot go into \nadministrative costs. It cannot buy you another Armani suit or a pair \nof Gucci shoes or a third or fourth home or $1,000 bottles of wine when \nyou have those conferences where you think about price fixing; you have \nto put it back into health care. I do not want to repeal that \nprovision. I want that 80 percent collected to go back into health \ncare. I think that is a good idea.\n  In our bill, one of the things I am proud of is that we stop big \ninsurance from putting lifetime dollar caps on benefits. I heard from a \nwoman in Columbia who told me her husband had reached his lifetime \nlimit. So when he needed an EKG to deal with a long-time cardiac \nproblem, they had to pay for it out of pocket. Even with health \ninsurance, their health care costs still topped $17,000 a year with \ntheir annual income at $60,000. By lifting that cap, the man can get \nhis EKG and prevent other kinds of problems.\n  I could go case example after case example.\n  Let's go to something called quality and prevention. I know that is \noften ridiculed. That is goosh; that is not like real medicine. I want \nto tell the story of a brilliant and talented physician at Johns \nHopkins, Dr. Pronovost. He developed a checklist that, if followed, \nlowers infections that are caught in hospitals which takes lives, takes \nmoney, and extends stays.\n  In health care reform, we improve patient safety and help prevent \nmedical errors. The Pronovost checklist, which we allow to occur in the \nbill, has now, we found out, reduced in Michigan patient deaths by 10 \npercent, and it has nearly had over an 85-percent effective rate at \neliminating bloodstream infections.\n  The cost savings to both public and private insurance in Michigan has \nbeen stunning. Do we really want to repeal these measures that are \nsaving lives and saving money?\n  I do not want to repeal this bill. We did a lot of good things in it. \nIf the Republicans have ideas, then I do not think they should vote to \nrepeal unless they have a better idea to replace what I outlined today. \nI challenge them: If you want to repeal, keep the other half of your \ncampaign promise--replace. Let's put those replacement ideas out into \nthe light of day. Let's put them out for debate and discussion and then \nvote. I am up to the task. I wonder if they are.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nrepeal this highly unpopular health care law. Here is what repealing \nthis health care bill will mean to Georgians.\n  First of all, the Federal Government will not be required to spend \n$8,470 on health care for every single Georgian every year; 176,000 \nGeorgia seniors who are today enrolled in Medicare Advantage will not \nhave their benefits reduced; and the $500 billion in Medicare cuts will \nnot be used to pay for new programs under this law; around 2.1 million \nGeorgia households making less than $200,000 will not have to pay \nhigher taxes to fund this monstrous bill; 70 percent of small employer \npurchasers will not face higher premiums; small businesses employing 50 \nor more people and 8,000 Georgia construction companies with five or \nmore employees will not have to pay higher health care costs or be \nsubjected to new penalties due to government mandates.\n  Under this law, hundreds of thousands of additional low-income \nGeorgians will become eligible for Medicaid in 2014. That is going to \nresult in an estimated $1 billion in new expenses for my State to fund \nthat program. How are we going to fund that $1 billion? We are a State \nthat has to have a balanced budget every year, and we are struggling \nright now. Our Governor and the legislature are making tough and hard \ndecisions cutting expenses to balance the budget this year.\n  Under this bill, they are going to have to come up with another $1 \nbillion. They are going to have to raise taxes, raise tuition costs at \nour universities. Where are we going to get it? We do not know the \nanswer to that, but that is what this bill would require.\n  While States work to prepare balanced budgets in anticipation of \nMedicaid expansion, they will not be given the flexibility to make \nprudent market-based decisions to improve their fiscal outlook. The \nGovernor of Georgia has put forward proposals such as ending Medicaid \ncoverage of dental, vision, and podiatry treatment for adults. These \nare painful decisions that States are being forced to make, but the \nhealth care law requires States to maintain eligibility levels for \nbeneficiaries in order to keep their Federal Medicaid dollars.\n\n  Reimbursement from Medicaid is already so low that a majority of \ndoctors will not see Medicaid patients. States are left with little \noptions other than further reducing payments to providers or raising \ncopayments for beneficiaries.\n  The Federal Government should not be hindering States' flexibility in \ndealing with their individual budget issues. This is not an area where \nthe Federal Government should be impeding on the sovereignty of our \nStates.\n  America's deficit is the single biggest issue facing our country \ntoday. Repealing the health care bill means that our deficit will not \nincrease by an estimated $2.6 trillion when this bill is fully \nimplemented over a 10-year period, and it would also prevent that same \n$500 million in cuts coming from Medicare to pay for entitlements that \nwould do nothing but exacerbate our budgetary woes.\n  My constituents in Georgia, and citizens all across this country, \nhave made it clear that they want Congress to repeal this legislation \nand work to lower health care costs and insure Americans through \ncommonsense solutions that are not negotiated behind closed doors. We \nneed a law that replaces this law and that actually reduces health care \ncosts and enacts insurance reforms immediately.\n  Americans should be allowed to buy insurance policies across State \nlines; small businesses should be allowed to pool resources and offer \nmore affordable insurance to workers; we need to limit baseless \nlawsuits against doctors; and we should expand health savings accounts.\n  Furthermore, in light of recent judicial decisions in Virginia and \nFlorida, it appears the law may not be upheld in the courts. I applaud \nthe decisions reached by Judge Hudson and Judge Vinson that Congress \ndoes not have the authority to force Americans to either purchase \nhealth insurance or pay a penalty for not doing so. That provision of \nlaw, obviously, is ultimately going to be decided by the Supreme Court.\n  I plan to vote on repealing this law and working with my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to start the process over, to make sure the \nnext time we do it in the open and not behind closed doors and that we \nget it right.\n\n[[Page S450]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. I know \nhe has been gracious enough to allow me to speak in front of him. My \nspeech today, hopefully, will be fairly short, but I do want to raise \nsomething that I think is of critical importance to the country.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Pryor pertaining to the introduction of S. 256 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. PRYOR. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there has been some confusion, moving \naround the time. While I was supposed to be here earlier, let me ask \nunanimous consent that I be allowed to speak in morning business for \nsuch time as I will consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I say to my friend from Arkansas who just spoke, I know a \nlittle bit about the program you have. In fact, the Senator is fully \naware my daughter Molly is a marketing professor at the University of \nArkansas, who has talked about this very concept. I do not know why all \nthe successes have gravitated to northwest Arkansas, but it seems that \nthey have. Maybe this has something to do with it. I look forward to \nfollowing through with the Senator on this program.\n  I wish to mention a couple things I have been wanting to talk about, \nbut I am here actually to describe two amendments I have to the FAA \nbill.\n  First, I would like to say publicly how proud I am of the new \nattorney general, Scott Pruitt, that we have in the State of Oklahoma. \nHe is taking the leadership in suing to determine the constitutionality \nof the government-run health care. We are doing that currently in the \nState of Oklahoma. I am looking for some great results from that.\n  As I look at this, sometimes you have to ask the very basic \nquestions. If you are talking about a government-run system, something \nthat doesn't work in Sweden or Denmark or the UK or Canada, why would \nit work here, when we have all these members of Parliament coming over \nsaying: Why are you insisting on going to something that is a dismal \nfailure at the same time we are moving toward a much more successful \nhealth delivery system, the model for the whole world, and that is what \nwe have in the United States.\n  I have to say also, when I look and listen to people talking about \nthe debt and the deficit and the problems we have, I think it is \nludicrous that we can go back and try to act like Bush had these great \ndeficits. If you take the deficits during the 8 Bush years, add them \nall up and divide by 8, it came out to $247 billion each year. Now we \nhave a President who has in just 2 years accumulated almost $3 \ntrillion--six times the deficit that was there under the Bush \nadministration. When people keep saying something over and over that is \nnot true, they assume people will eventually believe it. In this case, \nI believe the American people are so concerned about the spending, the \nunprecedented spending, the unsustainable spending of this \nadministration, this President and his majority in both Houses, they \nare up on this issue.\n  Before I get to my two amendments, I wish to mention one other aspect \nI was going to have as an amendment to the FAA bill. Unfortunately, \nthere was not time to put it together, so I will be doing some sometime \nthis summer, but I wish to serve notice. I have the distinction, I \nguess you would say, since the retirement of Senator John Glenn, I am \nnow, I believe, the last remaining active commercial pilot in the \nSenate. When I look at the FAA bill, I have a lot of interest in it.\n  I had an incident that occurred to me on October 20 of this year when \nI was flying my twin-engine airplane into a field in south Texas. It \nwas called Cameron County Airport, a noncontrolled field. I experienced \nsomething that is going to make me go back and revisit to see if \nperhaps what happened to me, if it happens to someone else, people in \nthe FAA would be just as generous as they were with me.\n  Before I tell you what happened, I have to say the FAA could not have \nbeen better. They could not have been more cooperative. I sat down and \ntalked with them about the incident. I will tell you what happened. I \nwas flying some passengers in one of my planes, a twin-engine airplane, \ninto Cameron County Airport. This happened to be a nice day. It was a \nVFR--visual flight rules is what that means--so I didn't have to have \ncontrol with the controllers on the way down. However, as a \nprecautionary measure, what I always do, I talk to them anyway. So when \nyou go down straight south from Tulsa, OK, to Cameron County Airport, \nyou fly right over Corpus Christi. That is about 120 miles north of the \nCameron County Airport.\n  Because they have a lot of training down there--they have the Navy \nguys, the training that takes place--it is always safer, when you are \nflying around down there with a lot of kids who may only have 30 or 40 \nhours, to get on control so they are watching you. When you get on a \ncontrol, in this case it is an approach control, they give you a squawk \nso you know--they know who you are, where you are, how fast you are \ngoing, how you relate to the other traffic in the area. So I got on \nCorpus Christi approach and I said: This is Twin Cessna 115 echo alpha. \nI will be coming south on VFR, descending through 15,500 to go to the \nCameron County Airport.\n  Halfway down they handed me off--this is the terminology that is \nused--to the FAA controller down there in the valley. This is way down \nSouth. A lot of the people back East here do not understand that Texas, \nwhen you get down to the southern tip, that is farther south than \nMiami, FL. It is way down there.\n  We went down and they handed me off to what they call valley \napproach. Valley approach took me all the way down to Cameron County \nAirport, turned me loose--and I am trying to get the recording so I \nknow exactly when it was--to land at the Cameron County Airport. This \nis the FAA.\n  The problem is, when I went ahead and landed--by the time I got \neverything in landing configuration, it was too late to go around. We \nare going below the blue line, as the saying is, so I had to land when \nthere were workers on the runway.\n  I say to my friend from Iowa, the way they normally preclude \nsomething from happening, as he well knows, is they have you on their \nradar. They know you are there. But they publish NOTAMs, that is Notice \nto Airmen. Before you fly into any place, you check the NOTAMs to see \nif there is construction on the runway, if there is any kind of \nproblem. Of course, we checked and there were no NOTAMs that day for \nCameron County Airport, but there were people working on the runway.\n  I wish to offer legislation, and I will include in the legislation a \nrequirement that NOTAMs are published where they can be found by the \npilot. In this case, the NOTAM that came out that there is someone \nworking on the airport did not come out until November 2 and this was \nOctober 20, so I had no control over it. I am not blaming anyone. I am \nsaying they need to be in a conspicuous place where that will happen.\n  The second problem I see that affects general aviation is everything \nwe do when we talk to a controller is recorded, and the public should \nhave access to these recordings. I know it is a difficult thing. I have \nrequested this, now, since way back in October and have not yet \nreceived it. I am going to try to set up a system where that is \navailable to everyone.\n  Then, last, because even though no action was taken--I didn't violate \nanything and everything turned out fine; I did study procedures and all \nthat--but the bottom line is, all during that process, someone, a \nbureaucrat, could have taken away my license. Here I have more hours \nthan most American airline pilots. I fly, on average, probably 4 hours \na week still to this day. That would be taking away a major part of my \nlife and that is how serious it is.\n\n[[Page S451]]\n\n  Many years ago, about 10 years ago, the greatest pilot in America, \nnamed Bob Hoover--he is a tremendous pilot, up in years, actually \nconsiderably older than I am--and they actually took away his license. \nThis is called an emergency revocation. I authored a law to require a \ntype of an appeal, appellate process. We passed it. I think a similar \nthing should be afforded to all members.\n  Again, I wish to say the FAA could not have been more cooperative and \nmore thorough, but I think we need to change the rules. We will \nprobably have to do it legislatively. I plan to do that during the \nsummer.\n  My two amendments. The first is one I think most people, when they \nunderstand it, will appreciate; that is, they are attempting, it is my \nunderstanding--right now there is a rule that is pending. It is not \npart of this legislation directly but in a way it is because, with my \namendment, we would be able to preclude this from happening. The air \ncarriers are scheduled airlines and unscheduled. The unscheduleds--they \nare called charter airlines and other types of airlines--they are under \na different FAR, the Federal Aviation Regulation, part 21, but it is a \nsubpart S. Subpart S says, if you are an unscheduled airline, you are \nnot restricted to the same crew restrictions they have for a scheduled \nairline. There is a reason for this.\n\n  The reason is this. A scheduled airline, they are out there every \nday, and they adjust their schedules for crew rest time. A charter does \nnot have that opportunity. So they may go maybe three or four times \nwhat the crew's rest would be and then have to take a longer flight. \nThis does affect the military. Right now, if you are flying blood into \nAfghanistan, it is flown in by charter airlines. These airlines will \ntake it down to Qatar and then go in probably on a C-17.\n  To go from Ramstein down to Qatar and back is longer than they can \ntake without crew rest or, if they take it into Afghanistan, that \ncharter flight would have to do crew rest actually in Afghanistan--\nmaybe in Kabul. Obviously, they cannot leave a civilian plane there \nunder some of those conditions. So the only choice, then, is we would \nhave to use some of our lift capacity of the C-17s to do that.\n  The problem we are having right now, our C-17s are so overworked, our \ncrews are overworked, so I believe that exemption should continue to be \nin place and we will be trying to pass this amendment. I am going to \ntry to get in the queue. This is actually our amendment No. 7.\n  The other amendment I have I am very sensitive to because I have \nparticipated in these programs. There are a lot of voluntary \norganizations, volunteer pilots--I have done it at my own expense, \nhelping heart patients get around different places, flying in to help \npeople out. A lot of pilots are very generous with their equipment and \ntime and money and they do this. What I want to do is get them a \nrelease from some of the liability to which they would otherwise be \nexposed. In other words, these people are doing this at their own \nexpense, on their own time, but they are also exposing themselves to \nmajor lawsuits.\n  These are the two amendments. That happens to be amendment No. 6. I \nwill be trying to get that in the queue after tonight's vote, so \nperhaps we will be voting on it sometime between now and Tuesday.\n  With that, I appreciate the patience of my friend from Iowa and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if there is one clear message that voters \nsent in the last election, it is that they want Democrats and \nRepublicans in Congress to cut out the bickering and the partisanship \nand to focus like a laser beam on boosting the economy, creating jobs, \nand reducing the deficit. So I find it absolutely astonishing that the \nRepublicans' No. 1 priority, indeed their obsession in these opening \nweeks of the new Congress, is to launch bitter new partisan attacks on \nthe new health reform law, in an attempt to repeal it in its entirety, \nsomething that would cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, and add $240 \nbillion to the deficit in the next 10 years.\n  It would be sufficient to oppose this reckless amendment strictly on \nbudgetary grounds. As I said, it would add $240 billion to the deficit \nin the first decade. Nearly $1 trillion would be added to the deficit \nin the second decade, if we repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n  The sponsors of the repeal amendment have proposed no offsets \nwhatsoever. So for all of the Republicans' crocodile tears over big \nbudget deficits, their first action in the new Congress is to propose \nadding nearly $\\1/4\\ trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years, \nand over $1 trillion in the second 10 years.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is our only objective nonpartisan \nreferee when it comes to budget projections. CBO has told us in no \nuncertain terms that the McConnell amendment, the repeal amendment, \nwill add $240 billion to the deficit this decade. The Republicans' \nresponse is to attack the credibility of CBO, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, and to claim that the hundreds of billions in budget savings, \nthanks to new health reform law, are based on ``gimmicks.'' That is \ncomplete nonsense. The budget savings in this new law are real. If \nanything, CBO has underestimated the savings that will come about, \nespecially as a result of the robust wellness and prevention provisions \nin the new law, provisions that will keep Americans healthy and out of \nthe hospital in the first place.\n  I would simply add that if the savings in the new law were based on \ngimmicks, then those gimmicks would surely show up by the second decade \nof the law's implementation. That is the nature of gimmicks; they \neventually get exposed. But the savings in the new law actually \nskyrocket in the second decade to nearly $1 trillion. So to wildly \nassert that the savings in the new health reform law are based on \ngimmicks is flat wrong. It is irresponsible.\n  Let's be clear. The Republicans' obsession with repealing the new \nhealth reform law is not based on budgetary considerations, it is based \nstrictly on ideology. They oppose the law's crackdown on abuse by \nhealth insurance companies, and they oppose any serious effort by the \nFederal Government to secure health insurance coverage for tens of \nmillions of Americans who currently have none.\n  We all remember William Buckley's conservative motto, sort of the \nfather of the, I would say, modern American conservative movement. \nWilliam Buckley said once that: The role of conservatives is ``to \nthwart history, yelling `stop.' ''\n  In 1935 Franklin Roosevelt and the Congress passed Social Security, \nproviding a basic retirement security for every American. Republicans \nfought it bitterly, and 75 years later they are still trying to undo it \nand privatize it. In 1965, President Johnson and the Congress passed \nMedicare, ensuring seniors access to decent health care. Republicans \nfought it bitterly, and 45 years later they are still trying to undo it \nand privatize it. To quote another famous Republican President: Here \nthey go again.\n  By the way, notice that the Republicans are no longer even pretending \nto offer a realistic comprehensive alternative. They used to talk about \n``repeal and replace.'' Now they are just talking about ``repeal.'' As \nalways, the Republican approach to health reform can be summed up in \nfive words: Pray you don't get sick.\n  So make no mistake, the fight to provide access to quality affordable \nhealth care for all Americans has only just begun, it looks like. The \nsame ideologue who came up with the big lies about the death panels and \npulling the plug on grandma are rolling out their latest campaign of \nmisinformation.\n  The good news is that this time around the dynamics of the debate \nhave shifted. Just as I long predicted, as people learn more about the \ngreat things in the Affordable Care Act, the benefits and protections \nthat are now guaranteed by law, support for health care reform is \ngrowing steadily as time goes by and people learn more about what is in \nit.\n\n[[Page S452]]\n\n  A year ago, we were bogged down in the messy, frustrating politics of \npassing a bill. This time around the law is the law, and what is at \nstake is crystal clear: Are we going to put the health insurance \ncompanies back in the driver's seat, once again free to discriminate \nbased on preexisting conditions, free to cancel your policy if you get \nsick, free to cut off payments? Are we going to revoke access to health \ninsurance for more than 30 million Americans? Are we going to add \nhundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit by wiping out all of the \nsavings of the Affordable Care Act? Are we going to impose higher taxes \non up to 4 million small businesses that are eligible for health care \ntax credits thanks to this new health reform law?\n  I also want to rebut the extreme ideological attacks on the \nindividual mandate in the new law. Republicans claim that this is \nsomehow an assault on freedom. Let's look at it another way. It is \ncertainly an assault on an individual American's freedoms when someone \ngoes without insurance and they show up in the emergency room and they \nstick other Americans with their emergency room bill. How about that \nfreedom? Shouldn't I be free, shouldn't you be free, from having to pay \nfor someone because they did not have insurance and they show up at the \nemergency room, which is the most expensive form of health care, and \nnow we have got to pay the bill? What about that freedom?\n  The individual mandate is just common sense, and that is why so many \nRepublicans supported it in the past. Senator John Chafee's reform bill \nin the early 1990s included an individual mandate. It was supported by \na number of Republicans, some of whom are still here. Republican \nSenator Grassley, my colleague from Iowa, Senator Hatch, Senator Lugar, \nall supported that individual mandate. More recently, the original \nWyden-Bennett bill--that is Senator Bennett, a Republican from Utah--\nincluded an individual mandate. It was supported by Senators Alexander, \nCrapo, Corker, and Grassley.\n  As we all know, the individual mandate was a critical piece of \nRepublican Governor Mitch Romney's health reform in Massachusetts. As I \nsaid, it is just common sense. By eliminating free riders and putting \neveryone in the risk pool, we keep rates down for everyone, and it is \nthe only way that people with preexisting conditions are not left out \nin the cold.\n  So it comes down to this, as we learned--I was watching in the last \nfew weeks the HBO series, now on DVD--about John Adams. What the early \ncolonists finally realized is that they could enhance their freedom, \nthey would have more freedom, if they stuck together, if they worked \ntogether, if they joined together.\n  The same is true here in health reform. When everyone is covered and \nno one is left out, we enhance an individual's liberty. So health \nreform is all about freedom, freedom from the fear that if you get \nsick, you will not be able to afford a doctor; freedom from the fear \nthat a major illness will lead to financial ruin. These are the \npractical freedoms that matter to Americans.\n  I cannot tell you how many people have come up to thank me and other \nsponsors for passing the Affordable Care Act. They tell me how it has \npersonally affected their families in profoundly positive ways. Let me \nfirst tell you about Sarah Posekany of Cedar Falls, IA.\n  She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease when she was 15 years old. \nDuring her first year of college, she ran into complications from \nCrohn's, which forced her to drop classes in order to heal from \nmultiple surgeries. Because she was no longer a full-time student, her \nparents' private insurance company terminated her coverage, and 4 years \nlater, she found herself--are you ready for this--$180,000 in debt, and \nwas forced to declare bankruptcy. Sarah was able to complete one \nsemester at Hawkeye Community College but could not afford to continue. \nBecause of her earlier bankruptcy, every bank she applied to for \nstudent loans turned her down.\n  With the new health law, people like Sarah will be able to stay on \ntheir parents' health insurance until they are age 26. This is a real \nperson. This is a real story. These are real people. So they want to \nrepeal this? They want to tell Sarah: Sorry, we cannot help you any, \nand we cannot help other young people like you stay on their parent's \npolicies until they are age 26.\n  We can consider the case of Eleanor Pierce, also of Cedar Falls, IA. \nWhen her job with a local company was eliminated, she lost her health \ninsurance. She had the option of purchasing COBRA insurance, but it was \ncompletely unaffordable. So she searched for coverage on the private \nindividual market and was almost universally denied access because of a \npreexisting condition of high blood pressure. The plans that would \ncover her came with premiums that she could not hope to afford without \nan income. So Eleanor, at age 26, suffering from high blood pressure, \nhad no choice but to go without insurance and hope for the best. ``Hope \nfor the best'' is no substitute for regular medical care. One year \nlater, Eleanor suffered a massive heart attack. When all was said and \ndone, she had racked up $60,000 in medical debts. So real people, real \nproblems, and real solutions.\n  We need to get beyond the ideological obsession and listen to \nordinary Americans, victims of the old broken sick care system. \nAmericans have a clear message: The new law has important new benefits \nand protections; do not take those protections away. Nearly half of \nnonelderly Americans have some type of preexisting condition such as \nhigh blood pressure, arthritis, heart disease. The new law outlaws the \ndenial of coverage based on preexisting conditions. The McConnell \namendment on repeal takes that away. The largest health insurer in \nCalifornia used technicalities to cancel the policies of women who got \nbreast cancer. The new law outlaws the practice of cancelling policies \nwhen people get sick. The McConnell amendment takes away that \nprotection and restores the right of health insurers to return to that \ndespicable practice. The new law prohibits insurers from imposing \nlifetime limits on benefits. The McConnell amendment sweeps that away. \nThe law allows parents to keep adult children on their policies until \nage 26, as I spoke about with Sarah. The McConnell amendment takes that \naway.\n  I want to briefly mention the destructive impacts the McConnell \namendment would have on my State of Iowa. One, it would raise taxes on \nmore than 260,000 Iowans by taking away tax credits to help them \npurchase health care coverage. More than 8,300 young adults would lose \ntheir insurance coverage on their parents' health plans. Tens of \nthousands of Iowa seniors would face higher prescription drug prices \nand once again have to pay a copay for preventive services, such as \ncolonoscopies and mammograms, which now they can get without a copay. \nAnd, of course, the 1.9 million Iowans with private coverage would once \nagain be vulnerable to a whole range of abuses and discriminatory \npractices by the health insurance industry, like cutting you off if you \nget breast cancer or putting a lifetime cap on it or an annual cap.\n\n  In addition, I want to mention that the new health care reform law \ndramatically remedies the discrimination against Iowa, my State, and a \nnumber of other States in terms of Medicare reimbursement.\n  A little background. Under a very complicated Medicare formula, \ndoctors in Iowa and a number of States were paid less for their \nservices than their colleagues elsewhere for the same service. Under \nthe formula, for example, Iowa physicians are reimbursed less than \ndoctors in Louisiana for the same procedure.\n  As part of the new health care reform bill, I joined with Congressman \nBruce Braley, Congressman Leonard Boswell, and Congressman Dave \nLoebsack on the House side to negotiate a compromise that provides an \nimmediate $800 million to address geographic disparities for both \ndoctors and hospitals, as well as written guarantees from Health and \nHuman Services Secretary Sebelius for further action to reform Medicare \nreimbursement rates. This great achievement is wiped out if the \nMcConnell amendment passes.\n  In addition, thanks to the new law, midsized hospitals in Iowa--we \ncall them the so-called tweeners. They are not big enough to have \neconomies of scale. They are not small enough to be put into the small-\nhospital category.\n\n[[Page S453]]\n\nThey are sort of in between, but they are important providers of health \ncare to so many communities in Iowa and other States around the Nation. \nWell, thanks to the new law, we will see greater Medicare reimbursement \nto these midsized hospitals in Iowa and other States. The 2-year fix \nwill cover fiscal years 2011 and 2012. It will aid these low-volume \nhospitals, some of which have struggled to keep their doors open. The \nfix was included in the new health care reform law, the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  At the heart of the reform mission was an effort to decrease the \nnumber of uninsured and increase access--access--to affordable care. \nThe law does just that and will ensure every Iowan access to quality \nhealth care, which these midsized community hospitals provide. Again, \nthat goes away if the McConnell amendment prevails. We fought very hard \nto get that compromise to protect these tweener hospitals--wiped out by \nthe McConnell amendment.\n  Finally, I want to mention the many millions of Americans who will be \ndenied health coverage if the McConnell amendment passes. The \nRepublicans apparently reckon that middle-class Americans who already \nhave health insurance do not care about those who are not so fortunate. \nI could not disagree more strongly. I believe Americans do care about \nthe uninsured, and they are well aware of the devastating human costs \nof repeal. Nearly 45,000 Americans die each year in part because they \ndo not have health insurance.\n  With the landmark law, we are ensuring at long last that every member \nof our American family has access to quality, affordable health care as \na right and not a privilege--as a right and not a privilege. I believe \nthe American people, even those who have good private coverage \nunderstand--understand deep down--that it is not right in our society \nfor 30 million Americans to go without health insurance coverage and \nthe devastating effects it has on those individuals and their families \nwhen they do not have that health insurance coverage. So the American \npeople are not going to allow the Republicans to take away this great \nhumanitarian achievement.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the McConnell amendment. It blows a \nhuge hole in the budget deficit. It destroys hundreds of thousands of \njobs. It repeals the Patients' Bill of Rights, allowing health insurers \nto return to the same old abusive and discriminatory practices. It \nrevokes health insurance coverage for tens of millions of Americans. \nInstead, let's listen to those voices of the American people who have \ncried out for so long--for so long--for health reform. Let's get rid of \nthe ideological obsessions.\n  If there are things that need to be fixed, we can fix them. I have \nsaid many times that the health reform law is not the Ten Commandments, \nwritten in stone for all eternity. It is a law. We pass laws. No laws \nare perfect, and sometimes you have to make changes. We make changes in \nlaws all the time. We are about to make a change in part of the health \ncare reform law now dealing with small businesses. Fine. These things \nneed to be adjusted and worked on as we go ahead. They should be done \nin a nonideological and hopefully bipartisan fashion. But to propose \nthat we repeal everything--everything; repeal it--makes no sense.\n  Let's move forward to build a reformed health care system that works \nnot only for the healthy and the wealthy but for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned in my remarks about how we had changed the \nlaw for Medicare reimbursement to benefit certain Iowa hospitals, and \nbecause of that, many of the hospitals in Iowa were going to get a bump \nup in their payments this year. I have a chart here. I did not have \ntime to get it put on a poster. For example, St. Luke's Hospital in \nCedar Rapids will get an additional payment this year of $794,841--this \nyear. That will be taken away by the McConnell amendment, by the way. \nTrinity Regional Medical Center, in Webster County, will get $434,913 \nadditional this year, taken away by the McConnell amendment. Mercy \nMedical Center will get $584,883, in Iowa City, taken away by the \nMcConnell amendment. We worked hard to get these payments to help these \nhospitals that are under duress and not able to serve people who are in \ntheir communities. We are able to get this additional money to help \nthem survive. Yet the McConnell amendment would take it all away.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an article by James Q. \nLynch that was in the Cedar Rapids Gazette and also a chart showing the \nreimbursement to Iowa hospitals under our new Medicare rules for 2011 \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Finally, I just say, for those of us in Iowa, in a small, \nrural State, with a lot of midsized hospitals, with a lot of people \nuninsured--and quite frankly, we are not in the upper echelons of \nincome in the United States--for us this health care law provides \nimmediate protections, immediate benefits, and promises even more \nbenefits as we get to 2014 and beyond. It would be a devastating blow \nto my constituents in Iowa to have this health care reform bill \nrepealed. That is why I so strenuously urge all my colleagues to oppose \nthe McConnell amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Medicare Reimbursement Changes Will Benefit Iowa Hospitals, Doctors\n\n                   (By James Q. Lynch, July 1, 2010)\n\n       A proposed change in Medicare reimbursement could increase \n     payments to Corridor hospitals by more than $4 million next \n     year.\n       Under changes expected to be finalized later this month, \n     reimbursement for Medicare services would increase payments \n     to St. Luke's Hospital by $794,841 and to Mercy Medical \n     Center by $584,883. In Iowa City, the University of Iowa \n     Hospitals and Clinics could see an increase of $2.3 million \n     in 2011 and Mercy Hospital could get a $509,898 boost.\n       At the same time, a rule change on reimbursement to doctors \n     could boost their Medicare payments by 5 percent beginning \n     next year.\n       ``This will mean a great deal to Iowa hospitals that have \n     been struggling for many years,'' according to 1st District \n     Rep. Bruce Braley, a Waterloo Democrat. He is part of a group \n     of U.S. House members who have sought to move Medicare away \n     from payment plans that resulted in geographic disparities \n     that ``punished health care providers in Iowa that provide \n     high-quality care and get low reimbursement rates.''\n\n      REIMBURSEMENT TO IOWA HOSPITALS UNDER PROPOSED MEDICARE RULES\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Hospital                     County           2011 Payment\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMarshalltown Medical & Surgical   Marshall...........            164,967\n Center.\nSt. Anthony Regional Hospital...

The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Isakson \nbe recognized to speak following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, today we will vote on repealing President \nObama's Federal takeover of health care. This vote will be not only to \nrepeal the specifics of this legislation but to reassert that we \noperate under constitutional restraint.\n  When this bill first came up, many on the other side sniffed and were \nincredulous that we would mention the Constitution. Many on the other \nside said the Constitution--they really had not even comprehended that \nthe question would be asked, ``Where do you get the authority under the \nConstitution to do this?'' Well, interestingly, we do still operate in \na society with constitutional restraint, and the courts have now \ndecided that the commerce clause does not mean you can do anything.\n\n[[Page S454]]\n\n  The commerce clause, though, for the last 70 years has gotten larger \nand larger. I used to joke that you can drive a truck through it now, \nit is so big. I also used to joke that if my shoes were made in \nTennessee, they could regulate my walking in Kentucky.\n  The commerce clause--the expansive definition and understanding of \nit--has been supplying no restraint to this body. But I think this \ncourt case and I think this bill is about so much more than health \ncare. It is about whether we live and operate with constitutional \nrestraint of government.\n  This has been going on for a long time. It started with Wickard v. \nFilburn back in the 1940s, where they told a farmer he could not grow \nas much wheat as he wanted to.\n  He wanted to grow 20 acres of wheat, and the government said: You can \nonly grow 10 acres of wheat.\n  He said: Why?\n  They said: Well, because of the interstate commerce clause, we can \ntell you how much you are going to grow.\n  He said: Well, I am not going to sell it to anybody. How am I engaged \nin commerce? I am just going to feed it to my livestock.\n  They told him that by not selling it, he could indirectly affect the \nprice of wheat between the States. It was a ludicrous argument then, \nand it is a ludicrous argument now.\n  My hope is that out of this case, as it moves forward to the Supreme \nCourt, maybe we will see a Court that takes a step toward overturning \nWickard v. Filburn. I think that would be the most important case in \nthe last 70 years in the Supreme Court, if we do it. Will we get there? \nI do not know. But listen to what the Founding Fathers said about this. \nMany people say: Oh, the general welfare clause says we can do this or \nthe commerce clause says we can do this. Madison wrote that we would \nnot have enumerated these specific powers and given them to the Federal \nGovernment if we intended for there to be no restraint.\n  Recently, in the two Federal court decisions, the judges made a point \nof saying that if you can regulate inactivity--basically, the nonact of \nnot buying insurance--then there is no aspect to our lives that would \nbe left free from government regulation and intrusion.\n  So I think this court case is incredibly important, more important \neven than the specifics of the health care bill. There are many reasons \nwe should have opposed the health care bill and still should, but \nreally No. 1 among them is that we need to have a government that \noperates under the Constitution and operates under a commerce clause \nthat was intended to promote free trade between the States and was \nnever intended to allow a government to grow so large and so invasive \nthat it could intrude into every nook and cranny of our economic lives.\n  With regard to the specifics of the health care bill, there were some \nproblems in health care. As a physician, I have seen some of the \nproblems. But do you know what the No. 1 complaint I got was? It was \nthe expense of health insurance, the rising expenses. The Federal \ntakeover of health care did nothing to that. In fact, it has already \nincreased the expenses to those. You see premiums rising.\n  But when you see problems, there are two directions to go. We had \nproblems in health care, but you could say: Do we need more government \nor less government? From my perspective as a physician, I saw we \nalready had too much government involvement in health care. I saw that \nwhat we had going on limited competition. You need more competition in \nhealth care if you want to drive prices down. So you need to allow \ninsurance to be sold across State lines. You need to allow competition \nin prices.\n  One of the surgeries I did was LASIK surgery, where you correct \nsomeone's eyes so they do not have to wear glasses anymore. No \ninsurance covers it, and you would think: Well, gosh, maybe this body \nwill get together and force people to buy insurance for LASIK surgery. \nIt is good. It is a great thing. Well, do you know what. Without \ngovernment getting involved, competition drove the prices down on \nLASIK. So the prices were driven down because the consumer was \ninvolved. The same way with contact lenses; you can buy a contact lens \nfor 4 bucks, maybe 3 bucks. It used to be $20 or $30 a contact. \nCompetition works.\n\n  So what we should have asked ourselves when we looked at this health \ncare debate is--yes, there are problems. Yes, we can agree portability \nwas a problem. Yes, we can agree preexisting conditions were a problem. \nBut we should have said: Do these problems exist because there is too \nmuch capitalism or too little capitalism? I would argue there is very \nlittle capitalism at all.\n  I do cataract surgery also. Do you know what. I charge the exact same \nprice as every other doctor in my town, every other doctor in the \nState, and every other doctor in the country because the prices are set \nin Washington by a central committee. That is not capitalism, and that \nis why health care is broken.\n  We need to get back to the fundamentals, and we need to say: Why does \ncapitalism work in nine-tenths of the economy but doesn't work in \nhealth care? Well, maybe it is because we are not allowing capitalism \nto operate in health care.\n  Today's vote on repeal is very important. There is great symbolism to \nthis because we have to say: Yes, we operate as a body under the \nrestraint of the Constitution, but there is also a message about \neconomic systems. The American economic system is capitalism, and we \nshould be proud of it. We should try to inject capitalism into more \nenterprises and not less capitalism. We should not have such great \nfaith in government that government has all the answers because \ngovernment is notoriously inept and inefficient at most of the things \nit does.\n  I rise today to support the repeal of the President's takeover of \nhealth care. I hope the Democrats will reconsider. I understand some of \nthem are reconsidering.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first of all, I commend the Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. Paul, for his remarks and particularly his reference to \nthe Constitution. When I read the decision of Judge Vinson in Florida, \nit read a lot like the Congressional Record of December 23 of last year \nwhen we were on the floor right before Christmas Eve debating whether \nto pass the Affordable Care Act. Judge Vinson was clear and precise \nboth on his ruling on the commerce clause as well as recognizing the \nnecessary and proper clause nor the general welfare clause can \nsubstantiate requiring people to make the decisions that the health \ncare bill requires.\n  I am going to vote for the amendment by Senator McConnell to repeal \nthe Affordable Care Act. I wish to repeat the reasons I stated a year \nand a half ago on the floor of the Senate as to why I believe that. \nFirst of all, it has little or nothing to do with affordable care, in \nmy judgment, and we have seen in the 13 months since its passage and \nthe 9 months since its signing increase after increase in costs, both \nin terms of insurance premiums as well as the application of the law to \nthe practice of medicine. So it is not about affordable care; it is \nabout care going up in its costs.\n  Secondly, if you look at the way in which the bill ostensibly claimed \nit paid for itself, it shot big holes in America's health care future, \ntaking $500 billion out of Medicare to begin with, reducing the \nreimbursement almost in its entirety for home health care which, in a \nState such as Georgia with many rural people, is the primary way in \nwhich health care is delivered to them, and the assessment of taxes, \nwhether it be on hearing aids and medical devices or the 3.8-percent \nsurtax placed on earned income for those people making more than \n$200,000 or families making $250,000.\n  It is appropriate to start over, but by starting over it doesn't mean \nwe delay dealing with the problems Americans face with their health \ncare. It may mean we, in fact, accelerate it beyond what this bill \nwould have done if it is carried out to its entirety.\n  When we had the meeting at the Blair House a year and a half ago in \nthe middle of the health care debate, when the President and the \nDemocratic leadership sat down across the table from the Republican \nleadership and for 4 hours engaged in a discourse over the differences \nin the two ideas, it became quite clear what the majority wanted\n\n[[Page S455]]\n\nto do. They wanted to change the paradigm and put the government in \ncharge of health care in America.\n  That is why every provision in the bill, from the fines for not \nbuying insurance to the provisions of reimbursement, drives government \nto be the decisionmaker and the controller, just as the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky talked about the price of health care today. The \nprice of health care begins and ends with the assessment of \nreimbursement made in Washington, DC.\n  So, No. 1, we do need to change the paradigm and get back to a \ncapitalistic-type system and a competitive system. For example, \nrepealing the barrier on interstate sales of health insurance and \nhaving a national marketplace. Allow affiliated groups or similar \ngroups to join together and compete across State lines as a larger risk \npool like independent contractors, like the profession I came from, \nreal estate agents, who are not employees, who don't have the benefits \nof ERISA coverage but bound together could compete with IBM or any \nother company in buying insurance as a group with a large enough risk \npool to reduce the cost of their premiums and raise their coverage.\n  It is very important to realize that the real solution to health \ncare, both in terms of its costs as well as a healthy America in the \nfuture, is the way we practice wellness and disease management. Those \nare the types of programs we can then begin to incentivize now to raise \nthem in their practice and lowering in the outyears the cost of health \ncare and begin to get our arms around what is right now a spiraling \ncontributor to the deficit and to the debt.\n  But most importantly of all, the fact that over 70 waivers have been \nissued by Health and Human Services already is proof the bill is \nflawed, and it is proof its continuation up until its beginning in 2014 \nis going to be nothing more than making other exceptions for other \ngroups for trying to make a bill that is designed to fail work. It \nwon't happen. It should be repealed.\n  I commend the leader on his amendment, and I will vote for it this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it was my understanding that another member \nof the Democratic Party was going to speak at this time, but not seeing \nhim, I think I will just go ahead and deliver my presentation.\n  As a candidate for the Senate during this past year, I met with many \nHoosier families and small business owners, as well as health care \nproviders, patients, doctors, and all those involved with concerns \nabout where this health care process was going to go. Everywhere I \nwent, from Lake County to Fort Wayne to Indianapolis, Muncie, and down \nto Evansville--all across the State I heard a resounding plea to \noverturn the costly and intrusive health care law that was passed by \nthis last Congress and signed into law by the President.\n  The issue for these people was not whether we needed to address \nissues of health care, whether it was quality, cost-effectiveness, or \naccess; the issues for them were two things: One, they resented the \nprocess where a massive bill, which many did not fully understand or \ngrasp the implications of, was forced through these Chambers and passed \nhours before Christmas. The rules were bent to try to move the bill \nthrough the process, and it became a policy which was not supported on \na bipartisan basis but yet a policy that affected virtually every \nAmerican.\n  If experience tells us anything, it is that massive changes in policy \nneed bipartisan support to be acceptable if they are going to be \neffective. The majority of people I spoke to about the health care plan \nthat is now in place believe it is fatally flawed and needs to be \nrepealed so we can start over with a much more cost-effective, \nefficient, affordable health care plan.\n  Those who have listened to the people express their views on this \nparticular issue have come to the conclusion that their voices were not \nheard, as they expressed throughout the deliberation of this; that \nCongress wasn't hearing what they were saying. The results of \nNovember--I think with this issue being central to the election--\nratified that. So I urge my colleagues in the Senate to listen to the \nAmerican people and repeal the law that is before us, a health care law \nthat raises taxes, penalizes businesses, straps States with costly \nmandates, and increases premiums for American families.\n  Recent polls show a significant majority of Americans want the \nPresident's health care law to be repealed, and they want Congress to \nstart over and put together a plan which does not cost the taxpayers a \nlot of money and will not provide the access and the care and the \nquality Americans are looking for.\n  We know more than half the States, including my State of Indiana, \nhave joined in lawsuits challenging provisions of the constitutionality \nof the law that will be settled by the Supreme Court in due time. But I \nbelieve we must take this opportunity now to overturn the law and start \nover.\n  Let me address some of the consequences to my State of Indiana and to \nHoosiers if we do not repeal the current health care law. Hoosier \nfamilies will clearly face higher premiums. Nonpartisan budget experts \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office reported that individual health \ninsurance premiums will increase by $2,100 per family as a result of \nthis new law. If we do not repeal the health care law, 50,000 low-\nincome Hoosiers will be dropped from the Healthy Indiana Plan. This was \nthe plan implemented by our Governor and our State representatives and \nsenators, an innovative plan that addressed the real problem of low-\nincome Hoosiers not qualifying for other support. This plan put in \nplace a proposal for health savings accounts. The program has been so \npopular that it now includes more than 50,000 participants.\n  Unfortunately, as a result of the health care law, the State may need \nto terminate the Healthy Indiana Plan and place its participants into \nMedicaid. This is just one example of a provision of law enacted at a \nFederal level that denies units of government--States, localities, and \nothers--from innovating and bringing about sensible, market-based \nsolutions to problems they face.\n  The one-size-fits-all Federal health care law basically says to those \nStates and those innovators: No, we know better. We will tell you what \nto do regardless of what the cost is or regardless of how effective \nyour program is. Our Governor had negotiated savings for prescription \ndrugs for low-income recipients, but this law prevents that type of \ninnovation and progress made on the state level.\n  If we do not repeal the health care law, Hoosier taxpayers will bear \na heavy burden. The law will force Indiana to expand Medicaid, \nenrolling approximately one of every four citizens in the program. \nAccording to an actuarial analysis by the Indianapolis-based Milliman, \nInc., Indiana will have to absorb an estimated $3.6 billion in new \ncosts over the next decade if the 1.5 million eligible Hoosiers enroll \nin Medicaid, which they may under this plan. That burden is passed on \nto Hoosier taxpayers, and our State, frankly, cannot afford to do that.\n  The report also predicts that Indiana would have to spend more than \n$300 million on new administrative costs alone. So with States already \nfacing budget cuts, there is no doubt these costs will either be passed \non to taxpayers or the State will opt out of the plan and turn people \nover to the exchanges and to the control of the Federal Government.\n  If we don't repeal the health care law, Hoosiers will see a decrease \nin the quality of service of care. I met with physicians, health care \nproviders, and hospital administrators at sites all across the State. I \nheard a very common concern: The new law will jeopardize the quality of \ncare for patients.\n  The health care plan cuts reimbursement dollars for hospitals and \nproviders at a time when they can least afford it. These cuts simply \nexacerbate the dire shortage of doctors and nurses and will result in \nless advanced care for people in need, less personal attention from \nproviders, and fewer choices for patients.\n  If we do not repeal the health care law, Hoosier businesses will \nsuffer. The President's health care overhaul hits our job creators with \nharmful mandates and regulations, mountains of paperwork, and countless \ntaxes. The new\n\n[[Page S456]]\n\nlaw requires businesses with 50 or more people on staff to pay a $2,000 \ntax per worker if the employer does not offer an acceptable health \ninsurance plan for its employees.\n  If I heard one thing more than any other thing from business owners, \nit was that this law will drive them to make employment decisions that \nare adverse to the benefit of those seeking employment. Companies that \nwere in the 45-to-50 range of employees, or even less, have basically \nsaid if the choice comes down to whether to hire new employees or \nwhether to outsource or whether to use technology to replace those \nemployees, they will do so to prevent going over 50 employees and being \nforced to offer insurance or pay a penalty.\n  An arbitrary line drawn at 50 basically puts the job creators of this \ncountry--the small- and medium-sized businesses--in the position of \nhaving to decide whether to take on the mandated tax burden of the \nFederal Government or simply not go forward and hire over that \nparticular limit, forcing them to find other ways to produce their \nproduct without added employment.\n  At a time when we are facing 9-plus--nearly 10 percent in many \nareas--unemployment, putting a law into place on a nationwide basis \nthat discourages businesses from hiring is simply the wrong thing to \ndo.\n  Other businesses may find it more cost effective--and many have told \nme they would drop workers from their health insurance plan and pay the \nfine instead. Turtle Top, a shuttle bus maker located in New Paris, IN, \nfound that dropping health care coverage for employees and paying the \nFederal penalty would generate a savings in the six-figure range for \nthe company. That is a story repeated over and over. The law dictates \nthat it financially benefits some companies to drop their insurance \nplans and shift coverage for employees over to the Federal taxpayer.\n  In fact, the administration's own estimates revealed that more than \n6,000 pages of regulations mandated by the law could force half of all \nemployers--as many as 80 percent of small businesses--to give up their \ncurrent health care coverage within the next 2 years.\n  One burdensome regulation is the 1099 provision. I believe we are \ngoing to vote on that amendment, and I hope it passes. This is one of \nthe many egregious, unexpected consequences of pushing a law through \nwithout fully understanding the law or the implications of the law. \nRather than beginning a piecemeal approach to de-construct this \napproximately 2,100-page bill, I believe it is expeditious for us to \nrepeal and start over.\n  The medical device tax particularly impacts my State. It adds a 2.3-\npercent sales tax on medical devices. This is an industry in the State \nof Indiana that probably is one of our top manufacturers, is making a \nprofit, and is hiring people. Yet it will be arbitrarily taxed as a way \nof helping to pay for the cost of the health care bill. Cook Medical, a \nmedical device company in Bloomington, IN, expects that the new health \ncare law will cost the company $15 million to $20 million per year. \nThis is a company, along with Biomet, Zimmer, and other medical device \ncompanies, that had the deep pockets because they were producing \nproducts that the world wanted to buy. They were one of our export \nleaders, and because they were making profits at a time when the \nFederal Government was looking for money to pay for other aspects of \nthe health care plan, they simply added a 2.3-percent sales tax on the \ndevices, to a total of about $20 billion.\n  The health care law devastates Indiana businesses. At a time when \nnearly 1 out of every 10 individuals today in Indiana is looking for a \njob, Congress should be focused on a way to encourage private sector \ngrowth and job creation, not stifle it.\n  Our health care system in America has problems, but restructuring it \nwith a one-size-fits-all, government-run plan that increases taxes, \nraises premiums, and hits businesses with penalties is not the right \nthing to do.\n  Congress needs to repeal the current law and start over with a step-\nby-step approach that reduces the skyrocketing costs of care.\n  Listening to Hoosiers over this past year, I created a list of 10 \npriorities that Congress, I believe, should focus on when we start over \non health care:\n  One, allow competition to cross State lines. We need to improve \naccess and the quality of care by increasing competition and allowing \nconsumers to purchase health insurance across State lines.\n  Encourage innovation. I talked about the innovation taken away from \nour State through this law.\n  Eliminate frivolous lawsuits and include liability reform. Passing a \nhealth care bill without liability reform part of it--when all of us \nknow defensive medicine is forced upon doctors and providers at \nhospitals through frivolous lawsuits and without a sensible process of \nproviding for those who clearly are victims of malpractice--undermined \nthe credibility of what Congress was trying to do and what the American \npeople and the health care providers were looking for.\n  Improving Medicaid and the SCHIP program.\n  Allowing for the immediate creation of association health plans for \nsmall businesses.\n  Incentivizing and rewarding healthy lifestyles.\n  Expanding health savings accounts, not reducing them.\n  Advancing the use of electronic medical records, while retaining \nprivacy.\n  Increasing cost transparency.\n  Retaining our promises to our military personnel veterans and their \neligible family members.\n  Those are all components of the more detailed plan I outlined this \npast year in Indiana.\n  Most important, I believe the underlying principles to ensure that \nour health care system is one that preserves personal freedoms and puts \nindividuals in control of their own health care decisions is critical \nto addressing the next bill we take up.\n  Let's take this opportunity now and listen to the patients, listen to \nthe health care providers, the physicians and listen to the job \ncreators and small business owners and then let's listen to the \nAmerican people who sent us here to represent them. Let's repeal this \nlaw and let's start over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it seems to me that what we \nought to be doing with regard to this law is fixing it instead of \nrepealing it. We ought to be focusing on fixing it instead of focusing \non repeal. Already, unanimously, it seems, people have embraced \ndifferent parts of this law as certainly necessary. You could go down \nthe list. Twenty-six-year-olds can now stay on their parents' health \ninsurance policies. Health insurance companies can't go off spending \nall kinds of money on all kinds of jet airplanes and vacations. They \nhave to deliver, on large group insurance policies, 85 cents of health \ncare out of the $1 of premium paid--85 percent.\n  Then, of course, you can't have a health insurance company cancel you \nin the middle of your coverage. Who in the world would not embrace this \nin the law; that is, you can't have some silly kind of reason that you \nare not going to give health insurance to a patient because they had a \npreexisting condition when, in fact, they had a skin rash, and that is \nan excuse.\n  There is a lot in this law that is good, not the least of which is \nthat there are 35 million people out of the 45 million who are \nuninsured in this country who, come 2014, will have private insurance, \nprivate exchanges, called health insurance exchanges, in each State, to \nwhich they can go and shop for health insurance. If they can't afford \nit because they are somewhere between that and the rate at which they \nare eligible for Medicaid or they are up to 400 percent of the poverty \nlevel for a family of four, they will have some assistance from the \nFederal Government so they can purchase that private enterprise \nexchange insurance. If you can bring 35 million people into the health \ninsurance system, what happens to it? If they have health insurance, \nthey start getting preventive care. That means you avoid what happens \nnow, which is they don't have health insurance, they avoid going to the \ndoctor because they can't afford it, and they wait until the health \nproblem turns into an emergency. Where do they end up? They end up in \nthe emergency room, which is the most expensive place now, with a full-\nblown emergency, and the laws of the 50 States require the emergency \nrooms to treat\n\n[[Page S457]]\n\nthose people. Guess what. Who pays? All the rest of us pay.\n  So if you can bring 35 million people out of the 40-some million \nuninsured Americans into the health insurance system, you bring down \nthe per-unit cost that all the rest of us pay, which is tacked onto the \nhealth insurance premiums we pay. Because when the hospital picks up \nthe tab, who do you think pays? It is distributed right out to the \nhealth insurance system, and the rest of us end up paying. So there is \na lot of good in here. What we ought to do is fix it. We should not \nrepeal it.\n  There is another issue that has arisen in this great debate we are \nhaving, which is of historic proportions, on what is going to happen to \nthis law that was passed in this body by a 60-vote margin. What has \nhappened is there have been a lot of lawsuits filed. In two cases, \nFederal district judges have ruled the law is constitutional. In two \nother cases, Federal district judges--this is the lower court of the \nFederal court system--have ruled it is not constitutional. Of course, \nwe have had action by the legislative branch, the other House, the \nHouse of Representatives, which has voted to repeal the law. Now here \nwe are with the issue in front of us on which we will vote later today.\n  Well, doesn't anybody conclude that this matter is going to the \nSupreme Court to decide if this law is constitutional? When the Supreme \nCourt decides, regardless of what we have done or what we haven't done, \nthe Supreme Court decision is going to discard political and partisan \ninterests. So isn't it in our commonsense interest if we would come \nhere and join together in a resolution to petition the Supreme Court to \nhave an expedited review of this case?\n  Typically, what happens with these two for and two against, that will \nwork its way up through the court of appeals, and that will take \nanother year, year and a half, and then it will get to the Supreme \nCourt. That will take another year, year and a half. Why don't we \nexpedite the matter? Why don't we express our intent to have an \nexpedited review by the Supreme Court?\n  I have filed such a sense of the Congress--a resolution--and its \npassage might prevent people from arguing back and forth over this law \nfor the next several years. Everybody in this country that will be \naffected would have an answer, and they deserve an answer. Therefore, I \nurge the Senate to consider adopting the resolution asking the Supreme \nCourt to step in and decide quickly whether the current law meets the \nconstitutional test.\n  My preference is that we fix the law, that we not throw it out. I \ndon't want to go back to the days of the insurance companies dropping \npeople because they get sick or depriving seniors of help getting their \nprescription drugs. But because the matter ultimately is going to be \nresolved by the Nation's highest Court, I think we ought to take a \ncommonsense approach on this resolution. I urge my colleagues to adopt \nit.\n  Mr. President, I see no one else is on the floor seeking recognition. \nI will just add that another commonsense component in this law that \ncertainly means don't repeal it is the assistance that is given to \nsenior citizens.\n  That assistance is in the form of help with the cost of their \nprescription drugs. The Congress passed, and it was signed into law \nyears ago, a prescription drug benefit, but that benefit was only \npartially assisted by the Federal Government, and senior citizens had \nto pick up a big part of the tab. This law closes a lot of that gap, \nwhat is commonly referred to as the doughnut hole. We do not want to \ntake that away from senior citizens. I certainly think that is going to \nstand the constitutional muster.\n  There is another part of this law that is so beneficial as well, and \nthat is, are we not concerned about the deficit, are we not concerned \nabout how we are going to get our country back on a road toward balance \nof our deficit so that we have a balanced budget? What this law does, \nwhich seems to me common sense that you do not want to repeal it, it \nsaves the Federal Government, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, a nonpartisan, highly technical economic team, $250 billion \nover the next 10 years and in the second 10-year period would save up \nto $1.2 trillion to the Federal Government.\n  There are plenty of reasons that we ought to fix it instead of \nrepealing it. I urge my colleagues--and I see my dear friend from the \nState of Nevada came in. Before he came in, I had urged us to consider \na sense-of-the-Congress resolution to have an expedited appeal to the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by the Republican leader to repeal what I believe is an \nunconstitutional government takeover of our health care system. Make no \nmistake, we all want to improve access to affordable health insurance \nfor all Americans, including those individuals with preexisting \nconditions. Unfortunately, this health reform law is not the right \nprescription.\n  Over the past year, I have spoken with tens of thousands of Nevadans \nabout this bill. They were very clear when they said that this law is \nnot the cure for our broken health care system.\n  This law imposes new burdens on most Nevadans and most Americans. It \nrequires that every American citizen purchase health insurance \ncoverage. Those who fail to buy health insurance that meets the minimum \nrequirements are subject to financial penalties.\n  Two weeks ago, I received an e-mail message from Tommy Felt, a Boy \nScout in Las Vegas. This is a picture of Tommy. He is 12 years old. He \nattends Molasky Junior High School, and he is working to earn his \nCitizenship in the Nation Merit Badge.\n  Tommy's e-mail stated:\n\n       I'm really concerned that the bill will damage our country. \n     I think it is unconstitutional for the government to force \n     citizens to buy health coverage. Also, I believe that the \n     hidden costs in this bill will drive our country much deeper \n     into debt. My dad says that this bill will lead to the \n     elimination of Senior Dimensions and Medicare Advantage plans \n     for our seniors.\n\n  I wish that more than half of my colleagues would heed the words of \nthis young 12-year-old.\n  I could not agree with Tommy more. I, too, am also concerned that \nthis health reform law will destroy our health system in our country. I \nam also concerned about the unprecedented overreach of the government's \ndemand that every American purchase health insurance just because they \nlive in America.\n  A judge in Florida, as we have all heard, ruled that the entire \nhealth care law is unconstitutional. Let's ask the question, Is it \nreally Constitutional for the government to tell all Americans they \nmust buy health insurance coverage? What is next? What personal liberty \nor property will the Congress seek to take away from Americans next? \nWill the government mandate what cars we are allowed to drive or what \nfood we feed our children? Where do we draw the line? Or will we even \ndraw one at all?\n  After all, the Constitution is about enumerated powers, the specific \npowers given to the Congress. This bill blows the lid off those \nenumerated powers.\n  I have spoken at length about the unconstitutional provision and even \nraised a Constitutional Point of Order before the Senate voted to pass \nthis reform bill.\n  As I previously mentioned, earlier this week, a Florida judge ruled \nthe individual mandate unconstitutional and even went so far as to say \nthat the whole bill is unconstitutional because the mandate cannot be \nseparated out. In December 2010, a Federal judge in Virginia also \nstruck down the individual mandate as unconstitutional.\n  We know it could take several years for this case to reach the \nSupreme Court of the United States. My good friend from Florida, \nSenator Nelson, talked about expediting that procedure--which makes a \nlot of sense--so that we do not have to wait several years for the \nSupreme Court to reach its decision. The administration should ask for \nthat. The administration has the right to bypass the Court of Appeals \nand go directly to the Supreme Court. In the meantime, because it\n\n[[Page S458]]\n\nmay take several years, we should act to repeal this law before we \nbegin to suffer under its tyranny.\n  Now, going back to Tommy. His e-mail addresses the significant costs \nassociated with this health reform bill. Tommy has every right to be \nconcerned. In fact, every American should be concerned. Spending in \nthis country has continued to spiral out-of-control. The health reform \nlaw is only adding to our financial demise. Unless we repeal it, the \nlaw will further exacerbate the cost of health care, explode our \ndeficit and debt, and forever alter the relationship between the \ngovernment and the American people.\n  We hear from the other side that this bill is going to reduce the \ndeficit because there are $500 billion in cuts to Medicare as well as \ntax increases. By the way, the Congress could repeal those cuts in \nMedicare and often does. The other side also used fuzzy math when this \nbill was being debated. A lot of the savings in Medicare were counted \ntwice. That is why a study by the Republican side of the Senate Budget \nCommittee said that this bill would actually increase the deficit in \nthe first 10 years by $700 billion.\n  Let's have some common sense. Do you think you can increase the \nMedicaid rolls by 16 million people in America and actually cut costs? \nDoes that make sense to anyone? Increase the Medicaid rolls, which are \npaid by the Federal Government and the States, and then say we are \nactually going to decrease the deficit? That defies common sense.\n  Many small business owners in my State have already seen a dramatic \nincrease in their health insurance premiums. This bill was supposed to \nbring down costs. It is doing exactly the opposite.\n  I have met with many companies across our State. At least three large \ncompanies I've met with tell me they are considering, because of the \ncosts, dropping their health insurance and paying the $2,000 fine per \nemployee. It makes sense to them. They can pay their employees a little \nstipend, they can put their employees on the government system, and \nthey are money ahead.\n  With businesses struggling just to make it today, this decision could \nbe the difference between staying in business or not. They are looking \nat huge increases in their premiums, or paying the fine and putting \npeople on the government system. That is one of the reasons I think \nthis bill is going to massively increase the Federal debt.\n  This law does not help the typical Nevada family who purchases \ninsurance in the individual market either. In fact, in traveling the \nState, I met with Nevadans who are already seeing increases in their \npremiums. Those who purchase insurance plans in the individual market \ncould see a 10- to 13-percent increase in their premiums because of \nthis bill. But some of the small businesses that I have talked with are \nalready seeing increases this year around 15 to 30 percent. A few of \nthe small businesses are seeing increases around 8 or 9 percent, but \nmost of them are in the 15- to 30-percent range.\n  In my State, unfortunately, about 70 percent of all the health plans \nprovided by businesses will not meet the minimum requirements that will \nbe mandated by the government starting in 2014.\n  In Tommy's e-mail to me, he also mentioned Medicare Advantage. There \nare more than 100,000 Nevada seniors who choose a Medicare Advantage \nplan. These Nevadans are not better off because of this reform. Their \nextra benefits actually will be reduced by more than half.\n  This bill does not help middle-income workers in Nevada either. Our \nhard-working hotel housekeepers, casino restaurant workers, airline \nworkers, teachers, and police officers now look forward to collectively \nsharing the burden of the $200 billion tax on health insurance holders.\n  Many American workers will pay for new taxes and penalties with \nreduced wages and lost jobs. Oh, and by the way, there are also new \ntaxes on prescription drugs, clinical lab work, and medical devices \nthat will also get passed on to the American people.\n  Simply put, I believe this health care bill is a job killer. My State \ncannot afford to lose more jobs. We have 14.5 percent unemployment in \nmy State, and 9.4 or 9.6 percent across the Nation. We cannot afford to \nlose more jobs.\n  I am sure many of us have heard the phrase that the devil is in the \ndetails. Truer words could not be spoken when talking about this health \ncare reform bill.\n  We know when Democrats passed this legislation that they gave \nenormous discretion to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. But \nI do not think any of us could have fathomed that the 2,000-page bill \nwould generate potentially up to 20,000 new pages and regulations.\n  I have printed off many of the rules and regulations as well as the \nbill itself. Look at the size of this stack, and they are not even \nclose to being done writing all the regulations. I challenge any \ncompany or any American to try to understand this bill and its \nregulations. It is virtually impossible. It takes a team of lawyers and \nhealth care experts to even come close to understanding all the \nimplications of this bill.\n  According to my staff's calculations, so far there are about 6,200 \npages of regulations. As I mentioned before, this could go to at least \n20,000 pages. It is safe to say that the devil is in the details with \nthis health bill.\n  The American people are going to learn more about the unintended \nconsequences of this legislation as more and more of these regulations \nroll out. Remember last year when Nancy Pelosi said, We have to pass \nthe bill so we can find out what is in it. We may be able to find out \nwhat is in the bill if you are able to understand it when you get \nthrough reading it all. I wonder how many people in this body have read \nnot only the legislation but the rules regulations. It is absolutely \ndaunting.\n  This health care reform bill is an over 2,700-page bill full of new \ntaxes on Americans, funding cuts for programs they rely on, and raised \npremiums, which is why we should be repealing this bill. Instead of \ndoing so, however, this administration is granting special waivers to \nvarious provisions in this law. These waivers are basically exceptions \nto the rules, and they allow organizations to circumvent the standards \nrequired in this health reform law. If waivers are needed, isn't that \nproof the health care reform bill is problematic? Isn't it proof this \nhealth care reform bill isn't working, or are special interest waivers \na greater priority than the plight of the American people? It is \ninteresting to me that some of the biggest supporters of this law have \nbeen working behind the scenes so they can obtain special waivers to \nget out of complying with this law so that they will not be held to the \nsame standards as businesses in Nevada.\n\n  Nevadans are not behind this bill. The American people are not behind \nthis bill. But there is no doubt that we need to improve health care in \nthe United States. What is the primary problem with health care in the \nUnited States? The new Senator from Kentucky said it best: It is too \nexpensive to buy health insurance in the United States. This bill does \nnothing but make that problem worse.\n  The people of this country did not sign up for the kind of change \nthat brings with it billions of dollars in new taxes and a potential \nloss of their current insurance coverage or the choice to decide which \ncoverage they have. The American people don't want a bureaucrat coming \nbetween them and their doctor.\n  Now, turning my attention back to taxes just for a moment, this bill \nalone ensures that hard-working Americans hand over even more of their \npaychecks each month to the government. It is funny how reforming \nhealth care means more money for Uncle Sam.\n  There is a new surtax on investment income--which, yes, does include \na gain on home sales--which has many Nevadans infuriated.\n  There are new limits on the use of flexible spending accounts, which \nconcerns many Nevadans who use these accounts to fund exceptional \nmedical costs, even though President Obama promised that people could \nkeep their current health care plans.\n  There is also a new tax on certain employer-provided health care--the \nso-called Cadillac plans. There are taxes on drug companies, medical \ndevices, indoor tanning services, and the onerous 1099 reporting \nrequirements for small businesses that, apparently, even President \nObama opposes now.\n\n[[Page S459]]\n\n  President Obama said in his State of the Union Address that we need \nto fix parts of the bill that need fixing and move forward. Well, I \nbelieve this whole bill needs fixing. So let's repeal it and replace it \nwith real health care reform that actually attacks cost, the No. 1 \nproblem in health care in the United States. We can go back to the \ndrawing board, take the best ideas from both sides of the aisle, and \nput together a health reform bill that will take us into the future.\n  Republicans have come up with many ideas on ways to fix the Nation's \nbroken health care system. The answer is not unbearable taxes, \nunsustainable growth of the government, or paying for a brandnew \nentitlement program.\n  Those aren't the qualities of comprehensive health reform. They are \nthe qualities of a terrible policy that will lead to devastating \nresults for Americans and our health care system, which is the best in \nthe world. There is a better way. It will take time, but if we can \nchange the way Americans think about health care, then we can create a \nbetter system.\n  Imagine a system where Americans get to keep their choices in health \ncare and where they are allowed to buy insurance across State lines. \nImagine a system where there is transparency, where you know how much \nyour doctor's visit will cost and how much your surgery will be. Ask \nyourself: When was the last time you went to a doctor's office and got \na written estimate? In this third-party payer system we have, where \nsomeone else is paying the bill and you are receiving the service, the \ndoctors don't care what you think of the cost. So there is no \ntransparency in today's system. We need to have a system that is \ntransparent, where you can shop around for the best value for your \nmoney.\n  Imagine a system that rewards individuals for engaging in healthy \nbehaviors. Imagine a system where you are not punished for having a \npreexisting condition. Imagine a system that allows small businesses to \npool their purchasing power together to provide health insurance to \ntheir employees through small business health plans.\n  Imagine a system where doctors can practice medicine to heal patients \ninstead of practicing medicine with the goal of not being sued. And \nimagine a patient-centered health care system instead of an insurance-\ncentered system or a government-centered system, which is what we have \ntoday.\n  These are all standards we should work toward. We cannot afford to \nsettle for this bill.\n  I believe this bill will bankrupt our country, our families, and our \nneighbors.\n  We simply cannot survive with this agenda of taxing and spending away \nour future. We can't survive it; we can't afford it.\n  Mr. President, I believe we should repeal this bill: all of its \npages, all of its regulations, all of the regulations to come. I \nbelieve we should work together--not as Republicans, not as Democrats--\nas Americans to address the primary problem in health care in this \ncountry: the cost. It is critical for the future competitiveness of \nAmerican business, and it is incredibly important for the quality of \nhealth care and for the future of our citizens as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in strong, vehement opposition to \nthe amendment offered by the minority leader, Senator McConnell, to \nrepeal the health care reform law.\n  First, I would say to my good friend from Nevada, yes, we would like \nto work together to further reduce costs, but this bill does reduce \ncosts significantly. The CBO has said in no uncertain terms that repeal \nwould balloon the deficit by $230 billion in the first decade and more \nthan $1 trillion in the second decade. That is because the law smokes \nout a good deal of the waste, the inefficiency, and the duplication \nthat we all know is part of our system.\n  That is the place where we have to continue to work together. Our \ncountry delivers the best health care in the world, but it is also the \nmost inefficient. We spend 17 percent of our GDP on health care. The \nnext highest spending country is only 10 percent. Under the reformed \nlaw, we will begin the first large step in keeping quality care but \ngetting costs under control.\n  If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said: You know, you \nare right; we have to reduce costs, we have a better way and they \noffered a bill on the floor, well, then, maybe we would take a look at \nit. But they are silent. It is very easy to sit there and say repeal, \nbut what would they put in its place?\n  The reason this amendment will be so easily defeated today is because \na budget point of order says if you are going to raise the deficit $230 \nbillion in the first decade and $1 trillion in the second, you better \nfind out where that money is coming from. The other side is silent, not \na peep about where that money would come from. So that makes one feel \nthis is sort of for show. Let's wave the flag for some of our hard-core \nsupporters who definitely want repeal, but there is nothing in its \nplace.\n  The old mantra the other side seemed to have--some of them--of repeal \nand replace is gone. It is now repeal and we have nothing to replace it \nwith. That does not meet with the favor of the American people. In \nfact, the number who are against repeal is growing. Only about one-\nfifth of those who say they want to see the law changed want full \nrepeal. Only 20 percent of the public wants full repeal. If those \nnumbers are correct, and I believe they are, that means almost \ncertainly that a majority of Republican voters don't want full repeal.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, and particularly in this area of \nhealth care, is that talking about deficit reduction is a lot easier \nthan doing it. That fact is evidenced by the amendment my friend, the \nleader from Kentucky, will offer. That is why a budget point of order \nis the appropriate response, and that is why this will be defeated \nrather handily.\n  In later days maybe my colleagues will come up with parts of the bill \nthey wish to change. We will be open to it. Today Senator Stabenow is \noffering an amendment to change the 1099 section of the law. She has \nworked with people on both sides of the aisle. I know Senator Johanns \nhas been a leader, the Republican from Nebraska. We are going to pass \nthat today. So the idea that we are unwilling to change any part of \nthis law is belied by what we are doing on the Senate floor.\n  We want to work together. But somehow, when we get a repeal \namendment--repeal the whole thing, no substitute, no answer to how to \ndeal with the debt--one wonders what this repeal is all about.\n  Furthermore, why is the American public becoming more favorable to \nthis law as we go through this debate? That is what the polling data \nhas shown. Well, I would give two reasons. First, many of the horrors \nthat were bandied about as the law was being put together are proving \nnot to be true.\n  I will never forget that last summer someone came to me, a gentleman \nfrom Long Island, and he said: Senator Schumer, I am a Democrat. I have \nvoted for you in every election, but I am not going to vote for you \nagain.\n  I said: Why?\n  He said: I hate the health care law.\n  I said: What do you hate about it?\n  He said: I am going to lose my health care benefits on Labor Day.\n  I said: What is your profession?\n  He said: I am a New York City firefighter. He lived on Long Island, \nbut he was a New York City firefighter.\n  Well, anyone who knows even a little about the health care bill knows \nthat a New York City firefighter will not lose their benefits on Labor \nDay or any other time under this provision. But this poor man had \nlistened to some talk radio and they had convinced him he was going to \nlose his benefits.\n  But that is all fading. I haven't spoken to the gentleman since. I \ndon't know his name. I just met him at a summer street fair. But he has \nfound his benefits are just as good today as they were on the day \nbefore Labor Day, so it is pretty logical to suppose he would have said \nrepeal the law a year ago but wouldn't say so today.\n  But there is another reason, and probably an even more important \nreason, this law is gaining support as people learn about it, and we \nowe some thanks to our Republican colleagues because they have given us \na second chance to make a first impression. Most who looked last year \nsaid the messaging--rightly or wrongly, falsely or truly--was done \nbetter by the opponents than by the proponents of the\n\n[[Page S460]]\n\nlaw. But now, as people look at the law, they are learning about the \nmany good things in the bill.\n  I daresay that most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwant to keep those good things. I would be quite certain that the vast \nmajority of Americans would want to keep those things, and the polling \ndata backs that up.\n  So when you say repeal, when you just use a hatchet and not a \nscalpel, you lose all the good things, many of which are in effect \ntoday. So I would ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \nsupport repeal: Do you support increasing prescription drug costs for \nour Nation's seniors? Thanks to this law, the so-called doughnut hole--\nwhich was created in the prescription drug plan of 2003 under George \nBush--will be fixed. Seniors who fall into this doughnut hole--which \nsays when they pay about $2,500 for drugs, the government will help \nthem no longer--will now get a 50-percent discount on their \nmedications. This first year that will amount to a savings of $550 for \nthe average senior.\n  When you are a senior on a fixed income, $550 is a nice amount of \nchange, and that will help a whole lot of people. The discount keeps \nincreasing every year until the last crumb of the doughnut hole is \ngone.\n  I will admit that is a mixed metaphor because a doughnut hole, by \ndefinition, has no crumbs. But good try, staff. Excellent work, in any \ncase. It sounded very good to me too.\n  But in these times, these savings aren't exactly chicken feed. They \nwill make a huge difference for seniors. The average senior, when the \ndoughnut hole is fully eliminated--crumbs and all--will save more than \n$2,000 a year.\n  How about the provision that helps young people? Every one of us \nknows of instances where young men and women get out of college or get \nout of high school and they go into the job market. Oftentimes those \nnew jobs they are seeking do not provide health care. That happens \nquite often. It is a new job, it is a low-paying job, they are just \nstarting out. I know--I have spoken to many young people like this, and \ntheir parents--there is a lot of anguish. Does that young person who \nmaybe has a job that pays $25,000 or $30,000 a year pay $1,000 a month \nfor health care for himself or herself? They cannot afford that.\n  On the other hand, to go without health care insurance--yes, they are \nyoung and healthy but God forbid they have an accident, go to the \nhospital, come up with some unusual and rare and expensive disease. \nWhat are they going to do? This keeps lots of young people and their \nparents up at night. This new bill solves that problem because you can \nstay on your parents' health care insurance, should they have it, until \nyou are 26. By then you are in the labor force a little bit longer and \nthe likelihood of your employer giving you health care is somewhat \ngreater. Do my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to take \nthat away? If so, what are you going to put in its place? What are you \ngoing to tell the young people, 22 and 23 and 24 and 25 and 26, to do?\n  Then there is another provision that I think is worth keeping--\npreventive medicine. We all know one of the big problems with our \nhealth care system as opposed to some of the others in some of the \nother western countries is we do not do enough prevention. So instead \nof a disease being nipped in the bud, making the patient healthier and \ncosting the system a whole lot less, it waits and waits. Those of us \nwho put this health care bill together realized that and said early \ndetection saves not only lives but billions of dollars. In this health \ncare bill Medicare will provide a free wellness checkup once a year for \nevery senior citizen. If there is a little bit of illness, they can nip \nit in the bud.\n  We all know the earlier you detect cancer or heart disease or \ndiabetes or emphysema, the better chance of curing it and the less \nexpensive to cure it. This is going to save billions of dollars. Just \ngiving certain tests at these wellness checkups will save people \nthemselves money but, more importantly, save the Medicare system money, \na lot of money. It is important for the people to save their money too, \nof course. This makes a great deal of sense.\n  A mammography can find breast cancer before it metastasizes. A simple \nblood test can find prostate cancer before it spreads. What are my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle going to say to seniors? What \nare they going to say to the Medicare system, which is trying to get \nmore effective by getting involved in early detection and prevention? \nForget it? That is what you are doing when you vote for repeal. You \nhave nothing in its place.\n  How about the small business tax credit? My dad was a small \nbusinessman. He had a little exterminating business. I know how small \nbusinessmen struggle. My father truly never became happy until he left \nthe business. Now, praise God, he is 87 and he is a much happier guy \nthan he was, even at 60, struggling in that business. One of the \ndilemmas that small business people face is the high cost of medical \ncare for their employees. They want to provide it, A, because they want \ntheir employees to be healthy, B, because they like most of their \nemployees, and C, because they want to keep the employees from going \nsomewhere else if they are good--but it costs so darned much. Here is \nwhat is in the bill. If you are a small business that makes less than \n$1.2 million and you have 25 or fewer employees, you get a 35-percent \ncredit, going up to 50 percent in 2014. That is a huge help to small \nbusinesses that are already providing health care for their workers, \nand a great incentive for small businesses that are not already to do \nso. Hundreds of thousands of small businesses in my State alone will \nbenefit from this. What, my friends on the other side of the aisle, are \nyou saying to those small businesses? What are you saying to their \nworkers? Go at it alone? Because you want to repeal it but you have \nnothing--nothing--to replace it.\n  There is one more provision I want to speak of. There are so many \ngood things in this bill. No matter how much you don't like some of the \nbad provisions--and I know that is genuinely held by some of my \ncolleagues--to just repeal it and get rid of the good stuff makes no \nsense, in my judgment. We have all heard the horror stories of \ninsurance companies--when you go to them after you, your spouse, your \nkid has an illness and you say: Thank God, I have insurance--the \ninsurance company deliberately, or maybe not but anyway they say: Mr. \nSmith, you did not check off that little box on page 17. You did not \ndot that I or cross that t. You are not covered.\n  We all know the intent was to cover it. We all know the insurance \ncompany was happy to take the premiums even without that dotted I or \ncrossed t or checked box when the family was healthy and money was \ncoming in. But now all of a sudden they say bye-bye. This bill does not \nallow that to happen.\n  The kinds of rescission I talked about are banned. What are we \nsaying, not just to the families who have experienced this but to every \nAmerican family with insurance who worries about this? What are we \nsaying to them? Again, you have nothing in its place because you are \nrepealing, not replacing, even though people said early on that is not \nwhat they are doing.\n  I have one more point before I conclude. We are willing to work with \nyou. The Stabenow amendment on the floor of the Senate shows that. I \nwould have drafted it a different way and there will be a Levin \namendment that I would prefer. But either way we are going to address \nthe 1099 issue. Many people on your side of the aisle, many people on \nour side recognize that was a mistake. Not every bill is perfect. We \nare not digging in and saying we have to have the bill exactly as \nwritten and exactly as drafted. But you are doing the inverse--you are \nsaying we have to have no part of this bill because if you wanted to \nretain parts of it you would have had an amendment on the floor saying \ntake these parts out and keep these parts in. But you are not. Why? \nYour guess is as good as mine. But it is a lot easier to tear down than \ncreate, as we learned when we did the health care bill. But you have an \nobligation, unless you believe there should not be a health care system \nor we ought to go back to the system without any changes in the law \nthat we have, which nobody liked. It is not fair.\n  In conclusion, No. 1, this bill reduces the deficit. The repeal \nincreases the deficit and there is no money there to make up for those \nfunds that the bill would bring in by cost cutting and by\n\n[[Page S461]]\n\nfees. No. 2, there are lots of good things in the bill that probably my \ncolleagues would support but they get rid of them with no replacement--\nnothing. Nothing for the seniors, nothing for the 21- to 26-year-olds, \nnothing for the people who are treated poorly by their insurance \ncompanies. And, No. 3, we want to work with you. There are some changes \nwe could work together on in the bill, not only 1099 but walking \nfarther down the road of reducing the inefficiencies in the system, the \nhigh cost, the waste, by still preserving good care for the people who \nget it. That is something that would lend itself, particularly in these \ntimes of high deficits, to bipartisan support and working together.\n  Today, simple repeal, again, it may feed some red meat to the \nminority in this country. It is a small minority, if you believe the \npolling, who say repeal it. But the responsible job of a legislator, \nwhether you agree with this bill or disagree with this bill, is not to \nrepeal but to improve. That is not happening today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise in strong and vehement support of \nthe amendment of Senator McConnell to repeal the health care reform law \nas now constituted, and I will support replacing it with reforms that \ntruly provide Americans with access to quality, affordable health care, \nreduce skyrocketing health care costs, and put our Nation on a more \nsustainable fiscal path. These good goals can be achieved. But this \ncurrent bill does not do it.\n  I am pleased to see my colleague say he would accept some amendments, \nbut the Johanns amendment he referenced was voted on twice last year. \nWhen the Democrats held a significant majority in this body they voted \nit down. After seven new Members have been added, many of them elected \non a promise to repeal this bill--virtually everyone on the promise to \nrepeal this bill--we now have agreement to change the 1099 reporting \nrequirements, which is about one-thousandth of 1 percent of what is \nsignificant about this legislation. Indeed, if Senator Scott Brown had \nbeen elected a month or so sooner, the bill would not have been passed \non December 24, the day before Christmas.\n  The truth is, the American people have never supported this bill. \nPolling numbers show they still do not support this bill. The \nDemocratic health care legislation was sold as a package that would \nreduce insurance premiums by $2,500 dollars per family. We were told \nthat repeatedly. It was also supposed to reduce the Federal deficit, \nand immediately create 400,000 new jobs.\n  Sadly, none of these promises were met. They were all false. The \nclaims were attacked on this floor by sophisticated people who pointed \nout how these matters were not going to be achieved, and they have not \nbeen. They were false then, and they are false now.\n  Instead, the new health care law will cause health care spending to \nrise over the next decade. Americans will see dramatic increases in \ntheir premiums. That is a fact. The Federal deficit will increase by an \nadditional $700 billion. This bill does not reduce the deficit, and the \nlaw's expensive mandates, penalties, and tax hikes will lead to job \nlosses and layoffs that will damage our economy. The last thing we need \nto do now is to have employers lay off people because of surging health \ncare costs, as is happening. Talk to small businesses in your community \nto confirm this.\n  As our Nation's reckless fiscal policy and surging debt bring us ever \ncloser to a tipping point--a debt crisis that could substantially \ndamage our country, as it has others around the world--respected \neconomists have stressed the need for Congress to reduce Federal \nspending and contain mounting health care cost. But rather than tackle \nthese problems that threaten the long-term stability of our Nation, the \nnew health care law exacerbates our fiscal crisis by creating a new, \nopen-ended entitlement, a monumental new entitlement program and by \nintroducing $2.6 trillion in new spending. Tell me how we can spend \n$2.6 trillion and not increase our country's debt.\n  Entitlements today are hammering our budget. They are surging our \ndeficit. Entitlements are dangerous things. The last thing we need to \ndo is create a new entitlement program that is not going to have \nrestrained spending. According to the Congressional Budget Office, our \nofficial analysts appointed by the Democratic majority, says that the \nhealth care law will cause insurance premiums in the individual market \nto soar by 10 percent to 13 percent; for American families, translating \ninto a $2,100 increase in their costs for purchasing health care \ncoverage by 2016. That is huge.\n  Another $2,100? That is a stunning development, and it is the exact \nopposite of the promises for the bill. CBO determined that. Total \nhealth care spending in the United States consumes already 17.3 percent \nof GDP, and we have felt that was too high. It is the largest of any \nindustrialized nation in the world. But under this new law, the \nnational health care spending will approach 20 percent of GDP by the \nend of this decade.\n  Sadly, many supporters of the health care law continue to perpetuate \nthe myth that repealing this law would increase the deficit. My friend, \nSenator Schumer, said: Repeal the law, and the deficit will go up. A \nthorough examination of the law pulls back the curtains and exposes the \ndeceptive budget gimmicks to reveal its true cost.\n  First, our Democratic colleagues double counted $398 billion in \nMedicare costs and taxes, $29 billion in Social Security taxes, $70 \nbillion in new long-term health care premiums to pay for the new health \ncare spending--all double counted money. It is the largest false \naccounting scheme, I suppose, in the history of the world.\n  Think I am exaggerating? December 23--the night before this health \ncare bill was finally passed 60 to 40, 60 Democrats, 40 Republicans--I \ncalled the Congressional Budget Office and Dr. Elmendorf, selected by \nour Democratic colleagues to be the Budget Director. This is what he \nsaid: The key point is, savings to the HI trust fund--that is the \nhospital insurance trust fund of Medicare--under the health care bill \nwould be received by the government only once, so they cannot be set \naside to pay for future Medicare spending and, at the same time, pay \nfor current spending on the other parts of the legislation or on other \nprograms.\n  This bill was cutting Medicare benefits and raising Medicare taxes. \nThey did not use the money to strengthen Medicare, which is heading to \ninsolvency. They took the money and spent it on a new program. \nActually, they borrowed the money from Medicare. But it was not the \nTreasury's money to spend on new programs.\n  The way it was written, the CBO score double counted the money. It is \nthis money that they are counting to say this bill actually creates a \nsurplus. Without this money, there is no surplus.\n  Since Medicare is going into deficit, they are going to call their \ndebt instruments, their bonds from the Treasury as they go into \ndeficit. By the way, the U.S. Treasury pays Medicare interest on the \nmoney they borrowed from them to start this new program. Soon that \nmoney is going to be gone. We are going to have to borrow money on the \nopen market to fund this new entitlement, and the new entitlement is \ngoing to cost far more than is currently estimated.\n  Over the 10-year budget window, the Congressional Budget Office \nreports point out how the law was doctored to start certain revenue \nenhancements, taxes, and so forth now, but only starting the \nexpenditure programs in 2014. Why is that important? Well, they got a \nscore from CBO of what it would cost over 10 years. So you get income \nfor 10 years and you get expenditures for 6. This plus the double \ncounting of the money and several other gimmicks might look pretty \ngood, which is how they say this is creating a surplus. But it is not a \nsurplus.\n  As the ranking member on the Budget Committee, I am stunned by how \ndifficult and how challenging our current financial situation is. We \nhave to do something about it. We need the President to help us and \nlead, but he is not, so it looks like Congress may have to tackle it.\n  The former Director of the CBO, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who \nunderstands budget gimmicks and has seen them for many years, cowrote \nan article in the Wall Street Journal in January that eliminates any \nconfusion about the law's impact. I am disappointed that Members of our \nSenate are still coming down here to suggest that repeal of this law is \ngoing to adversely impact our deficit. I am stunned to see this \ncontinue to be repeated.\n\n[[Page S462]]\n\n  This is what Dr. Holtz-Eakin, a highly respected individual, said in \nthe Wall Street Journal in January. The article is entitled, ``Health \nCare Repeal Won't Add to the Deficit.''\n  He said this:\n\n       Repeal is a logical first step towards restoring fiscal \n     sanity.\n\n  Fiscal sanity. He goes on:\n\n       How then does the Affordable Care Act magically convert $1 \n     trillion in new spending into painless deficit reduction? It \n     is all about budget gimmicks, deceptive accounting, and \n     implausible assumptions used to create the false impression \n     of fiscal discipline. Repeal is not a budget buster, keeping \n     the Affordable Care Act is.\n\n  This Dr. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office. There is no question about it. That is a stunning thing. \nA poll by the Kaiser Foundation and Harvard University released last \nweek revealed that the American people are seeing through these ploys. \nThey have heard these talks before, and they are not buying it. Sixty \npercent of the country believes the health care law will increase the \ndeficit over the next 10 years, while only 11 percent think it will \nlower the deficit.\n  So, colleagues, give us a break, would you? The American people are \nnot going to buy this argument. I wish it would not be repeated. But \nthe President continues to say it himself. Clearly, the American \npeople, once again, show they are wiser than their government leaders \nin many instances.\n  The final point I would like to make about the health care law is its \ndebilitating impact on jobs. The expensive mandates and penalties \nincluded in the health care law, coupled with rising costs of insurance \nfacing families and businesses, are costing us jobs right now, and it \nwill continue to do so in the future.\n  I will just add, I had meetings with small business groups in Phenix \nCity, AL, and Jasper, AL, with 10 or 15 individuals. Every one of them \ntold me, without question, this health care law would cause them to \nreduce their employment. We do not need to be reducing employment; we \nneed to be increasing employment.\n  This bill is a job killer. It is indisputable. Over 6,000 pages of \nregulations have been written. Economic estimates indicate that \nrepealing the law that threatens our economic recovery would save \n700,000 jobs. It is imperative that Congress repeals this law. Yes, we \nneed to start and continue to work on things we already agreed on, such \nas preexisting conditions, interstate competition, and other things \nthat we all agreed on and could agree on to make health care better. \nThat is not the massive Federal entitlement program that funded by \ndubious gimmicks imposed on the American people against their will and \ndamaging to the American economy.\n  We cannot allow this. It will be repealed, in my view. I know my time \nis up. I will just conclude by saying, we had a new election. A lot of \npeople took that issue to the American people. I think their voice was \nclear. The American people are not happy with Congress, which did not \nlisten to them and passed the bill against the public's wishes. They \nexpect Congress to reconsider it, eliminate it and start over with new \nlegislation.\n  Their message is clear, and that is what we need to do. I urge my \ncolleagues to support Senator McConnell's amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it is very hard for me to understand how \nanyone could be voting to repeal the entire health care bill. Because \nwhen you do that, among other things, what you are saying is that we \nwill continue the odious practice by insurance companies of denying \nhealth care to people who have preexisting conditions.\n  For 8 years under President Bush, more and more people lost their \nhealth insurance, the cost of health care soared, and our Republican \nfriends had virtually nothing to say on health care.\n  Now that a bill has been passed, which I am the first to agree is not \nthe best bill we could have passed--and I will tell you why. It has its \nshare of problems which should be remedied. But to say right now, when \n50 million Americans have no health insurance, when States all over \nthis country are wrestling with huge budget deficits, which no doubt \nwill result in millions more being thrown off health insurance, to say \nwe should retreat to where we were is beyond comprehension.\n  Second of all, for my Republican friends to say let's repeal health \ncare, there are millions of families who now are beginning to be able \nto include within their own health care plans their sons and daughters, \nup to the age of 26. Goodbye to that. Furthermore, in a nation which \nends up spending more on health care, almost double per person, \ncompared to any other nation on Earth, we have put in the health care \nreform bill billions of dollars for disease prevention.\n  We are, as a nation, very weak in terms of trying to keep people \nhealthy, trying to keep them out of the hospital. We spend a fortune on \npeople after they are sick. In this bill, we have made some significant \nsteps forward in terms of disease prevention, wellness, which is very \ncost effective in terms of health care dollars, not to mention human \npain and suffering.\n  In that regard, I am proud to have worked with a number of other \nSenators in doubling, in that bill, the number of community health \ncenters in America, which are providing the most cost-effective primary \nhealth care that is provided in this country, keeping people out of \nemergency rooms, keeping people out of hospitals, giving them access to \nprimary health care, dental care, low-cost prescription drugs, and \nmental health counseling.\n  In the midst of an extraordinary crisis in terms of primary health \ncare, where everybody recognizes we do not have enough primary health \ncare doctors or nurses or technicians, we tripled funding for the \nNational Health Service Corps, and it is already working effectively in \ngetting doctors and dentists and nurses and other practitioners into \nunderserved areas. All that would be undone. I think that makes no \nsense whatsoever.\n  Now, to my mind, what we have to do is not to repeal this bill but to \nmake it a better bill. I will give you one very specific suggestion \nthat I have worked on now for over 1 year. Senator Wyden has worked on \nthis, others have worked on it. That is to say, that if a State in this \ncountry, the State of Vermont, the State of Alaska, any other State, \ncan maintain the high standards for quality health care and coverage \nthat the national health care bill did, then that State should be given \nsignificant flexibility to perhaps do it in their own way and do it \nmore cost effectively.\n  I should tell you that in the State of Vermont, our new Governor is a \nsupporter of a Medicare-for-all single-payer program. There are other \nStates that want to move in a different direction, maintaining high \nstandards but doing it perhaps in a different way than has been \nproposed by the national legislation.\n\n  In my view, they should have that right. And if Vermont is effective \nin doing what I believe we could--providing quality health care to all \nof our people in a cost-effective way--I suspect other States around \nthe country can learn from Vermont's experience. I think that is a \npositive step forward.\n  The beauty of our Federalist system: 50 States--every State has a \ngood idea. I think if we maintain standards that are high and give \nStates flexibility, this can improve the health care reform bill we \npassed last year. But killing this whole bill makes no sense to me at \nall.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to say a word on an issue which is getting \nmore and more attention; that is, Social Security.\n  In my view, Social Security has proven itself to be the most \nsuccessful social program in American history. Over a 75-year period--\nand this is really extraordinary; we take it for granted, but it is an \nextraordinary success story--in good times and in bad times, Social \nSecurity has paid out every nickel owed to every eligible American. And \nit does that with a minimal administrative cost.\n  Despite its strong record of success over the last 75 years, Social \nSecurity now faces unprecedented attacks from Wall Street, from many of \nmy Republican friends, and from some Democrats. I have to be very \nclear: If the American people are not prepared to stand up and fight \nback, we could begin to see the dismantling of Social Security this \nvery year.\n\n[[Page S463]]\n\n  Let me cite the facts with regard to Social Security. I know when we \nwatch TV tonight there will be some guy up there saying: Social \nSecurity has gone bankrupt. Social Security is collapsing. That is \nabsolutely untrue. There has been a significant number of misstatements \nregarding Social Security. Here are the facts that nobody denies.\n  No. 1, according to the latest report of the Social Security \nAdministration, Social Security will be able to pay out 100 percent of \nall benefits owed to every eligible American for the next 26 years. \nNow, you tell me how a system is going bankrupt--we have a lot of \nproblems in this government, and our country faces enormous problems, \nbut when you can pay out every benefit owed to every eligible American \nfor the next 26 years, do not tell me this is a program in crisis or \ngoing bankrupt. After 2037, Social Security will be able to pay out 78 \npercent of promised benefits. Do we have to deal with that over the \nnext 26 years? Yes, we do. But it is not a crisis, and this Senator \nwill do everything he can to oppose any effort toward privatization, \nany effort to raise the retirement age, any effort to lower benefits.\n  Second point. Everybody is concerned about the deficit crisis we \nface--a $14 trillion national debt. How much has Social Security \ncontributed to the deficit and the national debt? How much? Well, not \none penny. Not one-half a penny. Social Security is funded by the \npayroll tax. Social Security has a $2.6 trillion surplus. That surplus \nwill go up. To attack Social Security because of the deficit crisis is \ngrossly unfair.\n  Do you want to know why the deficit went up? We are in the middle of \na recession. We fought two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and forgot to \npay for those wars. We gave hundreds of billions of dollars in tax \nbreaks to the wealthy; bailed out Wall Street; Medicare Part D \nprescription drug program, written by the insurance companies--all \nunfunded. Those are the reasons you have a deficit. Social Security has \nnothing to do with it.\n  So I would suggest that in the midst of all of this financial \ninstability that is out there, with the middle class shrinking and \npoverty increasing and people really worried about their retirement \nyears, one of the most significant things we as a Congress can do is \nstand up and say: We are there. We are going to protect Social \nSecurity. We are not going to cut it. And we are going to make it \nstronger so that, while it has done a great job for the last 75 years, \nit will continue to do a good job for the next 75 years.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nMcConnell amendment No. 13 that would completely repeal President \nObama's, in my view, unconstitutional health care bill. Of course, I \nwas an active participant in the debate last Congress about ObamaCare \nand fought that tooth and nail. The day after it passed into law, I \nintroduced a freestanding measure to repeal it completely. The first \nday of this new Congress that I could file bills, I reintroduced that \nmeasure. Of course, for all those reasons, I certainly support this \namendment that accomplishes that important goal.\n  Let me begin by responding to the suggestions of my distinguished \ncolleague from Vermont. Everybody who wants to repeal this law, \nincluding me--we do not want to do away with the idea that you should \nnot be shoved off insurance because of preexisting conditions, that you \nshould not have portability, you should not be able to meet those \nobligations. We do not think that at all. We are, however, for complete \nrepeal for a very simple reason.\n  What is wrong with this bill, what is wrong with ObamaCare is not one \ndetail here and one comma there, it is not at the periphery of the \nplan; it is at the heart of the plan, it is the essentials, it is the \ncore of the plan. We can and should and must pass significant reforms \nsuch as protection for individuals with preexisting conditions. That is \nwhy we have introduced those measures. We have advocated those measures \nin a targeted way. That does not mean we can or should or must preserve \nthe whole of ObamaCare, which has significant problems at the core of \nthat gargantuan bill.\n  Let me mention four of those core problems from my point of view.\n  The first is--maybe most fundamental, most basic--there are important \nelements at the core of ObamaCare that are flatout unconstitutional. \nEven if they were not unconstitutional, they would be unwise because \nthey are a dramatic expansion of the power and role and authority of \nthe Federal Government.\n  The most obvious is an absolute mandate in the bill, a mandate from \nyour Federal Government that every man, woman, and child in the United \nStates must buy health insurance.\n  This is unprecedented. There has never been a mandate like that from \nthe Federal Government or any level of government. There has never been \nthis forced purchasing of a product in the private marketplace.\n  Some people bring up the comparison with car insurance, but that is \nnot a close comparison at all because at the State level that is not a \nforced mandate; that is simply saying: If you want the right, the \nprivilege of driving a car, which is not some constitutionally \nguaranteed right, then part of the deal is you have to cover the \ndamages from any accident. So that is not a good comparison.\n  So this absolute mandate that every man, woman, and child in the \nUnited States go out and purchase health insurance, purchase a product \nin the private marketplace, is unprecedented, and for that reason it is \nunconstitutional. It is an unprecedented expansion of the power and \nrole and authority of the Federal Government.\n  In the last few days, there have been hearings--quite late to the \nhour, but there have been hearings in the Senate in the committees \nabout the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of ObamaCare. Of \ncourse, this central question came up. I found the response of some of \nthe witnesses at the hearings who favored ObamaCare or advocate for \nObamaCare pretty startling on this point. One Senator in the committee \nasked them: Well, if we can mandate constitutionally that every \nAmerican man, woman, and child buy health insurance, why can't we pass \na law that says obesity is a real problem in this country--which it \nis--and therefore we are going to mandate that every man, woman, and \nchild in America eat certain vegetables and certain healthy foods every \nday? Do you know what the response was from this advocate of ObamaCare? \nWell, I don't think you can mandate that they eat the food; you can \nonly mandate that they buy the food. Great. Very reassuring. To me, \nthat is not an argument for the constitutionality of ObamaCare; that is \na clear argument for the unconstitutionality and danger of the \nObamaCare Federal power overreach.\n\n  There are many other aspects of ObamaCare which also pose serious \nconstitutional problems. My point is, these are big problems, and they \nare not minor details which we can tweak with amendments. They go to \nthe heart of this gargantuan bill.\n  Similarly is the dramatic expansion of government and the cost of \nthat expansion. Instead of controlling and lowering health care costs, \nObamaCare is expanding government and expanding health care costs. In \nfact, the Senate Budget Committee estimates that the bill will cost \n$2.6 trillion for the first 10 years of full implementation. All of \nthat new spending does not lower health care costs, and there are \nmultiple sources affirming that. Yet President Obama continues to claim \nthat the act will ``slow these rising costs.'' Maybe he did not see \nthat CMS's Chief Actuary, Richard Foster, said that overall national \nhealth expenditures will increase by a total of $311 billion over the \nnext 10 years under the law. Now, when the CMS Actuary was asked \ndirectly if President Obama's health care bill would hold down \nunsustainable medical costs just last week, that Actuary replied: ``I \nwould say false.''\n  Last year, CBO also confirmed our concerns about the bill's inability \nto contain costs, stating, ``In CBO's judgment, the health legislation \nenacted earlier this year does not substantially diminish that \npressure.''\n  In addition to increased costs for the government and present and \nfuture taxpayers, health insurance premiums will increase for Americans \nand their\n\n[[Page S464]]\n\nfamilies. In fact, the CBO estimated that premiums will increase by \n$2,100 even though at least candidate Obama promised to lower premiums \nby $2,500 per family.\n  So that big expansion of government and cost and health care costs, \nincluding taxes and health care premiums, is another big problem. \nAgain, this is not a minor detail which we can fix with a perfecting \namendment, with a few tweaks to the bill. This goes to the core of the \nentire plan.\n  Another fundamental issue which goes to the core of the entire plan \nis the fact--and I think it is a well-established fact--that the \nObamaCare plan will cost us not just money, not just increased taxes, \nnot just increased health insurance premiums, it will cost us jobs. \nThat should always be worrisome, but it should be particularly \nworrisome as we stand here today and debate this in a horrible economy, \nas we are trying to come out of the worst recession since the Great \nDepression of the 1930s. Again, this is not just any period of time; \nthis is a time of prolonged historic unemployment.\n  This bill costs us jobs, and this bill absolutely decimates job \ncreation. The bill taxes jobs and places more burdens on job creators. \nFor instance, the National Federation of Independent Business, \nrepresenting thousands of American small businesses, including many in \nLouisiana, my home State, said:\n\n       If new taxes, new mandates and new government programs in \n     PPACA--\n\n  That is the ObamaCare bill--\n\n     remain intact the law will stifle the ability to hire, grow \n     and invest. . . .\n\n  In addition to the often-discussed 1099 paperwork nightmare for small \nbusinesses, the bill also includes a pay-or-play mandate on job \ncreators. This complicated new tax penalty imposes a tax on businesses \nwith more than 50 workers if they do not offer coverage or do offer \ncoverage but workers elect to decline that benefit. Yet again, this is \na fundamental problem with the bill that goes to the heart of the bill, \nnot the periphery. This aspect of the bill will have many dire \nconsequences. First, because the $2,000 penalty for not offering \ninsurance is less than the $6,100 average employer benefit \ncontribution, businesses are actually given an incentive to drop \ncoverage. So there is a concrete money incentive, a major money \nincentive for businesses to drop coverage and actually push workers off \ngood coverage many have right now.\n  Second, businesses that are able to grow and hire more workers may \nchoose not to create jobs and to stay under the 50-employee threshold \nto avoid all of these disincentives and difficulties.\n  Because of all this, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nconcluded that the bill ``will encourage some people to work fewer \nhours or to withdraw from the labor market.'' It also said: On net, it \nwill reduce the amount of labor used in the economy. Is that what we \nwant to encourage in any economy but particularly in a horribly down \neconomy? We are trying to come out of the worst recession since the \nGreat Depression. Do we want to reduce labor opportunity in our \neconomy?\n  These are stunning conclusions that so many of us warned against \nduring the debate--conclusions the majority of Americans feared. Taxing \nAmerican job creators and sticking businesses with more government \ncompliance requirements and costs is absolutely the wrong approach, \nparticularly in a down economy.\n  Finally, there is another core concern which I share with so many \nothers in this body that again goes to the heart of the bill. It is not \na minor debate. It is not something we can solve with a perfecting \namendment. It is not at the periphery. It is not changing a comma, \nchanging a sentence. It is at the heart of the bill; that is, the bill \ncontains at its heart over $500 billion in Medicare cuts--yes, over \n$\\1/2\\ trillion in cuts to Medicare. These cuts aren't invested back \ninto Medicare. They don't help Medicare stay solvent. They don't help \nMedicare survive or stay solvent longer. They don't help fix the \nlooming Medicare challenge. They are stolen from Medicare to pay for \nbrandnew stuff for other people in ObamaCare.\n  These Medicare cuts directly impact seniors, and one study shows that \nthe massive cuts to Medicare Advantage will hit Louisiana seniors \nparticularly hard. A study by the Heritage Foundation shows that \nLouisiana seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans lose more than \nany other State in the Nation because of the Obama health bill. The \nreport says that projected enrollment in Medicare Advantage will drop \nby over 125,000 Louisianians--62 percent--and benefits will be cut by \n$5,000 per beneficiary.\n  So this bill takes away benefits and choices for seniors not to fix \nMedicare, not to preserve Medicare, not to preserve its solvency for \nlonger, but steals it from Medicare, steals it from seniors for \nbrandnew purposes for other folks. This directly contradicts the \nPresident's promise that ``if you like what you have, you can keep \nit.'' No, you can't, Mr. President. Thousands of Louisiana seniors \ncan't. In fact, CMS's Chief Actuary also verified that the promise will \nbe broken, confirming that Americans may lose their current health care \ncoverage regardless of whether or not they want to keep it.\n  So I respond directly to my friend and colleague from Vermont by \nsaying that we want full repeal of ObamaCare for a very simple reason: \nThe big problems with the bill, the big problems with the plan aren't \nat the margin, they are at the core, and the big problems can't be \nfixed with a perfecting amendment, with changing a comma, changing \npunctuation, revising 1 or 2 or 5 or 10 sentences. The big problems are \nat the core of the plan, starting with a mandate from the Federal \nGovernment--unprecedented--that every man, woman, and child in America \nneeds to go into the market and buy a particular product.\n  That is why we demand repeal, that is why we will continue to pursue \nrepeal until it happens, and that is why we will replace this huge \nburdensome bill with targeted reforms such as protecting folks with \npreexisting conditions, such as reimportation, such as generics reform \nand other measures to reduce prescription drug prices, such as allowing \nAmerican citizens to shop for health insurance across State lines and \nto pool together through their small businesses, through other means, \nthrough association health plans.\n  Thank you, Madam President. With that, I urge all of my colleagues to \ncome together. Let's repeal this very problematic plan, and let's start \nanew with focused, targeted reforms that the American people have been \nasking for.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I rise today in support of the McConnell \namendment to the FAA reauthorization bill.\n  What we have this afternoon actually is an opportunity to show the \nAmerican people that we are listening to them. The American people want \nthe ObamaCare law--the affordable health care law, as it is known--to \nbe repealed and replaced with something less expensive, with something \nworkable. Polls show this, the individuals with whom we speak when we \ngo home tell us this, and this vote will be an opportunity for us to \nshow them we are listening.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues come to the floor this week and \nsuggest that this massive, 2,000-page, tax-increasing, job-killing bill \nis, in fact, just what we need. I would suggest there are a number of \nfacts that indicate otherwise. The other side would have us believe \nthat without this health care law, this country is going to fall off \nthe tracks and the world will virtually come to an end. They try to \ncite one or two popular proposals that are in this law, which, of \ncourse, could be enacted after repeal practically by unanimous consent, \nand ignore the fatal flaws in the law.\n  The former Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, during the \nconsideration of this act in the House and Senate, famously told a \ngrassroots group that had come to Washington, DC: We need to hurry up \nand pass the bill so you can find out what is in it. Well, indeed, \nsince the passage and signing of\n\n[[Page S465]]\n\nthe law of ObamaCare, every day the American people are finding out \nsomething new that is in the bill that they don't like. As a matter of \nfact, it turns out that Members of the House and Senate who voted for \nObamaCare also did not know precisely what was in the bill and \ncertainly did not anticipate the ramifications of this massive, ill-\nadvised law.\n  Under the new law, it is absolutely a fact, and we know this, that \nMedicare will face over $500 billion in cuts, and senior citizens have \na right to be concerned. Future senior citizens have a right to be \nconcerned about these cuts. They include $155 billion from hospitals, \n$202 billion from Medicare Advantage, $15 billion from nursing homes, \n$40 billion from home health agencies, and $7 billion from hospice.\n  Cuts from these Federal expenditures in Medicare are to pay for the \nnew ObamaCare legislation.\n  Everyone agrees that Medicare needs to be made more solvent, and we \nneed to work on Medicare. But these reckless cuts will only make \nMedicare's problems worse.\n  Another thing Americans have found out about this affordable health \ncare law which is being implemented even as we speak is that the law \nfalls short of the President's goal of controlling runaway costs. In \nfact, it raises projected spending.\n  Last week, in his State of the Union Address, President Obama said \nthe health insurance law we passed last year will slow these rising \ncosts. This is simply not true. To support my assertion it is not true, \nI cite the President's own Actuary. CMS reports that, in fact, spending \nwill be increased by about 1 percent over what it would have been over \n10 years. That increase could get bigger, of course, the report points \nout, since the Medicare cuts I have pointed out may be unrealistic and \npolitically unsustainable, according to the report. CMS said, overall, \nnational health expenditures under the health reform act would increase \nby a total of $311 billion and that health expenditures will be 21 \npercent of the gross domestic product by 2019.\n  But it is not just the government bean counters who are worried. Here \nis what the National Federation of Independent Business said:\n\n       Small businessowners everywhere are rightfully concerned \n     that the unconstitutional new mandates, countless rules and \n     new taxes in the health care law will devastate their \n     business and their ability to create jobs.\n\n  That is the National Federation of Independent Business. The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers says that manufacturers remain adamantly \nopposed to the employer mandates and to the Medicare hospital insurance \ntax increases. These employers who are faced with incorporating the \nfirst round of health care changes are grappling and having difficulty \nwith how to comply with the long list of new rules.\n  These are not scare tactics. These are not unwarranted fears by a \nconfused public. These are people who work with health care every day \nand are telling us that this Congress has made a mistake. In fact, \nthere are already real consequences of this health care reform law.\n  Abbott Laboratories said it is cutting about 1,900 jobs. It is just a \nfact. The job cuts come ``in response to changes in the health care \nindustry, including U.S. health care reform and the challenging \nregulatory environment.'' That is simply a fact. It is not conjecture.\n  Blue Shield California Health Insurer recently stunned individual \npolicyholders with a huge rate increase, effective March 1, seeking \ncumulative hikes of as much as 59 percent in premiums for tens of \nthousands of their customers. That San Francisco-based Blue Shield said \nthe increases were the result of fast-rising health care costs and \nother expenses relating to the new health care law.\n  Again, just a fact, Madam President. It is also an absolute certainty \nthat State taxes are going to go up, and they are going to go up big \ntime unless we repeal this health reform law.\n  In my State of Mississippi, the legislation will cost the State $1.7 \nbillion over 10 years, including $443 million in year 10 alone. From \nfiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2020, the massive expansion of Medicaid \nwill cost Mississippi taxpayers $225 million to $250 million extra each \nyear. Our Governor--one of the staunchest opponents of tax hikes I have \never heard of--has stated that this law will certainly force the State \nof Mississippi to increase its taxes unless it is repealed. Again, \nthese costs are simply facts. They result from the mandate.\n  Madam President, there is also bipartisan opposition to this law. We \ndidn't see much bipartisan support for its repeal in the other body, \nand I was disappointed by that. But when you get off of Capitol Hill \nand out to individuals, it is not a Republican or Democratic issue. \nThere is a bipartisan American opposition to this law.\n  I have repeatedly quoted former Governor Phil Bredesen, a Democrat of \nTennessee, someone who ran as a Democrat in his State successfully \ntwice and ran as the standard bearer for his party three times--a loyal \nDemocrat who, of course, called this law the ``mother of all unfunded \nmandates.''\n  After the law was enacted, he wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street \nJournal on October 21, 2010. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 21, 2010]\n\n                ObamaCare's Incentive To Drop Insurance\n\n                          (By Philip Bredesen)\n\n       One of the principles of game theory is that you should \n     view the game through your opponent's eyes, not just your \n     own.\n       This past spring, the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act (President Obama's health reform) created a system \n     of extensive federal subsidies for the purchase of health \n     insurance through new organizations called ``exchanges.'' The \n     details of these subsidies were painstakingly worked out by \n     members of my own political party to reflect their values: \n     They decided who was to benefit from the subsidies and what \n     was to be purchased with them. They paid a lot of attention \n     to their own strategies, but what I believe they failed to \n     consider properly were the possible strategies of others.\n       Our federal deficit is already at unsustainable levels, and \n     most Americans understand that we can ill afford another \n     entitlement program that adds substantially to it. But our \n     recent health reform has created a situation where there are \n     strong economic incentives for employers to drop health \n     coverage altogether. The consequence will be to drive many \n     more people than projected--and with them, much greater \n     cost--into the reform's federally subsidized system. This \n     will happen because the subsidies that become available to \n     people purchasing insurance through exchanges are \n     extraordinarily attractive.\n       In 2014, when these exchanges come into operation, a \n     typical family of four with an annual income of $90,000 and a \n     45-year-old policy holder qualifies for a federal subsidy of \n     40% of their health-insurance cost. For that same family with \n     an income of $50,000 (close to the median family income in \n     America), the subsidy is 76% of the cost.\n       One implication of the magnitude of these subsidies seems \n     clear: For a person starting a business in 2014, it will be \n     logical and responsible simply to plan from the outset never \n     to offer health benefits. Employees, thanks to the exchanges, \n     can easily purchase excellent, fairly priced insurance, \n     without pre-existing condition limitations, through the \n     exchanges. As it grows, the business can avoid a great deal \n     of cost because the federal government will now pay much of \n     what the business would have incurred for its share of health \n     insurance. The small business tax credits included in health \n     reform are limited and short-term, and the eventual penalty \n     for not providing coverage, of $2,000 per employee, is still \n     far less than the cost of insurance it replaces.\n       For an entrepreneur wanting a lean, employee-oriented \n     company, it's a natural position to take: ``We don't provide \n     company housing, we don't provide company cars, we don't \n     provide company insurance. Our approach is to put your \n     compensation in your paycheck and let you decide how to \n     spend it.''\n       But while health reform may alter the landscape for small \n     business in unexpected ways, it also opens the door to what \n     is a potentially far larger effect on the Treasury.\n       The authors of health reform primarily targeted the \n     uninsured and those now buying expensive individual policies. \n     But there's a very large third group that can also enter and \n     that may have been grossly underestimated: the 170 million \n     Americans who currently have employer-sponsored group \n     insurance. Because of the magnitude of the new subsidies \n     created by Congress, the economics become compelling for many \n     employers to simply drop coverage and help their employees \n     obtain replacement coverage through an exchange.\n       Let's do a thought experiment. We'll use my own state of \n     Tennessee and our state employees for our data. The year is \n     2014 and the Affordable Care Act is now in full operation. \n     We're a large employer, with about 40,000 direct employees \n     who participate in our health plan. In our thought \n     experiment, let's exit the health-benefits business this year \n     and help our employees use an exchange to purchase their own.\n       First of all, we need to keep our employees financially \n     whole. With our current plan,\n\n[[Page S466]]\n\n     they contribute 20% of the total cost of their health \n     insurance, and that contribution in 2014 will total about $86 \n     million. If all these employees now buy their insurance \n     through an exchange, that personal share will increase by \n     another $38 million. We'll adjust our employees' compensation \n     in some rough fashion so that no employee is paying more for \n     insurance as a result of our action. Taking into account the \n     new taxes that would be incurred, the change in employee \n     eligibility for subsidies, and allowing for inefficiency in \n     how we distribute this new compensation, we'll triple our \n     budget for this to $114 million.\n       Now that we've protected our employees, we'll also have to \n     pay a federal penalty of $2,000 for each employee because we \n     no longer offer health insurance; that's another $86 million. \n     The total state cost is now about $200 million.\n       But if we keep our existing insurance plan, our cost will \n     be $346 million. We can reduce our annual costs by over $146 \n     million using the legislated mechanics of health reform to \n     transfer them to the federal government.\n       That's just for our core employees. We also have 30,000 \n     retirees under the age of 65, 128,000 employees in our local \n     school systems, and 110,000 employees in local government, \n     all of which presents strategies even more economically \n     attractive than the thought experiment we just performed. \n     Local governments will find eliminating all coverage \n     particularly attractive, as many of them are small and will \n     thus incur minor or no penalties; many have health plans that \n     will not meet the minimum benefit threshold, and so they'll \n     see a substantial and unavoidable increase in cost if they \n     continue providing benefits under the new federal rules.\n       Our thought experiment shows how the economics of dropping \n     existing coverage is about to become very attractive to many \n     employers, both public and private. By 2014, there will be a \n     mini-industry of consultants knocking on employers' doors to \n     explain the new opportunity. And in the years after 2014, the \n     economics just keep getting better.\n       The consequence of these generous subsidies will be that \n     America's health reform may well drive many more people than \n     projected out of employer-sponsored insurance and into the \n     heavily subsidized federal system. Perhaps this is a \n     miscalculation by the Congress, perhaps not. One principle of \n     game theory is to think like your opponent; another is that \n     there's always a larger game.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, among other things, Governor Bredesen, \nwho was still Governor at the time, said:\n\n       Our Federal deficit is already at an unsustainable level, \n     and most Americans understand that we can ill afford another \n     entitlement program that adds substantially to it. But our \n     recent health reform has created a situation where there are \n     strong economic incentives for employers to drop health \n     coverage altogether. The consequence will be to drive many \n     more people than projected--and with them, much greater \n     cost--into the reform's federally subsidized system.\n\n  The Democratic-elected Governor of Tennessee criticized this act. He \npointed out other facts that are wrong. In his subsequent book on the \nsubject, Phil Bredesen also criticizes the health care law, saying it \nwill cause deficits to go up, costs to continue increasing, employers \nto drop coverage, State costs to increase, governments to grow, and \nwill make our current problems worse.\n  ``Obamacare is not what the doctor ordered,'' according to Governor \nBredesen.\n  My time is limited. I could go on and on, and Members of the Senate \nand House could and will go on and on as we face this issue, if we \ndon't win it today.\n  The facts are there. This is a terribly flawed piece of legislation. \nFacts are stubborn. The consequences have already started to mount up. \nOpposition is strong. Support for repeal is strong and bipartisan, and \nfor those reasons I will vote in favor of the McConnell amendment when \nwe consider it later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I can't say with any certainty anything \nabout the critics of the government's affordable health care plan, \nexcept one thing: Each of the critics on the Republican side of the \naisle of what they call government-administered health insurance--every \nsingle Senate Republican critic is currently protecting his or her \nfamily with government-administered health care. In other words, what \nis good enough for their families should not be good enough for the \nrest of America.\n  As a show of good faith, I think the Republican Senators should come \nto the floor today and say: Not only are we going to vote for repeal of \nhealth care reform, we are going to show our personal commitment by \nwalking away from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, a \ngovernment-administered health insurance program. I would admire them \nso much if their actions as Senators reflected their speeches on the \nfloor. But they don't. They are denying to the rest of America what \nevery single Member of Congress has available today to protect their \nfamilies. That, to me, is indefensible.\n  A judge in Florida this week decided that this Affordable Health Care \nAct was unconstitutional. Before we get carried away with that \ndecision, step back. This law has been challenged 16 times in Federal \ncourts. Twelve courts have dismissed the challenges on procedural \ngrounds, saying the person who filed the suit didn't have standing in \ncourt. Four of the Federal courts decided it on the merits. Two of the \nFederal courts decided it was a constitutional law, and two said it was \nunconstitutional.\n  You say to yourself: Wow, two Federal district courts said this law \nwas unconstitutional. Aren't you worried? Well, I don't take anything \nfor granted, but I do understand a little bit of history. What other \nlaws in America were found unconstitutional by lower courts and then \nconstitutional by the Supreme Court? Anything significant? Social \nSecurity was found unconstitutional; then the Supreme Court said, no, \nit is constitutional. The Federal minimum wage law was found \nunconstitutional by a lower court, and the Supreme Court said it was \nconstitutional. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was found unconstitutional \nby a lower court, and the Supreme Court said it was constitutional.\n  Let's not get carried away with lower court decisions that are \nclearly split on this issue. We had a hearing in the Judiciary \nCommittee today that I chaired where we had constitutional experts from \nacross the United States. There was a lot of difference of opinion \nbetween Democrats and Republicans. I think the case is clear and strong \nthat we have the power, under article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution--the enumerated powers of Congress--to regulate commerce.\n  Is there anybody on the Republican side who will stand here and argue \nthat the health care industry, which represents 18 percent of the \neconomy of America, is not commerce? Of course it is. Then, of course, \nwe have the authority in that same section to pass laws necessary and \nproper, to carry out the responsibilities and authority given us.\n  Here is what we are trying to do. We are trying to make sure \neverybody in America has health insurance. We say to the 83 percent of \nAmericans who currently are insured: You don't have to worry about this \nargument. You already have health insurance. For the 17 percent who are \nuninsured, many of them are people who have preexisting conditions and \nhave been denied coverage or they can't afford it. Some are people who, \nfrankly, cannot afford coverage even if they don't have a preexisting \ncondition.\n  This law moves us to a point where more Americans will be covered \nwith health insurance. We say those who can afford health insurance, \nand don't buy it, will pay a tax because of that decision. Is that \nheartless? Is that a Federal mandate on people who want to be left \nalone? If they were just being left alone, that is one thing, but human \nexperience teaches us that these people who want to go it alone--don't \nbother me, I am on my own--will get sick someday. When they go to the \nhospital, they will be treated. When they can't pay for their \ntreatment, do you know who will pay? All of the rest of us. Everybody \nelse paying health insurance premiums has to absorb the cost of those \nwho are freeloading on the system. It is not fair.\n  It used to be that conservative Republicans preached personal \nresponsibility. When we put personal responsibility in this law, all of \na sudden they don't like it. I think personal responsibility still \ncounts. I believe it is clearly constitutional to include it. I have \nlistened to some of the arguments about repealing this law. I heard the \nSenator from Mississippi say how bipartisan the support is for it. I \nwould have liked to have asked him how he explains the fact that four \nout of five people in America--80 percent of Americans--oppose repeal. \nThey don't think the law is perfect. Many say improve it if you can, \nbut 80 percent oppose repeal.\n\n[[Page S467]]\n\n  The signature issue for the House Republicans, and now the Senate \nRepublicans, is the repeal of affordable health care. It would be \ndevastating if we did. The first thing you will notice, if you read the \namendment--three pages--filed by Senator McConnell, the Republican \nleader, is that on the second page he manages to include the Statutory \nPay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, as passed and printed by the House of \nRepresentatives. Unless you are a person who follows closely what is \ngoing on around here, you may not know what that says.\n\n  What it says is that Senator McConnell wants us to ignore the fact \nthat repeal of the Health Care Act will add $230 billion to our \nnational deficit over the next 10 years and more than $1 trillion in \nthe decade after that. A party that comes to the floor every single day \ntelling us of their passionate determination to end our deficits and \naddress our debt with the McConnell amendment will add $230 billion to \nour national deficit over 10 years and $1 trillion more in the next 10 \nyears.\n  This is a budget buster amendment. This will add more to the deficit \nin one fell swoop than any single thing we have done in Congress in the \ntime I have served. And it is being offered by the party of so-called \nfiscal responsibility.\n  When we talk about premium increases currently taking place under \nhealth insurance policies across America, I understand it. We have all \nlived through it. We have seen it. Businesses see it all the time. \nThere is a provision in our Affordable Health Care Act which addresses \nthat issue that would be repealed by the McConnell amendment. The \nprovision is called medical loss ratio. It says a health insurance \ncompany has to spend 80 to 85 percent of premium dollars on actual \nhealth care. They cannot take it away in advertising, in administrative \ncosts, in salaries and bonuses for their CEOs.\n  One of the things that will happen if the Republicans have their way \nand repeal health care is that health insurance companies will be \nallowed to raise premiums at any level as quickly or as much as they \nwant without being held to this medical loss ratio.\n  That may not be the worst thing, though. Any person in America who \nhas been raised in a family where someone in the family suffers from \nwhat is known as a preexisting condition knows that you always live in \nfear that you will not have health insurance and fear that if you have \nto go out and buy it on the open, public market, you will never be able \nto afford it.\n  This law that Senator McConnell and the Republicans want to repeal \ntoday says no health insurance company in America can discriminate \nagainst anyone under the age of 18 who has a preexisting condition. \nThat is something any parent would appreciate. You never know if that \nbeautiful son or daughter of yours is going to have problems with \nasthma, diabetes, cancer, or mental illness. And you certainly want \nthat child, that love of your life, to have health insurance coverage.\n  Senator McConnell and the Republicans want to repeal the protection \nfor families who have children with a preexisting condition. That is \nfact. It is not as though they are offering exclusions and saying: No, \nno, we will keep that. They eliminate the entire law with this 3-page \namendment. They eliminate the protections.\n  How about protections for those who get diagnosed with a serious \nillness and health insurance companies cutting them off completely, \nputting a cap on the amount of money they will spend to provide for \nmedical services and treatment, saying at some point they are going to \neliminate their policies altogether because they failed to make a \ndisclosure on the application form? It happens too often.\n  In my State, we sadly lead the Nation in what is called rescissions--\nhealth care insurance companies that cancel coverage when people get \nseriously ill. How would you like to be in that predicament? How would \nyou like to face a serious illness that keeps you awake at night \ntossing and turning about whether you are going to live or die and then \nfight the insurance company in daylight hours in the hopes they will \ncover the prescriptions and treatment you need to stay alive?\n  That is a reality addressed by the Health Care Act, a reality that \nwill be repealed by Senator McConnell and the Republicans' efforts \ntoday. Those are the real results of what they want to do. It is not \nabout who wins the political debate and has the largest cheering \nsection when it is over. It is about real life changes.\n  How about senior citizens under Medicare? Many of them struggle to \npay for prescription drugs. Even with the Medicare prescription drug \nplan there is a gap in coverage called the doughnut hole. We start to \nclose that gap and say to seniors: If you have expensive prescription \ndrugs, we are going to make sure ultimately they are covered completely \nfrom the first of the year to the end of the year. Now there is a gap \nin the coverage.\n  The Republicans and Senator McConnell want to repeal that provision \nof the Health Care Act which provides for seniors not only more \ncoverage for their prescription drugs, but also an opportunity for an \nannual physical and the kind of preventive care they need to stay \nhealthy, strong, and independent in their homes for a longer period of \ntime. That is what Senator McConnell and the Republican Senators want \nto do with the repeal of this law.\n  What about job creation? The Senator from Mississippi talked about \none company cutting some employees. I am not sure of the particulars in \nthat company, but one of the things we did in this law was to take a \nlook at tax subsidies to medical device and pharmaceutical companies, \nif they were duplicative or overly generous, to make sure they got \ncloser to a reality of what a company needs in incentives to grow. It \nis true some of those tax subsidies were eliminated and some of the \ncompanies were not happy about it. The bottom line is we were trying to \nmake sure that health care is affordable. We cannot afford to provide \nmassive subsidies to profitable companies on an unlimited basis.\n  This bill the Republicans want to repeal will crack down on fraud in \nMedicare and Medicaid. It will simplify paperwork for private insurers, \nit invests in prevention, it creates a pathway for generic biologic \ndrugs, and tests new ways to pay health care providers to reward value \nrather than volume.\n  If the law is repealed, we will have fewer jobs and higher costs for \nfamilies and businesses. The No. 1 complaint of Illinois small \nbusinesses across our State is the cost of health insurance. If the \nRepublicans have their way and repeal this law we passed, the cost of \nhealth insurance will grow, the cost to businesses will grow, the \nnumber of employees will shrink.\n  A 1-percent or 1.5-percent growth in health care costs above the \nrates under the new law will prevent employers from creating 2.5 to 4 \nmillion jobs over the next 10 years. Talk about a job destroyer.\n  The Republican repeal amendment does just that. Repeal means going \nback to the same broken system we have had for so long with insurance \ncompanies once again free to overcharge families and businesses to \nprotect their corporate profits and CEO bonuses; the same broken system \nwith workers seeing their paychecks shrink as more and more of their \nhard-earned wages are deducted to cover skyrocketing premiums; the same \nbroken system with seniors being forced to shoulder the full cost of \nprescription drugs in the doughnut hole; and the same broken system \nwith small businesses closing their doors and laying off workers \nbecause they cannot afford the crushing cost of health insurance.\n  The Republican claim that this health care bill is a job killer is \njust plain false. The economy has been gaining private sector jobs \nsince President Obama signed the bill a year ago after losing jobs for \na long period of time before. Since the President signed the bill, we \nhave created more than 1.1 million private sector jobs. By contrast, in \nthe 10 years before health reform was enacted, we lost 3.3 million \nprivate sector jobs.\n  Average real incomes for Americans are back on the rise after years \nof being stalled under the old health care system. Just this week, the \nCommerce Department reported that average real disposable income has \nrisen 1.3 percent over the past year, after falling one-tenth of 1 \npercent in each of the previous 2 years.\n  I will close by saying that our hearing today before the Senate \nJudiciary\n\n[[Page S468]]\n\nCommittee on the constitutionality question makes it clear to me that \nthe Supreme Court, if it follows the clear precedents that have been \nhanded down for decades, if Supreme Court Justices who have spoken \neloquently and directly on the commerce clause will view this Health \nCare Act in the same context, they will find it constitutional. Then \nperhaps we can move on. Perhaps at that point the Republicans will stop \nbeating this drum on repealing health care, will join us in making it \nan even stronger bill, and will focus on creating jobs instead of \nkilling jobs as this McConnell amendment would do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I wish to talk about two topics today, \nfirst on this health care bill and then on the situation in Egypt.\n  I rise today in support of the amendment to repeal the health care \nlaw. We made a mistake last year in passing this law, and a large \nmajority of American people know it. In the face of the largest debt in \nour history, it was the height of folly to create a new spending \nprogram, offering subsidized health care to 30 million Americans. It is \na promise we cannot afford to keep and one that our lenders may force \nus to retract.\n  Before losing our credit rating or suffering the humiliation of \nforeign lenders denying us new loans, we should take the decisive \naction now to end this entitlement. Congress should replace this \nmistaken law with bipartisan reforms that prohibit the government from \noverriding the decisions you make with your doctor, that defend your \nright to buy insurance from any State in the Union, and to make lawsuit \nreforms to lower the costs of defensive medicine.\n  The failed health care law now ruled as unconstitutional by two \nFederal courts uses the commerce clause of the Constitution to create \nan unlimited government that could require Americans to buy what they \ndo not want. The very heart of the Constitution was the creation of a \nlimited government that could only accomplish its defined missions, \nleaving all else to the people and to the States.\n  These courts are right, the law is unconstitutional. It spends over \n$2.6 trillion, it hurts small businesses, it cuts senior health care \nunder Medicare, and levies billions in new taxes against our economy in \nthe teeth of the great recession.\n  Recently, I visited Decatur Memorial Hospital in Decatur, IL. Their \npresident, Ken Smithmier, warned me that the Medicare cuts required by \nthe new health care law would cut $10 million annually from their \nhospital, resulting in the loss of over 200 jobs. Decatur is not alone \nin its troubles. In nearly half of my State's counties, hospitals are \namong the top three employers. They are the backbone of our local \neconomies, and their employment would be greatly harmed by this health \ncare law.\n  We made a promise to seniors who depend on Medicare that we would \ntake care of them. This law cuts Medicare and hurts them. We should \nhonor, instead, our promises to defend the Nation, to support seniors \non Social Security and who depend on Medicare before making an \nextravagant promise that is irresponsible and cannot be kept under the \nhealth care law.\n\n\n                                 Egypt\n\n  Madam President, I also wish to take this time to speak on an \nentirely different subject, which is what is going on in Egypt.\n  I entitle this discussion ``The Muslim Brotherhood: Its Leaders in \nTheir Own Words.''\n  Will Egypt follow Poland or Georgia to foster a new democratic \ngovernment or will it follow Iran's revolution, converting Egypt into a \nstate sponsor of terror?\n  While U.S. policy should support human rights and democracy, we face \nthe risk that the Muslim Brotherhood, the al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun, could \nseize power. Who is part of the brotherhood and what are its political \nobjectives?\n  A detailed study shows why these questions should command the \nattention of the Congress and the President. With so much at stake in \nthe Middle East, Americans must be clear-eyed about the Muslim \nBrotherhood and its radical Islamic agenda with a pledge of jihad \nagainst the West and the State of Israel.\n  The Muslim Brotherhood is the largest Islamist movement in the Middle \nEast and is widely described as the most organized political force in \nEgypt. Its membership is estimated at over 600,000.\n  Although it claims to be nonviolent, this conservative organization, \nthe Muslim Brotherhood, has profoundly influenced Islamic terrorist \norganizations such as al-Qaida, Islamic Jihad, and Hamas. One of its \ndisciples was the prominent Islamist theologian Sayyid Qutb who \nprovided the intellectual underpinnings of al-Qaida. Ayman al-Zawahiri, \nal-Qaida's second in command, was once a member of Egypt's Muslim \nBrotherhood.\n  As recently as 2004, the organization's motto was as follows:\n\n     Allah is our objective.\n     The Prophet is our leader.\n     Qur'an is our law.\n     Jihad is our way.\n     Dying in the way of Allah is our highest hope.\n\n  The Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna. Banna \nis famously quoted as saying that ``it is the nature of Islam to \ndominate, not to be dominated, to impose its law in all nations and to \nextend its power to the entire planet.''\n  The Muslim Brotherhood has a violent history. Back in 1946, the U.S. \nArmy issued an intelligence report stating that the Muslim Brotherhood \n``maintains commando units and secret caches of arms.''\n  Throughout the 1940s, the paramilitary branch of the movement carried \nout targeted bombings and assassinations. In 1948, the Muslim \nBrotherhood was implicated in the murder of Egyptian Prime Minister \nMahmoud Naqrashi. In 1954, the group allegedly tried to assassinate \nthen-Prime Minister Gamal Abdel Nasser. The government banned the \nbrotherhood as a political party that very same year.\n\n  The Muslim Brotherhood went underground only to resurface during the \n1980s. It claimed to disavow violence and attempted to win political \npower as a religious and social organization. It was increasingly \nsuccessful with allied candidates, winning 17 seats in the Parliament \nin 2000 and then a stunning 88 seats, or 20 percent of Egypt's \nParliament, in 2005.\n  The Muslim Brotherhood is not a monolithic organization, but it does \nmaintain a leadership structure and a core set of beliefs. Its leader \nis called the general guide. He has several deputy guides. Below them \nis a guidance council, comprised of 15 to 16 senior leaders as well as \na broader body, the Shura, comprised of roughly 100 members.\n  Mohammed Badi was elected as the eighth general guide of the Muslim \nBrotherhood in January of 2010. As noted by the U.S. Government's Open \nSource Center, Badi is ``influenced by the writings of famous Muslim \nBrotherhood idealogue Sayyid Qutb, and is known for his conservative \nviews.''\n  In an April interview in 2010, Mr. Badi said:\n\n       We will continue to raise the banner of Jihad and the Koran \n     in our confrontation with the enemy of Islam. The Muslim \n     Brotherhood still considers the Zionists to be its main and \n     only enemy. The Jews who occupy Palestine have their eyes set \n     on Egypt.\n\n  Two days ago, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood, Muhammed \nGhannem, reportedly told Al-Alam Iranian news network that he ``would \nlike to see the Egyptian people prepare for a war against Israel,'' \nadding that the world should understand ``the Egyptian people are \nprepared for anything to get rid of this regime.'' He went on to say \nthat the Suez Canal should be ``closed immediately'' and that the flow \nof gas from Egypt to Israel should cease ``in order to bring about the \ndownfall of the Mubarak regime.''\n  In 2007, the Muslim Brotherhood released a political platform which \ncontained a number of indications on how this organization would govern \nEgypt if it came to power. According to the Congressional Research \nService, the platform called for ``the establishment of a board of \nreligious scholars with whom the President and the legislature would \nhave to consult before passing laws.''\n  As noted by Mohamed Elmenshawy--the editor-in-chief of Taqrir \nWashington and Arab Insight:\n\n       Reminiscent of Iran's Guardian Council, this \n     undemocratically selected body could have the power vested by \n     the state to veto\n\n[[Page S469]]\n\n     any and all legislation passed by the Egyptian parliament and \n     approved by the president that is not compatible with Islamic \n     Shari'a law.\n\n  The same document raises the important question of the Muslim \nBrotherhood's commitment to a pluralistic society. Despite pledges to \ntreat minorities and women as equals, the platform allows neither to \nhold high public office. As stated in the platform: ``Nonmuslims are \nexcused from holding this mission.'' For women, the post of President \nor Prime Minister would ``contradict her nature, social and other \nhumanitarian roles.'' The draft also cautions against ``burdening women \nwith the duties against their nature or role in the family.''\n  The people of Egypt and apparently its army are mandating the fall of \nthe Mubarak regime. While we support human rights and democracy, we \nmust heed the growing warnings about the Muslim Brotherhood, their \nleaders, and plans for taking Egypt all the way back to the 13th \ncentury. We, as Americans, have seen this movie before--in Iran, in \nLebanon, and in Gaza.\n  To prevent a strategic reversal on the scale of what happened in \nIran, the United States and her allies should do all they can to \nsupport Egypt's armies and secular leaders, ensuring no future for the \nMuslim Brotherhood. Egypt, locked under Shari'a law and oppressing \nwomen, Christians, and Jews, would be a catastrophic setback for \nprogress in the Middle East. Such a state could renounce the Camp David \npeace accords or even start yet another war with Israel.\n  Decisive action and influence now will benefit the national security \nand economy of the United States later. The defeat of the Muslim \nBrotherhood and victory for Egyptian secular nationalists would be the \nbest way to avoid war and restore economic confidence in the Middle \nEast and the wider world.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote to \nrepeal the new health care law. Repeal is the only way we can prevent \nthe job losses, insurance premiums increases and devastating Medicare \ncuts that are a direct consequence of the new health care law.\n  We are just now beginning to see many of the consequences resulting \nfrom this poorly conceived, hurriedly drafted 2,700 page law. Rather \nthan taking the time to get it right, the majority rushed to enact this \nnew law, despite the many warning signs pointing out serious flaws in \nthe new law.\n  These consequences are a result of the majority willfully ignoring \nthose who criticized their proposals and deciding that folks in \nWashington knew what was best for small businesses and families across \nthe country.\n  One example of this kind of unintended but easily predicted \nconsequence is the impact on child only health plans. Last week, my \nstaff conducted a survey, and found that the new law and the \nregulations implementing it have caused many health insurers to stop \nselling child only plans.\n  As a direct result of the new law, insurance plans in 34 States have \nstopped offering child-only plans, and parents in at least 20 states \nare no longer able to purchase any child only plans. This is a \ndevastating problem for parents who need to buy health insurance plans \nfor their children.\n  Many parents need to buy child only plans for their children, because \ntheir jobs provide insurance for them but not for family members. \nBefore the new law took effect, these parents could buy child only \npolicies for their kids. Unfortunately, because of the new law, parents \nin 20 States no longer have this option.\n  For other parents the cost of getting a family plan is too expensive, \nand their family budget can only afford to buy health insurance for \ntheir kids. Again, because of the new law these parents in 20 States no \nlonger have the ability to buy health insurance for their children.\n  I recently got a letter from a disabled Veteran in Wyoming. He wrote \nto tell me that because of the new law, he can't get health insurance \nfor his kids. He gets his health care from the VA so he doesn't need a \nfamily policy. He needs a policy for his two kids. Because of how the \nlaw was drafted and then implemented, this veteran now cannot get \nhealth insurance for his children.\n  I discussed this issue with Secretary Sebelius at a hearing last week \nin the HELP Committee and her reply was that kids can enroll in SCHIP \nor the new high-risk pools. In fact, the veteran in Wyoming doesn't \nqualify for either. While some low income kids are eligible for public \nprograms like SCHIP or Medicaid and some sick kids are eligible for \nhigh-risk pools, many children are ineligible for any of these plans, \nand will now go without insurance as a result of the new law.\n  Another unintended but easily predicted consequence of the new law is \nhow the new law is undermining the economy and the preventing the \ncreation of new jobs. During that same HELP Committee hearing, we also \nheard the testimony of Mr. Joe Olivo, who owns a small printing company \nin Moorestown, NJ.\n  Mr. Olivo told us how the new law will actually restrict his ability \nto expand his business and hire new workers. While he currently has 46 \nemployees, he will do everything he can to not hire 5 more people, in \norder to avoid the new law's mandate to offer health insurance to his \nemployees or pay a new tax. Small businesses across the country are \nbeing forced to make similar decisions, in order to avoid the $52 \nbillion in new taxes that the new law attempts to place on employers.\n  A study by the National Federation of Independent Business estimates \nthat the employer mandate will eliminate 1.6 million jobs at a time \nwhen over 15 million Americans are searching for new jobs, most of \nwhich are small businesses.\n  We need to be encouraging our businesses to grow, not discouraging \nthem. Over the last 2 years our economy has lost almost 3 million jobs. \nUnfortunately, the health reform law makes a bad employment situation \neven worse.\n  Another consequence of the new health care law will be to increase \nthe health insurance premiums paid by millions of Americans. During the \nhealth care debate, GOP Senators highlighted how the new health care \nlaw will cause millions of Americans to pay higher health insurance \npremiums.\n  In November of 2009, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that \nthe new law will increase health insurance premiums by 10 to 13 \npercent. This means families purchasing coverage on their own will have \nto pay $2,100 a year more because of the new law.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that many of the new taxes \nincluded in the health care reform law will be passed on directly to \nconsumers. This means that each of these new taxes, including the $60 \nbillion tax on health plans, the $20 billion tax on medical devices, \nand the $27 billion tax on prescription drugs, will further increase \npremiums for Americans.\n  In addition to CBO and JCT, six additional private actuarial analyses \npublished by Oliver Wyman, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the Hay Group, \nMilliman, Wellpoint and Lewin have all shown that the new law could \nincrease premiums, with increases ranging as high as 60 percent.\n  Additional studies by Milliman determined that because Medicaid pays \ndoctors and hospitals below costs, these providers must increase their \ncosts to everyone else, thereby costing the average American family an \nextra $1,700 per year. Forcing 16 million more people on to Medicaid \nwill further increase insurance premiums for many Americans, as \nproviders try to shift the costs resulting from inadequate Medicaid \nreimbursements\n  The estimates of the law increasing insurance premiums are already \nbeing born out in the market. I heard from a small business owner in \nSaratoga, WY, whose health insurance premiums are going up by 30 \npercent.\n  A 30-percent increase in health insurance premiums could tip him over \nthe edge of staying in business or closing his doors. He wrote to me to \ntell me that he is considering closing the doors of his construction \ncompany because he is having trouble making ends meet; he urged me to \nrepeal the new health care law.\n  Blue Shield of California--a nonprofit health insurer--recently filed \na 59-percent premium increase for some of their individual market plans \nand said that at least a portion of its increase was a direct result of \nthe new law. They estimate premiums will increase by 4 percent to \ncomply with the new mandated benefit.\n\n[[Page S470]]\n\n  Another unintended yet easily predicted consequence is the impact of \ncutting $500 billion from the Medicare Program. You can't cut a program \nby a $\\1/2\\ trillion and not expect to see decreases in covered \nbenefits or access to providers.\n  Republicans understand how important Medicare is to nearly 46 million \nseniors and disabled Americans. We want to protect and strengthen it. \nWe all know Medicare faces tremendous challenges in the near future.\n  Yet the law cuts over $500 billion from Medicare, not to strengthen \nMedicare, but to fund new entitlement spending. More importantly, the \nnew law fails to address even the most basic problems with the Medicare \nProgram, such as the broken physician payment formula.\n  I have already heard from seniors in Wyoming about how the new law is \nhurting them. A lady from Thermopolis, WY, wrote to tell me that she \ngot a letter from her Medicare Advantage plan saying her premiums were \ndrastically increasing because of the changes made in the new law.\n  She wrote say ``unfortunately, my former policy was $0. The ones \navailable now--even the most expensive one--have fewer benefits than \nwhat I was getting for free before ObamaCare took so much money from \nPart C. For instance, $45 for a specialist instead of $35; $10 for a \ngeneric drug instead of $6; and up to $350 for tests, when the old \npolicy had a flat rate of $16 for tests. I can't afford the premiums on \nmy Social Security and am considering dropping Part B, which would save \nme $97 per month.''\n  These are real life examples of the impact this new law is having on \neveryday Americans. I get letters every day from my constituents asking \nme to repeal this new health care law that is limiting their freedoms \nand emptying their pocketbooks. The Senate will soon vote on whether or \nnot to repeal the new health care law. I urge my colleagues to listen \nto their constituents and vote in favor of repeal.\n  Madam President, we need to pursue a step by step, bipartisan, \napproach to health reform that will reduce costs, expand coverage and \nallow our economy to expand. Using that process will allow us to \nthereby avoid the unintended consequences of this deeply flawed new \nlaw.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the 112th Congress began just 1 month \nago, with both sides of the political aisle voicing a renewed \ncommitment to cooperation. It is not hard to understand why I am \ndisappointed that at the first opportunity, Senate Republicans have \nchosen to manipulate the open amendment process. The Senate minority is \ndemanding a vote on an amendment to repeal the health care reform law \nin its entirety--an issue totally unrelated to the bill we are \nconsidering, the FAA Transportation Modernization Safety Improvement \nAct, which creates jobs, makes airline travel safer and more efficient, \nand offers consumers a `passenger bill of rights.'\n  The Senate's vote today follows the carefully staged show vote a few \nweeks ago by the new Republican majority in the House of \nRepresentatives. The American people have the right to know what a vote \nto repeal the Affordable Care Act really means. Repeal of this law \nwould take away the rights of millions of patients and would eliminate \ninsurance coverage for millions more, from the aging and elderly, to \nmen and women with preexisting conditions, to the most vulnerable \nchildren.\n  When you boil away the rhetoric, the only alternative offered to the \nAmerican people by advocates of repeal is: Don't get sick.\n  This amendment would turn back the clock to a time when, once again, \nwomen would have to pay more for health insurance than men, insurance \ncompanies could rescind a health insurance policy because someone gets \nsick, and coverage could forever be denied to someone born with a \ndisease or ailment. In Vermont, repeal would mean nearly 2,000 young \nadults would no longer have coverage through their parents' insurance \nplans, more than 5,000 Vermont seniors would see an increase in the \nprice of their prescriptions, and 350,000 Vermonters with private \ninsurance could have lifetime limits slapped on how much insurance \ncompanies will spend on their health care.\n  Some in Congress want to drain federal spending on domestic programs \nwhile looking the other way in supporting a repeal amendment that will \naccelerate the health cost spiral and add to our ballooning deficit. \nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that repeal of \nthe Affordable Care Act would boost the federal debt and deficits by \n$230 billion. The economic turmoil would reach beyond the overall costs \nof repeal by removing vital antifraud provisions I have long advocated \nthat have helped the Obama administration recover billions of taxpayer \ndollars. Repealing the Affordable Care Act would remove these fiscal \nsafeguards and reopen the floodgates to insurance discrimination, by \nputting insurance companies back in charge.\n  Opponents of the Affordable Care Act have gone to new lengths to \nrepeat and prolong this political battle. Not only do they want to \nreplay a 2-year long debate on a law that was enacted by a decisive \nmajority, but some opponents are also replaying the debate in the \ncourts. These political opponents seek to achieve in the courts what \nthey could not in Congress. They want judges to override legislative \ndecisions properly assigned by the Constitution to Congress, the \nelected representatives of the American people.\n  Today, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the \nconstitutionality of the historic Affordable Care Act. A dozen federal \ncourts have dismissed challenges to the law. Another four courts have \nheard arguments about its constitutionality; two have upheld the law as \nconstitutional, and two have not. Legal challenges to the law are \nexpected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  As I concluded during the debate on the Affordable Care Act, I have \nno doubt that Congress acted well within the bounds of its \nconstitutional authority in working to secure affordable health care \nfor all Americans through this plan that is based on the long \nestablished health insurance marketplace. The testimony we heard today \nfrom constitutional scholars makes clear that the language and spirit \nof the Constitution provides for such a response to a clearly \nestablished national need, as do judicial precedent and prior acts of \nCongress that also protect hardworking Americans in the national health \ncare market and promote the general welfare.\n  The Senate should not be spending its valuable time relitigating a \nlaw that has already helped millions of Americans and will help \nmillions more as the law is fully implemented. The American people \nrightly expect us to work together and make progress on so many \nchallenges that we face today.\n  I will not support a return to less protection, less coverage, less \nfairness and higher costs. The Affordable Care Act extended health \ninsurance to millions of families in Vermont and across the country. \nThose who represent the American people in Congress should stand ready \nto get to work for their constituents. This is not a time to cobble \nback together a broken system that has burdened most American \nhouseholds with health coverage uncertainty and crippling costs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we are here today, holding this debate, \npreparing for this vote, because our Republican friends believe a \ncollection of myths. Some of them say they want to repeal a law that \namounts to a ``government takeover'' of health care. Some of them say \nthey want to repeal a bill that violates the Constitution. They say \nthey want to repeal a law that will cut the benefits on which Medicare \nrecipients depend. Others say they want to repeal a bill that will \nexplode the deficit, or that they want to repeal the law because it \nwill kill jobs.\n  If such a law existed, I would want to repeal it too. Thankfully, the \nlaw Republicans describe is a fiction.\n  The Affordable Care Act, the law Republicans want us to repeal, does \nnot take over the health care system; it strengthens and protects our \nexisting private health insurance system. The independent fact checkers \nat Politifact.com found that the law ``is, at its heart, a system that \nrelies on private companies and the free market,'' and called the claim \nthat government would take over the system Politifact's ``Lie of the \nYear.''\n  This bill does not violate the Constitution. Opponents claim that the \nindividual mandate included in this bill\n\n[[Page S471]]\n\nviolates the Constitution because it requires citizens to purchase \ninsurance; under their arguments, many other programs, including \nMedicare, would violate the Constitution. Perhaps that is what these \nopponents believe, but it is emphatically not what most Americans \nbelieve, and it is contrary to decades of legal precedent.\n  This law does not reduce care for Medicare beneficiaries. In fact, \nmost Medicare recipients already enjoy expanded benefits under the \nAffordable Care Act. As a result of this law, Medicare beneficiaries \nnow receive preventive care such as annual check-ups with no out-of-\npocket costs, and starting last year this law began to shrink the \n``donut hole'' that hits so many seniors with significant drug costs. \nThe law strengthens Medicare by beginning to rein in the enormous costs \nthat threaten to swamp the system in coming years, and it does so by \nencouraging efficiency and reducing waste and abuse, not by cutting \nbenefits.\n  The Affordable Care Act does not explode the deficit. The \nindependent, nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has found that \nrepeal of the Affordable Care Act would increase the deficit by $143 \nbillion over the first decade, and by significantly more in the years \nto follow. It is ironic in the extreme that Senators who describe the \n2010 election as a mandate to reduce the deficit could now try to add \n$143 billion to that deficit as their first major action of the new \nCongress by repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n  This law does not kill jobs. Again, independent observers have \ndismissed this claim as patently false. The independent FactCheck.org \ncalled the claim ``exaggerated and misleading'' and that Republicans \nhave ``badly misrepresented'' findings by the Congressional Budget \nOffice in making their arguments.\n  We should leave the realm of myth and discuss what the Affordable \nCare Act does, in fact, do.\n  This law protects Americans from abuses by insurance companies, such \nas denial of coverage for preexisting conditions or gender. It allows \nparents to keep children covered under their insurance plan until age \n26. It requires that coverage include preventive care at no out-of-\npocket cost. It limits the unilateral power of insurance companies to \narbitrarily impose annual or lifetime coverage limits. Those arbitrary \nlimits have forced families to choose between foregoing much-needed \ncare and bankruptcy. Families will be protected from unexplained \npremium increases, and they will get clear, easy-to-read summaries of \ntheir options. Small businesses will receive tax credits to help them \nprovide affordable insurance coverage to their workers. And insurance \ncompanies will be prevented from rescinding coverage when patients need \nit most, when they get sick.\n  This law is not a government takeover of health care. It is sensible, \nmoderate reform that in the coming years will make health insurance \nmore affordable and secure for those who have it today, and make \naffordable coverage available for millions of Americans who are now \nwithout it. It will reduce the deficit, protect the Medicare benefits \nthat seniors depend on now and in the future, and help ensure that \nfamilies can afford the insurance coverage they need. It is unfortunate \nthat so many of our colleagues subscribe to the mythical notions about \nthis law. But here, in the real world, we need to preserve and protect \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:15 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to votes in relation to the following \namendments to S. 223, the FAA authorization bill, in the order listed \nbelow:\n  Levin amendment relative to repeal of 1099, the text of which is at \nthe desk; the Stabenow amendment No. 9, repeal of 1099; and the \nMcConnell amendment No. 13, which is the repeal of health care reform; \nthat no other amendments, points of order or motions be in order to \nthese amendments prior to the votes, except that a budget point of \norder, if applicable, remain in order to each of these amendments, and \nif one is raised, a motion to waive the budget point of order be in \norder; that if the motion to waive is agreed to, the amendment be \nconsidered agreed to; and the Senate then proceed to vote in relation \nto the next amendment in the sequence; further, that the Levin \namendment be subject to a 60-vote threshold for its adoption and if it \nfails to achieve 60 affirmative votes, the amendment be withdrawn.\n  Finally, that there be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to \neach vote; and that all votes after the first vote be limited to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 28\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, there is, I believe, overwhelming \nbipartisan support for repeal of the recent changes to the 1099 \nreporting requirement. Small businesses in my State and across the \ncountry have told us that the new reporting requirements they face \nunder the Affordable Care Act will create an unnecessary burden that \ncan make already tough times even tougher.\n  I believe there may even be a consensus among our colleagues that we \nshould act, but I strongly oppose one of the methods proposed to \naddress this problem. That method would undermine Congress's role in \nthe constitutional scheme of separation of powers among the branches of \ngovernment and it would abdicate Congress's responsibility to decide on \nthe spending of taxpayer dollars. We can and we should remove the 1099 \nburden on small businesses. We can and we should do so without \nabandoning our role in determining Federal spending. The power of the \npurse should not be handed to the President, any President. The \nchallenge we face is that repealing the section 1099 provision carries \na cost of about $22 billion over 10 years. The mechanism that some \nsupport to meet that cost would empower the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget to decide by himself which funds we have \nappropriated but that have not yet been obligated--which of those \nunobligated funds should be cut to pay the cost of repeal.\n\n  To some this may be a convenient way to relieve Congress of its \nresponsibility to make difficult choices. To others it may be a \nconvenient way to shift the blame for the painful impact of any cuts \nfrom Congress onto the President. But what is convenient is not always \nright. The Constitution places in our hands and ours alone the \nauthority to appropriate funds. We cannot statutorily pass that buck, \nand we should not.\n  The Framers of the Constitution consciously and deliberately placed \nthe power of the purse in the hands of the Congress. James Madison \ndescribed this authority as, ``the most complete and effectual weapon \nwith which any Constitution can arm the immediate representatives of \nthe people.''\n  We do not know what programs the Director of OMB will decide to \nreduce under the approach that some have proposed, but I do know that \nwhat they are proposing is that this would be his decision and his \ndecision alone. What are some areas the OMB Director could unilaterally \ncut? What is the universe of the potential cuts? Do we care? We surely \nshould, because the implications for our constituents will be \nsignificant.\n  Disaster Relief Enhancement Funds were set aside to help States \naffected by natural disasters in 2008. According to the Appropriations \nCommittee, 13 States received such funding and they all have \nunobligated balances. Would the Senators from those States turn over to \nthe OMB Director the decision whether to eliminate the unobligated \nbalances affecting their States? I would not. But that is what could \nhappen under the proposal that is going to be considered here later.\n  The Appropriations Committee tells us that the EPA has $624 million \nin unobligated balances in the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and \n$343 million in the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. In addition, \nthere is $388 million unobligated in specific State sewer programs \napproved by Congress. The two\n\n[[Page S472]]\n\nState revolving funds, $967 total, include projects in all 50 of our \nStates. So there is a $1.3 billion target that could affect sewer and \ndrinking water infrastructure in every one of our States. We \nappropriated those funds and if they are going to be cut, then we \nshould do the cutting and not hand that power over to the executive \nbranch, to the President's OMB Director.\n  According to our Appropriations Committee, the Department of Justice \nhad a total of $1.25 billion in unobligated funds as of November 30 \nlast year. It is probably lower now, but what is it? What programs are \npart of it? Do we know? Do we care? We surely should. Will the OMB \nDirector decide to cut funding for U.S. Attorneys' investigations and \nprosecutions? What about U.S. Marshals, who provide security to our \ncourthouses? Will the OMB Director decide to reduce funding for Project \nGunrunner, which is focused on firearms enforcement along the Southwest \nborder?\n  NASA had a total unobligated balance of $155 million as of the end of \nJanuary. About $10 million of that is for Constellation, the follow-on \nmanned space vehicle to the shuttle.\n  According to the Appropriations Committee, in recent years spending \nfor the Women, Infants and Children Program, the WIC Program, has \ntotaled more than $6 billion. Is the OMB Director going to decide to \ncut unobligated balances in the WIC Program? He could do so if we adopt \nthe approach that is going to be before us after the vote on our \namendment. I might agree to some of these cuts in a larger package but \nI would surely want to know what is in the whole package so we can \nadopt some priorities.\n  I favor the repeal of the 1099 reporting requirement and I favor \npaying the cost of repeal, whether through spending reductions or \nclosing tax loopholes. But I strongly oppose paying for the repeal by \nabdicating our power of the purse, the power we have under the \nConstitution. We cannot and we should not abdicate this to the \nexecutive branch to unilaterally make spending cuts to programs we have \npreviously enacted.\n  The provisions we are going to debate today but hopefully not adopt \nmust also be understood in a larger context, one that foresees the \ndifficult decisions ahead on how we will return to fiscal discipline. \nThere are many, perhaps even some in this Chamber, who believe that we \nin the Senate and here in the Congress are incapable of making these \ndecisions. They point out there are only two ways of lowering the \ndeficit, reducing spending or increasing taxes, and that neither of \nthese is popular with our constituents. They argue we will prove unable \nto muster the political courage to make decisions that we know will be \nunpopular, and there is some truth in those sentiments. Restoring \nfiscal balance will be painful and we are in the fiscal hole we are in \nbecause spending is popular and so are tax cuts, and we have provided \nplenty of both. It would certainly be easier for all of us if we could \nhand somebody else the authority to decide how to remedy the excesses \nof the past. But we cannot and should not run from this responsibility.\n  Justice Kennedy once put it this way: ``Failure of political will \ndoes not justify unconstitutional remedies.'' He added: ``The \nConstitution is a compact, enduring for more than our time, and one \nCongress cannot yield up its own powers. . . . Abdication of \nresponsibility,'' he said, ``is not part of the constitutional \ndesign.''\n  We must not run from painful decisions. Difficult or not, only the \nCongress can decide how to pay for repeal of these reporting \nrequirements. And difficult or not, only Congress can decide the larger \nissue of how to bring our spending in line with our revenues. If we \ncannot today exercise our responsibility on the finding of $22 billion \nto pay for the repeal of these reporting requirements, how can we \nexpect to tackle the much larger budget deficit we face?\n  There is an alternative amendment which we are offering today. I, \nalong with Senator Inouye and others, am proposing today an amendment \nwhich will make specific decisions on spending cuts and revenue \nincreases to account for the cost of repealing this provision. We would \nreform unjustified tax expenditures related to oil and gas production \nby large oil companies, companies that are enormously profitable with \nor without these tax expenditures. Our amendment will reform a loophole \nthat provides tax credits to filers who pay taxes both in the United \nStates and in foreign countries, and our amendment will eliminate some \nunintended loopholes used to avoid clearly intended rules on gift tax \nexemptions.\n  If there are better alternatives than the ones we are proposing, \nfine. Let's consider them. But what we cannot support is the abdication \nof our responsibility to make these decisions. It was the will and the \nwisdom of the Framers of the Constitution to give us that \nresponsibility and I urge our colleagues not to shrink from it but to \nexercise it.\n  I will yield the floor but first I call up our amendment and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Levin \namendment, which I believe is a far superior alternate to the Stabenow \namendment as it currently stands. The amendment offered today by \nSenator Stabenow proposes to rescind $44 billion from unobligated \nbalances of appropriated funds that are designated for specific \npurposes in various appropriations bills previously enacted by \nCongress. The Senator offers these rescissions in order to offset the \nloss of revenues resulting from an amendment.\n  This amendment is a perfect representation of what I expect to be a \nflood of similar amendments and stand-alone bills that seek to \neviscerate the nondefense functions of the Federal Government. With the \nexception of the proposal from the junior Senator from Kentucky, which \nhad the courage to list each and every cut he proposed, I expect many \nother bills and amendments will be blanket rescissions that leave it to \nthe executive branch to decide how the taxpayers' moneys will be spent. \nThese bills and amendments turn the constitutional separation of powers \non its head and provide a terribly dangerous precedent.\n  In the specific case of the Stabenow amendment, it simply provides \nfor generic rescission of funds, with the authority and decisionmaking \non the programs to be impacted delegated entirely to the executive \nbranch. Rescinding funds in this manner, as pointed out by Senator \nLevin, may be politically convenient as it simply cites the top line \nnumber of $44 billion, but it is also thoughtless and rash. It will \nserve to shelter those who vote in its favor from the righteous anger \nof Americans whose lives are disrupted when important and, in some \ncases, vital projects and programs are shut down as they inevitably \nwill be, should the amendment be agreed to.\n  I can also promise that if this amendment is enacted into law, the \nforce of these cuts will be felt in each of the 50 States, and the \ncapricious nature of the cuts will only deepen the pain.\n  I know that because we are in the middle of the second quarter of the \nfiscal year operating under a CR. Consequently, as I explained in \nNovember, the only unobligated balances remaining outside of those for \noperating under a CR in 2011 are those accounts that have slow spend \nrates, such as construction and infrastructure accounts. That is why it \nis taking $44 billion in rescissions to pay for a $19 billion problem. \nAs a result, we will be cutting deeply into our nondefense \ndiscretionary programs without congressional guidance and without any \nanalysis of the ultimate costs and impacts. This approach is simply \nirresponsible.\n  While we cannot say with certainty what the cuts will be because the \nexecutive branch will have complete authority over what programs will \nbe impacted, I believe the following cuts are likely: State and local \nlaw enforcement will face cuts of $200 million to $300 million in grant \nprograms, including $82 million in Violence Against Women grants, $81 \nmillion in Byrne and other Office of Justice grants, and $10 million in \nJuvenile Justice grants. Cutting these grant funds will take funding \nfrom programs already expected to be awarded, and will fall \nparticularly hard on States with large problems with crime.\n  A cut of $95 million from the DEA would mean halting efforts to go \nafter and take down Mexican drug cartels, to enforce narcoterrorist \ninvestigations, and information sharing, and to address emerging \ntechnologies used by drug traffickers. The TSA stands to lose $674 \nmillion of funds to procure and install over 200 explosive detecting \nsystems at airports across the Nation.\n  Finally, the U.S. Marshals would face a cut of $48.7 million, \nbringing an end to courthouse security equipment projects and also \nhalting Marshals' operations in the Southwest border where they engage \nin activities such as tracking fugitives.\n  Supporters of the Stabenow amendment would claim that I am using \nscare tactics, painting a dark picture when the real cuts are not as \ndevastating.\n  How can anyone stand here and claim we can cut $44 billion and not \nhave it hurt our States and our constituents? This amount is equivalent \nto funding the entire Department of Homeland Security, which covers \neverything from the Coast Guard to FEMA, from the Secret Service to the \nBorder Patrol.\n  No one denies that waste, fraud, and abuse exist and that we need to \ncontinue to enact reforms that will lesson waste, convict those who \nwould defraud the government, and eliminate abuses of programs that are \ndesigned to help those who need it most. But if this amendment is \nsigned into law, then 60 days later we will all get a harsh reminder \nthat campaigning against waste, fraud, and abuse is not the same thing \nas implementing a policy that cuts billions of dollars in useful \nspending. These rescissions will hurt individuals, they will hurt \ncommunities and jeopardize safety of life and our security.\n  Let me also point out to my colleagues that if this amendment is \nenacted, we cannot stop rescissions of unobligated balances from a \nsingle account we may view as vital because the amendment gives sole \ndecisionmaking power in identifying cuts to the executive branch.\n  I will say this again. This amendment is not in the best interests of \nthe Senate, it is not in the best interests of our democratic \npriorities, and it is certainly not in the best interests of the \nAmerican people.\n  If it is indeed the will of the Senate to eviscerate these critical \nprograms, let's stop hiding behind generic rescissions. Let's instead \nsupport the Levin amendment, which offsets a revenue loss with a \nrevenue gain, which eliminates unnecessary tax loopholes, and which \nwill leave important national priorities intact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to\n\n[[Page S474]]\n\na vote in relation to amendment No. 28, offered by the Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Levin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have just spoken on this. I ask unanimous \nconsent that we be allowed to yield back the time on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we all know that small business is the \nengine of the economy. This amendment will address a burdensome \nregulation we have all talked about. We need to repeal an unnecessary, \nburdensome provision in the law that would require 40 million \nbusinesses in America, most of them small businesses, to file 2,000 \npercent more paperwork with the IRS. We have a chance to do something \nabout that with this amendment.\n  I wish to thank Senator Baucus and his staff for their work.

Res. 70, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2009.\n  Mr. President, the amendment will significantly worsen the deficit--a \nfact confirmed by the CBO in a letter to Speaker Boehner on January 6. \nThe CBO letter says clearly they estimate that enacting the health care \nlaw repeal would increase Federal deficits in the decade after 2019 by \nan amount that is in the broad range around one-half percent of GDP for \nthat period. The GDP for that period is $293 trillion. Mr. President, \none-half of 1 percent is an increase in the deficit and debt of this \ncountry of more than $1.4 trillion.\n  We have heard colleagues on all sides say we have to get our deficits \nand debt under control. Yet one of the first measures is to explode the \ndeficits and debt, add $1.4 trillion to the debt. That is not just \nirresponsible, it is reckless. I urge my colleagues to support the \nbudget point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, only in Washington could you argue with \na straight face that starting a new multitrillion-dollar entitlement \nprogram is going to save money.

Mr. President, I regret having missed votes to \nconsider amendments to the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and \nSafety Improvement Act. I was celebrating the joyous occasion of my \nnewest grandson's birth with my wife and children.\n  Had I been present, I would have voted to oppose the motion to waive \nthe Budget Act on the amendment to repeal the landmark health care \nreform legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \nThis law provides health care coverage to more than 30 million \nAmericans and also reduces the deficit. The benefits that have already \nbeen achieved by this law are substantial. Its repeal would force \nseniors to pay more for their drug coverage, businesses would lose \nvaluable tax credits that enable them to provide health care coverage \nto their employees, and millions of Americans would no longer receive \nvital consumer protections from the health insurance industry. \nAdditionally, this law extends the solvency of Medicare for 12 more \nyears.\n  I have said before that a law this comprehensive would not be without \nflaws. I will support efforts to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and \nreduce the unintended consequences from it. I do not, however, support \nits repeal, which would not only be risky for our economy, but would \nhave the effect of increasing the number of uninsured and causing vital \nprograms such as Medicare to face insolvency in the very near future.\n  Had I been present, and consistent with my desire to continue to \nimprove the Affordable Care Act, I would have supported both Senators \nLevin and Stabenow's amendments to repeal the form 1099 reporting \nrequirement. This provision imposes an onerous compliance obligation on \nbusinesses of all sizes, and Congress should act quickly to remove that \nburden and allow businesses to direct their time, energy, and resources \nto growing their businesses and creating new jobs.\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I voted for the Affordable Care Act \nbecause the current health care system is simply unsustainable and it \nwill bankrupt our Nation. This law helps lay the groundwork for \ncontaining health care costs through leveraging private sector \ninnovation and competition to improve the quality and value of care in \nthis country. I was unable to vote today because of a family emergency, \nbut I wanted to register my strong opposition to Senator McConnell's \namendment which would repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n  The Affordable Care Act is already helping millions of Virginians and \nAmericans. The law has helped lower prescription costs for seniors, \nincluding over 63,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the Commonwealth of \nVirginia. It has provided affordable coverage for millions of young \nadults throughout the country who have been able to stay on their \nparent's plan and stopped insurers from denying coverage to children \ndue to a preexisting condition. Small businesses are benefiting from \ntax credits to cover the cost of offering health insurance coverage to \ntheir employees.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has stated that repealing the health \ncare reform law would add $230 billion to the deficit and take away \nthese immediate benefits and many other critical delivery systems \nreforms which currently are being implemented. Taking us back to the \nstatus quo is not an option.\n  This law is not perfect, nor will it be the final say in efforts to \nensure that we have a quality, affordable health care system which \nworks for American families and businesses.I have continued to push for \nfixes to parts of this law, including repealing the provision which \nplaced a burdensome requirement on small businesses to file a form \n1099, and will continue to pursue additional steps to further lower \nhealth care costs.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle to provide affordable, quality care to all Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to waive \nfurther reading of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend title 18, United States Code, to provide penalties \n    for aiming laser pointers at airplanes, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the end of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 733. PROHIBITION AGAINST AIMING A LASER POINTER AT AN \n                   AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) Offense.--Chapter 2 of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 39A. Aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft\n\n       ``(a) Whoever knowingly aims the beam of a laser pointer at \n     an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the \n     United States, or at the flight path of such an aircraft, \n     shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 \n     years, or both.\n       ``(b) As used in this section, the term `laser pointer' \n     means any device designed or used\n\n[[Page S476]]\n\n     to amplify electromagnetic radiation by stimulated emission \n     that emits a beam designed to be used by the operator as a \n     pointer or highlighter to indicate, mark, or identify a \n     specific position, place, item, or object.\n       ``(c) This section does not prohibit aiming a beam of a \n     laser pointer at an aircraft, or the flight path of such an \n     aircraft, by--\n       ``(1) an authorized individual in the conduct of research \n     and development or flight test operations conducted by an \n     aircraft manufacturer, the Federal Aviation Administration, \n     or any other person authorized by the Federal Aviation \n     Administration to conduct such research and development or \n     flight test operations;\n       ``(2) members or elements of the Department of Defense or \n     Department of Homeland Security acting in an official \n     capacity for the purpose of research, development, \n     operations, testing or training; or\n       ``(3) by an individual using a laser emergency signaling \n     device to send an emergency distress signal.\n       ``(d) The Attorney General, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Transportation, may provide by regulation, after \n     public notice and comment, such additional exceptions to this \n     section, as may be necessary and appropriate.

Aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft.''.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of this \namendment I have offered with Senators Kirk, Boxer, Durbin, Casey, \nMenendez, and Schumer to secure aircraft cockpits against lasers. This \ncommonsense and bipartisan amendment would protect passengers and \npilots by making it a Federal criminal offense to knowingly aim the \nbeam of a laser at an aircraft.\n  As explained in a recent article in the New York Times, ``a beam that \nis \\1/25\\ of an inch wide at its origin can be 2 to 3 feet wide by the \ntime it reaches an airliner approaching or departing an airport.'' As a \nresult, when targeted at aircraft, laser stripes can instantly flash \nacross the cockpit, temporarily blinding the pilot and the crew. One \npilot described the feeling of being hit by a laser like this:\n\n       It immediately lit up the whole cockpit and it hit both of \n     my eyes and burned both of my corneas. Instantly, I was \n     blinded. It felt like I was hit in the face with a baseball \n     bat--just an intense burning pain.\n\n  FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt similarly recently warned that lasers \ncan ``damage a pilot's eyes or cause temporary blindness.'' Indeed, \npilots have described the need to hand control of their aircraft to a \ncopilot as a result of one of these incidents.\n  It goes without saying that such a threat to a pilot's sight, \nparticularly during the critical phases of takeoff and landing, poses \nan unacceptable risk to the traveling public, to our pilots, and to \ncitizens on the ground. For this reason, Secretary of Transportation \nRay LaHood recently described laser incidents as ``a serious safety \nissue.''\n  The problem is growing. According to a recent report by the Federal \nAviation Administration, 2,836 pilots reported that they were targeted \nwith lasers in 2010, nearly double the number in 2009. In other words, \nevery day, eight pilots and the passengers they fly are put at risk in \nthe manner I described. The problem affects airports of all sizes \nacross the country.\n  At T.F. Green Airport, for instance, in my home State of Rhode \nIsland, there were 12 such reported incidents just in the last year. \nThe problem also is worsening as new and more powerful lasers become \ncommercially available. These new lasers emit an increasingly bright \nbeam that can reach aircraft miles away from the airport.\n  Current Federal law does not provide prosecutors with ready tools to \nprosecute and thus deter this dangerous conduct. Ill-fitting existing \nstatutes occasionally can be used, but only in limited cases, leaving \neven identified perpetrators to go unpunished. My amendment would solve \nthis problem by creating a criminal offense that clearly and distinctly \ncovers this harmful conduct. It would explicitly criminalize knowingly \naiming the beam of a laser pointer at an aircraft. Violations would \nlead to punishment of imprisonment for up to 5 years or fines of up to \n$250,000.\n  The legislation would exempt valid uses of lasers in the aviation \ncontext, such as designated research and development activities, flight \ntest operations, training, and emergency signaling. Prosecutors would \ngain a new, valuable tool to protect air safety without any burden \nbeing imposed on the legitimate use of lasers.\n  Comparable bipartisan legislation has previously passed the House of \nRepresentatives and was reported favorably out of the House Judiciary \nCommittee this year. It is widely supported. For example, this \namendment is supported by the Airline Pilots Association and the \nNational Association of Police Organizations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters from those organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Government Affairs Department, Air Line Pilots \n           Association, International,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 1, 2011.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf the Air Line Pilots Association, \n     International (ALPA) which represents 53,000 pilots who fly \n     for 38 airlines in the U.S. and Canada, I urge you to support \n     the Whitehouse-Kirk-Boxer amendment to protect aircraft \n     flight decks from the threat posed by laser illuminations as \n     the Senate considers S. 223, the FAA reauthorization bill.\n       On January 19, the FAA announced that the number of reports \n     of lasers pointed at airplanes nearly doubled in one year to \n     more than 2,800. The inappropriate use of widely available \n     laser pointers against airborne flight crews is a genuine \n     safety and security concern and is simply unacceptable. At a \n     minimum, the laser illumination of a cockpit creates a flight \n     crew distraction and in more serious cases can result in eye \n     damage and temporary incapacitation.\n       Along with a number of federal law enforcement \n     organizations, ALPA has long maintained that the reckless and \n     malicious laser illumination of airliners should be \n     prosecuted as a specific federal offense and not solely as a \n     violation of state laws. This amendment ensures that such \n     activity will, in fact, be classified and prosecuted in that \n     manner and will provide additional benefit by informing the \n     public that shining laser beams into aircraft cockpits is a \n     dangerous offense which will be met with serious \n     consequences.\n       ALPA applauded the U.S. House of Representatives last year \n     for passing similar legislation, the Securing Aircraft \n     Cockpits Against Lasers Act of 2010. It should be noted that \n     the House Judiciary Committee has this year unanimously \n     reported out an identical bill, H.R. 386.\n       Again, we urge you to support the Whitehouse-Kirk-Boxer \n     amendment which will enhance the safety and security of all \n     airline passengers and crewmembers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Lee Moak,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                   Police Organizations, Inc.,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, February 1, 2011.\n     Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Whitehouse: On behalf of the National \n     Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), representing \n     241,000 rank-and-file police officers from across the United \n     States, I would like to thank and commend you for your \n     support to secure aircraft cockpits against laser pointers. \n     The House of Representatives Judiciary Committee recently \n     passed H.R. 386, a bill that would prohibit the aiming of a \n     laser beam at an aircraft or in its flight path by punishing \n     offenders with an imposed fine or prison term.\n       The Federal Flight Deck Officers Association is a member of \n     NAPO. Together, we have a vested interest in protecting \n     pilots and passengers from the harmful effects of laser \n     pointers. On January 19, 2010, the Federal Aviation \n     Administration announced that the reports of laser pointers \n     being pointed at aircrafts basically doubled in one year from \n     1,400 to 2,800 incidents. Laser beams pointed at an aircraft \n     can cause temporary blindness to pilots and jeopardize \n     aviation security.\n       Helping to protect our nation from potential gaps in the \n     enforcement of homeland security is one of NAPO's top \n     priorities. NAPO urges both chambers to take swift action in \n     passage of legislation that seeks to bolster security and \n     thwart criminal acts.\n       Securing cockpits is an important safety measure that law \n     enforcement is willing to support. NAPO believes H.R. 386 and \n     companion legislation is essential to assist the law \n     enforcement community in the protection of our nation from \n     security threats. If you have any questions on how NAPO can \n     support your efforts, please feel free to contact me, or \n     NAPO's Director of Government Affairs, Rachel Hedge.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Johnson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank Senators Kirk, Boxer, Durbin,\n\n[[Page S477]]\n\nCasey, Menendez, and Schumer for their leadership on this issue. I also \nthank our partners in the House for their work, and let me thank \nChairman Rockefeller and Ranking Member Hutchison for considering this \namendment.\n  I hope Senators on both sides of the aisle will join me in voting for \nthis amendment that will protect our public safety against this new \nhazard.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added \nas a cosponsor to this superb amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I have some notes, but the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island has exhausted my brilliant notes in his own speech. \nJust let it be said that it is an extraordinarily dangerous situation, \nthis whole concept of stronger lasers, more carefully targeted lasers \nfrom greater distances, and being able to do it from behind trees and \nhidden places blinding, probably temporarily at this point but maybe \npermanently as they become stronger or doing damage to the eye.\n  When the Senator spoke about having to turn over the duties of \nlanding the airplane or taking off the airplane to a copilot because of \nthis threat, it makes me worry that it is going to get worse because \nthis is kind of easy to do. In essence, it becomes an act of terrorism, \nnot just the problem of safety for the airplane and its passengers and \nthe pilots.\n\n  It is a superb amendment. It is my strong feeling it will pass this \nbody easily and it will become law. The Senator from Rhode Island \ndeserves enormous credit for bringing this to the attention of the \nCongress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the distinguished chairman for his very kind \nwords. Let me thank him for his efforts to support this amendment. His \ncosponsorship is extremely important. I look forward to working with \nwhatever I can bring to get this amendment successfully adopted into \nthe bill and to get the bill successfully passed. I very much \nappreciate the chairman's distinguished leadership.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I reluctantly suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/02/senate-section/article/S477-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary \nachievements of Andre Kirk Agassi, professional tennis player and \nfellow Nevadan, for his induction into the International Tennis Hall of \nFame earlier this month.\n  He was born on April 29, 1970, in Las Vegas to Mike and Betty Agassi. \nThe son of a former Iranian Olympic boxer, Andre Agassi's father taught \nhim to play tennis at a very young age. At 16 he made his professional \ndebut, and 1 year later he won his first singles title. He quickly rose \nto the international stage and was soon ranked No.1 in the world. He \ncontinued to represent Nevada and the United States, as well as \nathletes by winning a gold medal, which he earned at the 1996 Olympic \nGames in Atlanta, and by capturing eight Grand Slams.\n  He is known as one of the most impressive champions in tennis \nhistory, and his charisma for the game drew attention and rivals alike. \nMany recall the great tennis rivalry with Pete Sampras of the mid-1990s \nwhich recaptured a robust following of tennis fans.\n  Despite his tremendous success as an athlete, his accomplishments off \nthe court are just as impressive. After his first Grand Slam title, \nAgassi founded the Andre Agassi Charitable Association, which has \nraised more than $60 million to help disadvantaged youth in Nevada. In \n2001, he also established a charter school for children in underserved \ncommunities and has funded countless scholarships. And just as he \nachieved the No. 1 ranking as a tennis player, Agassi recently reached \nthe top spot on the New York Times Best Sellers List when he released \nhis autobiography.\n  I commend Andre for his efforts and extend my congratulations to his \nwife Steffi and their two children. Andre Agassi is an inspiration to \nall Nevada's student-athletes and I am pleased that his hard work and \nexcellence is being recognized with the highest honor an athlete can \nreceive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/02/senate-section/article/S477-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S477-S479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DELISTING OF THE GRAY WOLF\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have joined my colleagues to introduce \nlegislation to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to remove the \ngray wolf. The Endangered Species Act has proved a failure for wolf \nconservation. I believe Congress must pave the way for a new State-\nbased approach.\n  Since the listing of the gray wolf as endangered in 1976, the Federal \nwolf recovery programs have been in continuous litigation. The latest \nFederal district court decision returning the Rocky Mountain gray wolf \nto the Endangered Species List despite a population in excess of agreed \nupon recovery goals was the last straw. It is evident now that science \nis not driving recovery; rather, judicial decisions and consent \nagreements with special interest groups are dictating the fate of \nwolves and impacted communities. Despite the authorities and \nresponsibilities conveyed to States by Congress under section 6 of the \nEndangered Species Act, State wildlife agencies have become mere \nbystanders in wolf management under this paradigm.\n  Take the Mexican gray wolf in the Southwest. The U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service, USFWS, has not been able to revise the recovery plan \nfor that wolf in 28 years. Why? Because of the litigious nature of \nactivist organizations. Another attempt to overhaul the program and \ndevelop a recovery plan is under way, but USFWS estimates that plan is \nat least 4 to 6 years away, assuming no litigation. We can't expect the \npublic or the wolves to continue to wait.\n  Acceptance of wolves on the landscape requires preventing, mitigating \nand responding to livestock depredation and nuisance issues on public, \nprivate and tribal lands. It requires trust and implementation of \nsolutions collaboratively developed by local stakeholders. It's time to \ngive States the chance to demonstrate that they can make wolf \nconservation work for both people and wolves.\n  Restoring wildlife is not new to States or tribes. In my home State \nof Arizona, the Game and Fish Department has been very successful in \ncollaborative conservation. A great example is the Southwestern bald \neagle. The Game and Fish Department's intensive interagency management \nof this species has increased its numbers and prevented its listing. \nThe Arizona Game and Fish seeks to apply this proven approach to wolf \nconservation. This bill, if enacted, would give them the opportunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following documents be printed in \nthe Record in support of this legislation: a letter from the Arizona \nGame and Fish Department dated December 7, 2010, and a resolution \nadopted by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies dated \nJanuary 9, 2011.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             The State of Arizona,\n\n\n                                     Game and Fish Department,\n\n                                    Phoenix, AZ, December 7, 2010.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Trent Franks,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator John McCain, Senator Jon Kyl and Congressman \n     Trent Franks: The Arizona Game and Fish Commission has \n     concluded it is beyond time to try a different approach to \n     Mexican wolf conservation. We ask\n\n[[Page S478]]\n\n     that you help us do that by working with other members of \n     Congress to delist the gray wolf rangewide (i.e. including \n     the Mexican wolf) and place the conservation burden for this \n     species on the States and willing Tribes. Restoring wildlife \n     is not new to either the States or the Tribes. Witness what \n     has been accomplished with many other species since the early \n     1900s. And recognize that when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n     Service (USFWS) speaks with justifiable pride about its \n     efforts to recover endangered and threatened species, many, \n     if not most, of those efforts are carried out by or at least \n     with substantial assistance from State and Tribal wildlife \n     agencies.\n       After a lengthy public session on December 4, the Arizona \n     Game and Fish Commission (Commission) voted 4-1 to support \n     Congressional actions to delist the gray wolf from protection \n     under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended. \n     The vote reflects the fact that we do not want to get out of \n     the wolf conservation business; rather, we want to get in \n     deeper but more affordably, efficiently and effectively. \n     Bureaucratic process compelled by litigation has driven the \n     cost of Mexican wolf conservation out of reach for States, \n     Tribes and private stakeholders. We cannot print our own \n     money.\n       According to USFWS estimates, we are faced with the \n     prospects of at least 2 years of recovery planning, 4-5 years \n     of environmental impact analysis and 1 to 2 years of federal \n     rulemaking. Even if some of the Federal process can occur \n     simultaneously, and even if litigation does not draw the \n     process out (an extremely unlikely event), it would likely be \n     4 to 6 years before all the pieces are in place to effect \n     significant change in the current approach to Mexican wolf \n     recovery through reintroduction. We want to put precious \n     State resources, public resources and private resources into \n     on-the-ground wolf conservation rather than regulatory \n     process and legal fees.\n       The Commission sees this as an opportunity to break through \n     the litigation and Federal process gridlock in Mexican wolf \n     recovery and reintroduction that has impeded progress since \n     2001 and welcomes the opportunity to manage this important \n     species. The Commission desires to work with every \n     stakeholder and all who are willing to come to the table to \n     seek (and collaboratively fund) solutions to issues. Local \n     governments, sportsmen, livestock operators, \n     environmentalists and the White Mountain Apache Tribe have \n     all repeatedly stated their support for Mexican wolf \n     conservation in Arizona, as has the Commission. Opponents of \n     wolf conservation are a distinct but vocal minority.\n       If the Mexican wolf were delisted by Congressional action, \n     the Commission would anticipate taking the same approach to \n     its conservation that we have taken with the Southwestern \n     bald eagle. We would sustain the interagency conservation \n     effort that has been in place since 1998 but modify it as \n     necessary to address significant problems that were \n     identified in program reviews in 2001, 2002 and 2005. USFWS \n     is our most important agency partner in wildlife conservation \n     and we would work closely to engage them under a new paradigm \n     developed with our stakeholders. We are confident that, \n     unfettered by the regulatory and litigation gridlock that has \n     peaked over the past three years, we and willing cooperators \n     in the governmental (including USFWS and Tribes) and \n     nongovernmental sectors could find an appropriate balance \n     among the more significant needs for and constraints on \n     Mexican wolf conservation. Such a balance would result in an \n     ecologically appropriate wolf population, sufficient prey \n     populations to support the wolves without eroding hunter \n     opportunity or unnecessarily reducing other outdoor \n     recreation, and with significantly reduced uncompensated \n     impacts on public, Tribal and private lands livestock \n     producers in Arizona.\n       Maintaining a robust Mexican wolf conservation program is \n     fundamental to our commitment to wildlife under Arizona \n     Revised Statutes Title 17 and is indicative of our commitment \n     since 1985 under Section 6 of the ESA to maintain an \n     ``adequate and active program for the conservation of \n     endangered species and threatened species.'' We have invested \n     more than $5 million in Mexican wolf conservation and since \n     2003 the Department has been the primary glue holding the \n     interagency Arizona-New Mexico wolf reintroduction project \n     together at the agency oversight and field levels. We have \n     tried everything possible, short of legal action or \n     Congressional intervention, to remedy the gridlock resulting, \n     in large part, from litigation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n     Service has been unable to respond as necessary to resolve \n     even the most obvious significant problems, perhaps largely \n     because of legal and policy issues stemming from litigation \n     over the Northern Rockies and Western Great Lakes gray \n     wolf programs as well as the Mexican wolf program, but \n     also, at least in part, because of the complexity and \n     rigidity of Federal regulatory processes. Regardless, the \n     livestock producers affected by Mexican wolf \n     reintroduction simply cannot afford more years of gridlock \n     and neither can Arizona Game and Fish. Further, Arizona \n     cannot afford to continue investing significant time and \n     money in wolf conservation only to arrive at a day when, \n     as has occurred in the Northern Rockies and Western Great \n     Lakes, special interest groups with public lands agendas \n     much broader than wolf conservation refuse to accept as \n     recovered even a population of wolves that is several \n     times larger than required by an approved Recovery Plan \n     they helped develop.\n       We realize Congressional listing or delisting of any \n     species would usurp authorities conveyed through the ESA to \n     the Secretaries of Interior and Commerce. That would set a \n     precedent few if any of us have ever wanted to see, including \n     Arizona Game and Fish. However, none of us ever anticipated \n     the degree to which the judiciary would usurp those same \n     authorities in an environment of continuous litigation under \n     the ESA and the Administrative Procedures Act. Congressional \n     delisting is not a step that we advocate lightly but the \n     Mexican wolf was included in the 1976 Federal listing of the \n     gray wolf as endangered and there is still no indication the \n     ESA-driven approach to recovery will ever be successful. In \n     fact, there is ample evidence to the contrary. USFWS has not \n     been able to revise the Recovery Plan in 28 years; how can \n     anyone possibly hope it can achieve Mexican wolf recovery in \n     our lifetimes under the current procedural morass that \n     constrains it?\n       Congressional delisting would represent sailing uncharted \n     waters fraught with unforeseen challenges. So be it. Far \n     better to test ourselves against those challenges than to \n     allow the current gridlock to force us all to continue doing \n     the same unproductive things over and over again for another \n     decade; with litigation at virtually every step of the way, \n     no change in outcome and no greater hope for success in our \n     lifetimes. A decade from now, we would much rather regret \n     having stepped boldly and failed than having wasted another \n     10 years trying to make the litigation-driven approach to \n     Mexican wolf conservation work.\n       It is truly ironic that successful conservation of the \n     Mexican wolf might hinge on removing it from the control of \n     the Congressional Act that was intended to save it.\n       Please let me know if there is anything more I can do to \n     encourage or facilitate your consideration of this crucial \n     issue. I would be happy to send a member of my staff to \n     Washington, D.C. to provide key members of your staffs a more \n     detailed description of the gridlock I have referenced above. \n     One member of my staff has worked with Mexican wolf \n     conservation for 28 years and has a comprehensive grasp of \n     the story from the beginning through present times. It is a \n     compelling story that makes the depth of frustration among \n     Arizona stakeholders more understandable.\n       Representatives from sportsman, environmental, livestock \n     producer, Tribal and local government stakeholders are \n     prepared to accompany my staff to answer your questions \n     regarding this situation and the need for constructive \n     change. An alternative would be for key members of your \n     staffs to meet with these stakeholders in Alpine, Arizona, so \n     a better appreciation of the local situation could be \n     provided, possibly through a tour of ``wolf country'' in \n     Arizona. I would be equally happy to facilitate such a \n     meeting, as I believe would any of the three County \n     governments in eastern Arizona that are among our most \n     constructive cooperators in Mexican wolf conservation.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Larry D. Voyles,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Resolution\n\n\n       DELIST THE GRAY WOLF AND RESTORE MANAGEMENT TO THE STATES\n\n       Whereas, the northern Rocky Mountain distinct population \n     segment of gray wolves exceeded the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n     Service recovery level of thirty or more breeding pairs in \n     2002; and\n       Whereas, population estimates as of 2009 include at least \n     1,700 animals well distributed among Idaho, Montana, and \n     Wyoming; and\n       Whereas, the remarkable increase in gray wolf populations \n     was only possible because of the historic management and \n     stewardship of ungulates by state fish and wildlife agencies; \n     and\n       Whereas, a primary purpose of the Endangered Species Act \n     (ESA) is to ``provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon \n     which endangered species and threatened species depend may be \n     conserved, to provide a program for the conservation of such \n     endangered species and threatened species, and to take such \n     steps as may be appropriate to achieve the purposes of the \n     treaties and conventions set forth in subsection (a) of this \n     section.''; and\n       Whereas, the primary purpose of the ESA has clearly been \n     achieved for the gray wolf, and gray wolves have recovered in \n     the States of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming; and\n       Whereas, a lack of delisting, given the species has met \n     recovery goals, can result in an erosion of public acceptance \n     of wolves and the ESA; and\n       Whereas, State wildlife agencies are the competent \n     authorities to manage resident species for their sustained \n     use and enjoyment; and\n       Whereas, the overall aim of the ESA is to recover species \n     such that the species can be managed by the appropriate \n     entity. State wildlife agencies are the appropriate entities \n     to assume management of the gray wolf as a resident species; \n     and\n       Whereas, delays in federal decision-making, induced partly \n     by citizen-suit litigation over virtually all aspects of \n     Mexican gray wolf recovery, have, after 34 years of \n     protection under the ESA, including 12 years of \n     reintroduction efforts, resulted in failure to recover the \n     Mexican gray wolf; and\n       Whereas, the States of Arizona and New Mexico, the White \n     Mountain Apache Tribe,\n\n[[Page S479]]\n\n     various local governments and local stakeholders are willing \n     and able to use incentives and interdiction measures without \n     being encumbered by the gridlock resulting from federal \n     listing, to increase the Mexican gray wolf population to \n     levels in both states that, coupled with conservation efforts \n     in Mexico, would establish and maintain a rangewide \n     population of Mexican gray wolves that is self-sustaining and \n     managed at levels sufficient to meet scientifically-valid \n     population objectives. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife \n     Agencies supports and endorses immediate delisting of gray \n     wolves in the WAFWA member states from the ESA, either \n     through legislative or administrative means, and that this \n     species be managed by the respective State wildlife agencies.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have joined my colleagues \nin introducing legislation that would delist the gray wolf from \nendangered species status thereby returning wolf population management \nto the respective State wildlife agencies. As my colleagues know, \nFederal efforts to recover the gray wolf and related subspecies are \ncontroversial throughout the West and Midwest including my home State \nof Arizona.\n  Officially listed in 1974, the gray wolf was among the first animals \nprotected under the Endangered Species Act. At that time, gray wolves \nwere undoubtedly a broken species, hunted to near extinction by western \npioneers. But in the 1990s, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service launched \nan ambitious wolf repopulation effort in several States where wolves \nhad been eradicated. Federal biologists released dozens of wolf \nbreeding pairs into parts of Montana, Wyoming, Idaho as well as Arizona \nand New Mexico in the hopes that these so-called experimental \npopulations would reestablish their historic ranges.\n  In the northern Rocky Mountains, these efforts largely paid off in \n2002 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that it achieved \nits population goal of 30 breeding pairs and 300 wolves in Idaho, \nMontana and Wyoming. In fact, the Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Program \nwas so successful at breeding pups that by 2005 they reached 49 \nbreeding pairs and 663 total wolves. Today those numbers stand at over \n71 breeding pairs and about 1,700 total wolves, far surpassing the \nstated goals of the Federal Government's wolf recovery plan. Despite \nthis remarkable comeback, several environmentalist groups have used the \njudicial process to keep gray wolf populations under various forms of \nFederal protection, even to the detriment of native deer and elk \npopulations which are dropping dramatically because of so many predator \nwolves. By keeping wolves locked into federally protected status, State \nwildlife authorities are legally prevented from rightfully controlling \ntheir exploding wolf population. At the same time the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service is forced to overextend its resources, reach and \nwelcome on a program that achieved its goals almost a decade ago. This \nsimply cannot continue.\n  With respect to Arizona, my support for delisting the gray wolf is \nnot a mandate for wolf hunts but rather to establish a path forward for \nsaving the Mexican gray wolf from a failed Federal recovery program and \nto provide essential protections for livestock growers. If you compare \nthe success of the northern Rockies against the dismal returns of the \nMexican Wolf Recovery Program in Arizona and New Mexico, you see how \nFederal mismanagement and judicial activism have combined to hurt both \nranchers and wolves. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service introduced 13 \nwolves in 1998 and estimated that the Southwest should have 100 wolves \nby now but in fact we have barely topped 42 wolves over the past 12 \nyears. Pup survival in Arizona and New Mexico remains bleak with 31 \nobserved in 2009 but only 7 surviving the winter. Livestock \ndepredations remain a constant concern even though the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service recently rescinded rules that allow rancher's to \nprotect their cattle for depredation. To date, the Mexican Wolf \nRecovery Program has cost taxpayers roughly $20 million or roughly \n$500,000 per wolf with no end in sight. By removing Federal protections \nfor the Mexican gray wolf, management and recovery responsibilities \nwould be transferred from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to the \nState's wildlife authority, the Arizona Game and Fish Commission, which \nrecently voted to support this proposal.\n  The facts on the ground paint a clear picture that it is time to \nreturn management and recovery of these wolf populations to the States. \nI urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/02/senate-section/article/S479-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              UNI-CAPITOL WASHINGTON INTERNSHIP PROGRAMME\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the Uni-\nCapitol Washington Internship Programme, UCWIP. For more than a decade, \nthis international internship program has been enabling outstanding \nAustralian college students to participate in internships throughout \nthe U.S. Congress.\n  Students participating in the program obtain immeasurable experience \nthrough their congressional internships, and participants also have the \nopportunity to participate in other educational experiences, including \nU.S. historic site and government agency visits and other learning \nevents. I am proud to be involved in this rewarding and well-rounded \nexchange program, and I am grateful for the contribution Uni-Capitol \nWashington Programme interns continue to make in providing valuable \nviewpoints and helping me serve Idaho constituents.\n  Gemma Whiting, a UCWIP participant, has joined my staff as an intern \nthis semester. She is studying law/arts at the University of Western \nAustralia, where she is majoring in political science and international \nrelations. Gemma has spent many hours helping keep my schedule and \nactivities running smoothly, and she has been an immense asset. Her \ncommitment and hard work are appreciated, and we are fortunate to have \nGemma as a part of the team. I asked her to share her impressions \nregarding the program and her internship. She said, ``It was an honor \nto be a part of UCWIP 2011. The opportunity to work in Senator Crapo's \noffice has been the most remarkable experience. I could not have hoped \nfor a more welcoming and affable office. The insight gained through \nthis opportunity is invaluable, adding a higher level of understanding \nto the intricate workings of the U.S. Congress and the world's foremost \ndemocracy. This internship has been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, \nadding priceless knowledge to my studies in Law and Political Science. \nI could not have had a more enjoyable or memorable experience thanks to \nSenator Crapo's office.''\n  I also commend the efforts of the program's director and founder, \nEric Federing, who has utilized his own Capitol Hill and Australia \nexperiences to provide this important exchange opportunity that \nbenefits both Australian students and congressional offices. His \ninterest and skill have been instrumental in shaping an outstanding \nprogram.\n  I look forward to continuing my association with the Uni-Capitol \nWashington Internship Programme, which I have been honored to be \ninvolved with for 5 years. I commend Gemma Whiting, Eric Federing and \nthe other Uni-Capitol Washington Internship Programme participants and \ninterns for contributing to the 12 successful years of this important \nprogram that facilitates the valuable broadening of relationships and \nunderstanding between our two countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/02/senate-section/article/S479-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S479-S480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            ABILITYONE PROGRAM AND THE ARC OF CADDO-BOSSIER\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I recognize a program which \nin the last several years has helped more than 45,000 Americans who are \nblind or who have significant disabilities gain skills and training \nthat ultimately led to gainful employment, the AbilityOne Program.\n  The AbilityOne Program is the single largest source of jobs for \nAmericans who are blind or have significant disabilities. The program \nharnesses the purchasing power of the Federal Government to buy \nproducts and services from participating community-based nonprofit \nagencies that are dedicated to training and employing individuals with \ndisabilities. This program affords Americans with disabilities the \nopportunity to acquire job skills, training, good wages, benefits, \nwhile providing greater independence and quality of life.\n\n[[Page S480]]\n\n  I am especially proud to acknowledge that the AbilityOne Program is \naffiliated with the Arc of Caddo-Bossier in Shreveport, LA.\n  The history of the Arc of Caddo-Bossier represents a true example of \nwhat it means to grow and help people with disabilities to become an \nactive and contributing part of society. The Arc of Caddo-Bossier was \nfounded in 1954 by a small group of parents with a mission to promote \nthe growth of their children by developing programs and services to \nmeet their needs. In 1996, the Arc of Caddo-Bossier Foundation was \nestablished to further promote community involvement and programs for \npeople with mental disabilities. Today, the Arc of Caddo-Bossier still \nremains committed to their unique mission to help the needs of people \nwith developmental disabilities and their families.\n  It is with great pleasure that I first extend my support to the \nAbilityOne Program. Secondly, I commend the dedication and commitment \nof the Arc of Caddo-Bossier executive director, Janet Parker, and her \nstaff for helping individuals who have a disability find employment. \nTheir work helps people live fuller lives and become more active \nmembers of their community. I also commend each AbilityOne employee who \nworks every day to improve their lives and make our country a better \nplace to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/02/senate-section/article/S480-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/02/senate-section/article/S480-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/02/senate-section/article/S480-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT CONCERNING THE RATIFICATION OF THE TREATY BETWEEN THE UNITED \n   STATES OF AMERICA AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON MEASURES FOR THE \nFURTHER REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE ARMS, SIGNED IN \n        PRAGUE ON APRIL 8, 2010 (THE ``NEW START TREATY'')--PM 4\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I have considered the United States Senate's December 22, 2010, \nResolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification of the Treaty between \nthe United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for \nthe Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, \nsigned in Prague on April 8, 2010, with Protocol, including Annexes \n(the ``New START Treaty''; Treaty Document 111-5), and I hereby certify \nthat:\n  1. United States National Technical Means, in conjunction with the \nverification activities provided for in the New START Treaty, are \nsufficient to ensure effective monitoring of Russian compliance with \nthe provisions of the New START Treaty and timely warning of any \nRussian preparation to break out of the limits in Article II of the New \nSTART Treaty.\n  2. The New START Treaty does not require, at any point during which \nit will be in force, the United States to provide to the Russian \nFederation telemetric information under Article IX of the New START \nTreaty, Part Seven of the Protocol, and the Annex on Telemetric \nInformation to the Protocol for the launch of (a) any missile defense \ninterceptor, as defined in paragraph 44 of Part One of the Protocol to \nthe New START Treaty; (b) any satellite launches, missile defense \nsensor targets, and missile defense intercept targets, the launch of \nwhich uses the first stage of an existing type of United States \nintercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) or submarine-launched \nballistic missile (SLBM) listed in paragraph 8 of Article III of the \nNew START Treaty; or (c) any missile described in clause (a) of \nparagraph 7 of Article III of the New START Treaty.\n  3. I intend to (a) modernize or replace the triad of strategic \nnuclear delivery systems: a heavy bomber and air-launched cruise \nmissile, an ICBM, and a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine \n(SSBN) and SLBM; and (b) maintain the United States rocket motor \nindustrial base.\n\n  4. (a) The United States will seek to initiate, following \nconsultation with NATO Allies but not later than 1 year after the entry \ninto force of the New START Treaty, negotiations with the Russian \nFederation on an agreement to address the disparity between the non-\nstrategic (tactical) nuclear weapons stockpiles of the Russian \nFederation and of the United States and to secure and reduce tactical \nnuclear weapons in a verifiable manner; and (b) it is the policy of the \nUnited States that such negotiations shall not include defensive \nmissile systems.\n  5. I intend to (a) accelerate, to the extent possible, the design and \nengineering phase of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research. Replacement \n(CMRR) building and the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF); and (b) \nrequest full funding, including on a multi-year basis as appropriate, \nfor the CMRR building and the UPF upon completion of the design and \nengineering phase for such facilities.\n  6. It is the policy of the United States to continue development and \ndeployment of United States missile defense systems to defend against \nmissile threats from nations such as North Korea and Iran, including \nqualitative and quantitative improvements to such systems. As stated in \nthe resolution, such systems include all phases of the Phased Adaptive \nApproach to missile defenses in Europe, the modernization of the \nGround-Based Midcourse Defense system, and the continued development of \nthe two-stage Ground-Based Interceptor as a technological and strategic \nhedge. As I stated in my letter to the Senate of December 18, 2010, the \nUnited States believes that these systems do not and will not threaten \nthe strategic balance with the Russian Federation. Consequently, while \nthe United States cannot circumscribe the sovereign rights of the \nRussian Federation under paragraph 3 of Article XIV of the Treaty, the \nUnited States believes continued improvement and deployment of United \nStates missile defense systems do not constitute a basis for \nquestioning the effectiveness and viability of the Treaty, and \ntherefore would not give rise to circumstances justifying the \nwithdrawal of the Russian Federation from the Treaty.\n  The report called for in the sixth Condition of the Resolution will \nbe provided under separate cover to the Committees on Armed Services \nand Foreign Relations.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 2, 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/02/senate-section/article/S480-4", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S480-S481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-405.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of Rockland \n     County, New York urging Congress to pass the Livable \n     Communities Act of 2010; to the Committee on Banking, \n     Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                           Resolution No. 624\n\n       Whereas, the Rockland County Legislature agrees that \n     demographic trends support the need for cooperation in land \n     use planning and the development of housing and \n     transportation. The population of the United States will grow \n     from approximately 307,000,000 people to approximately \n     439,000,000 people during the period between 2009 and 2050, \n     an increase of more than 40 percent; and\n       Whereas, the Energy Information Administration of the \n     Department of Energy forecasts that driving will increase 59 \n     percent between 2005 and 2030, far outpacing the projected 23 \n     percent increase in population; and\n       Whereas, demographers estimate that as much as 30 percent \n     of current demand for housing is for housing in dense, \n     walkable, mixed-use communities, and that less than 2 percent \n     of new housing is in this category; and\n       Whereas, people who live in areas of compact development \n     (where housing, shopping, jobs, and public transportation are \n     in close proximity) drive 20 to 40 percent less than people \n     who live in average development patterns in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, transportation accounts for 70 percent of the oil \n     consumed in the United States and nearly 1/3 of carbon \n     emissions in the United States come from the transportation \n     sector. Reducing the growth of the number of miles driven and \n     providing transportation alternatives through good planning \n     and sustainable development is a necessary part of the energy \n     independence and climate change strategies of the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, a number of studies, reports, and articles by \n     organizations including the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     the National Association of Realtors, and the Transit \n     Cooperative Research Project have found that one of the keys \n     to revitalizing and maintaining the character of town centers \n     and preserving surrounding agricultural land in small and \n     rural communities is to prevent commercial and residential \n     development on the outskirts of town, by promoting integrated \n     housing, economic, and transportation development in town \n     centers; and\n       Whereas, funding for integrated housing, transportation, \n     energy, environmental, and economic development and other \n     land use planning efforts at the local and regional levels is \n     necessary to provide for sustainable development and smart \n     growth, and\n       Whereas, the Livable Communities Act of 2010 would provide \n     funding and support services to help municipalities make \n     smart planning decisions by:\n       1. facilitating and improving the coordination of housing, \n     community development, transportation, energy, and \n     environmental policy in the United States;\n       2. encouraging regional planning for livable communities \n     and the adoption of sustainable development techniques, \n     including transit-oriented development;\n       3. providing a variety of safe, reliable transportation \n     choices, with special emphasis on public transportation and \n     complete streets, in order to reduce traffic congestion, \n     greenhouse gas emissions, and dependence on foreign oil;\n       4. providing affordable, energy-efficient, and location-\n     efficient housing choices for people of all ages, incomes, \n     races, and ethnicities, and making the combined costs of \n     housing and transportation more affordable to families;\n       5. promoting economic development and competitiveness by \n     connecting the housing and employment locations of workers, \n     reducing traffic congestion, and providing families with \n     access to essential services;\n       6. supporting public health and improving quality of life \n     for the residents of and workers in communities by promoting \n     healthy, walkable neighborhoods, access to green space, and \n     the mobility to pursue greater opportunities,\n       and\n       Whereas, to accomplish these goals, the Livable Communities \n     Act of 2010 would establish the Office of Sustainable Housing \n     and Communities, the Interagency Council on Sustainable \n     Communities, a Comprehensive Planning Grant Program, and a \n     Sustainability Challenge Grant Program; and\n       Whereas, the Planning and Public Works Committee has met, \n     considered and by a vote of four ayes, two nays and one \n     absent, approved this resolution; Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Rockland County hereby \n     requests that the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives pass bills S. 1619 and H.R. 4690--the Livable \n     Communities Act of 2010, and that the President of United \n     States sign such legislation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk to the Legislature be and he is \n     hereby authorized and directed to send a certified copy of \n     this resolution to Hon.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for equity investments in small business \nconcerns; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, we know we need to focus on cutting our \nspending. We know we need to focus on the tax reform effort. I think \neverybody generally agrees on that. Although they may disagree on what \nthe particulars would be, they agree we need to do those two things. \nThe third thing we also must do is to focus on the economy and jobs. \nThis is something that we have seen in this country over the last 2\\1/\n2\\ years, where we have gone through a very harsh, very difficult \nrecession and we have seen an unemployment number that stays stubbornly \nhigh. We have seen a lot of topsy-turvy economic numbers over the last \n2\\1/2\\ years, and I believe the Congress--the House and Senate--and the \nWhite House need to set the table for job creation and economic growth \nin this country, and we need to do it in a very smart way.\n  Today, I am here to talk about the angel investment tax credit bill I \nam introducing. I want to encourage my colleagues to consider reading \nthe bill and becoming cosponsors. I would love to be working on this \nover the next few weeks to get a broad base of support and to get as \nmuch emphasis on this effort as possible right now. It is one of many \njob-creating pieces of legislation I am interested in in this Congress, \nbut I would love to get as many colleagues as possible interested now \nto look at this and see if it is something we could pass sooner, rather \nthan later, around here.\n  The angel investment tax credit is modeled after the new market tax \ncredit, and it would provide a 25-percent Federal income tax credit for \ninvesting in qualified early-stage small businesses. The focus will be \non advanced manufacturing, aerospace, biotechnology, clean energy, and \ntransportation. The bill would provide that up to $2 million per year \nin tax credit-eligible cash equity investments could be made, with a \ntotal of $10 million per small company. The goal would be that for \nevery $1 we put in, there would be $4 of private-sector stimulus.\n  This is the private sector getting back on its feet with a little bit \nof grease provided by the government to get things going in the right \ndirection through the Tax Code. The bill I have written would authorize \n$500 million per year for 5 years for these tax credits. As I said, \nthis proposal is expected to stimulate $2 billion per year in new \ncapital formation.\n  Let me give one quick example of how this can work. All these \ncompanies on this chart here started with an angel investment to get \nover the hump. What happens is someone will have a good idea. They \nthink they can innovate, they think they can produce, they think they \ncan have value in the marketplace, but they can't get the capital in \norder to get established. They can't quite get over the hump. J. B. \nHunt company is now a $5 billion company. It employs 14,500 people and \nhas 400 facilities in 48 States. In 1961, J. B. Hunt had an idea and he \nwent to five poultry company executives with his hat in his hand asking \nfor money. They gave him $25,000 in seed money, and that is what he has \ndone with that company throughout the course of his lifetime.\n  There are lots of examples of folks like that--HP; there is a company \nin Arkansas called NanoMech, BlueInGreen, and other companies we have \nseen do this. But many of these companies are very much household \nnames--Google, Facebook, Amazon, eBay, and Apple. All of these \ncompanies started with angel investment to get them through what they \ncall the valley of death. The valley of death is usually that period \nwhere something has gone from the idea stage to the marketplace. They \nusually need somewhere between $1 million and $4 million to get their \nideas to market.\n  Our bill is designed to bridge that gap and cross that valley of \ndeath so we can see a lot of startup companies come into the \nmarketplace. We are looking for the next J.B. Hunt, we are looking for \nthe next Apple, or the next Amazon. We are trying to find the next HP, \nwhoever is out there who has great ideas who wants to come in and \ninvest. Angel investment led to the creation of 250,000 jobs in 2009 \nand 2009 wasn't a great year, but angel investment led to the creation \nof 250,000 jobs. This represented about 5 percent of all the new jobs \nin the United States, so this can have a measurable impact. This can \nmove the needle in the right direction.\n\n  The time is now for us to work on this. I encourage my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to read the legislation. If they are \ninterested, I would like to visit with them about it. I would love to \nget this bill moving through the system as quickly as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 257. A bill to improve certain programs of the Small Business \nAdministration to better assist small business customers in accessing \nbroadband technology, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to \ndiscuss an issue of great importance to small businesses, the drivers \nof this Nation's economy.\n  In the same way the interstate highway system and the railroads \nrevolutionized transport, connecting main streets across the Nation to \nfacilitate the stream of commerce; broadband technology has forever \nchanged the relationship between small businesses and the customers \nthat they serve. This is especially true for rural small businesses, \nwhich now have direct access to new customers in major cities across \nthe globe through broadband connectivity. Over 95 percent of the \nworld's customers are located outside of our borders, and in the United \nStates alone, an estimated 60 million Americans use the Internet on a \ndaily basis. With the click of a mouse, they now have access to goods \nand services from main streets around the world. With every click, our \nNation's small businesses are growing, and helping to create jobs as \nwell as further innovate within the U.S. economy.\n  Unfortunately, too many of our small businesses are missing out on \nthese opportunities for growth. Due to a combination of factors that \nrange from a lack of computer literacy to the inability to access high \nspeed or broadband Internet services, many entrepreneurs have yet to \ncapitalize on the resources available to them via the Internet. In \nfact, it is estimated that fewer than 24 percent of our Nation's small \nbusinesses routinely use e-commerce applications to sell their products \nonline. As a result, they are missing out on opportunities to expand to \nnew markets or find new customers. We must do more to help our Nation's \nsmall businesses\n\n[[Page S484]]\n\nutilize advanced technologies like broadband so that they can best \ncompete in the global marketplace.\n  As Chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I \nhave made increasing the ability of small businesses to access high-\nspeed broadband Internet a top priority. That is why today, I along \nwith my distinguished colleague on the Small Business Committee, former \nChairman John Kerry, am introducing the Small Business Broadband and \nEmerging Information Technology Enhancement Act of 2011. This critical \npiece of legislation will help to level the playing field for our \nentrepreneurs and small businesses by implementing key findings from \nthe Federal Communications Commission's 2010 National Broadband Plan.\n  More specifically, this legislation calls on the Small Business \nAdministration to take a lead role in helping our small businesses to \naccess broadband and other advanced technologies. To accomplish this, \nthe legislation requires the SBA to make three key improvements to its \ncore programs. First, it calls on the agency to create a Broadband and \nEmerging Information Technology Coordinator to facilitate the \ndevelopment of small business broadband initiatives within the agency, \nand also to act as a liaison with other Federal agencies. Second, the \nlegislation requires SBA resource partners, such as Small Business \nDevelopment Centers, SBDCs, to provide technical assistance related to \nboth accessing and utilizing broadband and emerging information \ntechnology. Finally, the bill will improve the SBA's popular 7(a) and \nmicroloan programs by allowing borrowers to use the proceeds of their \nloans to finance the purchase of broadband services, equipment or other \nemerging technologies. Making these three simple changes will allow \nmore of our small businesses to not only access previously untapped \ncustomers and markets; it will also allow them to become more \ncompetitive with their foreign counterparts, fostering innovation and \njob creation.\n  I have heard from a number of my Committee members and I know how \nimportant this issue is to them, and I am proud to introduce this \nlegislation for the second consecutive Congress. I look forward to \nworking with them in the coming months to get this legislation to the \nPresident's desk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 257\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Broadband and \n     Emerging Information Technology Enhancement Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that, according to a report by the Federal \n     Communications Commission entitled ``Connecting America: The \n     National Broadband Plan'', dated March 2010, the Commission \n     recommends that--\n       (1) ``To fully implement next-generation technology within \n     its operations, the SBA should also appoint a broadband and \n     emerging IT coordinator.

A bill to amend chapter 81 or title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide for reform relating to Federal employees workers compensation; \nto the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise this evening to introduce the \nFederal Employees Compensation Reform Act of 2011. This bill would \npreserve the essential purpose of the Federal Workers' Compensation \nProgram, which is to ensure income for injured Federal and postal \nworkers, while at the same time it would protect the program from fraud \nand abuse.\n  The Federal Employees Compensation Act, which is known as FECA, \nprovides benefits that serve as a safety net for Federal employees and \npostal employees who are injured on the job, providing income until the \nhealing process and rehabilitation allowed them to return to work. \nObviously, we want to support those employees until they can return to \nwork. That is both humane and just.\n  Over the years, however, this program has unintentionally morphed \ninto an alternative retirement program that is far more financially \nlucrative for recipients than the standard Federal retirement system. \nBecause of the way the program is structured, for some individuals, \nFECA has become a gold-plated retirement system, tainted by unfairness, \nperverse incentives, and the potential for abuse and fraud.\n  This program pays monthly benefits to about 49,000 recipients. Those \nare recipients who have suffered a work-related injury and have been \napproved for workers' comp benefits.\n  In the past fiscal year, this program cost $2.78 billion. Of that \namount, nearly $1.1 billion went to Postal Service employees receiving \nthese benefits.\n  This program has become increasingly expensive and requires some \ncommonsense reforms--reforms that many States have already implemented \nin their own workers' comp programs.\n  As it currently operates, FECA includes a perverse financial \nincentive that encourages older employees who otherwise would have \nretired to continue to receive workers' comp benefits.\n  Remember, these payments are designed as a bridge to help injured \nworkers until they are able to return to work. That is the important \nphrase--``return to work.'' This program was never intended to serve as \na higher paying alternative to the Federal retirement system.\n  Federal employees on FECA receive an average of 73 percent of their \ngross pay. Moreover, these workers' comp benefits are tax free--another \nsubstantial benefit.\n  By contrast, a Federal employee, with 30 years of service under the \nCivil Service Retirement System, would average slightly more than 56 \npercent of his or her gross pay as a retirement benefit, and these \nretirement benefits are taxed. It pays then to stay on workers' comp \nfor as long as possible, since many recipients receive more money under \nthat program than they would if they were to retire.\n  Let me again emphasize that these workers' comp payments are tax \nfree--another big difference.\n  In fact, according to the numbers produced by the Department of \nLabor, nearly 30 percent of the current workers' comp recipients are \nage 66 and older, while the average retirement age for both Federal \nemployees and postal workers is age 60.\n  With no mandatory Federal retirement age, FECA recipients are allowed \nto stay on workers' comp rolls for their entire lifetimes, even when \nthere is no expectation that they will return to work because of their \nadvanced age.\n  Some employees have continued to receive Federal workers' comp \nbenefits into their hundreds. For the U.S. Postal Service alone, let's \nlook at the statistics.\n  As we can see, there are more than 15,000 recipients in total. Of \nthose, more than 2,000 recipients are age 70 or older; 927 recipients \nare age 80 or older; 132 recipients are age 90 or older; and \nastonishingly enough, 3 postal employees receiving workers' comp are \nage 98 or older.\n  Mr. President, it is obvious these workers are not going back to \nwork. They clearly should be transitioned to the retirement system. I \nmust ask the obvious question: Is there any likelihood at all these \nrecipients are ever going to return to the workforce? No. Then why \naren't they transitioning to the retirement system when they reach \nretirement age? Think how unfair that is to the worker who does retire, \nsay, at age 65 and gets a lesser amount.\n  Right now, the way the system is structured it does not encourage \npeople to go back to work or to transfer to retirement at an age when \nmost of their fellow workers would have retired. To prevent this \ncontinued abuse, my bill would convert retirement-eligible postal and \nFederal employees on workers' compensation to the retirement system \nwhen they reach age 65.\n  Now, that is generous, Mr. President, because we know the average \nretirement age is actually 60. I would choose age 65. This is a \ncommonsense change that would save millions of dollars that the Postal \nService, the Federal Government, and the American taxpayer cannot \nafford to spend. It is also a matter of fairness, Mr. President. But we \nmust also examine other elements of the FECA program to determine \nwhether there are some additional improvements that are necessary.\n  Unlike many State programs, the Federal workers' compensation program \nhas no cap nor time limits on benefits. Moreover, the Federal \nDepartment of Labor acknowledges a 2- to 3-percent fraud rate in the \nprogram. I suspect it may be even higher. We need to reduce this rate \nof fraud by examining whether the medical certification requirements \nand other internal controls should be strengthened. Are we doing \nmedical reviews to see if these individuals could go back to work?\n  For example, a former postal worker was sentenced just a week or so \nago to 5 months in jail after pleading guilty to workers' compensation \nfraud. The employee claimed he was unable to walk from his parked car \nto the post\n\n[[Page S486]]\n\noffice. But at the same time he was receiving tax-free workers' \ncompensation benefits, he was also operating a snow removal and lawn \ncare business.\n  In addition, about 100 other claimants per year are prosecuted by the \nDepartment of Labor's Office of Inspector General because they received \nworkers' compensation and their retirement pay. These are the so-called \n``double-dippers.''\n  Mr. President, as part of my effort to strengthen oversight of this \nprogram, I have asked the Government Accountability Office, along with \nSenator Coburn and Senator McCaskill, to audit the FECA program and \nreport on the length of time individuals remain on the program, the \nnumber of recipients who exceed the standard Federal retirement age, \nand how the Federal program compares to State workers' compensation \nbest practices. I expect these findings will lead to additional reform \nproposals as the bill proceeds through the Senate.\n  I also intend to work with stakeholders to determine if changes in \nthe Federal Employees Retirement System, the FERS system, as opposed to \nthe old Civil Service Retirement System are necessary to make sure that \nworkers' compensation recipients would be treated fairly when they are \nconverted to FERS retirement benefits under this bill.\n  For example, this may require the Department of Labor to administer \nthe Thrift Savings Plan contributions for recipients or to require \nSocial Security contributions from workers' compensation recipients.\n  What is clear, however, is that this program is in need of urgent \nreform. The program is costing too much, injured workers are not being \nmonitored sufficiently and helped to return to productive work, \nrecipients who should be in the retirement system are instead receiving \ntax-free benefits, and some agencies have high claim rates, suggesting \nthat safety improvements are needed.\n  For the sake of fairness and fiscal responsibility, we must reform \nthis program now. Not doing so is an affront to the thousands of \nFederal employees who enter the retirement system. It is a disservice \nto those Federal and postal employees who truly need workers' \ncompensation benefits, and it is an unnecessary burden on taxpayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/02/senate-section/article/S486-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 36--RAISING AWARENESS AND ENCOURAGING PREVENTION OF \n STALKING BY DESIGNATING JANUARY 2011 AS ``NATIONAL STALKING AWARENESS \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Chambliss, \nMr. Kohl, and Mr. Isakson) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Community is central to \n     education ministry, both as a necessary condition and an \n     ardently desired goal. The educational efforts of the Church, \n     therefore, must be directed to forming persons-in-community; \n     for the education of the individual Christian is important \n     not only to his solitary destiny, but also the destinies of \n     the many communities in which he lives.'': Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the goals of Catholic Schools Week, an event \n     cosponsored by the National Catholic Educational Association \n     and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops that \n     recognizes the vital contributions of thousands of Catholic \n     elementary and secondary schools in the United States; and\n       (2) commends Catholic schools, students, parents, and \n     teachers across the United States for their ongoing \n     contributions to education, and for the vital role they play \n     in promoting and ensuring a brighter, stronger future for the \n     United States.\n\n                               S.
