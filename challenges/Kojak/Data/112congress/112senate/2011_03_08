Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to \ndiscuss an issue that is critically facing the American people: It is \nthe price of gasoline at the pump. It is something that, in my opinion, \nwill impact our economy, impact the economic recovery we are all hoping \nwill continue in this country. But with every penny the cost of \ngasoline goes up, it has been estimated it takes about a billion \ndollars away from the amount of money that can be spent on other things \nin this country and to growing the economy.\n  We are at a point where the American people, who have to balance \ntheir budgets every year--and States have to do it, of course. \nWashington doesn't do that, but the American people do. They have to \nfocus on their pocketbooks. When they are going to fill up with gas at \nthe pump and are noticing that they are approaching a point where it is \ngoing to be $100 to get a fill-up, they worry about the impact on the \nquality of their life, their ability to put food on the table for their \nchildren, and clothing on their children, and even have the money to \nget back and forth to work--those fortunate enough to have jobs.\n  One can say: Well, is it really a problem? I believe it is. I filled \nup yesterday morning in Casper. A young man in front of me at the \nfilling station was filling up his pickup truck. He was watching the \nnumbers go up and up. I filled up a week ago in Wyoming as well. We use \na lot of gasoline in Wyoming. We travel long distances. I was filling \nup in the evening. I put my credit card in, and it stopped at $75 \nbecause apparently they have to reset these pumps. One would think that \nwith $75 one would have enough money to fill up. But not as these gas \nprices continue to rise.\n  My concern is that so much of this money is being sent overseas to \npeople who are trying to blow us up. We have an opportunity to be much \nmore secure in our energy resources by developing our energy resources \nat home. It just seems that this administration's policies are making \nit that much harder.\n  One may say: How high can gasoline prices go? With the unrest in the \nMiddle East, a front-page story a few days ago in USA TODAY said: ``If \nunrest spreads, gas may hit $5 a gallon''--$5 a gallon by summer.\n  We need to do some things in this country that this administration \nhas continued to block. We need to find more of our own energy, be \nreliant more on ourselves and less on foreign sources of energy. That \nmeans doing three things: exploring offshore, exploring on Federal \nland, and exploring in Alaska. We know there are huge reserves of oil, \nof energy in those locations. Yet day by day those efforts are\n\n[[Page S1336]]\n\nbeing blocked. The impact on our overall economy is huge, and it is \nbecause of policies of this administration.\n  USA TODAY this morning: ``Will gas prices stall U.S. upturn? \nConsumers could cut spending again.''\n  It is not in the best interest of this country for us to have energy \npolicies that make it more expensive for Americans to gas up their \ncars. It does not help the economy of this country when the policies of \nthis administration do things that make it more expensive and harder \nfor small businesses to create jobs and hire people. We are trying to \nget people hired, back to work.\n  That is what we need to focus on--jobs and the economy. When the \nadministration's policies cut into our ability to use energy sources \nfrom within this country--red, white, and blue energy jobs; red, white, \nand blue energy as well--and just send more money overseas, that does \nnot help us as a nation, it does not help our economy, and it does not \nhelp strengthen our communities. We are so blessed in this country with \nwonderful families, wonderful communities, and wonderful land. Yet we \ndo not seem to be making wise decisions on a daily basis with the \npolicies coming out of this administration.\n  It is interesting to see who is actually benefiting from these \nincreased costs because we know American families are not benefiting, \nwe know American taxpayers are not benefiting, and we know people \ntrying to get their kids off to school are not benefiting. Who is \nbenefiting from this huge increase in the cost of energy and the cost \nof oil? All we need to do is go to the front page of the business \nsection of today's New York Times: ``Fears About Mideast Oil Pay Off \nfor Russia.'' For Russia, Mr. President. ``Whatever the eventual \noutcome of the Arab world's social upheaval, there is a clear economic \nwinner so far: Vladimir V. Putin.'' Right there, that is the winner. \nThe economic policies of this administration to limit our ability and \ncurtail our ability to use American energy, American oil, to keep down \nthe cost of gasoline, are benefiting Russia.\n  It says:\n\n       Russia, which pumps more oil than Saudi Arabia, is reaping \n     a windfall from the steep rise in global energy prices \n     resulting from instability in oil regions of the Middle East \n     and North Africa . . . Russia does not have any oil wells \n     standing idle . . . Right now Russia is pumping oil at its \n     top capacity.\n\n  In a country where we and this Congress in particular choose winners \nand losers in energy, the winner seems to be Russia because of the \npolicies of this administration.\n  The Hill newspaper this morning said: ``Pump pain for Obama.'' This \nclearly lies specifically at the feet of the President because of the \npolicies of this administration.\n  We have had a situation in the Gulf of Mexico where there has been a \nmoratorium, which is extended almost permanently, shutting down the use \nof oil reserves for the United States. The administration--so happy, \nand pronounced the moratorium--has not until this week allowed for an \nadditional permit and finally one when the price of gasoline went up at \nthe pump 38 cents on average, about $3.50 per gallon.\n  The Department of Interior, last October in the Federal Register, had \na solution. They had some ideas about this because the Department of \nthe Interior admitted--the President's own Secretary and his Department \nof Interior admitted that what they were doing in the Gulf of Mexico \nwould have an impact.\n  It says:\n\n       The impact on the domestic deepwater hydrocarbon production \n     as a result of these regulations is expected to be negative.\n\n  What it means is that it is going to cut down on American sources of \nenergy. We need energy security. We as a nation need to do it in an \nenvironmentally responsible way, and we need to focus on economic \ngrowth. This administration does not seem to be willing to make that \ndistinction about energy security and economic growth and the needs we \nhave to help make our economy stronger.\n  What is the administration's position? What, as of October of last \nyear, was their position on all of this to say: OK, we know we are \ngoing to have impacts in the gulf. They didn't say: Oh, I know, we can \ngo onshore and look on Federal land. They didn't say: Let's go to \nAlaska to explore. This is this administration's position. They said:\n\n       Currently, there is sufficient spare capacity in OPEC--\n\n  In OPEC, in the Middle East--\n\n     to offset a decrease in Gulf of Mexico deepwater production \n     that could occur as a result of this rule.\n\n  The rule that they are going to shut down the gulf.\n\n       Therefore, the increase in the price of hydrocarbon \n     products to consumers from the increased cost to drill and \n     operate on the Outer Continental Shelf is expected to be \n     minimal.\n\n  That is the administration's solution. They do not expect anything to \nhappen. They are not worried about it. And if there is a problem, just \nbuy more oil from OPEC, send more American dollars overseas. That is \nthe administration's position? And what about the impact on our \neconomy?\n  We do have a Secretary of Energy. One would think he would be \nconcerned about the cost of energy and the impact on American families. \nNot so when we look at some of the statements he has made. In the past, \nhe said:\n\n       Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline to the levels of Europe.\n\n  That is the proposal of the Secretary of Energy--figure out how to \nboost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe. How much does \ngasoline cost in Europe? Almost $8 a gallon.\n  The President, when he was a Senator and running for President, did \nnot seem to think high energy prices were a problem. He just wanted the \nprice to go up gradually. He said the problem is when things go up too \nquickly.\n  The American people who try to put bread on the table for their kids, \nclothing on their backs, get them off to school, and then go to work \nthemselves, notice this. They know every time the cost of a gallon of \ngasoline goes up by a penny or a nickel or 38 cents, as it has most \nrecently, the economy will suffer as a result. It is specifically a \nresult of the policies of this administration, the policies that ignore \nthe need for American energy.\n  At a time when we need to be focused on jobs, that we need to realize \nthe amount of uncertainty in the Middle East, there is now sticker \nshock at the pumps, and it is the policies of this administration that \nare keeping us from developing the energy security we need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1336-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1336-S1338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a few minutes \nabout our current fiscal situation.\n  Over the next few weeks, we are undoubtedly going to have a very \nrobust debate on our country's future and the tremendous issues we \nface. We are going to have a debate about the need for fiscal \nresponsibility. One thing all of my colleagues should be able to agree \non is that our current level of spending and borrowing and debt is just \nsimply not sustainable. When you are bringing in $2.2 trillion but you \nare spending $3.8 trillion annually, something is seriously wrong. \nAdding $1.65 trillion to the national debt each and every year is not \nthe answer. We simply cannot afford to continue in this direction.\n  For too long, the answer of Washington was: We will be all things to \nall people--promising everything with really no plan to pay for it. The \nresult now is that we face a financial crisis unlike anything our \nNation has ever seen. While Americans are making very tough, painful \ndecisions in their daily lives, their government still refuses to make \nthe same difficult choices.\n  I come from a State where its citizens really do believe that less \ngovernment is better government. But even if my colleagues disagree \nthat less government is better, we would be hard-pressed to find anyone \nwho can argue with the numbers. Numbers do not lie, and they cannot be \nspun.\n  Let's take a look at the numbers, grim by any economist's viewpoint. \nWe are currently borrowing 42 cents on every dollar. For every dollar \nspent today, every dollar spent this year by the Federal Government, 42 \ncents is borrowed. Can you imagine an average family charging nearly \nhalf of all of their spending to a credit card? It\n\n[[Page S1337]]\n\nwould not take long for that family to face bankruptcy.\n  What is happening with our Nation is we are absolutely losing control \nof our destiny. I heard the Senator from Wyoming talk about the oil \nissues and the fact that we are shipping our resources out of this \nNation. That is absolutely true. But what is also happening is that for \nevery dollar borrowed, we have to find a banker. Looking at this chart, \nwho are our bankers out there? China, Japan, other foreign holders, oil \nexporters, the UK. And we begin to understand the point. Billions of \ndollars annually are being borrowed from foreigners who have really no \nhome interest in our Nation.\n  The interest payments on our debt will increase to almost $1 trillion \nby 2020--an increase of 370 percent since 2009. Again, just look at the \nchart. The numbers do not lie--a nearly 380 percent increase by 2020. \nThe American people are absolutely appalled at trillion-dollar annual \ndeficits. Just imagine, therefore, trillion-dollar annual interest \npayments. And what if current interest rates go up, which many project \nthey will? Each 1 percent increase in interest rates equals--get this--\n$140 billion in additional debt. Our interest payments alone will \neventually bankrupt our country before we even begin to think about \nproviding services to our citizens, and everything will suffer. If you \nlike education, guess what. It will suffer. If you want to build more \nroads and bridges, guess what. It will suffer. Our society will suffer. \nProbably most important, for those of us in the Senate, the legacy we \nleave behind for our children and grandchildren of a diminished \nstandard of living because we could not get our spending under control \nis absolutely a horrific legacy. Our country's national debt totals \nnearly 70 percent of our entire gross domestic product. Looking down \nthe road, within 10 years our publicly held debt will be at the 90-\npercent threshold.\n\n  While the American public looks on at this Enron accounting with \nutter amazement, they can't imagine 90 percent of their paychecks going \nto pay off debt. Yet their government continues to recklessly add to \nthe debt year after year after year, trillion-dollar deficits, \ntrillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see.\n  Well, this is just enormous. It is a record-setting annual deficit. \nThe alarm bells are sounding, the red lights are flashing, and the \nflags are waving. We have to stop it.\n  While this discussion would not likely even acknowledge the \nentitlement iceberg headed our way, we have to come to grips with the \nreality that we can't finance what we have promised. Yet some object to \n$61 billion in spending reductions. In the grand scheme of what we are \ndealing with, that is hard to imagine. How can we possibly attack a \nmassive debt if we can't even come to agreement on $61 billion out of a \n$3.5 trillion annual budget?\n  Now, I acknowledge $61 billion is significant. I acknowledge many of \nthese programs are programs I like. But if we don't come to grips with \nthis, those programs will not exist. Yet many are saying: Well, let's \ndo a little nip and a tuck. Let's maybe get $4 billion out of this. \nThat is only fourteen onehundredths of 1 percent in reductions. Does \nanyone really think that is a serious effort? Nobody is buying that. \nThe media is not buying it, and the American people aren't buying it. I \njust did nine townhall meetings all across my State, and they are not \nbuying it back home. It is time to roll up our sleeves. It is time to \nsay: Look, we can't go on doing this.\n  It is my intention to be on the floor of the Senate on these issues a \nlot in the weeks and months ahead. I believe we are at a tipping point. \nIf we don't turn this around, we may lose the ability to control our \nown destiny.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I understand I have up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Nebraska has suggested the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, if the Chair will let me know when I get \nwithin 1\\1/2\\ minutes of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I rise today to speak also on the matter \nof our country's unlimited spending, the fact that this last month, \nFebruary--I don't know if many people know this; it was just \npublished--we had the largest budget deficit for 1 month in recorded \nhistory of $223 billion. Those numbers were just released.\n  I know we have some measures we are going to vote on this week \nregarding reductions in spending. I realize the Republican version \nlikely will not pass and the Democratic version likely will not pass. \nHopefully, we will then sit down and work out something to allow \ngovernment to be open with, hopefully, a long-term CR. I know we are \nhaving a lot of difficulties in our departments as they try to manage \ntheir budgets not knowing what we are going to do.\n  As the Senator from Nebraska mentioned, $61 billion is a drop in the \nbucket as it relates to trying to solve our country's problems. That is \nwhy I have brought forth something called the CAP Act. I have tried to \ndo it and I have done it in a bipartisan way. There are numbers of \npeople in this body who have supported the CAP Act. I think the Chair, \na former Governor, and other people here--and Tennessee families who \nhave to live within a budget--realize that around here we have \nabsolutely no construct. We do not know where we are going in the \nfuture. We never have a plan.\n  What we do is what we are doing this week: we fight and debate over \nissues that take us almost nowhere. Yet we do not have a long-term plan \nas it relates to spending. I think everybody in this body knows when we \nhave $3.7 trillion in spending this year, and we have $2.2 trillion in \nincome, trying to solve this problem by only dealing with discretionary \nspending makes no sense. If we did away with all discretionary spending \nduring this year--all discretionary spending including defense--we \nstill would not have a balanced budget. All of us know it is the \nmandatory programs that have to be added into this. What we need to do \nis create a comprehensive budget, a straitjacket for Congress.\n  I, along with others, have offered something called the CAP Act. It \ntakes us from where we are today over a 10-year glidepath to the \nhistorical average of spending in this country relative to our \ncountry's output. That is about 20.6 percent of our country's economic \noutput. I have tried to not message. This is not a messaging bill. It \nis a bill that I truly hope to pass. I have been meeting with numbers \nof my Republican colleagues and Democratic colleagues. I have numbers \nof meetings set up over the course of the next several weeks to try to \nbuild consensus.\n  Here is the way it would work. We would pass it as a statutory bill. \nWhat it would do is take us from where we are today--and that is a \nlittle over 24.5 percent of spending relative to our country's output, \nwhich is way out of line. By the way, I am not here to cast blame. I \nthink both parties can recognize some of the contributions they have \nmade to getting us where we are as a country. But the fact is, we know \nwe cannot continue on today's path. We know that. We have to not just \nlook at discretionary spending.\n  I have heard so many of my colleagues talk on the Senate floor about \ntrying to solve this entire problem with only a very small percentage \nof the budget. That makes no sense. Everybody understands that. I know \neveryone here wants to ensure that the entitlement programs seniors \nbenefit from are here for the long term. We want other seniors to \nbenefit from them. Yet we know the way these programs are set up, they \nare not sustainable. There is not a person here, I don't think--there \nmay be a few, but I think most of it would be rhetoric, though I don't \nwant to cast judgment--who doesn't know these programs cannot continue \nas they are.\n  So this bill would require us to start today, working ourselves down \nto 20.6 percent of our GDP. Again, that has been the historical average \nfor 40 years. This isn't something to try to overreach. For what it is \nworth, what that would mean to our country is that over the course of \nthe next 10 years--as opposed to the course we are on now,\n\n[[Page S1338]]\n\nthe alternative CBO scenario and what they deem most likely to occur \nwithout our action--we would spend $7.63 trillion less than we are now \nspending. This is how it would work. There is a formula in here.\n  This is a 10-page bill. There are not a lot of ``whereases'' in this \nbill. It is just a business document, something the former Governor \nfrom New Hampshire might be accustomed to looking at. It is a business \ndocument that puts in place statutory limits that are formula driven to \ntake us from here to there.\n  If we don't meet those requirements, then after 45 days--and there \nare targets each year of spending relative to our economy. By the way, \nthis joins everybody at the hip in wanting our economy to grow because \nif our economy grows rapidly, those targets are much easier to hit. But \nif Congress doesn't act, if we don't have the courage to act, then \nthere would be automatic sequestration on a pro rata basis, depending \non the enumerator, what the size of that particular budget \nappropriation is relative to the overall budget. So on a pro rata \nbasis, we would have sequestration that would take out those monies.\n\n  Now, none of us wants to see that happen, so that would force us to \nactually do what any Congress acting responsibly needs to do; that is, \nto actually work together each year to meet those requirements.\n  I have heard so many people recently, especially on the other side of \nthe aisle, talking about focusing on discretionary spending only, \nbasically cutting out some of those things that might make our country \nstronger. There are some things certainly in all of these bills, as the \nSenator from Nebraska was mentioning, where I might have differing \npriorities. But the fact is, when we try to do it all only on \ndiscretionary spending, we are not only not solving the problem but it \nprevents us from actually looking at some aspects that might otherwise \nmake our economy grow.\n  Again, this bill, the CAP Act--with Claire McCaskill signed on as an \noriginal cosponsor with me, and others are looking at it--would cause \nus to look at everything. So, again, first, a comprehensive look at \nspending relative to our economy at historical levels. Everything is on \nthe table and on budget. Sequestration would be in place, and it would \ntake a two-thirds vote of Congress to override these spending limits.\n  Again, I did not come here to message. I didn't come to move the bar \nbeyond what the other side might be doing just to make a name for \nmyself or create publicity. I came to solve our country's problems. I \nlook at these young people in front of me, and I don't think they have \nany idea what our irresponsibility is doing to them. We talk about \nfuture generations, but I think all of us know we are actually at a \npoint now where we have been so irresponsible that this is not just \ngoing to affect future generations, it is getting ready to affect us.\n  There is a lot of turmoil in this world today. For that reason, the \nUnited States has been perceived as a safe haven. Our interest rates \ncontinue to be low because of the rest of the world's turmoil. The fact \nis, if and when--and we hope that when is soon--everything settles \ndown, as people begin to again look closely at where we are as a \ncountry, and if we continue to not act responsibly and show the world \nwe have the ability to at least put in place this framework that causes \nus to work together and get to the place we all know we need to get, \nthen I fear interest rates, over time, are going to run from us, and \nthat interest relative to our debt payments is going to continually \nconsume more.\n  In closing, Madam President--and I appreciate the time--I have gone \naround the State of Tennessee and conducted 43 townhall meetings \ntalking about this type of approach. I know numbers of Members on the \nother side of the aisle have talked about what they believe is an \nappropriate level of spending relative to our country's economy. I \nbelieve this bill is not out of line. I know this bill is at least \nappropriate. There are a number of people who think it should be lower, \nbut this is something that would cause us to first agree on where we \nare going.\n  It is difficult for a body such as this, with 100 Senators and 435 \nHouse Members on the other side, to agree on little matters when we \ndon't have any idea where it is we are trying to go. This would create \na target for us. It would create a straitjacket for Congress. It would \ncause us to prioritize.\n  So I am going to continue talking about this until, hopefully, we \npass it and actually have a process that causes us to work together in \na constructive way.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1338-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1338-S1339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GASOLINE PRICES\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to focus on another grave threat \nto our economic recovery and jobs: skyrocketing energy prices, and \nparticularly the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  Madam President, I don't have to point out to Americans all over the \ncountry, and Louisianans all over my State, because they see it in \nfront of them every time they go get a new tank of gas, the ever-\nincreasing energy prices, the ever-increasing prices at the pump. Right \nnow, on average, nationwide, the price at the pump is $3.51 a \ngallon. That is about 80 cents higher than the average price a year \nago. Most Americans know it is not stopping there. They see $4 gasoline \ncoming sooner rather than later, and who knows how far it will go \nbeyond $4 at the pump?\n\n  This is a real threat. We are trying to come out of the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression and this is an immediate threat to \nput the brakes on any recovery we may be mounting, and it is surely a \nreal threat and a real hit to Louisiana and American families. It is a \ndirect hit to their pocketbooks.\n  Louisianans, like all Americans, hear talking heads on TV, national \neconomists, saying we don't have any real inflation. Listen, they are \nhit every time they go to the pump. They know there is inflation in key \nprices such as gasoline, and that is a big hit to their family budget.\n  This has sparked somewhat of a breakthrough in thinking among the \nranks of the Obama administration. Let me explain what I mean by that. \nRecently President Obama's Energy Secretary, Secretary Chu, focused on \nsupply and he said we need to increase supply to temper prices and \nmitigate the increasing price at the pump. He said we need to do this \nby convincing the Saudi Arabians to increase their supply of oil on the \nworld market: ``That's going to mitigate the price increase.'' He said \nfurther, ``We're hoping market forces will take care of this.'' I at \nleast give Secretary Chu and the Obama administration marks for this \nbreakthrough understanding that supply is a big part of the equation. \nIn fact, it is half of the supply and demand equation that yields \nprice.\n  Recently the White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley made a comment \nthat also went to supply. He said this weekend, on some of the weekend \ntalk shows, that we need to consider opening the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve to put more product on the market, to increase supply--also to \ntemper prices, to stop these ever-increasing prices. Again, I at least \ngive Mr. Daley and the Obama administration credit for finally \nrealizing, and it is a bit of a breakthrough, that supply is a big part \nof the issue.\n  Where I disagree, where I want a further breakthrough, is that they \nneed to focus on domestic supply we can create and that we can control \nin America. Unfortunately, they are not doing that yet.\n  I have come to the floor many times to talk about the virtual \nshutdown of the Gulf of Mexico to energy production since the BP \ndisaster. I will mention that again because that is at the heart of \nthis issue. The administration understands we need to increase supply. \nWhat about domestic supply? What about the Gulf of Mexico? What about \nall of our other vast energy resources that we are taking off the table \nand shutting down? What about that supply? That is the first place we \nshould turn, that is the first action we should take. That is what can \nhelp us control our own destiny.\n  Instead, there has been a virtual shutdown of the Gulf of Mexico to \nenergy production. That has reduced direct and indirect employment in \nthe oil and gas and service industries. It threatens 93,000 jobs for \nevery year until 2035 unless we reverse it. It could\n\n[[Page S1339]]\n\nreduce an additional 82,000 jobs every year through 2035 in non-oil and \ngas-related industries that are still impacted indirectly by this \nshutdown.\n  It reduces annual GDP by over $20 billion a year, a cumulative impact \nof $500 billion in the next 25 years, unless we immediately reverse \ncourse. It reduces long-term U.S. oil production by 27 percent. Long-\nterm U.S. foreign oil imports are increased by 19 percent. Groppe, Long \n& Littell estimates--that is a consulting firm--show that over 23 wells \nper month are needed to maintain current production levels in the \nshallow water of the Gulf of Mexico. Since the moratorium was lifted on \nshallow water drilling, the formal moratorium, the administration has \nonly approved permits for new wells at a pace of 1.8 per month--so 23 \nversus 1.8.\n  In deep water it is even worse. There has been one deepwater \nexploratory permit issued since the BP disaster and only one, in 9 \nmonths. As a result, six deepwater rigs have departed the gulf: \nDiscovery America's Transocean has been moved to the Black Sea/\nMediterranean. Ocean Baroness of Diamond Offshore, a semisubmersible \nrig, has been moved to Brazil. Ocean Confidence, also with Diamond, has \nbeen moved to West Africa. Ocean Endeavor, also with Diamond, has moved \nto the Black Sea area. Stena Drilling has moved major equipment to \nEastern Canada. Transocean has moved some of their equipment to West \nAfrica. According to ODS, another five major rigs are scheduled to \nleave the U.S. Gulf of Mexico by April 1. So that will put that 6 \nnumber up to 11. New well drilling has fallen from 20 in the first \nquarter of 2009 to 1 in the first quarter of 2010.\n  Again, I applaud the administration's realization that supply is a \nbig part of the issue; that we need to increase supply in order to stop \nthese skyrocketing prices which are hurting Louisianans and Americans \nevery day. But let's focus on domestic supply. Let's focus on the Gulf \nof Mexico. Let's focus on things we can directly control--not just \nbegging the Saudi Arabians to increase their production. I want to \ncreate jobs here, not just in Saudi Arabia. I want our children to be \nindependent, to control their own future, not to have to beg some Saudi \nArabian prince.\n  With regard to Mr. Daley's suggestion of opening the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, you know the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is just \nthat. It is supposed to be strategic--for crises, for our security, our \nnational security as a country. It is not the Salazar petroleum reserve \nto open, to cover up the complete ineptitude and foot dragging at the \nInterior Department in terms of issuing permits for our own drilling. \nSo let's not play politics with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, let's \nnot treat it as the Salazar petroleum reserve, to cover up the mistakes \nand ineptitude and foot dragging of the Interior Department.\n  Let's increase domestic production, let's address the supply side of \nthe equation that way, aggressively, and create American jobs in the \nprocess. Louisianans are depending on that. Americans are depending on \nthat--for jobs and to mitigate prices at the pump so we do not have \nthese ever-increasing prices that could kill a recovery that we are \nhoping to mount and that could hurt every American's pocketbook, every \nAmerican family's budget.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to come \ntogether on this point and urge the administration to act. Yes, they \nare right, supply is key. Let's start with domestic action, domestic \nsupply, and mitigate price increases that way.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1339-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, first let me commend my friend and \ncolleague from Louisiana on his observations about the need to increase \ndomestic production. I think he certainly agrees with me we will be \ntalking about this a lot more in the coming months as the price of gas \nat the pump continues to rise, and I thank him for his insight.\n  Sometime this week, Senators will have an opportunity to take a \nposition on government spending on two bills the majority leader has \npredicted will fail. One is a serious effort to rein in wasteful \nWashington spending that has gotten completely and totally out of \ncontrol. The other, by our Democratic friends, is a proposal so \nunserious that even its supporters have been forced to exaggerate its \nimpacts--something they have been called out on by the press \nrepeatedly. That proposal comes on the heels of an equally unserious \nproposal by the White House last week to cut $6 billion from Federal \nspending for the entire year at a time when Washington is averaging \nabout $4 billion in deficit spending every day. Let me say that again. \nWe are running a $4 billion deficit every single day this year. \nApparently Democratic leaders in Congress thought even that was too \nmuch to cut, because the bill they are proposing this week shaves it \ndown to only about $4.7 billion. So you had the administration last \nweek saying they would go along with $6.5 billion, and the proposal the \nDemocrats in the Senate are going to lay before the Senate this week \nonly reduces spending $4.7 billion. That is about what we are engaged \nin spending, deficit spending, every single day. We are averaging about \n$4 billion a day in debt this year and Democrats want to cut $4.7 \nbillion and call it a day. That is their idea of getting serious.\n  Washington will add more to the debt this week than they want to cut \nfor the entire year, and that is the farthest their leaders say they \nare willing to go. Anything more, they say, is Draconian. I will tell \nyou what is Draconian. Draconian is what will happen if Democrats don't \nget real about our Nation's fiscal crisis.\n  Yesterday, the independent Congressional Budget Office issued a \nreport that gave us a pretty good sense of the recklessness of \nWashington spending these days. Last month alone, the Federal \nGovernment spent $223 billion more than it had--last month alone--the \nhighest monthly deficit ever and the 29th straight month Washington has \nbeen in the red.\n  Here is the Democrats' proposal: Let's cut $4.7 billion and call it a \nday; $4.7 billion, even less than the President called for last week. \nEven that was ridiculed because of the preposterous claim that it met \nus halfway. It is time our friends on the other side stop trying to see \nwhat they can get away with and actually summon the courage to get our \nfiscal house in order, because here is the hard truth: Even the biggest \ncuts under discussion this week are puny compared to the fiscal \nproblems we face in the area of entitlements. It is a pitched battle \naround here over $4.7 billion when we have a $14 trillion debt and more \nthan $50 trillion in entitlement promises that Washington cannot keep.\n  If Democrats cannot bring themselves to cut $4.6 billion, how are we \ngoing to get a handle on the big stuff? This is just a dress rehearsal. \nDemocrats are going to have to do a lot better than this if we stand a \nchance of getting our Nation's fiscal house in order.\n  Frankly, it is embarrassing. The American people deserve better. It \nis time for Democrats in Washington to face facts and, as I said \nyesterday, it is time for the President to get off the sidelines and \nlead because, with each passing day, it becomes clear that Democrats in \nCongress cannot bring themselves on their own to get serious about the \nproblems we face. They don't even want to admit these problems exist.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I wanted to know, from a parliamentary \nstandpoint, what time remains on the Republican side and when the \nDemocrats' time begins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nRepublican side.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is my understanding the Republicans \nhave finished their time.

Madam President, I listened very carefully to my \nRepublican colleagues who have come to the floor blaming the Democrats \nand the President for everything you can imagine, including the high \nprice of gasoline and deficits as far as the eye can see.\n  I wish to say to Senator Manchin, I am going to make some very brief \nremarks about H.R. 1 and then yield to you for 5 minutes.\n  I respect the right of any colleague to say whatever he or she wants \non the floor. But I also wish to tell the American people who may be \nfollowing this debate, that in truth, in the last many years, 40 years, \nthe only party to balance the budget was the Democrats. Bill Clinton, \nin his Presidency, not only took a deficit brought about by Republican \nPresidents, not only did he balance the budget with us, but we created \nsurpluses. Guess what. Twenty-three million jobs.\n  Compare that to George W. Bush. He created huge deficits, handed \nPresident Obama a tremendous debt and deficits--I will get the exact \nnumbers--and created 1 million jobs, compared to 23 million jobs.\n  I appreciate the lectures from my Republican friends, but look at any \nmeasure: job creation, budget balancing, stock market. Check it out, \nAmerica. These are facts that are in the history books. So please do \nnot lecture us about how to balance the budget. We know how to do it. \nThe way you do it is cut waste, cut fraud, cut abuse, make sure \neverything you spend is essentially justifiable by the results, by the \nbenefits, and invest in our people so if they lose a job, we invest in \nworker training, invest in our people, invest in science and \ntechnology, invest in health research, invest in our children.\n  If you follow that method, we will not only balance the budget, we \nwill create jobs. We know their approach, H.R. 1, which they support, \nwould devastate this economy, barely doing anything about the deficit. \nMost amazingly, they do not think billionaires should pay even a little \nbit higher tax rate than people who are earning $150,000--billionaires, \nmultimillionaires. It does not make any sense.\n  So with that as an opening, I am very pleased to yield to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Mr. Manchin, for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1340-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1340-S1348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I rise today to express my deep \nconcerns with the two widely divergent proposals for a continuing \nresolution that will be presented to us here today.\n  Now, I may be just a freshman Senator, but I will be blunt--this \nwhole process does not make a lot of sense to me, and, I am afraid it \ndoesn't make sense to a lot of West Virginians or most Americans.\n  We will likely have votes on two proposals today, and both options \nare partisan and unrealistic. And neither one will pass.\n  The first is a Democratic proposal that does not go far enough. This \nproposal, which calls for $6.5 billion in new cuts, utterly ignores our \nfiscal reality. Our Nation is badly in debt and spending at absolutely \nunsustainable and out-of-control levels. In February alone, the Federal \nGovernment outspent revenues by an unacceptable $223 billion. We must \nturn our financial ship around, but the Senate proposal continues to \nsail forward as if there is no storm on the horizon.\n  On the other hand, we could choose a second even more flawed measure: \na House GOP proposal that blindly hacks the budget with no sense of our \npriorities or of our values as a country. I did not grow up in an \nAmerica that would carelessly cut Hear Start and make the playing field \neven harder for kids born into poverty. Our America should not cut \nfunding for veterans or for border security or for first responders or \nespecially for our children without at least discussing the \nalternatives.\n  The bottom line, however, is this: Democrats and Republicans are \nbeing asked to vote on wildly different proposals for reining in \nspending. Republicans will say Democrats do not go far enough. \nDemocrats will say Republicans go too far. The truth is both are right, \nand both proposals will fail. Worse still, everyone in Congress knows \nthey will fail.\n  The more important question is this, Why are we engaging in this \npolitical theater?\n  Why are we voting on partisan proposals that we know will fail, that \nwe all know do not balance our Nation's priorities with the need to get \nour fiscal house in order?\n  Why are we doing all this when the most powerful person in these \nnegotiations, our President, has failed to lead this debate or offer a \nserious proposal for spending and cuts that he would be willing to \nfight for?\n  How does that make sense?\n  The truth is that this debate, as important as it is, will not be \ndecided by House Republicans and Senate Democrats negotiating with each \nother or past each other. This debate will be decided when the \nPresident leads these tough negotiations.\n  And right now that is not happening.\n  I know it is not easy. I know that it takes compromise. I know it \nwill be partisan and difficult. I know that everyone will have to give \nup something and no one will want to relinquish anything. But that is \nwhat the American people are demanding.\n  Respectfully, I am asking President Obama to take this challenge head \non, bring people together and propose a compromise plan for dealing \nwith our Nation's fiscal challenges, both now and for the future.\n  For me, when I was Governor of the great State of West Virginia, \ndealing with our State's problems required bringing together a diverse \nand strong-willed group of legislators. But I did, because that was my \nresponsibility. By working together, we were able to tackle the tough \nfiscal problems that our State faced and we did it while setting our \npriorities and protecting the most vulnerable in our State.\n  The bottom line is the President is the leader of this great Nation, \nand when it comes to an issue of significant national importance, the \nPresident must lead--not the majority leader or Speaker but the \nPresident.\n  He must sit down with leaders of both parties and help hammer out a \nreal bipartisan compromise that moves our Nation forward and \nestablishes the priorities that represent our values and all hard-\nworking families.\n  And I truly believe that he can do it. And when we finally do come \ntogether and agree to a bipartisan solution, we will not only set a new \ntone for our Nation but we can start to focus on what the American \npeople sent all of us here to do: start working together to create a \nmore prosperous future for our children and our families, and be the \nAmerica we all know we can be.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am going to use leader time. I am \nwondering how long Senator Boxer is going to take.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have a number of people coming for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will use leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, since the moment Republican \nRepresentatives passed their budget, the now infamous H.R. 1--it was \ntheir No. 1 issue in the House of Representatives--the country has been \nwaiting to see whether the Senate would repeat the House's mistake in \npassing it. The House has passed it.\n  The plan the tea party pushed through the House is an irresponsible \nplan. It is a reckless plan. It is dangerous for the health of our \neconomy and certainly the citizens of our great country.\n  In the last few days, I have come to the floor and explained at \nlength the damage this tea party plan would do in the short term and in \nthe long term. Let me now again talk, briefly, about a few of the \nthings I have talked about before--but I will talk about them again. \nHere are some of the consequences.\n  H.R. 1 will fire 700,000 Americans, 6,000 Nevadans. Our budget would \ncreate jobs, not cost jobs. It will kick 200,000 Head Start students, \nthe poorest of the poor, little boys and girls trying to get started in \nlife, it will kick them off their ability to learn to read and do \nelementary math. Hundreds in Nevada will suffer from that. This is a \nvery successful early education program. Head Start works.\n\n[[Page S1341]]\n\n  It would slash college students' Pell grants, the financial aid so \nmany rely on to afford to go to school. It will eliminate job training \ninvestment at a time when we need them the most. It would pull the plug \non 600 renewable energy jobs at the largest solar plant in Nevada. It \nwould fire 600 Nevadans who work at community health centers, which \nhurts those workers as well as the neediest Nevadans who need this help \nevery day.\n  It would arbitrarily slash programs that fight crime and keep our \nneighborhoods safe. It would slash homeland security investments that \nkeep Nevadans safe and our country safe. We have 55, 60 million people \nwho visit Las Vegas every year. It is important we keep them safe also.\n  The mean-spirited bill, H.R. 1, eliminates national public \nbroadcasting. That is saying a lot; is it not? It eliminates the \nNational Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the \nArts. These programs create jobs. The National Endowment for the \nHumanities is the reason we have, in northern Nevada every January, the \nCowboy Poetry Festival. Had that program not been around, the tens of \nthousands of people who come there every year would not exist.\n  National Institutes of Health, it whacks that. When we are at a time \nin the history of this country, when we are on the verge of \nbreakthroughs on some of the most devastating diseases known to man, \nthey are cutting that program.\n  There are scores of other examples I could talk about. But, in short, \nthe Republican plan they want to push through the Senate is all smoke \nand mirrors. It cuts the deficit in the name of a stronger future but \ncuts the most important ways we strengthen our future. It is \ncounterproductive. It is bad policy. It is going to cost America \n700,000 jobs. This is not some figure I picked out of the air. \nEconomists agree with them, including Mark Zandi, chief economist at \nMoody's, who, by the way, worked for the Republican nominee for \nPresident, John McCain. He was his chief economic adviser.\n  Their plan slashes billions from the budget and hopes no one will \nlook past the pricetag. H.R. 1 is not just about numbers, it is about \npeople. It is about programs. It is about little boys and girls at Head \nStart. It is about senior citizens whose programs are going to be cut.\n  Because Republicans know that once the country sees what is in the \nfine print, they will run away from that as fast as they can. It seems \nRepublicans themselves have finally read their own budget in the Senate \nbecause now they are even running from H.R. 1.\n  In the Senate, it was not we who moved H.R. 1 forward, it was the \nRepublicans. We have a procedure in the Senate called rule XIV. It \nallows bills to move forward.\n  The Republicans decided they wanted to get to H.R. 1. So they jump-\nstarted H.R. 1. They wanted to make sure they let their buddies in the \nHouse know they wanted to have a vote on H.R. 1.\n  Last Thursday at 4, back in the Vice President's office, there was a \nmeeting held with me, Senator McConnell, Speaker Boehner, Leader \nPelosi, and the Vice President. The purpose was to move forward on \nbudget negotiations. We had a very good meeting. Everyone was kind and \nthoughtful and considerate. The idea we came up with is that what we \nshould do to move these negotiations forward is have a vote on H.R. 1 \nand a vote on our alternative. That was the agreement. It was agreed \nupon by the Vice President, Joe Biden; by the Republican leader, Mitch \nMcConnell; by the majority leader, Harry Reid; by the Speaker, John \nBoehner; and the leader of the Democrats in the House, Nancy Pelosi. \nThat was the agreement we made: We would come here today and have a \nvote on H.R. 1 and on our alternative.\n  After we had made the agreement, the staff was called into the \nmeeting. We told them what was done. Now over here the Republicans \ndon't want to vote. They don't want to live up to the agreement.\n  Last Thursday the leaders of both Houses of Congress and both parties \nmet with the White House. We decided this was a way to move forward. We \nagreed to hold a vote on H.R. 1 that Republicans moved to the Senate \nfloor themselves. Then we would vote on the Democratic alternative, \nwhich makes much smarter cuts and more solid investments. But that \nwould be up to the body to decide. Then we would return to the \nnegotiating table and try again to find common ground.\n  There is no question that was the agreement made, no question. That \nwas the deal. Now Republicans are reneging on that deal. They don't \nwant to vote on their own bill. They want some procedural votes. They \nwill have an opportunity to vote on H.R. 1. I may have to jump through \nall the procedural hoops to do it, in spite of the fact that they made \na deal that we would move to have those votes. We are going to do that. \nThe Republicans over here are going to have to vote on that terrible \nbill, H.R. 1. They will have to vote on it. They don't want to vote on \ntheir own bill.\n  The budget we outline--and our votes on that budget--reflects our \nvalues, values such as helping our Nation recover and prosper, giving \nus strong education for the children, encouraging innovation, keeping \nAmerica competitive. But another important value is keeping one's word. \nWhere I come from people keep their word. I am disappointed that \nRepublicans now refuse to keep theirs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, could the Chair tell me what the order \nis?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats control 51 minutes 26 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time do I control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may speak for up to 10 minutes \ntotal. She has spoken for 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, my intention is to yield to Senator \nUdall. He and Senator Merkley will engage in a colloquy.\n  I wish to open before yielding by saying that Senator Reid has laid \nout the devastating consequences of H.R. 1, which the Republicans have \nput forward as their plan to cut the budget. It is a jobs killer. It is \na killer for the middle class. They said they would have a vote on it. \nNow they don't want to vote on it. We are going to have a vote on it. \nIt is important for the American people to understand the various plans \nto cut the deficit.\n  One of the things in H.R. 1, of many, is a huge cut to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. There are two points I wish to make in \nthat regard. In 1970, the Clean Air Act was passed. The vote in the \nSenate was 73 to 0. The vote in the House was 374 to 1. Richard Nixon \nsigned the Clean Air Act. H.R. 1 destroys the Clean Air Act by giving \nthe largest cut of any agency to the Environmental Protection Agency. \nIf that is not enough, it prohibits the EPA from enforcing pollution \nlaws. In 1977 there were the Clean Air Act amendments signed by Jimmy \nCarter. There wasn't even a rollcall vote it was so popular. In 1990, \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush signed the Clean Air Act amendments. Two out \nof the three Presidents were Republicans. This passed 89 to 10 in the \nSenate and 401 to 25 in the House.\n  The Clean Air Act and the EPA are strongly supported by the American \npeople. The only place we have a lack of support is in the Congress by \nour Republican friends, primarily.\n  The American Lung Association says 69 percent think the EPA should \nupdate the Clean Air Act with stricter air pollution limits; 68 percent \nbelieve Congress should not stop the EPA from enforcing Clean Air Act \nstandards, which is what H.R. 1 does; and 69 percent believe EPA \nscientists, not Congress, should set pollution standards.\n  Our friends on the other side, through H.R. 1, are acting as if they \nhave all the brilliance in the world, all the scientific credentials in \nthe world. They don't.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we continue with our time until Senator \nKerry comes to the Chamber to talk on his particular subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, America's environmental \nlaws are public health laws. Undermining those public health laws may \nprotect special interests, but last year the Clean Air Act protected \nAmerican families from 1.7 million asthma attacks, 130,000 heart \nattacks and 86,000 emergency room visits.\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\n  In New Mexico, over 170,000 residents suffer from asthma, and over \n47,000 of those are children. Thousands also suffer from other \nrespiratory illnesses. The House bill puts hundreds of thousands of New \nMexicans at greater risk from pollution from powerplants, oil \nrefineries, mines, and cement kilns.\n  The Clean Air Act has cut six major pollutants by over 40 percent, \nbut air pollution still claims 70,000 lives per year, three times that \nof car accidents.\n  If we weaken that act, unfortunately, that number will rise. That is \nwhy the American Lung Association opposes these environmental rollbacks \nin the House bill.\n  The Clean Air Act also protects pregnant mothers and developing \nchildren from mercury, a neurotoxin that creates problems in brain \ndevelopment, including attention and memory problems. Mercury comes out \nof smoke stacks into the air, deposits into our water, and is also \nconsumed in the fish that we eat.\n  One New Mexico pediatrician, Dr. K.P. Stoller, notes that ``mercury \nis the most toxic non-radioactive element on the periodic table.'' In \nNew Mexico, over 2,000 pounds of mercury are emitted each year. Clean \nAir Act standards are making progress reducing that amount.\n  The American Academy of Pediatrics opposes the House bill because it \nwould allow for more highly toxic mercury than existing law in the air \nwe breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. Overall, the House \ncontinuing resolution undermines the Clean Air Act, leading to more \npollution, asthma, hospital visits, and less healthy children.\n  These efforts run counter to the progress we are trying to make in \nNew Mexico. At the University of New Mexico, the New Mexico \nEnvironmental Public Health Tracking Network and the National Tracking \nNetwork at the Center for Disease Control work closely with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to provide air quality data. We use \nthat data to better understand how to prevent disease and develop air \npollution standards for our State.\n  Unfortunately, these State air pollution control efforts are targeted \nfor cuts in the House bill. The funding is not a lot of money so some \npeople believe the real reason is to stop public health protections \nfrom going forward.\n  These standards are designed to reduce pollution, not put industrial \nfacilities out of business. We have heard from few, if any, businesses \nin New Mexico that want these antipublic health provisions in the House \nbill.\n  Instead we are seeing dozens of e-mails from people simply asking \nthat the Environmental Protection Agency do its job to protect public \nhealth.\n  Here are some additional facts about the House bill.\n  It cuts $2 billion in local wastewater and drinking water treatment \nfunds, costing over 50,000 jobs. Dozens of rural communities from New \nMexico are in desperate need of funds to rebuild aging water treatment \nplants and remove septic tanks that are polluting our limited supplies \nof groundwater.\n  It blocks the Environmental Protection Agency from enforcing the \nClean Water Act to protect wetlands. Wetlands definitions are a \ncontroversial issue, but the Supreme Court has ruled on this twice, and \nFederal agencies need to move forward to resolve uncertainty and issue \npermits in a responsible way.\n  It cuts $60 million from the 2010 enacted level and more than $140 \nmillion from the President's 2012 Budget for grants to State and local \nenvironmental and public health agencies. Nearly every State is in a \nbudget crisis.\n  America's leading public health professionals have responded to \nefforts to block clean air safeguards. For example: 1,882 Doctors, \nNurses and Health Professionals:\n\n       Please fulfill the promise of clean, healthy air for all \n     Americans to breathe. Support full implementation of the \n     Clean Air Act and resist any efforts to weaken, delay or \n     block progress toward a healthier future for all Americans.\n\n  From the American Lung Association:\n\n       The House of Representatives also adopted amendments that \n     would block implementation of the Clean Air Act and its \n     lifesaving protections . . . These provisions and others \n     adopted by the House of Representatives in H.R. 1 would \n     result in millions of Americans--including children, seniors, \n     and people with chronic disease such as asthma--being forced \n     to breathe air that is unhealthy. Breathing air pollution can \n     cause asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, cancer and \n     shorten lives.\n\n  From the American Public Health Association:\n\n       Attempts to remove protections already in place must be \n     stopped. The public health community is very concerned about \n     the long-term health consequences of global climate change. \n     Blocking EPA's authority to reduce carbon dioxide and other \n     greenhouse gases could mean the difference between chronic \n     debilitating illness or a healthy life.\n\n  From the Trust for America's Health:\n\n       The potential consequences for public health are grave \n     because the Clean Air Act protects the most vulnerable \n     populations--those with asthma and other lung disease, \n     children, older adults, and people with heart disease and \n     diabetes--from the dangers of pollution . . . The science \n     says carbon pollution is bad for our health. Rolling back \n     EPA's ability to protect the public from this threat \n     literally has life and death stakes.\n\n  From the American Thoracic Society:\n\n       The Clean Air Act is one of the best public health success \n     stories of the past four decades and has saved thousands of \n     American lives. Any effort to revise the Clean Air Act should \n     be carefully considered and focused on enhancing the public \n     health benefits--not on granting big polluters a free pass to \n     increase the amount of carbon pollution they release into the \n     environment.\n\n  The American Lung Association has said the health of 137.2 million \nAmericans--including as many as 29.8 million children under the age of \n14 and close to 2 million children suffering from asthma attacks--are \npotentially exposed to unhealthful levels of smog, air pollution.\n  Scientific evidence increasingly shows that air pollution plays a \nmajor role as a trigger for asthma episodes. Specifically, fine \nparticles, sulfur dioxide and ozone have been linked to increases in \npatients' use of asthma medication, emergency department visits and \nhospital admissions.\n  Powerplant particle pollution is estimated to cause more than 603,000 \nasthma episodes per year, 366,000 of which could be avoided by cleaning \nup the power plants.\n  Estimates of the annual human health costs of outdoor air pollution \nrange from $14 billion to $55 billion annually.\n  Each year, pollution claims 70,000 lives in the United States.\n  In 2010, the United States will save a projected $1,100 billion in \nhealth benefits--i.e., avoided illness and death--associated with \nreductions in air pollution due to implementation of the Federal Clean \nAir Act.\n  Let me thank the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Boxer. She has done an excellent job in terms of \noutlining in committee the real issues facing us. The big issue is, as \nwe have heard today from Leader Reid and Chairman Boxer, H.R. 1, or \nwhat we call the House Republican budget, is not only a budget bill, it \nis loaded with all these environmental riders that attack public health \nby repealing public health laws.\n  I wish to reflect, as Chairman Boxer did, on the history. We used to \nhave tremendous bipartisan support in terms of public health and \nenvironmental laws. I remember the glory days of the Senate in the \n1960s and 1970s. It was the Senate that passed the Clean Air Act, the \nClean Water Act, created the Environmental Protection Agency, passed \nthe Endangered Species Act. All of those were passed and created with \nsignificant bipartisan support. In fact, anywhere from 8 to 12 \nRepublicans believed these were strong laws that needed to be passed. \nWe don't need to look further than the majorities.\n  In 1967, the Air Quality Act passed 88 to 0. In 1970, the Clean Air \nAct passed 73 to 0, championed by a number of Republican Senators. In \n1990, the Clean Air Act, championed by President George H.W. Bush and \nhis EPA Administrator, William Reilly, passed 89 to 10. So there was \nbroad bipartisan support.\n  What has happened to the Senate and to the Congress in terms of \nprotecting public health? I suggest what we have seen with this House \nRepublican budget is very strong powerful special interests weighing \nin, and those folks on that side kind of catering to that kind of \nmentality rather than looking out for public health and the American \npeople.\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\n  I rise to talk about the impact of this bill on Americans and on \npublic health and on New Mexicans.\n  At this point, I wish to engage in a colloquy with Senator Merkley on \nsome of the damaging aspects he sees in terms of public health and the \nenvironment in H.R. 1, the House Republican budget.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, it is a pleasure to join my colleague \nfrom New Mexico to discuss both the general environment, the \nenvironment in which we no longer have strong bipartisan support for \nclean air and clean water that we once had, and some of the specifics \nof the House Republican budget and the damage that would do to American \ncitizens.\n  Just to give a small sense of this, in 2010 the Clean Air Act \nprevented 1.7 million asthma attacks, 130,000 heart attacks, and 86,000 \nemergency room visits. That is why leading public health experts oppose \nthese cuts, groups such as the American Lung Association, which said: \n``H.R. 1 is toxic to public health.''\n  Why is that the case? I will give a couple examples and then turn \nback to my colleague. One example is that it would prohibit standards \nfor toxic air pollution, including mercury, lead, arsenic, dioxin, and \nacid gases coming from coal-burning powerplants. A second is that it \nwould prohibit standards for toxic air pollution coming from industries \nburning coal and oil. A third is that it would prohibit guidance on how \nto protect clean drinking water from mountain top mining. A fourth is \nit would prohibit standards for handling hazardous waste from burning \ncoal just 2 years after a disaster in Tennessee caused 1 billion \ngallons of coal waste to spill into people's neighborhoods and homes.\n  I have a longer list, but I will stop there and note that these \nimpacts on water and air occur to citizens in every State under H.R. 1, \nthe Republican budget.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, if the American people knew \nwhat was happening here I think they would be out in the streets in \nWashington, as we are seeing in Wisconsin where people are turning out \nand are energized, because the rollback of these environmental laws is \na rollback on public health.\n  As Senator Merkley has discussed persuasively, we are talking about \npreventing heart attacks, preventing emergency room visits. In New \nMexico alone over 170,000 residents suffer from asthma. Over 47,000 of \nthose are children. Thousands suffer from respiratory illnesses. With \nthe rollbacks in the House Republican budget, those folks will suffer a \nlot more. It is going to impact vulnerable populations.\n  The House Republican budget puts hundreds of thousands of New \nMexicans at greater risk from pollution, from powerplants, oil \nrefineries, mines, and cement kilns. The Clean Air Act has had a very \npositive impact over the years that it has been a law. It has cut six \nmajor pollutants by over 40 percent. But air pollution still claims \n70,000 lives per year, three times that of car accidents. So if we \nweaken that act by these riders and this approach in the House \nRepublican budget, that number is going to rise. The number of lives \nclaimed each year is going to rise. That is why one of the major \norganizations that monitors this, the American Lung Association, \nopposes these environmental rollbacks in the House bill.\n\n  The Clean Air Act also protects pregnant mothers and developing \nchildren from mercury, a neurotoxin that creates problems in brain \ndevelopment, including attention and memory problems. Mercury comes out \nof the smokestacks into the air, deposits into our water, and is also \nconsumed in the fish we eat.\n  Just to give a little example, in New Mexico--and Senator Merkley may \nhave this up in Oregon too--we have these coal-fired powerplants that \nare emitting mercury. It gets into the streams. We now have a warning \non every stream in New Mexico--every stream in New Mexico--that if you \nare going to catch fish and eat them, do not do it more than about once \na week. They actually warn pregnant women to not eat the fish from New \nMexico's streams at all. I do not think people realize how much \npollution there is out there.\n  With that, I yield back to Senator Merkley for any additional \ncomments the Senator has. I see our good friend, Senator Cardin, is on \nthe floor and also has been a real leader on this issue. I know he \nwants to speak also.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I will say that one key aspect is that \nthe House Republican budget would cut $2 billion from EPA's clean water \nand safe drinking water infrastructure loan programs. As I am going \naround my State, holding a townhall in every single county, I hold a \nmeeting with the city and county leaders in advance of the public \nmeeting. At virtually every one of these gatherings, I hear stories \nfrom mayors and chairs of county councils who talk about the challenge \nthey have with their aging infrastructure, both on their water supply \nand on their wastewater disposal; and that aging infrastructure needs \nto be upgraded as plants wear out and as we discover more challenges we \nneed to address. So cutting the loan program that supports our \ncommunities--our rural communities, our suburban communities, our urban \ncommunities, all of our communities--in providing clean water to the \nresidents and of helping dispose of and treat wastewater would be an \nenormous mistake. That partnership is absolutely crucial to communities \nthat cannot otherwise afford this infrastructure. That would mean more \nsewage and other pollution going into our water ways and less treatment \nof water we take out to drink.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, in conclusion, from my \nperspective, I think it is most important at this point in our history \nin America that we take actions on the Senate floor that are going to \ncreate jobs, that are going to try to move us forward in terms of our \neconomic development.\n  This House Republican budget is devastating in terms of creating \njobs. Leader Reid, I think, said 700,000 Americans are fired as a \nresult of this job-killing bill, this House Republican budget. It is a \ndevastating--devastating--thing to the fragile economic recovery we \nhave going on right now.\n  I am very happy to hear--very happy to hear--that Senator Reid says \nwe are going to bring the House Republican budget here to the Senate \nfloor. We are going to have an up-or-down vote on that budget. And it \nwill be out there. We are going to have lively debate until we have \nthat vote, and it will be out there for the American people to see the \ndevastating consequences it could have if we adopted it.\n  With that, I say to Senator Merkley, I know you have some concluding \nremarks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I say to the Senators, if I could take \nback my time. I want to thank both Senators. We have only 10 minutes \nremaining, and we have three more speakers. So I thank you very much.\n  Before I yield to Senator Cardin--I thought it could be for 5; now I \nam told there are two more speakers; it will be about 3 minutes--let me \nput two charts up here in the Chamber and then yield to him for 3 \nminutes.\n  Look at this picture, I say to my colleague from Maryland. These are \nthe most difficult times on these children when the air is dirty. This \nis a beautiful child. She cannot breathe, and she has asthma. The \nreason we passed the Clean Air Act is because of kids like her, and \nothers who are gasping for air, literally.\n  The other thing I want to show you is this chart. This is an \nincredible chart that shows the significant drop in smog-related health \nadvisories in southern California, the most polluted area, since we \nhave put the Clean Air Act into place in the 1970s. Look at this. We \nhave gone from 166 days where there were warnings for people to stay \nindoors to zero days in 2010. The Republicans, in H.R. 1, devastate the \nEPA's budget, plus they tell them they cannot enforce the Clean Air \nAct.\n  Let me say this: If my Republican friends want to repeal the Clean \nAir Act, just bring it on, and we will have a debate here. Do not do it \nthrough the guise of deficit reduction.\n  Now I see I have three colleagues in the Chamber for the remaining \ntime. I ask unanimous consent that we have until 20 after before we \nturn it over to Senator Kerry, and that I am going to yield 3 minutes \nto the following: Senators Cardin, Lautenberg, and Whitehouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1344]]\n\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me thank, first, Senator Boxer for \nher leadership on this issue in bringing us together to point out what \nharm the House-passed budget bill would do to our environment.\n  I start off by saying, when you look at the Republican budget plan in \nthe House, it not only devastates important investments in our \nenvironment, it does not bring us to a balanced budget because all the \nsavings they get in these Draconian cuts to our discretionary domestic \nspending are offset by extending the tax cuts. We lose all the savings \nthrough their tax policy.\n  But today I want to talk about a nonmoney issue, at least a rider \nthat was put on the House budget. Let me read what it says. The bill \nsays that ``none of the funds made available in this Act may be used to \n. . . implement'' the Bay restoration plan now under way. I am talking \nabout the Chesapeake Bay program, a matter I have talked about on this \nfloor many times.\n  What does that mean? That means none of the funds in the budget can \nbe used in the six States that are in the watershed, including Maryland \nand the District of Columbia, to implement their plan. Each of these \nStates is relying and getting Federal funds under the State revolving \nfund to deal with wastewater treatment plants. Those funds would be \ndenied. None of the money could be used for the State water programs. \nNone of the funds could be used for watershed groups to restore local \nstreams.\n  We have school groups and civic associations participating with us to \nclean up the Bay. Those programs would come to an end. It is estimated \nthis one rider alone will cost the Bay restoration effort in Delaware, \nMaryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, West Virginia, and the \nDistrict of Columbia more than $300 million.\n  What does that mean? It means job loss in our areas, by far. We are \ntalking about jobs here. It also puts our citizens at risk as far as \ntheir health is concerned. More and more health-related illnesses are \ncoming as a result of the poor quality of water in our communities.\n  Let me mention one other issue; that is, the House-passed budget--the \nRepublican budget--will slash the EPA budget by 33 percent below the \nfiscal year 2010 level. That is a one-third reduction in the EPA's \nbudget.\n  It threatens Clean Water Act protections for lakes, streams, and \nrivers across our country by cutting $2 billion from the EPA's Clean \nWater and Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund.\n  I mention that because in my State and around the Nation we are \nseeing more and more disasters occurring as a result of water main \nbreaks. We saw what happened in Prince George's County, MD. That was \nwithin the last year. We saw what happened in downtown Baltimore when a \nwater main broke and turned our downtown into unpavable streets. We saw \nwhat happened in Montgomery County, MD, where River Road became a river \nand people had to be rescued from their cars. This, once again, is \nabout jobs. It creates jobs. But it also provides us with safe drinking \nwater in our communities.\n  For all these reasons, Madam President, it is important that we do \nnot allow the House-passed budget to become law.\n  I thank my colleagues for participating in this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  The remarks of Mr. Lautenberg are printed in todays Record under \n``Morning Business.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank Chairman Boxer for pulling \nus together. I want to make three quick points in the time I have.\n  The House bill cuts $2 billion out of the clean water and safe \ndrinking water infrastructure loan programs at a time when EPA \ncalculates we have a $600 billion water infrastructure deficit. We are \nbehind on rebuilding America's clean water infrastructure, and yet they \ncut it. We need the infrastructure. We could certainly use the jobs. \nThis is a very misplaced cut.\n  From a clean air perspective, the bill cuts $60 million from State \nand local grants that ensure clean air and clean water and attacks \nclean air programs. In 2010, the Clean Air Act is estimated to have \nsaved 160,000 lives, compared to where things would have been without \nit.\n  Physicians for Social Responsibility says that U.S. coal plants alone \ncause about 554,000 asthma attacks each year. Why do I talk about \nasthma? Rhode Island has a 10-percent rate of asthma, despite not \nhaving a single coal-fired powerplant.\n  Why is this? Because out in the Midwest, they are pumping their \npollution up into the sky, where it falls down on our New England \nStates.\n  Average smokestack height increased from 200 feet tall in 1956 to \nover 500 feet tall in 1978. In 1970, there were only two U.S. \nsmokestacks over 500 feet tall. By 1985, there were 180 smokestacks \ntaller than 500 feet, and 23 were over 1,000 feet tall--so tall that \nthey had to be put on air traffic control maps.\n  Why? Because it exports their pollution to us. A State such as Rhode \nIsland has no shot at controlling the pollution that is dumped on us \nthat originates in other States if there is not a strong national EPA \nto do this. So it is very vital to us. And asthma is a real threat.\n  Lastly, on carbon pollution, we hear a lot of talk about this, and \nthere are certain things that are just factual at this point. It is a \nfact that over the last 800,000 years, the atmosphere has been in a \nrange between 170 and 300 parts per million of CO2. That is \na measurement, not a theory. In 1863--a long time ago, during the time \nof the Civil War in this country--an Irish scientist, John Tyndall, \ndetermined that carbon dioxide has a blanketing effect in the \natmosphere and increasingly warms the Earth. That has been textbook \nscience for more than a century. It is not a negotiable or debatable \nproposition. We have burned 7 million to 8 million gigatons of carbon \ndioxide every year, and it is having an effect. We are now at 391 parts \nper million--well outside of a benchmark that has lasted for 800,000 \nyears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I understand I have 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 27\\1/2\\ minutes, I am told.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent to use the full 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank my colleagues, the Senator from \nCalifornia and other colleagues, who have been involved in an important \ndiscussion here. I will say a few more words about that in the course \nof my comments.\n  Let me begin by observing that last week, like a lot of colleagues \nhere, I voted in favor of a 2-week continuing resolution in order to \navoid a government shutdown. But I will say that I did so extremely \nreluctantly, and I am not inclined to continue to do that in a series \nof hatchet budgets that continue to make cuts without regard to the \nlarger budget considerations we need to be considering. I know \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle voted reluctantly. Frankly, it is \ninsulting and frustrating that we are reduced to passing incremental \nallowances just to keep the government functioning. This is just the \nwork of this year's budget--something that should have been passed for \nan entire year last year.\n  The impact of this kind of staggered, stop-and-start, keep-them-\nguessing budgeting on programs and projects that, frankly, need to do \nsome long-term planning actually costs Americans money and costs \nAmericans long-term competitive capacity. Run a business the way we are \nrunning these kinds of programs, and you would go under if you had a \nmonth-to-month, week-to-week, 2-weeks-to-2-weeks budget process. No \ndepartment head can plan for the long term because they don't know what \nthey are going to have, how much they are going to spend. Projects that \nneed to begin don't begin, and that costs America leadership. It costs \nus money. No wonder Americans are frustrated. All we do\n\n[[Page S1345]]\n\nis bounce from one short-term, stopgap solution, band aid approach to \nanother, always deferring the tough decisions and the adult \nconversation, which is exactly what the American people sent us here to \nengage in.\n  I come here today to appeal to the common sense and conscience of our \ncolleagues. This is not the time to create a fundamentally political \nbudget document, steeped in ideology. It is not the time to put forward \na set of choices, many of which have absolutely nothing to do with \nreducing the deficit or debt but everything to do with ideological \ngoals long sought by some, now cloaked in the guise of deficit crisis \nin order to achieve what they have never been able to achieve to date.\n  Everyone here knows--you have private conversations with colleagues, \nand they will nod their heads and acknowledge to you how serious this \nbudget situation is. We need a serious conversation about our fiscal \nsituation. It begins with a comprehensive discussion about \ndiscretionary spending. Yes, that has to be on the table. But what \nabout entitlements? What about revenues? Everybody here knows we have \nto work toward a long-term solution in order to reduce the budget \ndeficit and the staggering debt of our country. We are going to have to \nreduce some Federal spending and make appropriate changes in \nentitlement programs in order to do that. When we are honest about it, \nit means you have to talk about everything--revenue, tax reform, \nspending, and entitlements.\n  A lot of Americans appropriately ask: What are we doing with 57,000 \nor 60,000 pages of a tax code? How many Americans have their own page? \nYou can run through it and find an awful lot of big interests, big \nbusiness, folks who can afford big lobbyists--they get their own pages. \nBut the average American appropriately feels left out and abused by \nthat process. That ought to be on this agenda--the simplification of \nthe code and the fairness of the code.\n  In addition, we obviously need to talk about Medicaid, Medicare, and \nSocial Security. Social Security, frankly, is easy to fix. We fixed it \nin the 1980s with Ronald Reagan. I was here then. We can do this again. \nThat is not challenging. We can make that safe and whole throughout the \ncentury so that our children and grandchildren and their children have \nthe opportunity to trust in the Social Security system. That is doable \nwith minor tweaks.\n  What is far more complicated and challenging is Medicaid and \nMedicare. I assure colleagues who are out to undo the health care bill \npassed by President Obama, if that is undone, those Medicare costs are \ngoing to soar and the medical choices before our country are going to \nbecome even more complicated.\n  Back in December, a number of our colleagues understood and embraced \nexactly what I am saying right now. Senators, Republicans and Democrats \nalike, including Senators Durbin, Conrad, Coburn, and Crapo, had the \ncourage and willpower to put on the table the whole set of choices when \nthey embraced the debt commission's report, which was appropriately \nentitled ``The Moment of Truth.'' Nobody liked every proposal set forth \nby the commission--not even the Commissioners themselves--but they did \nit in order to put everything on the table for a discussion by us.\n  The Congress is responsible for making these choices. Unfortunately, \nthe budget sent to us by the House is an unbelievably irresponsible \nexercise in avoidance, and includes a set of choices that will take \nAmerica backward. I am not exaggerating about that. I will go into that \nin a moment.\n  Let me cite what the commission said to remind us about our \nresponsibility. They said that throughout our Nation's history, \nAmericans have found the courage to do right by our children's future. \nDeep down, every American knows we face a moment of truth once again. \nWe cannot play games or put off hard choices any longer. Without regard \nto party, they said, we have a patriotic duty to keep the promise of \nAmerica to give our children and grandchildren a better life. Our \nchallenge is clear and inescapable. America cannot be great if we go \nbroke. Our businesses will not be able to grow and create jobs, and our \nworkers will not be able to compete successfully for the jobs of the \nfuture without a plan to get this crushing debt burden off our backs. I \nthink every Senator probably agrees with that, but is every Senator \nprepared to do something about it? Certainly, this budget sent to us by \nthe House is an avoidance of that kind of discussion and the \nresponsibility the debt commission placed on our heads. So we ought to \nget serious.\n  For fiscal year 2011, the administration's budget projects a deficit \nof $1.6 trillion. Without changes in our current policies, the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that our Federal debt will be 95 \npercent of GDP the gross domestic product of our Nation. Today, as we \nare here, we are borrowing 40 cents of every single dollar we spend--\nborrowing 40 cents. We borrow a lot of it to be able to afford to buy \nthe source of our energy from other countries, and much of the dollars \nwe borrow in order to go into debt to buy energy from other countries \nwinds up making us less secure. This is not a smart cycle, not a \nvirtuous cycle. Certainly, it is not something we are locked into. We \nhave a whole set of other choices.\n\n  Let me point out to my colleagues that spending is at the highest \nlevel as a share of our economy than it has been in more than 60 years. \nWe are spending more than we have spent as a share of our economy at \nany time in 60 years. But we are also collecting less revenue than we \nhave ever collected in the last 60 years. There is something wrong with \nthat equation.\n  It seems to me clear--and many of us objected and opposed the tax cut \nthat wound up putting us in this predicament--that we have been on a \nbinge of political sloganeering. It has been appealing to the easiest \ninstinct of every American. Who doesn't feel they don't pay too much? \nThe fact is that the burden we pay is far less than many other \ncountries. It is at about the lowest level in our history--the least \namount of revenue in the last 60 years. That is part of what \ncontributes to our debt. It also robs us of a whole set of other \nchoices in terms of American competitiveness.\n  Let me point out, to listen to the Members of the House and some of \nour colleagues, you would think the President didn't do anything about \nthis. In fact, the President is the only person who put a realistic \nbudget before us. The President is the only person who really put in a \nplan to reduce the overall debt, not just a CR on a temporary basis but \nan overall budget with a plan for how you grow America and reduce our \ndeficit. The President's budget does significantly reduce deficits.\n  I remember in the 1990s when we faced this very question. I remind my \ncolleagues that we did balance the budget. The last President and party \nto balance the budget was President Bill Clinton and the Democrats. We \ndid it jointly, working together in a responsible way. It wasn't just \nthat we increased revenues and reduced spending. What was critical \nwas--they all met within 1, 2, or 3 years--that we sent a message to \nthe marketplace and the American people that we were serious about \nturning our deficit into a surplus.\n  I believe that as we go forward we have a responsibility to \nunderstand that we need to have a responsible set of choices put in \nfront of us. We are locked in a debate that is not actually trying to \nfind common ground right now. Ask this question: Is everything on the \ntable in a serious effort to create jobs and advance America's economic \nleadership? Is it really impossible for us to sit down together across \nthe aisle and come to an agreement as to what helps us grow and what \ndoesn't? Is it really true that American Senators have the inability to \nbe able to agree as to where the benefit comes to the economy in the \nmultiplier effect with respect to science research or technology \nresearch or other kinds of things we can excite in the private sector?\n  Completely absent from this debate is an honest discussion of what \nactions only the government is actually equipped to take in order to \nbolster our global competitiveness. Every CEO in America knows there \nare some things that only the government can do. Look at President \nEisenhower's National System of Interstate Highways in the 1950s. By \ntoday's standards, we could not build it. It would not happen by \ntoday's standards. But the fact is, more than 30 or 40 percent, maybe \n50 percent, of America's productivity increases came as a consequence \nof the building\n\n[[Page S1346]]\n\nof the Interstate Highway System, not to mention billions of dollars' \nworth of spinoff jobs and tax revenues to our communities. We are still \nliving off that inheritance. We are living off the infrastructure \ninvestments of those who went before us.\n  Today, China is investing 9 percent of its GDP into infrastructure. \nEurope is investing 5 percent of its GDP into infrastructure. The \nUnited States, just about 2 percent, slightly less. We have a $2.2 \ntrillion infrastructure deficit.\n  What we have not been discussing in this debate is what we need to \ninvest in, a coherent strategy, a policy to make certain we are not \nheld hostage to oil and instability in the Middle East.\n  The United States could become the first country to have 1 million \nelectric vehicles on the road by 2015 and ensure that 80 percent of our \nelectricity comes from clean energy sources and with that comes jobs. \nWe need a cutting-edge, high-speed wireless data network. We still do \nnot have one. We are going backward. We invented the technologies. We \nused to be No. 3 or No. 4. Now we are drifting back to No. 16 or No. \n21, depending on whose measurement we look at. By any measurement and \nany standard, we are going backward, while other countries are going \nforward, and it is because we are not investing and making it \nattractive for the private sector or private citizens to achieve this.\n  America has always been a competitive country. Our DNA is innovation \nand creativity and entrepreneurial activity. The fact is, we are not \ndoing the things we could do in joint venture with the private sector \nto attract the best jobs and create the best opportunities. We have to \nbecome that nation again. That is what our budget ought to be \ndiscussing, and we ought to be able to agree across party lines as to \nhow we do that.\n  The budget passed by the House of Representatives not only does not \npresent a realistic set of choices with respect to how we make America \ncompetitive and create higher paying jobs and grow our economy, not \nonly does it not do that, it actually strips away the opportunities to \ndo that. It takes us backward.\n  The House budget is going to lower the deficit by only 6 percent \nbecause they are focused only on domestic discretionary spending. They \ndo not focus on defense spending. They do not focus on Medicaid, \nMedicare, entitlements. They do not focus on some of the waste and \nduplication within the system. They just strip away at a whole bunch of \nprograms that many of them have opposed for their entire life in \npolitics and voted against in the first place. They are using the \nopportunity of this budget to press an ideological agenda. That is why \nonly 13 percent of the budget is being focused on in what they are \ndoing.\n  They have sworn off any discussion of the very hard choices. Here we \nare 3 months after the Commission put forward its important proposals, \nand the Senate is trapped in a political moment when what we need is a \nmoment of truth.\n  We have to find a way to make these tougher choices. I wish to be \nclear about what I think they are. I ask my colleagues: Do we want a \ngovernment that is too limited to have invented the Internet? A lot of \npeople do not think about that, but the fact is, the government \ninvented the Internet. It was a spinoff from DARPA, from research into \nhow we might be able to communicate in the case of nuclear war. We were \ncreating this communications network which became the Internet. Then \nthe private sector saw the opportunities and took those opportunities \nand translated them into what we have today, which has revolutionized \nthe way people communicate and do business. But it came from the \ngovernment, just as digitalization came from government research, the \nspace program, which also produced Gortex and microwave and Teflon and \na host of other products that are now out in the marketplace where we \nhave created millions of jobs. The Internet created more than a million \njobs and has added greatly to the gross domestic product of our \ncountry.\n  We want to have a country that is so limited that we do not do those \nkinds of things? Taxes so low that everybody feels good, thinks they \nare better off, but we do not do the research that is necessary to \ncreate jobs and new industries and fill the Treasury with the revenue \nthat educates our children, cures to diseases and provides \nopportunities for poor people to break out of poverty and touch the \nbrass ring of America.\n  We have to get past the slogans and the sound bites. We have to \nreason together and talk about the things America does best.\n  If we are going to balance the budget and create jobs, we cannot \npretend we are going to do it by eliminating earmarks and government \nwaste. We have to look at how we did it previously.\n  In the early 1990s, our economy was faltering because deficits were \ntoo big and debt was freezing capital. We had to send a signal to the \nmarket that we were capable of being fiscally responsible. Guess what. \nWe did it, and we did it without a reckless assault on a whole series \nof things that make a difference to the quality of life of our country \nand to our ability to create jobs. We saw our economy turn around in \nthe 1990s, and we created 22 million jobs. We created unprecedented \nwealth in America. Every single income level in our country saw their \nincome go up in the 1990s. We created more wealth in the 1990s than we \ncreated in the 1920s and 1930s with the great barons of wealth of that \nperiod--the Carnegies, Mellons, and so forth. We did it by committing \nthe country to a disciplined path, where we spoke to the potential of \nthe American people.\n  Working with the Republicans--it was bipartisan--we came up with a \nframework that put our country on a track to be debt free by 2012, for \nthe first time since Andrew Jackson's administration. The fact is, Alan \nGreenspan was warning America and the Senate that we were paying down \nour debt too fast and that could have implications on the marketplace.\n  We know how to do this in a responsible way. How we got off track \nfrom that is a story I am not going to go back into right now. It is \npretty well known. But the truth of how we generated the 1990s economic \nboom is a story that has to be retold again and again.\n  Let me point out the difference. We are not going to do this process \nin 2 weeks. We know that. We ought to have a responsible CR that allows \nus to go forward and give ourselves a proper amount of time to tackle \nthese larger issues and put something serious on the table with tax \nreform spending, entitlements--all those issues on the table.\n  What we have in this House budget--let me point out, rather than say \nit takes us backward. I believe there are reckless cuts in this budget \nthat would do great harm to our country because it strips away our \nability to create the future. Research and development in technology, \nresearch and development in science, the National Institutes of \nHealth--a host of these things are cut in a draconian way.\n  I had lunch the other day with the Secretary of the Navy. He was \ntelling me how the House budget has cut ARPA-E program. It has cut it \nfrom about $250 million down to $50 million. The House bill effectively \nshuts off all the projects.\n  Do you know what some of those projects are? One is our military's \nability to have greater capacity in the field, to have solar or wind or \nbattery storage so they do not have to run convoys of fuel to keep \nvehicles and supply our troops with the administrative support they \nneed.\n  They say the military has done a study. For every 24 convoys for \nfuel, we lose one marine or soldier--one marine or soldier for every 24 \nconvoys. They are looking at ways to reduce having those convoys, and \nthey are cutting the money so our military will be more dependent on \nthe fossil fuel that comes from unstable countries in various parts of \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, China is racing ahead with respect to these \nkinds of investments. The fact is, they are sending their students to \nthe United States for degrees in math, science, and engineering, but \nthe House is cutting Pell grants so there is a 15-percent cut below the \nmaximum level, which would affect over 100,000 students in college, \nmaking it less affordable, less accessible for low- and moderate-income \nstudents. That is not a\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\nbudget that helps our economy. It does nothing with dealing with the \ndeficit and jobs.\n  They tie the hands of the Consumer Product Safety Commission so they \ncannot launch a database for consumer products. If you are an average \nAmerican, you do not need to know if the products you buy are safe or \nwill harm you. That does not matter anymore, even though it has nothing \nto do with dealing with the budget problem.\n  They reduce Federal funds from being spent for Planned Parenthood, \nfor doctors and nurses to conduct 1 million lifesaving screenings for \ncervical cancer and more than 830,000 breast cancer exams. I guess it \nis much more important that millionaires, people earning more than $1 \nmillion a year, get their tax cut than 830,000 women to have breast \ncancer screenings. This value system is something that I think is \nabsolutely essential for us to examine.\n  The House cuts almost $2 billion from the clean water and drinking \nwater State funds that allow us to capitalize on low-interest loans and \nno-interest loans so we can build and refurbish clean water systems.\n  All across our country, we have communities that are under court \norders to clean up the water for our citizens. The House is cutting the \nability of those communities to be able to provide for that because \nmost of them do not have the tax base to do it on their own.\n  The House bill prohibits the EPA--that discussion took place, and I \nwill skip over it. It has nothing to do with deficit reduction. It just \nprohibits the EPA from enforcing clean air laws, after the American \npeople decided in 1970 they wanted clean air, and people's lives have \nbeen improved because we have provided it. We are going to go backward \nthere.\n  I mentioned the ARPA-E cuts. The House bill cuts $780 million below \nthe current level for energy efficiency and renewable energy, which is \ngoing to cut critical programs that advance our job base.\n  I met yesterday with the CEO of a major solar company. They are going \nto create a huge number of jobs in the Southwest of our country. The \nlargest facilities are going to be in Arizona and California. But by \ncutting the loan guarantee program, we are going to lose 1,200 jobs \njust on the California project, and that does not include the $\\1/2\\ \nbillion of equipment from U.S. suppliers in nine States, including \nArizona, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Colorado, and Kansas. That is a loss of \njobs in every single one of those States.\n  The House bill reduces funding for the National Institutes of \nStandards and Technology, which is going to reduce research and hurt \njob creation. It slashes funding for the National Science Foundation by \nmore than $300 million. That is 1,800 fewer research and education \ngrants.\n  The House bill provides $787 million below the current level for \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy. It would significantly delay \nneeded investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy R, \ndemonstration and deployment programs critical to the transition to a \nclean energy economy.\n  The U.S. stands to be the world leader in concentrated solar with the \naddition of these two projects, but this title is in jeopardy thanks to \nmore irresponsible and irrational cuts in H.R. 1.The proposed \nelimination of the DOE loan guarantee program for clean energy cost \njobs, American competitiveness, and immediate economic benefits. For \nexample, yesterday I met with Abengoa Solar, a company trying to help \nthe U.S. become the world leader in concentrated solar with two of the \nlargest facilities in Arizona and California. But by cutting the loan \nguarantee program we stand to lose 1,200 jobs from just the California \nproject. In addition this doesn't include the $\\1/2\\ billion of \nequipment from U.S. suppliers in nine States across the U.S. including \nArizona, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Colorado, and Kansas.\n  The House bill slashes $1.3 billion from the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH, which would force NIH to reduce support for more than \n25,000 existing research grants and scale back clinical trials and \nresearch projects. These drastic cuts will devastate biomedical \nresearch; cures will be delayed, jobs will be eliminated, and American \nleadership and innovation will be jeopardized. NIH is the primary \nFederal agency responsible for conducting and supporting medical \nresearch, most of which is done at medical schools, hospitals, \nuniversities and research institutes distributed in every State in the \ncountry. NIH-funded research drives scientific innovation and develops \nnew and better diagnostics, prevention strategies, and more effective \ntreatments. NIH-funded research also contributes to the Nation's \neconomic strength by creating skilled, high-paying jobs; new products \nand industries; and improved technologies.\n  They do that even as we know that continued commitment to NIH is \nessential for securing a strong national economy and for maintaining \nour leadership as the global leader in research and development. \nEveryone applauded when President Obama said in his 2011 State of the \nUnion Address that ``one key to future growth in the U.S. economy will \nbe to encourage American innovation and job creation by investing in \nresearch and development--including biomedical research at the NIH.'' \nAnd Massachusetts received more than $2.5 billion in NIH grants last \nyear alone. But here we are gutting the NIH because we are afraid to \nlook at the things that need to be addressed that yield real savings.\n  Folks, this is killing our economic competitiveness in the cradle--\nand in the laboratories. Investment in the NIH produces a steady stream \nof talented researchers who lead the way to treatments and cures for \nsome of the world's most devastating diseases. In fact, a report by \nFamilies USA estimated NIH awards to the States results in over 351,000 \njobs that pay an average annual wage of more than $52,000, and results \nin $50.5 billion in increased output of goods and services to the U.S. \nThe jobs, the spinoff industries, and the local development that are \nsustained by NIH awards will disappear or relocate to more competitive \nnations--such as China or India--without continued and stable funding \nfor the NIH.\n  The House bill reduces funding for the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology by $223 million which will reduce research and \nhurt job creation. The House bill slashes funding for the National \nScience Foundation by more than $300 million below current levels \nmeaning 1,800 fewer research and education grants.\n  Earlier this month, 300 of America's leading economists, including \nAlan Blinder and Laura Tyson, sent an open letter to President Obama \nand Members of Congress concerning these cuts, and they said it is \nshortsighted to make cuts that eliminate necessary investments in our \nhuman capital, our infrastructure, and the next generation of \nscientific and technological advances. They said: Republican-planned \ncuts threaten our economy's long-term economic competitiveness and the \nstrength of our current economic recovery. The letter goes on to say \nthat we need to look and sustain the critical investments in the \nproductive capacity of the United States.\n  Mr. President, you are a farmer, and there ain't a farmer in the \ncountry who doesn't know you don't eat your seed corn. But that is what \nwe are doing here. We are eating our seed corn. We are stripping away \nAmerica's already challenged ability to compete against a China, India, \nBrazil, Mexico, South Korea, and countless countries that are \nindicating far more seriousness than we are about their desire to build \nout and build a future.\n  We have a train that runs from Washington to New York called the \nAcela. It can go 150 miles an hour. But it only goes 150 miles an hour \nfor 18 miles of that trip between here and New York. Why? Because if it \ngoes too fast into the tunnel in Baltimore, the tunnel may cave in; \nbecause if it goes too fast over the bridges of the Chesapeake, they \nmay fall down. But you can go to China and ride on a train that goes \n200 miles an hour and the water in your glass doesn't even move; or 300 \nmiles an hour in the Maglev train from Shanghai airport to downtown \nShanghai. Go to Abu Dhabi, go to Dubai, go to Paris, or any major \nairport in Europe and you will find an airport that outshines the \nairports of the United States and you will find public transit systems \nthat outshine the public transit systems of the United States. Because \nonce again, we are living off what our parents and grandparents built \nbecause we are not willing to pay for anything, which is why revenue in \nthe United States is at a 60-year low.\n\n[[Page S1348]]\n\n  We need to be smart about where we are going here. The GDP of our \ncountry is measured by our total expenditures of consumption of the \nAmerican people, it is measured by our investments, it is measured by \ngovernment spending and investment, and by our exports minus our \nimports. That is the GDP. That is how you measure GDP. How can these \nfolks sit here and say if you cut the government spending you are not \ngoing to cut the GDP, which is what every major economic analysis has \nsaid?\n  So yes, we have to cut waste; yes, we have to cut some spending; yes, \nwe have to be responsible. But let us be responsible in a responsible \nway, by looking at the overall budget and the places we can reduce, at \na tempo that doesn't do injury to our ability to invest in America's \nfuture, to create the jobs for the future, but nevertheless send the \nright message to the marketplace and to the American people.\n  We have done that before. We saw the longest expansion in America's \nhistory. Staring us in the face is the largest economic opportunity of \na lifetime. The energy marketplace is a $6 trillion market with 6 \nbillion potential users today, rising to about 9 billion over the next \n30 years. But we are not engaged in that. Two years ago, China produced \n5 percent of the world's solar panels. Today, they produce 60 percent, \nand the United States doesn't have one company in the top 10 companies \nof the world's solar panel producers. What are we doing? The biggest \ntransformational market staring the United States in the face is the \nenergy market, and we should be here putting an energy policy in place, \nan education policy in place, an infrastructure investment policy in \nplace, and a research policy for technology and medical that soars, \nthat takes America into the future, creates the jobs we need for the \nnext generations, and reduces the deficit in responsible ways, not in \nthis unbelievable reckless, meat axe, hatchet budget that is being \npresented to us by the House of Representatives. We need to find common \nground.\n  The minority continues to criticize President Obama about the lack of \nprogress in creating jobs. Last month, the economy added 192,000 jobs \nand the unemployment rate declined from 9 percent to 8.9 percent. This \nis one of the best job reports since the recession began more than 3 \nyears ago. It shows that the economic recovery is beginning to gain \nmomentum. However the unemployment rate is still too high and we need \nboth small and big businesses to increase jobs if we are going to see a \nmeaningful decrease in unemployment. The House continuing resolution \nwill make that more difficult.\n  Republican economist Mark Zandi says that now is not the time to \nimplement the cuts included in the House continuing resolution. In a \nrecent report, Zandi said. ``The economy is adding between 100,000 and \n150,000 per month--but it must add closer to 200,000 jobs per month \nbefore we can say the economy is truly expanding again. Imposing \nadditional government spending cuts before this has happened, as House \nRepublicans want, would be taking an unnecessary chance with the \nrecovery.''\n  Zandi estimates that the cuts included in the Republican continuing \nresolution would lead to 700,000 fewer jobs by the end of 2012. Federal \nReserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said last week that the Republican \ncontinuing resolution would reduce growth and cost our economy about a \ncouple hundred thousand jobs.\n  Last month, a Goldman Sachs economist warned that the Republican cuts \ncould reduce economic growth in the United States by 1.5 to 2 \npercentage points this year.\n  Additional spending cuts would also go against the thrust of our \neconomic policies. The Federal Reserve is holding short-term interest \nrates close to zero and purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars in \nlong-term Treasury bonds, in an effort to hold down long-term interest \nrates. The tax cut agreement we made last year is also helping to \ncreate jobs and boost our economy. It doesn't raise taxes, includes a 2 \npercent payroll tax holiday, extends emergency unemployment insurance \nbenefits and allows businesses to expense their investments this year.\n  The American people deserve better than the approach taken by the \nHouse of Representatives that cuts critically needed research funding, \neliminates jobs and reduce economic growth, hurts our competitiveness \nand could push our economy into a ``double dip'' recession.\n  There is a better way for us to resolve our budget problems. Let's go \nback to what worked before and can work again if we are willing to bite \nthe bullet. In the early 1990s, our economy was faltering because \ndeficits and debt were freezing capital. We had to send a signal to the \nmarket that we were capable of being fiscally responsible. We did just \nthat and as result we saw the longest economic expansion in history, \ncreated more than 22 million jobs, and generated unprecedented wealth \nin America, with every income bracket rising. But we did it by making \ntough choices.\n  Now is the moment for America to reach for the brass energy ring--to \ngo for the Moon here on Earth by building our new energy future--and, \nin doing so, create millions of steady, higher paying jobs at every \nlevel of the economy. Make no mistake: Jobs that produce energy in \nAmerica are jobs that stay in America. The amount of work to be done \nhere is just stunning. It is the work of many lifetimes. And it must \nbegin now. This shouldn't be a partisan issue, but instead of coming \ntogether to meet the defining test of a new energy economy and our \nfuture.\n  There is a bipartisan consensus just waiting to lift our country and \nour future if Senators are willing to sit down and forge it and make it \nreal. The President's fiscal commission made very clear that our budget \ncannot be balanced by cutting spending alone. The American people \ndeserve a serious dialogue and adult conversation within the Congress \nabout our fiscal situation, discretionary spending, entitlements, and \nrevenues. We need to work together in a bipartisan process to develop a \nlong-term solution to reduce both our current budget deficit and our \nstaggering debt. And, yes, we will need to reduce Federal spending and \nmake appropriate changes to our entitlement programs to meet the fiscal \nchallenges facing our country. But everything everything--tax reform, \nspending and entitlements--needs to be on the table.\n  Mr. President, this is one of the moments the Senate was intended to \nlive up to to provide leadership. To find common ground. To level with \nthe American people and be honest with each other. We will no doubt \ncontinue to be frustrated and angry from time to time, but I believe \nthat more often than not, we can rise to the common ground of great \nnational purpose. A lot of us like to talk about American \nexceptionalism. But now we need to get beyond the permanent campaign \nand the ideological agenda--and instead do the exceptional things that \nwill keep America exceptional for generations to come.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, American ingenuity and innovation have been \na cornerstone of the American economy from the time Thomas Jefferson \nexamined the first patent to today. The Founders recognized the \nimportance of promoting innovation. The Constitution explicitly grants \nCongress the\n\n[[Page S1349]]\n\npower to ``promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing \nfor limited times to inventors the exclusive rights to their respective \ndiscoveries.''\n  The discoveries made by American inventors and research institutions, \ncommercialized by American companies and protected and promoted by \nAmerican patent laws, have made our system the envy of the world.\n  The Senate has before it the America Invents Act. This will keep \nAmerica in its longstanding position at the pinnacle of innovation. \nThis bill will establish a more efficient and streamlined patent system \nthat will improve patent quality and limit unnecessary and \ncounterproductive litigation costs, while making sure no party's access \nto court is denied.\n  I was glad to see the overwhelming bipartisan vote in favor of ending \ndebate and invoking cloture that was cast yesterday. Yesterday was one \nof the rare instances ever in Vermont where snow impeded us and made it \nimpossible for us to get back. I am delighted to be back here for what \nI hope will be the successful conclusion and vote on our legislation.\n  This is, after all, the product of eight hearings over the last three \nCongresses, hundreds of meetings, and dozens of briefings. I again \nthank Secretary Locke and PTO Director Kappos for their involvement, \ntheir wise counsel and their support.\n  Last Congress, I introduced the Patent Reform Act of 2009 as a \nprecursor to the America Invents Act today, along with Senator Hatch \nand others, and our bill was the subject of consideration and \namendments over several thoughtful sessions of markups in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in March and April of 2009. At that time, Senator \nKyl asked that I convene a meeting with the Director of the Patent and \nTrademark Office to discuss whether there were further changes the \noffice needed in the legislation to improve the office's efficiency. We \nheld those discussions, and we held countless other meetings and \nbriefings with interested parties in an effort to improve the \nlegislation, again on a bipartisan basis. Bruce Cohen in my office, \nAaron Cooper, Ed Pagano and others, had meeting after meeting just as \npredecessors of theirs had. In short, we spent a whole lot of time \nmaking sure this was done right and we did it in a bipartisan manner. \nBolstering the American economic recovery and strengthening our efforts \nin global competition should not be matters of partisanship or \npolitical advantage.\n  The process of discussions, debates and deliberation has resulted in \nlegislation that is going to be a much-needed boon to our economy. It \nis also a model for our legislative process. It shows what you can do \nwhen you set aside partisan rhetoric and instead negotiate and \ncollaborate together in good faith.\n  I know I speak for Senator Kohl, Senator Whitehouse, Senator \nKlobuchar, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Coons and the other Democratic \ncosponsors of the bill when I thank the four senior Republican members \nof the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, Senator \nKyl and Senator Sessions for working with us. Innovation and economic \ndevelopment are not uniquely Democrat or Republican objectives, so we \nworked together to find the proper balance for America--for our \neconomy, for our inventors, for our consumers. It is both a process and \na result that should make us all proud.\n  The last time Congress significantly updated the patent system was \nmore than a half century ago. In the intervening decades, our economy \nhas changed dramatically. A patent system developed in our 1952 economy \nbefore the Internet, before cell phones, before computers, before \nphotocopiers, even before the IBM Selectric typewriter, needs to be \nreconsidered in light of 21st century realities, while staying true to \nthe consistent constitutional imperative of encouraging innovation and \ninvention.\n  Our patent laws that were the envy of the world in the 20th century \ndesperately need to be updated if we are going to compete effectively \nand win the future. China and the European Union are improving their \npatent laws. We can't remain complacent. If we are going to win the \nglobal competition by out-innovating the rest of the world, we need a \npatent system that works in the 21st century.\n  The array of voices heard in this debate represent virtually all \nsectors of our economy, all interests in the patent system. They have \nnot been uniform, as expected, but they know the legislative process is \none of compromise and accommodation where possible, and it has been \nthat way during the 6 years we have been at work on this bill. Three \nmajor areas of concern emerge from this discussion. The America Invents \nAct addresses each one of them.\n\n  First, there is significant concern about delays in the patent \napplication process. The Patent and Trademark Office, PTO, currently \nhas a backlog of more than 700,000 unexamined patent applications. \nThere are several reasons for this, not the least of which is the PTO \nis overwhelmed with patent applications and doesn't have the resources \nnecessary to work through that backlog.\n  The Director of the PTO often says the next great invention that may \ndrive our economic growth may be waiting on the shelf, waiting to be \ngranted. Some estimate that each issued patent represents three to 10 \njobs. We can ill-afford to keep so many job-creating patents backlogged \nat the PTO. The America Invents Act authorizes the PTO to set its fees \nand ensures that the PTO will have access to those fees. We want the \nPTO to work through its backlog and be current. In his white board \npresentation on the need for patent reform this week, Austan Goolsbee, \nthe chair of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, illustrated \nthis point by noting that when Alexander Graham Bell applied for a \npatent that led to the telephone, it was granted in a month. The patent \nin 1974 that led to the cell phone took less than three years. The \naverage time this year for a patent to be processed is almost three \nyears and several thousand take far longer.\n  I want to commend Austan Goolsbee, the chairman of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers. His white board presentation this week on the \nimportance of patent reform shows we need to help America win global \ncompetition and create jobs. The creation of more than 220,000 jobs in \nthe private sector last month, the creation of 1.5 million jobs over \nthe last 12 months, and the unemployment rate finally being reduced to \n8.9 percent are all signs that the efforts we have made over the last \ntwo years to stave off the worst recession since the Great Depression \nare paying off and the economic recovery is taking hold. The almost \nfull percent point drop in the unemployment rate over the last three \nmonths is the largest decline in unemployment since 1983. Despite \ninterruptions of economic activity in many parts of the country caused \nby winter weather over the last months and days, despite the \nextraordinary rise in oil prices, the Dow Jones industrial average has \nclimbed back to over 12,000 from a low point of 6,500. Passage of the \nAmerica Invents Act should help bolster our economic recovery and keep \nus on the right path toward business development and job creation.\n  According to an article in the New York Times just a couple of weeks \nago, patent applications last year amounted to 2,000 a day. There are \ncurrently 1.2 million patent applications in the pipeline. Among them \ncould be the next medical miracle, the next energy breakthrough, the \nnext leap in computing ability, or the next killer app. We should be \ndoing all we can to help the PTO Director. It makes no sense that it \ntakes 2 years for an inventor to get an initial ruling on his or her \npatent application and another year or more to receive a patent, this \nduring a time when technology changes sometimes by the hour, to say \nnothing by the year and the 2 year and 3 year. As the New York Times \nreporter Edward Wyatt notes: ``The delays and inefficiencies are more \nthan a nuisance for inventors . . . . [P]atent delays cost jobs, slow \nthe economy and threaten the ability of American companies to compete \nwith foreign businesses.''\n  Second, there is a concern about the quality of patents that have \nissued. Just as high quality patents are the key to innovation, low \nquality patents are a drag on the economy because they provide monopoly \nrents over products or processes that were not inventive.\n  Patent examiners are facing a difficult task given the explosion in \nthe\n\n[[Page S1350]]\n\nnumber of applications and the increasing complexity of those \napplications. When Congress last overhauled the patent system in 1952, \nthe PTO received approximately 60,000 patent applications; in 2009, it \nreceived more than 480,000.\n  The America Invents Act will improve the quality of patents issued by \nthe PTO in several ways. At the outset, our legislation makes the \ncommonsense change that third parties who see a patent application and \nknow that it is not novel and nonobvious, can assist the PTO examiners \nby providing relevant information and explaining its relevance.\n  The bill will also create a new post-grant review process for patents \nthat recently issued to improve the quality of patents in the system, \nas recommended by the National Academy of Sciences, and it will \nstreamline the current ``inter partes'' system so that it will be a \nmore efficient alternative to litigation.\n  The third concern is that as business competition has gone global, \nand patent applicants are increasingly filing applications in the \nUnited States and other countries for protection of their inventions, \nour system puts American inventors and businesses at a disadvantage. \nThe filing system in the United States differs from that in other \npatent-issuing jurisdictions, which have ``first-inventor-to-file'' \nsystems. The difference causes confusion and inefficiencies for \nAmerican companies and innovators. The inefficiencies exist both in the \napplication process and in determining what counts as ``prior art'' in \nlitigation. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an \neditorial from today's New York Times, which calls the transition to \nfirst-inventor-to-file ``simpler and cheaper'' and says it ``should \nbenefit the little guy.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. The America Invents Act transitions to a first-inventor-\nto-file process, as recommended by the administration, while retaining \nthe important grace period that will protect universities and small \ninventors, in particular. We debated this change at some length in \nconnection with the Feinstein amendment. That amendment was rejected by \nthe Senate by a vote of 87 to 13. The Senate has come down firmly and \ndecisively in favor of modernizing and harmonizing the American patent \nsystem with the rest of the world.\n  When we began the patent reform debate 6 years ago, there was also a \nsignificant concern that the costs and uncertainty associated with \npatent litigation had been escalating, which was resulting in a drag on \ninnovation. Damage awards had been inconsistent and not always related \nto the value of the invention. This disconnect and uncertainty was a \nproblem that also led to unreasonable posturing during licensing \nnegotiations.\n  Fortunately, the courts have made great strides in addressing this \nissue, and there is general consensus that legislation need not and, in \nfact, should not affect the law of damages as a result.\n  The Senate has before it bipartisan legislation that can lead to \nlong-needed improvements in our patent laws and system. This is a \nmeasure that can help facilitate invention, innovation and job \ncreation, and do so in the private sector. This can help everyone from \nstartups and small businesses to our largest, cutting edge companies.\n  The America Invents Act promotes innovation, and will improve our \neconomy, by addressing the impediments to innovation. As the President \nchallenges Americans to win the future, Congress cannot afford to sit \nidly by while innovation--the engine of our economy--is impeded by \noutdated laws. Our legislation leverages the ingenuity of our \nbusinesses, our universities, and our independent inventors, and \ncreates a system in which that ingenuity can improve our economy. It \nwill create jobs, improve products and reduce costs for American \ncompanies and American consumers.\n  I began working on patent reform years ago, along with Chairman Smith \nin the House, because of my belief that we needed a more efficient and \nstreamlined system. For many years, patent law interested only a niche \naudience, and developments were reported only in trade publications. \nNow they are discussed everywhere from the front page of the Wall \nStreet Journal to the New York Times, and all three branches of \ngovernment have taken an active role.\n  The America Invents Act is about economic development. It is about \njobs; it is about innovation; it is about consumers. All benefit under \na patent system that reduces unnecessary costs, removes inefficiencies, \nand holds true to the vision of our Founders that Congress should \nestablish a national policy that promotes the progress of science and \nthe useful arts.\n  When Thomas Jefferson examined that first patent in 1790--a patent \nthat went to a Vermonter--no one could have predicted how the American \neconomy would develop and what changes would be needed for the law to \nkeep pace, but the purpose then remains the purpose today: promoting \nprogress.\n  If we are to maintain our position at the forefront of the world's \neconomy, if we are to continue to lead the globe in innovation and \nproduction, if we are to continue to enjoy the fruits of the most \ncreative citizens, then we must have a patent system that produces high \nquality patents, that limits counterproductive litigation over those \npatents, and that makes the entire system more streamlined and \nefficient.\n  Now is the time to bolster our role as the world leader in \ninnovation. Now is the time to create jobs at home. Now is the time for \nCongress to act on patent reform. I urge all Senators to support the \nAmerican Invents Act.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 7, 2011]\n\n                   Patents, Reform and the Little Guy\n\n       In the last decade, Congress has missed several chances to \n     reform a patent system that is slow, costly and puts the \n     United States at odds with the rest of the industrial world. \n     On Wednesday, the Senate has another opportunity to reform \n     the nation's patent law.\n       The America Invents Act offers a step toward a more \n     effective and transparent patent protection system. This \n     should encourage investment in inventions and faster \n     diffusion of ideas. The bill, which has broad bipartisan \n     support, would boost the patent office's resources by letting \n     it keep all the fees it collects. This would enable it to \n     speed up the review of patent applications--which currently \n     takes almost three years to process--and work through an \n     immense backlog of 715,000 applications.\n       The bill should reduce costly litigation by creating an in-\n     house system to look into claims of patent infringement \n     before they go to court.\n       The bill would also replace the first-to-invent standard \n     prevailing in the United States--which grants formal \n     protection to the creator of an innovation--with the first-\n     inventor-to-file system used in most nations.\n       This change would make it cheaper for American patent \n     holders to get patent protection around the world. But it has \n     been met with vocal opposition from some groups of small \n     businesses and inventors who claim the change would benefit \n     big corporations at their expense.\n       We disagree. The new law would make the process simpler and \n     cheaper. That should benefit the little guy.\n       Small inventors who needed time and money to fully develop \n     and test their ideas could request a provisional patent until \n     they were ready for a full filing. It costs $110. And because \n     it is easy to determine who filed a patent first, the new \n     system would better protect small inventors from challenges \n     by corporations with deep pockets, reducing the chance of \n     costly litigation.\n       Right now, proving who invented something first is \n     difficult and expensive. According to the patent office, it \n     costs $400,000 to $500,000 to challenge a patent on the \n     grounds of a prior invention. Most small inventors don't have \n     that kind of money. Big corporations do.\n       In fact, the current system mostly protects whoever files \n     first for a patent. Of the last three million applications \n     filed, only 113 were granted to entities who filed second but \n     proved they had invented first. In 88 of these cases, the \n     winners were large corporations.\n       The patent system is too cumbersome, and it doesn't protect \n     the small inventor. The America Invents Act is a smart \n     reform.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the debate \nthat has been going on in the Chamber about spending proposals and how \nwe get through the balance of this current fiscal year and ensure that \nwe do not\n\n[[Page S1351]]\n\nend up with a government shutdown and some of the repercussions that \nwill come about from that.\n  I am blessed to represent a State that has not only a \ndisproportionate share of Federal employees but also has a large number \nof private sector employees who rely upon predictability from the \ngovernment. Unfortunately, with these lurchings from 2-week extensions, \nwe are not providing that kind of predictability.\n  As you know, I strongly believe this is a moment in time for this \nbody, colleagues in the House, and the President and others to come \ntogether regarding the question of how we no longer simply look at our \ndebt and deficit on a piecemeal basis but we actually take on this \nissue on a comprehensive basis as so many, both elected officials and \nfinancial officials, continue to suggest. That came in earlier today in \ntestimony from former Senator Alan Simpson and former Presidential \nChief of Staff Erskine Bowles about the consequences of our failure to \nact if we do not get our comprehensive deficit and debt under control. \nIt is a problem that is not going to get easier. Every day we fail to \nact we add $4 billion to our national debt.\n  Unfortunately, some of the proposals that are coming, particularly \nfrom the House at this point, the House budget plan, do nothing \nsignificant to address our long-term deficit and debt issues.\n  I travel around Virginia. Yesterday I was down with our colleague \nfrom Georgia, Senator Chambliss. We met with literally hundreds of \nbusiness leaders from across central Virginia, and their message was \nclear: No more games, no more showmanship, get something done. That \n``something'' they want done is a comprehensive approach to our \nNation's fiscal challenges. That will mean, yes, cutting down on \nspending. That will mean, as well, making our Tax Code more efficient \nso American business can grow and compete.\n  It will also mean at the same time that part of that tax reform \neffort adds revenues because trying to deal with this problem by simply \ncutting or simply taxing will not be sufficient. Instead, the folks \nacross Virginia, and I imagine across Montana as well, are saying: This \nis a moment in time we have to put everything on the table, and we have \nto ensure we actually provide a long-term solution.\n  One of the things that has been most frustrating as I listened to \nthis current debate about CRs and what we are going to do for the \nbalance of this fiscal year is that the debate has focused almost \nentirely, the spending cuts proposed from the House, on domestic \ndiscretionary spending. The $60-plus billion the House has celebrated \nall comes from that one narrow slice of the pie. Domestic discretionary \nspending accounts for less than 12 percent of our Federal spending. We \ncannot solve the $1.5 trillion current-year deficit or the over $14 \ntrillion long-term debt without going beyond that 12 percent of our \nbudget.\n  What should be particularly challenging to our colleagues is that \nevery day we fail to act, we are seeing not only our debt grow, but we \nare seeing the amount of taxpayer dollars that we have to spend to pay \noff current interest rates--current interest payments continuing to \nrise. As a matter of fact, it is expected at some point over the next 3 \nor 4 years the amount that we pay out of every dollar collected, simply \non interest, will exceed the 12 percent of our current domestic \ndiscretionary spending. So all of these current fights about these \ncurrent cuts that are being proposed, all will be subsumed in interest \npayments we will all have to make as Americans; dollars that, quite \ncandidly, do not go to build another school, to make another \ninvestment, to build another road; dollars that are not recycled in \nthis country but increasingly are owned by folks abroad, increasingly \nby our bankers in Asia and a disproportionate number from China.\n  When we have the chance to vote on H.R. 1 this afternoon, I will be \nvoting no. I will be voting no because I think this narrow focus on \ndomestic discretionary spending only for cuts will not get us to the \npoint we need to be in terms of long-term deficit reduction.\n  Let me again point out where I think the House proposal is so \nshortsighted. One of the things that Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson \nsaid today: There is no silver bullet in this challenge we have in \nfront of us. It is going to take significant spending cuts. It is going \nto take looking at the revenue side through the aspects of tax reform. \nBut those two things, revenues and spending alone, still will not get \nus out of this problem. We have to get a third leg on the triangle, and \nthe third leg on the triangle is a growing economy. How do we grow an \neconomy in a place where America, while still the world's leading \neconomy, does not drive the economy the way it did even 20 years ago?\n  We saw 20 years ago where the world would have to wait on America to \nget its financial act together. The world is not waiting now--China, \nIndia, Brazil, countries abroad are moving ahead. If we are going to \nremain competitive, we have to continue to invest smartly.\n  The President said we have to make sure we educate, we have to invest \nin our infrastructure, and we have to be able to out-innovate. That \nmeans targeted research and development. Unfortunately, the House \nproposal, which not only focuses on domestic discretionary to the \nexclusion of other areas of spending but also focuses these cuts on the \nremaining 6 or 7 months of our fiscal year, takes a disproportionate \nwhack out of these key areas where we must maintain certain levels of \ninvestment if we are going to grow the economy to make sure the other \ncuts and other revenue raisers won't have to be as Draconian.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. I know the Presiding Officer comes \nfrom an energy-rich State. He also realizes we have to diversify our \nenergy mix in this country and no longer be dependent upon foreign oil. \nOne of the things that those of us who have hallowed the benefits of \nthe Internet over the last 20-plus years are quick to point out is that \nthe Internet came about because of initial government investment \nthrough ARPA. That led to the development of the networks that created \nthe Internet that have spawned tremendous economic growth in this \ncountry.\n  I believe, and I think many of our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle believe, that we need a similar investment in the energy field. \nThat was created, the RPE Program, at the Department of Energy. If we \nmove forward with the House budget proposal, that will cut $1 billion \nout of the kind of basic research we need to make sure we have a full \nportfolio of domestic energy sources, renewable energy sources. I, for \none, believe it also has to include conservation, nuclear, increased--\ncontinued domestic oil and gas, coal--all these have to be part of the \nmix. But we have to do it in a smarter and cleaner way. Right now, at \nthis point, to cut $1 billion out of that kind of basic next generation \nresearch and development, the same kind of research and development \nthat in the IT field created the Internet, would be shortsighted. I \nthink that is true in the minds of most business folks.\n  We have to get our health care costs under control. Part of getting \nour health care costs under control means continuing to unlock \ninnovation. Perhaps one of the greatest growth fields of the next 20 \nyears, and something I know the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has \nbeen working on in terms of his patent reform, is making sure in the \nlife sciences area America continues to lead in terms of innovation.\n  Well, where does that innovation come from in terms of government \ndollars being leveraged four, five, six times? That comes from an \ninvestment in NIH. Unfortunately, the House budget proposal cuts $1.3 \nbillion from NIH funding. Well, if you are in stage 2 or stage 3 of the \nnext-generation cancer development drug, to have those kind of trials \ncut back, to have that kind of basic research cut back, not only in \nterms of American economic growth but the personal toll it could take \non folks who are desperately waiting for solutions to a disease, I \nbelieve, is again not a good policy choice at this moment.\n  As we move forward as well, we have to make sure we outeducate our \ncompetitors. No one believes America's future is going to be based on \nlow-wage labor; it is going to be based on a well-educated, innovative, \nand well-trained workforce.\n  I think one of the areas this President has not gotten the \nappropriate\n\n[[Page S1352]]\n\ncredit for is the fact that he has advanced forward dramatic education \nreform within his proposals. Unfortunately, the House bill will cut $5 \nbillion from the Department of Education and over $1 billion from the \nHead Start Program.\n  When we are trying to look at our kids competing against kids from \nIndia and China, does it make sense, if we are going to grow our \neconomy, to slash education programs, if we are going to have that \nwell-trained workforce?\n  So I do believe the House proposal is shortsighted. I believe it does \nnot do anything to take on the structural deficit our country is \nfacing. I will continue to work with the Presiding Officer and I think \na growing number of Members from both sides of the aisle. Our \nsuggestion is to go ahead and take the good work that was put forward \nby the Presidential debt and deficit commission as at least a starting \npoint and put in place as consequences if we do not act; that we will \nnot solve this issue--which, I believe, is the issue of the day, which \nas Chairman Mike Mullin said is the No. 1 national security issue for \nthis country, to get our deficit and debt under control--unless we can \nbroaden this debate from the 12 percent of domestic discretionary to \ninclude, yes, defense spending, entitlement spending, tax reform, \ntrying to make sure everything is on the table.\n  The House approach does not do that. The House approach is \nshortsighted. The House approach will not allow us to grow our economy \nin a way we need. I will be voting against that proposal when it comes \nto the floor. But I look forward to working again with all my \ncolleagues to make sure we get a true comprehensive deficit and debt \nreduction plan that this Congress can vote on and put into action.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I wished to rise to speak on \nthe legislation that is currently before the Senate, the America \nInvents Act of 2011. I wish to applaud the work of Judiciary Committee \nChairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley for working so hard to bring \nthis complex, bipartisan legislation to the Senate floor.\n  As we work to rebuild our economy, get Americans back to work, and \nwin the global economic race, we should all appreciate this effort to \nspur innovation and create jobs. Patent reform is an important issue \nfor Colorado's economy and, of course, our national economy. High-tech \ninnovators represent over 12,000 jobs in Colorado, and they are an \nimportant part of our economic recovery.\n  In addition, Colorado has a vibrant biotech, clean energy, and \naerospace set of industries. That is why I believe getting patent \nreform right and achieving consensus on provisions such as inter partes \nreexamination is so important.\n  Inter partes reexamines a proceeding at the Patent Office that allows \nfor the validity of a patent to be challenged in an administrative \nproceeding. These proceedings are intended to serve as a less-expensive \nalternative to courtroom litigation and provide additional access to \nthe expertise of the Patent Office on questions of patentability.\n  Inter partes reexam is often the preferred method of examination \nbecause a panel of experts is more likely to reach the correct decision \non a technical question compared to a jury composed of laypeople. The \ninter partes process is not frequently used today because of procedural \nrestrictions in the existing law. Rather than expanding the \nopportunities to use the inter partes reexamination process, the \nAmerica Invents Act before us today imposes standards that are more \nrestrictive than current law and are not supported by top high-tech \ninnovators.\n  We need a patent reform bill that is fair to America's innovative \ntechnology companies and all users of the patent system.\n  By failing to provide any relief from the huge burden abusive patent \nlawsuits impose on technology companies and instead reducing the \nprotections in current law, I fear this legislation will force these \ncompanies to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on frivolous \nlawsuits. These are dollars that otherwise would be used to employ \nengineers, produce and market new goods and services, and help Colorado \nand America win the global economic race.\n  As this legislation moves to the House, we must work to achieve \nconsensus on inter partes reexamination. While I do not believe we have \nthe right balance quite yet, I do believe this bill is a good faith \neffort to improve our patent system, and I am going to support moving \nit forward because we cannot let job-creating patents languish any \nlonger.\n  As we all know, the Patent Office has an enormous backlog of nearly \n700,000 applications, in addition to a half million new applications \nevery year. Each of these pending applications will create on average 3 \nto 10 jobs. But while these applications collect dust in America, other \ncountries are getting a head start on technologies that can \nrevolutionize the way we live. I am very pleased the America Invents \nAct will address the funding challenges faced by the Patent Office. \nThis legislation will allow the Director of the Patent Office to set \nfees as necessary, but it will also ensure that those fees stay at the \nPatent Office--all without any cost to taxpayers. This legislation will \nallow the Director to finally clear the backlog and create needed jobs \nthrough innovation. It is my hope that the funding provisions in the \nAmerica Invents Act stay in this legislation as it moves to the House.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation includes an amendment I \ncosponsored with Senator Bennet to establish additional satellite \npatent offices around the country. It is no secret that we believe \nColorado is well situated to house a regional satellite patent office \nbecause of the combination of our rich and diverse innovative economy, \nour strong research universities and the fact that Colorado is a great \nplace to live. I am confident that Colorado will be competitive in the \nprocess of selecting these new satellite patent offices.\n  In the end, I believe the America Invents Act goes a long way to help \nunleash America's innovative spirit, but we need to make sure that we \ndon't make changes that could have unintended consequences for some of \nour most innovative companies. Let's get patent reform right. Let's \nmove it forward, and let's continue working to make our patent system \nfair, efficient and supportive of innovators as we seek to compete in \nthe global economy.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his attention and interest in his \nown State of Montana.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1352-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take this time to talk about the budget \ndeficit and what we need to do in order to\n\n[[Page S1353]]\n\nbring our budget into balance to have a credible plan to deal with our \nfuture growth in this Nation.\n  I start off by saying the budget deficit is an extremely serious \nissue for this Nation. We do not have a sustainable budget. You cannot \nsustain a budget that creates debt at 10 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct and a gross debt that equals 100 percent of our GDP. We need to \nbring down our deficit in order to have the type of economic growth \nthat our children and grandchildren will be able to enjoy a better \neconomic circumstance than this generation.\n  First, before we talk about where we need to go, we have to \nunderstand how we got here. I am not going to harp on this, but I wish \nto make sure the people of Maryland and the Nation know how we got to \nthese large deficits so we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.\n  During President Clinton's administration, we balanced the budget. I \nmight say, we did that--the Democrats did it--without a single vote \nfrom the Republicans. We were on course to retire all of our debt, and \nthat was just 10 years ago.\n  Then, under President Bush, we cut taxes twice without paying for it. \nWe went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan and did not pay for it. To date, \nthe war in Iraq has cost $770 billion. That is money we had to borrow \nin order to fight that war in Iraq.\n  We had chosen, under the previous administration, that it was more \nimportant to cut taxes than it was to balance the budget, and that was \na mistake. President Obama inherited a huge deficit and an economy that \nwas hemorrhaging 700,000 jobs a month.\n  Well, it is time now to move forward. We have turned our economy \naround. It is growing, but we need to do it in a way that does not \njeopardize our economic recovery. But it is absolutely essential we \nstart to move our budget back into balance and we take aggressive steps \nto do it.\n  Today, in the Budget Committee, we heard from Erskine Bowles and \nSenator Simpson from the debt commission, and I think we were all \nimpressed. If we are going to get a credible plan--which is critically \nimportant for our Nation--to balance the budget, we need to follow the \nexample of the debt commission. It does not mean we have to agree to \neverything the debt commission did. But the debt commission recognized \nwe could not balance the Federal budget by cutting discretionary \ndomestic spending alone; that we need a game plan which brings all the \nmajor components of the budget together: discretionary domestic \nspending, military spending; we need to deal with entitlements, and we \nneed to deal with revenues. We are only going to get this done if \nDemocrats and Republicans work together for a credible plan. That is \nwhat we need to do in order to bring back our economy.\n  The only specific proposal we have had come over from the House of \nRepresentatives to date--H.R. 1, their budget--I believe does not \nfollow the example of the debt commission. I believe it is extremely \nharmful to the process of trying to work out a plan where we have a \ncredible effort to balance the budget with shared sacrifice because the \nHouse-passed budget, the Republican budget in the House, gets all its \nsavings from 12 percent of the Federal budget, from discretionary \ndomestic spending, and it jeopardizes our recovery. Mark Zandi, the \neconomist from Moody's, said we would lose 700,000 jobs if the House-\npassed Republican budget were enacted into law.\n  Let me give you some examples as to how it would affect the people of \nMaryland if the House budget became law.\n  First, let me talk a little bit about some of the budget cuts \nthemselves.\n  About 10 days ago, I was at the Greater Baden Health Center in Prince \nGeorge's County, MD. They are expanding that health center to include \nprenatal care. The reason, quite frankly, is that the infant mortality \nrate in Maryland is way too high. We rank 29th in the Nation. That is \nunacceptable. In the African-American community, the infant mortality \nrate is 260 percent of that of the White community. The problem is, we \nhave too many low birthweight babies. Some die and become part of the \ninfant mortality statistics. Others survive and have complications \nthroughout their lives.\n  It is in our interest, from every perspective, to bring down that \ninfant mortality rate and to provide prenatal care for women so we have \nhealthier babies. I hope we would all agree to that. We are doing \nsomething about that in Maryland, using moneys that were a part of the \nAffordable Care Act. The Republican budget would eliminate that \nfunding. That community would not be able to expand with prenatal care \nto do something about the health of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, 2,900 community health workers would lose their jobs \nin Maryland--2,900 community health workers would lose their jobs in \nMaryland--if the House-passed budget, H.R. 1, became law.\n  I have taken the floor on several occasions, and a little earlier \ntoday, to talk about the Chesapeake Bay and the Federal partnership. We \nhave had a Federal partnership in cleaning up the bay. It is the \nlargest estuary in North America. It is a body of global significance, \nand it is in danger because too many pollutants are entering the bay as \na result of population growth, development, and farming practices.\n  Well, we have a game plan to do something about it. But the budget \nthat passed the House would cut the Chesapeake Bay program \ndramatically--$25 million--making it extremely difficult for us to move \nforward on our remedial efforts. Making it even worse, there is an \nenvironmental rider that was put on H.R. 1 that says none of the funds \nmade available under this act may be used to implement the bay \nrestoration plan now underway.\n  What does that mean? It means each one of the States that are in the \nwatershed of the Chesapeake Bay--the States of Maryland; Virginia, the \nPresiding Officer's State; Delaware; New York; Pennsylvania; West \nVirginia; and the District of Columbia--they all rely on improving \ntheir wastewater treatment facility plants in order to reduce the \npollutants going into the bay under the State revolving fund. Well, if \nthat rider became law, the States could not participate in that \nprogram. They would not be able to implement one of the major features \nof their plan in order to reduce the pollutants going into the bay to \nmake it a cleaner body of water.\n  I could talk about the watershed grants that go to schools and civic \nassociations--eliminated under the Republican budget--or I could talk \nabout how the State gets money to operate its water funds--eliminated \nunder the House-passed budget.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency sees their budget reduced by over \n30 percent. Plus, there are additional environmental riders that make \nit very difficult for the Environmental Protection Agency to protect \nthe environment.\n  In Maryland, we would lose $150 million toward the Federal \nGovernment's commitment to the Washington Metro system. This affects \nthe entire area, including Virginia and the District. This is the \nNation's Metro system that allows the Federal workforce to get to work. \nWe entered into a 10-year commitment with the local jurisdictions, \nincluding Maryland, Virginia, and the District, that the Federal \nGovernment would be a partner--$150 million a year--toward those costs. \nThe House budget eliminates those transit funds.\n  The Republican House budget would cut Head Start by $1.1 billion. Mr. \nPresident, 157,000 children would be affected, 2,300 in the State of \nMaryland--2,300. These are children who are getting a better start in \nlife because of this program, and the budget passed in the House, H.R. \n1, would eliminate those services for so many of our children.\n  Pell grants, to allow families to be able to afford a college \neducation, are reduced by $5.7 billion. It affects 9.4 million \nstudents. What does it mean for the people of Maryland? It means those \nwho have Pell grants today could see their grants go down by as much as \n$650. I can tell you, there are many families in Maryland who cannot \nafford that extra $650. Without a college education today, it is \ndifficult to be able to be as competitive as you need to be in order to \ntake advantage of our economic opportunities.\n  The WIC Program that helps women and infants and children is cut by \n10 percent under the House-passed budget. NIH funding is down $1 \nbillion.\n  Research--and not just at NIH, located in Maryland, but also at Johns \nHopkins University and the University of Maryland Medical Center--would \nbe\n\n[[Page S1354]]\n\ndisrupted if the Republican-passed budget, H.R. 1, were to become law.\n  Our challenge, as President Obama said in the State of the Union \nAddress, is that we have to outeducate, outinnovate, and outbuild our \ncompetitors so that America will be able to compete in the 21st century \nglobally. That is our challenge. H.R. 1, the Republican budget, doesn't \nallow us to do that. There is a better way of doing it, and, as the \nPresident said, we need to do it in a fiscally responsible way. How do \nwe do that?\n  We need a credible plan to balance the Federal budget--a credible \nplan that will bring in more deficit reduction than H.R. 1, the \nRepublican budget, because you need to allow America to grow, yet move \ntoward a balanced budget. The only way is to include all sectors, not \njust discretionary domestic spending. You need to include military \nspending, you need to deal with entitlements, and you need to deal with \nrevenues. President Obama's budget starts us down that path by freezing \ndiscretionary domestic spending over 5 years. We have already gone \nfurther than that in the continuing resolution we have passed. We are \ngoing to go back to 2010 numbers or even below that.\n  We have already put on the table dramatic reductions in the growth \nrate of discretionary domestic spending, but we need to include \ndefense. Iraq and Afghanistan need to come to an end; those savings \nwill be dramatic. America cannot continue to have a growth economy \nwhere we spend so much more than any other nation on our national \ndefense. We have to protect the people in this Nation, but we cannot \ntake on the burdens of the world. There have to be adequate burdens \namong our allies, which will bring savings to the U.S. taxpayer.\n  In entitlement spending, we need to bring down costs. We took a major \nstep forward in doing this in the Affordable Care Act. One of the areas \nin which I agree with some of our Republican friends who are \ncriticizing the CBO is that their numbers are off. We are going to get \nmore savings, not less, than what the CBO estimated.\n  I am convinced that when you deal with people in preventive health \ncare and use better information technology, when you manage people's \ndiseases, when you deal with readmissions so people understand what \nthey need to do to stay healthy, when you put all that together, when \nyou expand our community health centers, as I said earlier about what \nhappened at the Greater Baden center on prenatal care, when you do all \nthat, it will bring down the rate of health care costs.\n  America spends more than any other nation, any way you want to \ncalculate it, on health care. We don't have the health care results to \ndemonstrate that type of commitment. We can bring down the cost of \nhealth care, and when we do that, by implementing the Affordable Care \nAct and making sure we get those savings, we will bring down the \nMedicare costs and we will bring down the Medicaid costs, which will \nsave taxpayers even more under our entitlement spending. We can get \nthose savings.\n  By the way, we are going to save middle-income families in this \ncountry by also reducing their costs for health care. That is what we \nneed to do to make our economy stronger.\n  We can do something about entitlement spending, and there are other \nareas we need to look at. The farm subsidy programs need to be \nreviewed, and the debt commission made recommendations in that regard \nthat I think are worthy of our review.\n  Then there is revenue. Yes, I think we need to take a look at \nrevenues. Our current income tax structure cannot be justified, as has \nbeen pointed out frequently. We hemorrhage as much revenue in our Tax \nCode as we raise. If you eliminated all the special provisions, you \ncould cut the tax rates in half. Since we had tax reform in 1986, we \nhave added so many new loopholes and provisions and special interest \nprovisions in the Tax Code. In 1986, we attempted to lower the rates \nand make sure everybody paid their fair share. Well, it is now 2011, \nand we are out of balance, and we need to look at tax reform.\n  I urge, in looking at tax reform, that we should look at consumption-\nbased taxes. I know the criticisms of that, but I will start by saying \nthat if we had consumption-based taxes to deal with some of our income \ntax revenues, we would be more competitive internationally. If you are \nan export company and you are choosing whether to locate in America or \nin another country, you pay income taxes here that cannot be taken off \nthe price of your product when you put it in the international \nmarketplace. If you locate in another country that uses consumption \ntaxes at a higher level than we do--we don't use it at all--but a \nhigher level than our income taxes, that country will allow those \nexporters to take the tax off when they put their products into the \ninternational marketplace. That is acceptable under the World Trade \nOrganization, putting American producers at a disadvantage.\n  We need to save more as a nation. We have heard over and over the \npoint made that America, during the height of our economic progress, \nhad one of the lowest savings ratios in the world. We need to save more \nas a nation. Our Tax Code should encourage savings much more than it \ndoes today.\n  I want to make it clear that I am totally committed that in tax \nreform we should make our Tax Code more progressive. I don't believe it \nis progressive enough. Progressive means that it is based, at least in \npart, on the ability to pay. Wealthier people will pay a higher \npercentage of the tax than lower income people. Today, under our income \ntax system, many people do not have to pay income tax now. We can \ndesign a consumption tax, so they won't have to pay a consumption tax \nand there is no new tax burden. There are proposals out there that can \ntake more people off the tax rolls.\n  By the way, this is a zero-sum game on revenue. Let's decide how much \nwe need and then raise it in a cost-efficient way that will allow \nAmerica to grow.\n  That is the type of reform I hope we will be able to get. If we do, \nit will mean not only bringing our budget into balance by a credible \nplan that deals with discretionary domestic spending and military and \nentitlement and revenues but does it in a way that allows America to \ngrow by investing in our future--in education, in energy, in our \ntransportation infrastructure and transit and all those areas that we \nneed--so that we can meet the challenges of the future but do it in a \nway that is fiscally responsible.\n  How do we get this done? We get it done by coming together and \nlistening to each other. I don't think anybody here has a monopoly on \nwhat is right. For the sake of our Nation, let's listen to each other \nand try to get this done in a way where we have a credible plan. It has \nto be a credible plan. These are not Democratic or Republican or \nIndependent problems; these are American issues. We have to put our \nNation first.\n  I hope we will step back a little and listen to the debate and use \nthe debt commission as a model of civility. Again, I am sure we will \nhave different views on it, but at the end of the day, I hope we can \nachieve at least the deficit reduction of the commission. I think we \ncan. The people of Maryland and the country want us to do this. Working \ntogether, I think we can accomplish those goals.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I have been sitting in my office listening \nto news reports about the Congress and the President arguing about the \nbudget and the debate about what we are going to cut. It is interesting \nto think back over the last couple of years, because it is hard to put \nthese things together. After 2 years of the largest expansion of \ngovernment, the biggest increase in debt in our history, now suddenly \nwe are debating what needs to be cut.\n  I think over the last couple of years as the President proposed a \nmassive spending plan--which we called a stimulus--and Republicans were \nsaying no, that is not the way to improve the economy. But the \nPresident insisted it would keep unemployment below 8 percent and get \nour economy going again.\n\n[[Page S1355]]\n\nRepublicans said no. We were accused of being the party of no. As it \nturns out, we were right.\n  Then it wasn't too long until the President insisted we needed \nessentially a national takeover of our health care system, and this, he \npromised, would lower the cost of health insurance. Republicans said \nno, what we need is more freedom for patients and physicians to work \ntogether, and more transparency, more competitiveness in the market. \nThe President said no, that his way of nationalizing health care was \nbetter. Republicans were again called the party of no for saying that \nwas not the way to go. But as it turns out, we were right. Insurance \npremiums are headed straight up. Even the New York Times today talked \nabout skyrocketing insurance premiums and less health care.\n  Well, it wasn't long after that until the President and our \nDemocratic majority wanted more national control of our whole banking \nsystem, with the financial reform that was supposed to loosen credit \nand help our economy get going again. But I have talked to too many \nbankers back home to believe that worked. Of course, Republicans said \nno, that wasn't the direction we needed to go. We were called the party \nof no. But as it turns out, we were right.\n  You might say we were the party of no, but you spell it K-N-O-W. We \nknew this centralization of power, of government control, was not going \nto stimulate our economy, that it was not going to improve our health \ncare system, and it wasn't going to improve our banking system. It was \nthe time to say no.\n  Last November, the American people decided it was time to say no. \nThey began to put a stop to what has been going on around here, and we \nknow what happened in the House and the elections over here. The \nAmerican people were pretty clear. They instinctively knew we couldn't \ncontinue to spend more than we were bringing in. They knew when you are \nborrowing 40 cents on every dollar you spend that sooner or later the \ncountry is going to be bankrupt.\n  But it is amazing that since that election, even with the changes \nhere, our colleagues on the other side the other day killed a proposal \nto balance the budget--a resolution that called for the balancing of \nthe budget. I think most Americans know if you are not willing to \nbalance your checkbook or balance your budget, sooner or later you are \ngoing to be bankrupt. I think that is what a lot of Americans are \nafraid of right now.\n  I think we have a different situation going on with our colleagues on \nthe other side. From Wisconsin to here in Washington, as we look at the \nbudget problems and the debate on how to cut spending at the Federal \nlevel, we have a party of no show. They are not showing up for the \ndebate in Wisconsin. The Democrats headed across the State line. And in \nthe budget debate, the President, who had pledged to do something about \nour spending and our deficits and go through the budget line by line, \ndidn't even produce a budget. And regarding the budget he proposed this \nyear--and promised that it would keep us living within our means--even \nthe most liberal commentator said this expands our debt nationally \nprobably more than $10 trillion over the next 10 years. We are over $14 \ntrillion in debt, we hit our debt ceiling within the next month or 2, \nand we are debating how much to cut.\n\n  I want to talk a little bit about this debate because it shows that \neven with the astounding election we had in November, very quickly \nCongress is back to business as usual. The deficit we are looking at \nthis year in America--this is just 1 year--is over $1.5 trillion. That \nis going to be on top of the $14 trillion that we are already \nexperiencing. The projections are that we will increase our debt over \nthe next 10 years another $1 trillion every year. Last month, in \nFebruary--which was a short month--over $220 billion of debt was \nincurred in that 1 month. That is a larger deficit than we have \nexperienced in most years our country has been around. It is crazy, \n$220 billion in 1 month.\n  We are facing $1.5 trillion this year. It is amazing how this place \ncan lower our expectations. Do you know what the debate is about right \nnow? The Republican House has proposed $61 billion in cuts against the \n$1.5 trillion. The Democrats have told us this is completely \nunacceptable; these are Draconian cuts. The President proposed around \n$6 billion. I think the Democratic leader is coming out with one that \nis about $4.5 billion, which some say is too much of a cut.\n  As we are looking at doubling this $14 trillion deficit over the next \n10 years or close to doubling it, and the hard decisions we have to \nmake about how to deal with Social Security and Medicare, the big \ndecisions about how we economize even in areas like our defense, how we \npossibly deal with this debt, we have a Congress now that instead of \naddressing the issue of $1.5 trillion is debating between $61 billion \nand $6 billion. These are fractional. You cannot even see the line \nhere, of what is being proposed by our Democratic colleagues.\n  I am afraid that President Obama and Democrats, like we see in \nWisconsin, are not showing up for this debate. Instead of proposing \nrealistic ways to tighten our belts at the Federal level and look at \nhow we can balance our checkbook, as so many Americans have to do every \nmonth in their homes, the President has decided to sit on the sidelines \nand criticize things that have to be trimmed or cut or changed.\n  It is amazing. The Democratic leader has called Republicans ``mean \nspirited'' because they are proposing to cut funding for a cowboy \npoetry festival. I love poetry and cowboys as much as anyone else, but \nwe are looking at bankrupting our Nation, destroying the future that \nwas given to us by our predecessors, and we cannot even get close to a \nrealistic debate on how we can stop this rampage toward bankruptcy in \nAmerica. There is not enough there. Even what the House Republicans \nhave done is not enough. I realize that politics is sometimes the art \nof the possible, but I am hoping it can become the promotion of the \nprinciples that make this country great and can secure our future.\n  We all have to decide today how we are going to vote. Obviously, this \n$6 billion is not a serious proposal by our Democratic colleagues. But \nI think those of us who realize we are up against a mountain of debt--\nhow do we deal with even the highest proposal now that is coming \nthrough Congress? My point is this: There are some hard decisions that \nhave to be made in Washington, some very hard decisions. There is a new \nreality that we have to face as a Congress. We have to tell the truth. \nAmericans just want the truth. They want fact-based budgeting. They \nwant us to do what we need to do to save our country. Obviously, no one \nwants anything that is coming to them to be cut, but I have talked to \ntoo many Americans who have said: Keep fighting. Do what has to be done \nto leave this country as good as we found it. I think that is a \nreasonable request for us to consider.\n  What we are doing is not even within the realm of reality of what has \nto be done to leave America better than we found it. This is not about \npartisan politics anymore, this is about the survival of America. This \nis about avoiding bankruptcy not just for our country, but this country \nhas been the bastion of freedom and the model for democracy and freedom \nfor centuries. The other countries even today are looking to us and \nwanting to be free as violence erupts around the world. They want to \noverthrow authoritarian regimes so their people can live in freedom. \nBut at the time other countries strive to be like America, America \nseems to be determined, at least at the political level, to push our \nway toward being a Third World country that is so in debt and so \ndependent that we can no longer determine our destiny.\n  Today America is literally on its knees to China and other countries \nfor the credit we need to run our economy. We are also on our knees to \nthe Middle East, which is very unstable right now, for the energy we \nneed to run our country, to even take our food to market, the \nessentials at home. But instead of addressing the real issues, knowing \nthis budget is in front of us, over the last couple of weeks, when we \nknew we just had this 2-week funding bill to get us through, instead of \ndebating what we are really up against we have been dealing with a \npatent bill.\n  I think it is good to improve our patent system, but the party that \nis leading the Senate has been a no-show on\n\n[[Page S1356]]\n\nthe issue that is really threatening our country. And unless they show \nup, it is very difficult for Republicans--who are not in the White \nHouse; they are not controlling the Senate--to actually take the steps \nthat are needed to move our country back in the right direction.\n  My invitation today is to my Democratic colleagues, that after \nlistening to them call us the party of no, I will say that we were \nright, and our hope is they will listen to what we are saying and show \nup for the debate on our budget and do what we need to do to change the \nrole of the Federal Government, to devolve functions back to the States \nand back to individuals so this country can continue to survive and \nthrive and succeed in the future.\n  This is within our grasp. It is something we can do. This is not a \ndoomsday scenario because many of the solutions are not in what the \nFederal Government can do but what the Federal Government can let go \nof. As we look at the problems we have, it is not a matter that freedom \nhas failed. The problem is we have failed to let freedom work. We have \ntried to take control of education, of health care, of transportation, \nof energy, of retirement programs. The fact is, we have not done it \nwell and now we are spending so much that our country is threatened \nwith bankruptcy. There are good solutions if we are willing to look at \nletting things go.\n  As we consider this massive debt hill we have to climb, we need to \nrealize we can and we must balance the budget. That is probably what I \nwould consider the No. 1 goal of the Republicans right now is to \nproduce a budget that shows within 5 years that we can balance the \nbudget and leave America better off than before we started. I believe \nwith real freedom solutions we can do that.\n  We need to go back to where we started. This political system, this \nWashington establishment has brought America to the brink of \nbankruptcy. The debt in 1 year--even 1 month--and we are talking about \nnot even addressing for maybe a few days and we cannot even agree on \nthis $61 billion.\n  I hope the American people who were so instrumental in changing \nthings in November will rise up and let Washington know that it is time \nto get serious about reforming the way we spend money in Washington. We \nhave had reports in the last week that show over $100 billion of \noutright waste that we could cut immediately if we would just address \nit. But when one party will not show up for the debate it is very \ndifficult to do.\n  Let's make this more than partisan politics. Let's cooperate. Let's \nlook at the real problem and let's address it. I believe we can \nsucceed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I inquire of the Parliamentarian: My \nunderstanding is, we are in morning business with Senators permitted to \nspeak for 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, there is a lot of talk these days \nabout dangers posed to our national security from far away places: \nrevolution in Libya, the war in Afghanistan. They get our full \nattention. But what about the dangers that lurk inside our Nation?\n  We have a domestic situation, a danger that is directly visible, and \nwe are about to stoke that fire. House Republicans are going after \nsomething as fundamental as the air our children breathe.\n  The budget they recently passed calls for the gutting of the Clean \nAir Act, which is a clear and present danger, as they fail to solve a \nmajor fiscal requirement. That includes the expansion of revenues to \nbalance the budget rather than simply the slash-and-burn policy we are \nnow undergoing.\n  The Clean Air Act protects our children from toxic chemicals in the \nair and illnesses such as asthma and lung cancer. Last year alone, that \nlaw prevented 1.7 million cases of childhood asthma and more than \n160,000--160,000--premature deaths, according to EPA. Those numbers are \nbig, but they loom a lot larger when it is your child. As we often say \nhere, what goes around can come around.\n  If you want to know the real value of the Clean Air Act to America's \nfamilies, talk to the millions of parents who live in fear of their \nchildren's next asthma attack. It is a fear my own family knows all too \nwell. One of my grandsons suffers from this disease. He is an athletic \nyoung man, and every time he goes to a competitive game, my daughter \nfirst checks to see where the closest emergency room is, if she hears \nhim starting to wheeze.\n  The House Republican budget says to these families: We are sorry, we \nare here as accountants and we are not here to worry about these \nhumanitarian things--as ridiculous as that sounds. But that is the \nresult of the work they have done over there with their budget.\n  They say you cannot restrict polluters with regulations because it is \ntoo cumbersome. If you do not like regulations, get rid of traffic \nsignals. Those red lights slow traffic down. It is a terrible \ninconvenience. Think of the outcome if you had no red lights. Or maybe \nthey would get rid of the air traffic control system--pilots having to \nwait for some governmental bureaucrat to tell them when and where they \ncan fly, land, or take off.\n  The House Republican budget does not even allow us to control mercury \nemissions. Mercury is brain poisoning for children. The Centers for \nDisease Control has said mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can--and I \nquote here from their statement--``permanently damage the brain, \nkidneys, and developing fetus.'' Yet the House Republicans want to \nreturn mercury to our Nation's air.\n  The House Republicans also, in their budget, prevent the EPA from \nstrengthening air quality standards for soot pollution. Soot pollution \nreaches deep into the lungs and causes serious health problems, \nespecially in the very old or the very young. As shown in this picture \nI have in the Chamber, you see how ugly it looks. It is much uglier \nwhen it reaches inside a child's body.\n  Studies have linked soot with aggravated asthma, heart attacks, and \npremature death. Why would we want to weaken our clean air laws and \nallow polluters to pump more smog, more soot, and more toxic substances \ninto the air our children breathe?\n  It is pretty simple: The tea party Republicans in the House \napparently do not care about protecting our children's health. They \nonly care about one thing: cutting the budget no matter the real cost, \nthe long-term pain that can follow by cutting these budgets.\n  The question we have to ask here is: Do we want our children to be \nable to play outside in clean air that allows them to grow and be \nhealthy? Or should we keep them indoors all the time?\n  If you want to see where the House Republicans will lead us, look at \nChina. China has no clean air act. The air is so polluted that many \npeople wear masks when they walk outside. During the Olympics in \nBeijing, some U.S. athletes delayed their arrival to avoid the polluted \nair.\n  On a trip I took to China some years ago, I went to visit the \nMinister of the Environment, and he complained. He said: Look at how \nthe United States fouls the air with their burning of fuel. I asked him \nto join me at the window. We were on the 23rd floor. You could not see \nthe sidewalk--that is how heavy the pollution was in the air.\n  We do not want to be like that. We want to make sure we take care of \nour obligations. And the strongest obligation anybody has in America is \nto their children. Interestingly enough, what is happening now is: The \nphone calls that came to my office in New Jersey at first seemed to \nsupport these irrational budget cuts; and now they have turned around \nand they do not like what they see.\n  We would rather make sure our children are taken care of, that we try \nto balance the budget in more efficient ways. The one I talk about on a \nregular basis is revenue. I ran a pretty good-sized corporation before \nI came to the Senate and I know something about financial statements. I \nknew one thing: that we had to continually improve the revenue so we \ncould, in that corporation, increase the profits and not cut\n\n[[Page S1357]]\n\nstaff needlessly or endlessly while the company got weak. We cannot do \nit in this country of ours.\n  So we face a very difficult task because people are feeling the \nsqueeze on their incomes, concerned about job protection, concerned \nabout being able to stay in their houses. We still face a lot of \nforeclosure possibilities for homeowners. They cannot educate their \nchildren, cannot take care of their health. We cannot say to them, as \nwe used to say, that we know our children will do better in the future \nin their lives than we did in ours. We cannot say it and be honest \nabout it. We do not know that is true. If we continue along the path we \nare on, we are going to be looking at fairly bleak things to tell our \nchildren about as they grow, if we do not work harder to balance the \nbudget, educate our kids, make sure their health is good, with America \nbeing what it is always thought to be: a golden opportunity to bring \nyour families up and make sure life is acceptable or better than they \notherwise might have had.\n  Madam President, how is the time here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator used 9\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I will take that half minute, and I \nask unanimous consent that if I go over the half minute that I get 2 \nmore minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I served in World War II a long time \nago, but I have been around a long time. When I went into the Army--I \nenlisted when I was 18--my father was deathly ill with cancer. My \nmother was 37 years old. The prospects for life for our family were \ngrim. I went to the Army. My father, with a condition, arranged with \nthe recruiters that I would be allowed to stay home till my father \npassed away. He was 43 years old. My mother became a 37-year-old widow, \nand things were tough. Money was owed to doctors and pharmacists and \nhospitals.\n  Why do I talk about this now? It is because I was given the benefit, \nas were 8 million others who were in uniform, to get my college \neducation. I went to Columbia University. It was so far distant from my \nvision when I graduated from high school and enlisted in the Army. It \nturned out to be the greatest generation America has ever seen. It was \nbecause the government intervened at the right time and made sure that \neducation was abundantly available for those who could learn. That is \nwhat we ought to recall about America, and not this kind of a gloomy \npicture that says, OK, we are growing, but so are the threats to health \nand well-being.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1357-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Madam President, before the Senate moves to final passage \nof the America Invents Act of 2011, I wish to express my unequivocal \nsupport for this bill. This is not a perfect bill, but the fact is it \nis going to be a very important occasion to pass this because we \nhaven't passed a major piece of patent legislation for over 60 years or \naround that length of time. It has been a long time in the making, but \nit is well worth the effort to modernize our patent system. Despite \nmodifications along the way, the bill retains its strength and ability \nto bring about true reform.\n  In considering our country's economic condition, the bill's passage \ncould not come at a more opportune time. The America Invents Act is \nintegral to creating jobs and spurring growth across all sectors of our \ncountry. After all, jobs and economic growth are crucial to maintaining \nour Nation's dominance in innovation and entrepreneurship.\n  I would like to briefly mention a few key provisions of the act that \nimprove our outdated patent system. These include transitioning to a \nfirst-inventor-to-file system, which all the rest of the world has; \nallowing third parties to submit relevant prior art during patent \nprosecution; creating a patent quality-enhancing supplemental \nexamination process; and instituting a post-grant review and an inter \npartes reexamination expansion. All of that is extremely important.\n  The bill provides fee-setting authority and addresses a long-felt \nneed by the patent community and now by the majority of this body to \nend the practice--the obnoxious practice--of diverting fees from the \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office. No wonder we have such a rough time \ngetting things to work.\n  Finally, the legislation makes important clarifications to tax \nstrategy patents and creates a pilot program to review already-issued \nbusiness method patents.\n  This enumeration underscores a holistic approach that strikes the \nright balance. I hope everyone in this Chamber recognizes what we are \naccomplishing. We have come together in a bipartisan fashion to \ninvigorate some of our country's greatest strengths--our ideas and our \ninventive spirit.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by commending Senate Judiciary Committee \nchairman Pat Leahy for his leadership and tenacity in moving this bill \nthrough the Senate. He deserves a lot of credit. His vision and \ntireless efforts have made today's vote a reality. Together, we have \nworked on patent reform legislation since 2006--and in reality, even \nearlier than that--passing the torch of leadership along the way. One \ntime, I was chairman; he has been chairman. It is satisfying to see the \ntime has finally come to pass this bill.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of our distinguished \nranking member, Chuck Grassley. His unwavering support and commonsense \napproach have been invaluable in this process.\n  I wish to acknowledge the various staff members of Senator Leahy, my \nstaff, and Senator Grassley's staff for the work they have done on this \nbill--very important. Likewise, contributions of the members of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and other Members of this body have enriched \nour debate.\n  Finally, as I have said, I wish to thank our bill managers' staff for \ntheir sustained efforts throughout the process. Aaron Cooper, Bruce \nCohen, Rita Lari Jochum, and Kolan Davis have been instrumental in \ngetting us to this point. I also thank my own counsel, Matt Sandgren, \nwho has done a terrific job on this bill for all these years we have \nbeen working on it, and Remy Yucel, my USPTO detailee, for her and \nMatt's commitment and perseverance over these many years. They have \nbeen a formidable team.\n  I also acknowledge the important work of Joe Matal, Sarah Beth \nGroshart, Tim Molino, and Curtis LeGeyt.\n  Madam President, passing the America Invents Act is the right thing \nto do, and I urge my colleagues to join in this monumental undertaking. \nIt is the right thing to do, it will help our country, it is going to \nreestablish our patent laws in ways they should be, and it will stop \nthe fee diversion that has been going on, assuming we can get help from \nthe House as well, and I believe we will. It will be a bill that I \nthink we will have to go to conference on and hopefully be able to \nperfect it even more. I am grateful for all who have been involved, and \nI hope and pray we can get this through both Houses of Congress and \nestablish this monumental bill at a monumental time. It is very \nimportant in all our lives.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1358]]\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, we have now almost a 9-percent \nunemployment rate in this country. I think the good news is that \nunemployment dropped to 8.9 percent, but it is still way too high. We \nhave a $1.6 trillion deficit. Yet, despite these enormous challenges, \nCongress still has not passed a Federal budget for this year. Our \ndeadline to pass a 2011 appropriations bill was September 30 of last \nyear, but Congress still has failed to meet that deadline. Last week, \nwe passed our fifth short-term continuing resolution to keep the \nGovernment open.\n  At some point soon, I think maybe this evening, we are going to be \nvoting on the House Republicans' package of budget cuts that I believe \nthreaten our economic recovery. After moving on from that, we will \nstill need to pass another continuing resolution by the end of next \nweek in order to avoid a Government shutdown.\n  While we are debating these short-term continuing resolutions, in \nChina and India and Germany, they are debating long-term investments in \neducation, energy, technology, and research. Those are the decisions \nwith the potential to shape the global economy for many decades to \ncome. Meanwhile, here at home, we are fighting about whether we are \ngoing to keep the Government open for 2 weeks. This kind of short-term \nbudgeting is not just hurting our future, it is hurting our economy \ntoday.\n  Just last week, I heard from a company in New Hampshire about the \neffects of Congress's failure to pass a full-year budget. The company \nis called Nitro Security and it is located in Portsmouth, NH. It is a \ncompany that is at the forefront of the emerging cyber security \nindustry. Even in a difficult economy over the last couple years, they \nwere named one of the 600 fastest growing private companies in the \nNation. Yet, despite most of their business coming from the private \nsector, Nitro Security also has significant contracts protecting data \nsystems at the Department of Defense, NASA, and even the Food and Drug \nAdministration. They should be creating jobs and helping to get our \neconomy moving again, but because Congress cannot conduct its business \non time, their stalled contracts mean they have not been able to hire \nnew workers. We are missing out on these jobs because Washington's \nbudget process is broken.\n  Congress needs to do better. In the last 30 years, Congress has only \ncompleted the annual budget process on time twice--just two times in \nthe last 30 years. That is a 7-percent success rate. Solving our long-\nterm deficit problems and reinvigorating our economy is going to \nrequire tough choices, but we are never going to be able to make these \nchoices until we change the way Washington does business. That is why I \njoined Senator Isakson in proposing the Biennial Budgeting and \nAppropriations Act, to bring sorely needed oversight and long-term \nplanning to the Federal budget process. Our legislation would dedicate \nthe first year of a Congress to appropriating Federal dollars and \ndevote the second year to scrutinizing Federal programs to determine if \nthey are working and deserve continued funding.\n  Because of annual budgeting, Members of Congress do not have the time \nwe need to conduct careful, thorough reviews of Federal programs, and \nFederal agency staff are required to dedicate countless hours every \nyear to preparing the budget and to explaining what they do, rather \nthan accomplishing critical missions. As a result, we continue to spend \nmoney on projects that are duplicative, sometimes failing, and often no \nlonger useful.\n  In fact, just last week, the Government Accountability Office \nreleased a landmark report on Government duplication and overlap. The \nreport reveals that in as many as 34 different areas across the Federal \nGovernment, agencies are offering overlapping services to similar \npopulations.\n  As we think about how we need to address our debt and deficit, we \nshould begin by eliminating these kinds of duplicative programs. That \nis the type of reform we should be considering. We should be \neliminating duplication and making targeted cuts and investments in our \nfuture. We should be making investments in projects such as the \nMemorial Bridge, which connects New Hampshire and Maine and is a \ncritical economic engine for the seacoast region of New Hampshire and \nMaine and the shipyard that is so vital to making sure we can upgrade \nthe ships in our Navy.\n  Even though this bridge has been recognized as a national priority \nand it enjoys support from the Maine and New Hampshire Senate \ndelegations, the project to replace the bridge has been threatened by \nill-considered, reckless cuts in the House of Representatives' \ncontinuing resolution. These are the consequences of short-term \nbudgetary thinking: They are penny wise and pound foolish.\n  In another example we have in New Hampshire, the Bureau of Prisons \nhas recently completed construction of a Federal prison in the north \ncountry of New Hampshire in a community called Berlin. The cost--$276 \nmillion. As the construction was wrapping up, the Bureau of Prisons \nrequested activation funding for fiscal year 2011 to hire rank-and-file \nofficers and begin getting this prison ready to open. But because we \nare operating on this short-term continuing resolution that fails to \naccount for these types of situations, we now have a state-of-the-art, \n$276 million prison that is sitting vacant. We have a warden who is \nthere who is waiting to hire staff. The Bureau of Prisons needs the \n1,280 inmate beds this facility will provide. The community needs the \n$40 million annual economic impact from this prison and the 340 jobs \nthis facility will provide. But none of these important objectives are \nbeing met because our budget process is not working. Instead, the \nBureau of Prisons is spending $4 million a year to maintain an empty \nbuilding.\n  As Members of Congress, we are entrusted with the responsibilities of \nspending taxpayer dollars wisely. Our current budget and spending \nprocess makes it all too easy for waste and inefficiency to remain \nhidden and, at the same time, important priorities are neglected by the \nwhims of a chaotic annual budgeting process. Switching to biennial \nbudgeting will not solve all our problems, but it would certainly be an \nimportant step toward greater oversight, increased accountability, and \na more responsible government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from New \nHampshire for her great leadership on the subject about which she just \nspoke; that is, the necessity of moving beyond our old system of having \nappropriations bills every year. I have advocated, for a long time, \nexactly what she is taking the lead on; that is, every 2 years do the \nappropriations and then we can do oversight. As the Senator from New \nHampshire correctly pointed out, we don't do oversight because we are \nalways wrapped up in some appropriations measure or budget measure \nevery single year.\n  It is time we move and move as rapidly as possible to biennial \nbudgeting so we can fulfill one of our most important obligations, \nwhich is to find out what is working and what is not working so we can \nhave oversight. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for her \nleadership in this area.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank Senator Harkin for his efforts over the years \nto try to move us to a biennial budget and a process that gets a budget \ndone that makes a lot more sense and allows us to be a lot more \nthoughtful about how we are supporting programs in our Federal \nGovernment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Just make sure I am on your bill, OK?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. We will.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Put my name in because you are right on--and Senator\n\n[[Page S1359]]\n\nIsakson. It is a bipartisan effort and it should be a bipartisan \neffort. I talked to a number of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who believe the same way we do about this. Hopefully, we can have \na good, bipartisan approach.\n  I wish to take a few moments to talk about the budget and what we are \nconfronting right now in the Congress. First of all, we all agree--I \nthink we should all agree--the deficits we have now are unsustainable. \nThey are a drag on our economy, they jeopardize our future, and they \nhave to be brought under control. I am committed to finding a \nbipartisan approach to try to get us through this and to attain this \nimportant goal of bringing the budget under control and balanced for \nthe future.\n  I might just say for the last three decades, I have been proud that \nmy party, the Democratic Party, has been the party of fiscal discipline \nand balanced budgets. Well, that may come as a shock to some people, \nbut let's review the history.\n  When Bill Clinton became President in 1992, he inherited at that time \nthe largest deficits in U.S. history. Well, he joined with Democrats in \nCongress to pass a balanced deficit reduction law that resulted in the \nlargest surpluses in history and put us on a path, by the year 2000, to \ncompletely eliminate the national debt within a decade. I was here for \nthat. Every single Republican voted against it, every single one.\n  Likewise, President Obama inherited from President Bush a deficit in \nexcess of--are you ready for this one--$1 trillion and a deep recession \nthat made it even worse. Once again, we Democrats are committed to \nbringing this under control and to do it in a fair and balanced way.\n  But as a former President once said: Here we go again. In December, \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle, the Republicans, insisted \nthat we extend tax cuts largely benefitting the wealthy, add $354 \nbillion to the deficit this year, and even more next year. Then they \nvoted to repeal the health reform law on the House side, which would \nadd $210 billion to the deficit over the next decade. Now these same \npeople are shedding crocodile tears and claiming to be worried about \nthe deficit.\n  Let's be clear. There is a right way to balance the budget and there \nis a wrong way. We can balance the budget in a way that is fair or we \ncan do it in a way that is manifestly not fair, that will deepen the \ngulf between the rich and the poor and further erode the middle class \nin our country.\n  H.R. 1, which I assume we will be voting on shortly, embodies the \nRepublican approach to reducing deficits, driven by ideology that \nabsolutely rules out any tax increase. It kind of holds the Bush tax \ncuts to the wealthy to be almost sacred. Instead, they take a meat ax \nto the essential parts of the budget, everything from cancer research \nto education to safety net programs for our most vulnerable citizens.\n  Well, we have seen this movie before--you know, give tax breaks to \ncorporations and the wealthiest people in our society. Then balance the \nbudget on the backs of the middle class and low-income in America. \nThese are bad priorities, they are bad policies, and they are bad \nvalues.\n  The right way is a balanced approach. This must include spending \ncuts. We have made cuts in my own appropriations bill. But it also \nincludes necessary revenue increases while making room for critical \ninvestments in education, job training, infrastructure, research, \nthings that are essential to economic expansion and job creation in the \nfuture.\n  We know this balanced budget approach can work. As I said, that is \nwhat we did in the early 1990s under President Clinton. We did both. We \ncut spending and we raised revenues. As I said, every Republican voted \nagainst it. But that single act of Congress, that bill signed by the \nPresident, led to the largest budget surplus and the longest economic \nexpansion in U.S. history and created 22 million new jobs.\n  Now, H.R. 1, which has come over from the House, their approach on \nhow to bring the budget under control, will kill jobs. Mark Zandi, top \neconomic adviser to Senator McCain's campaign in 2008, estimates H.R. 1 \nwill kill some 700,000 jobs. Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke \nestimates it will kill 200,000 jobs. Nobody knows for sure. But what \nthey all agree on is it will kill jobs. With about 9 percent \nunemployment, a fragile economy--we are just now starting to increase \nemployment in this country--why would we be asked to vote for a bill \nthat we know, that everyone agrees, will kill hundreds of thousands of \njobs?\n  Well, we do not reduce the deficit by increasing unemployment. That \nis what H.R. 1 will do. It will slow economic growth, drag us back into \na recession, and make deficits even worse. H.R. 1 slashes the entire \ngamut of education programs that are so essential to provide a ladder \nof opportunity for our younger generation in this country. It slashes \nthe safety net for our most vulnerable citizens--infants, children, \nseniors, and people with disabilities. So if you vote for H.R. 1, the \nHouse bill, you are voting to slash title I grants to school districts \nby nearly $700 million. It means that 2,400 schools serving 1 million \ndisadvantaged students could lose funding.\n  If you vote for H.R. 1, you are voting to slash community health \ncenters by about $1 billion. That means you eliminate funding for 127 \nclinics in 38 States. If you vote for H.R. 1, you are voting to slash \nHead Start Programs. Why would you want to take it out on kids? Why \nwould you want to say: Oh, we have to balance the budget so we are \ngoing after Head Start kids? But that is what it does. It eliminates \nservices for about 218,000 children and their families next year, about \na 25-percent reduction in Head Start.\n  If you vote for H.R. 1, you are voting to slash childcare. The child \ncare development block grant would be cut by H.R. 1. If you vote for \nH.R. 1, you are voting to undermine Social Security.\n  Well, people say: How is that? Social Security is not involved in \nH.R. 1. Well, it is in this way: We know because of the recession more \nand more people have applied for SSI, supplemental security income. \nThey have applied for disability. They have gone on disability or \nbasically they have just retired.\n  Well, in order to take care of this huge increase in the number of \npeople applying, we have to have people who will take the cases in, \nreview them, make sure people are eligible, cut the checks, and get the \nmoney out. That is called the Social Security Administration. Well, \nH.R. 1 cuts the funding for doing this $125 million below last year's \nfunding level. That means every American filing for benefits this year \nwill have to wait even longer. Right now, it is almost 400-and-some \ndays. That is over a year. That is over a year.\n  Think about if you are on disability, if you are disabled and you \ncannot work and you filed for a disability claim. You are waiting a \nyear and a half in order to even get your first check. Well, H.R. 1 \nwould cut it even more and would probably increase waiting times up to \n2 years or maybe even more than 2 years. So it undermines the safety \nnet of Social Security.\n  If you vote for H.R. 1, you are voting to slash student aid. It cuts \nthe maximum Pell grant by $845. That is 15 percent below where we are \nnow. You might say: Well, that is not that big a deal. Well, it is. I \ntell Senators, check two things. Check with your private not-for-profit \nschools in your States. They do a great job of educating low-income \nstudents because they are able to utilize Pell grants plus endowments. \nThey put them together. They do a great job in every one of our States \neducating poor kids. Start taking away that Pell grant, we lower that \nPell grant, that means a lot of poor kids will not be able to go to \nschool. That means the private non-profits would have to raise the \ntuition on other kids. That means some of them would not be able to go, \nand we start an escalator effect in our colleges.\n  I just had the President of the University of Iowa, President Mason, \nin to see me today talking about one of our great universities in Iowa, \nthe University of Iowa. She told me, President Mason said that cutting \nPell grants would affect probably close to 5,000 students at the \nUniversity of Iowa. Sometimes this is the difference between whether \nthey are in school or they are not in school or it could be the \ndifference between a Pell grant or they have to go out and borrow more \nmoney and take on more debt.\n\n[[Page S1360]]\n\n  So if you vote for H.R. 1, you are cutting student aid. If you vote \nfor H.R. 1, you are going to slash job training programs. The House \nbill that came over, H.R. 1, completely eliminates Federal funding for \nadult training, dislocated worker assistance and youth training \nprograms, completely eliminates it. These programs provide job training \nand reemployment services to about 8 million Americans every year, 8 \nmillion. They just do away with it.\n  If you vote for H.R. 1, you are voting to slash the community \nservices block grant. Well, they cut about $305 million from that. That \nprovides services to some of our lowest income people and elderly. If \nyou vote for H.R. 1, you are voting to cut investments in \ninfrastructure, highway funding, sewer and drinking water funds, and \nrural economic development funding because H.R. 1 slashes community \ndevelopment block grants by 62 percent.\n\n  Now, I say go out and talk to your mayors, talk to your city council, \ntalk to your boards of supervisors in your counties. Ask them if they \ncan take a 62-percent cut in their community development block grants \nand what it is going to mean to them.\n  Well, I cannot help but also speak to my own constituents in Iowa \nabout what this means for my own State. If H.R. 1, the House bill which \npassed the House, if it were to be passed and enacted into law--well, I \nmentioned about the cuts that we are having in the Job Corps. It would \nbasically kill the Denison, IA, Job Corps Center, which employs 163 \npeople. It provides training to 450 at-risk students each year, and we \nhave a new Job Corps Center just being built, just being opened in \nOttumwa. That will probably just come to a screeching halt. It is \nsupposed to be opening later this year.\n  It would shut down at least the community health center in \nCenterville, IA. That is H.R. 1. H.R. 1 would be cutting down the \ncommunity services block grant and would shut down the Red Rock \nCommunity Action Agency serving Boone, Jasper, Warren, Marion, and \nrural Polk County.\n  H.R. 1, as I mentioned, would completely eliminate funding for job \ntraining programs, which assisted more than 35,000 Iowans in the last \nyear. As I mentioned, it would slash Pell grants for our kids who go to \nall of our colleges in Iowa, the private not-for-profits and our \nRegents institutions. Two thousand low-income Iowa kids who now attend \nHead Start would be cut off.\n  Lastly, it is not only just the cuts and the slashes to these vital \nprograms which will increase unemployment and send us back into another \nrecession, there are riders in this bill, what we call legislative \nriders, that are pernicious. They do terrible damage to our country.\n  For example--just one--there is a rider in the bill that says no \nmoney can be used or spent to continue the implementation of the health \nreform bill that we passed last year. Well, what does that mean? Well, \nthat means right now, in law, because of the Affordable Care Act we \npassed last year, kids can stay on their parents' policy until they are \nage 26. That would be gone. The question would be, the ones who got on \nbefore this, will they be able to stay on? But I can tell you, no new \nkids would ever be allowed to stay on their parents' policy until they \nare age 26.\n  We put in--and as you know, it is in law right now--that an insurance \ncompany cannot impose a lifetime limit on individuals. That was in the \nbill last year. That would be gone. They can start reinstituting \nlifetime limits and annual limits.\n  Also we had a provision in the bill that provided for a medical loss \nprovision. Let me try to explain that.\n  In our bill we said insurers and health insurance companies have to \npay at least 80 cents of every dollar of premium they collect on health \ncare rather than profits, bonuses, overhead, fancy buildings, and \ncorporate jets and all of that. They had to pay--80 cents of every \npremium dollar has to go for health care. It is done away with under \nH.R. 1. We cannot enforce that at all.\n  So, again, for those who have seen benefits to themselves from the \nhealth care bill we passed, whether it is keeping their kids on their \npolicy or elderly people now who get free mammograms and free \ncolonoscopies and a free health checkup every year with no copays, no \ndeductibles, that ends. That ends with H.R. 1.\n  So the bill passed by the House is just, as I said, bad policy, and \nit is bad values. It is not the values of our country, and I hope the \nSenate will resoundingly--resoundingly--defeat H.R. 1, consign it to \nthe scrap heap of history, the history of ill-advised ideas, of ill-\nadvised programs. There have been a lot of them that have come along in \nthe history of this country.\n  Fortunately, I think the Congress in most instances has turned them \ndown, and we moved ahead. We can't afford to go backward. H.R. 1 would \ndo that. It would take this country back. We would lose jobs. It would \ncut kids out of getting an education, close down Head Start centers. It \nwould widen that gulf between the rich and the poor. We can't continue \nto go down that road. We don't want to wind up another Third World \ncountry where we have a few at the top and everybody at the bottom and \nnobody in between. The middle class built this country, and we cannot \ncontinue to erode the middle class. That is what H.R. 1 would do, erode \nthe middle class and widen the gulf between the rich and poor.\n  I hope the Senate will recognize H.R. 1 for what it is, a detriment, \na body blow to our recovery efforts. I hope the Senate will \nresoundingly defeat it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since the Senate began this debate on the \nAmerican Invents Act more than a week ago, I have talked about American \ningenuity and innovation. As this debate comes to a close, I want to \nemphasize that this is legislation that should promote innovation, help \ncreate jobs, and help energize the economy as we continue our recovery. \nThis legislation can be a key part of a jobs agenda. We can help \nunleash innovation an promote American invention, all without adding a \npenny to the deficit. This is commonsense, bipartisan legislation.\n  Innovation has been a cornerstone of the American economy from the \ntime Thomas Jefferson examined the first patent to today. The Founders \nrecognized the importance of promoting innovation. A number were \nthemselves inventors. The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the \npower to ``promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing \nfor limited times to . . . inventors the exclusive right to their \nrespective . . . discoveries.'' The discoveries made by American \ninventors and research institutions, commercialized by American \ncompanies, and protected and promoted by American patent laws have made \nour system the envy of the world. The President has spoken all year \nabout the need to win the future by out innovating our competition. \nThis bill can play a key role in that effort.\n  Yesterday, I commended Austan Goolsbee, the chair of the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers, for his white board presentation this \nweek on the importance of patent reform to help America win the global \ncompetition and create jobs. The creation of more than 220,000 jobs in \nthe private sector last month, the creation of 1.5 million jobs over \nthe last 12 months, and the unemployment rate finally being reduced to \n8.9 percent are all signs that the efforts we have made over the last 2 \nyears to stave off the worst recession since the Great Depression are \npaying off and the economic recovery is taking hold. The almost full \npercent point drop in the unemployment rate over the last 3 months is \nthe largest decline in unemployment since 1983. Despite interruptions \nof economic activity in many parts of the country caused by winter \nweather over the last months and in recent days, despite the \nextraordinary rise in oil\n\n[[Page S1361]]\n\nprices, the Dow Jones industrial average has climbed back to over \n12,000 from a low point of 6,500. Passage of the America Invents Act \nshould help bolster our economic recovery and keep us on the right path \ntoward business development and job creation.\n  As we began this debate, I referred back to the President's State of \nthe Union address and his challenge to the Nation to out-innovate, out-\nbuild and out-educate our global competitors. Enacting the America \nInvents Act is a key to meeting this challenge. Reforming the Nation's \nantiquated patent system will promote American innovation, create \nAmerican jobs, and grow America's economy. I thank the President and \nhis administration for their help and support for the Leahy-Hatch-\nGrassley America Invents Act. Commerce Secretary Locke has been a \nstrong partner in our efforts, and Director Kappos of the Patent and \nTrademark Office has been an indispensable source of wise counsel.\n  The America Invents Act will keep America in its longstanding \nposition at the pinnacle of innovation. This bill will establish a more \nefficient and streamlined patent system that will improve patent \nquality and limit unnecessary and counterproductive litigation costs, \nwhile making sure no party's access to court is denied.\n  The America Invents Act is the product of eight Senate hearings over \nthe last three Congresses. Our bill is the product of years of work and \ncompromise. The Senate Judiciary Committee has reported patent reform \nlegislation to the Senate in each of the last three Congresses, this \nyear, unanimously. And the House has seen efforts over the same period \nled by Congressmen Lamar Smith of Texas and Howard Berman of \nCalifornia. The legislation we are acting on today, in fact, is \nstructured on the original House bill and contains many of the original \nprovisions.\n  From the beginning, we recognized the need for a more effective and \nefficient patent system, one that improves patent quality and provides \nincentives for entrepreneurs to create jobs. A balanced and efficient \nintellectual property system that rewards invention and promotes \ninnovation through high quality patents is crucial to our Nation's \neconomic prosperity and job growth. That is how we win the future--by \nunleashing the American inventive spirit. This bill, the America \nInvents Act, will allow our inventors and innovators to flourish.\n  It is important to our country's continued economic recovery, and to \nour successfully competing in the global economy. America needs a 21st \ncentury patent system to lead. The last extensive reform of our patent \nsystem was nearly 60 years ago. It is time.\n  While the Congress debates spending and budget measures in an often \ntoo partisan manner, the American people are craving--and the American \neconomy is demanding--bipartisan legislation that can create jobs and \nhelp our economy through common sense measures. That is what this bill \ncan do. It relies on not one dollar of taxpayer money. Let me \nemphasize, not a dime in taxpayer money is spent on the Patent and \nTrademark Office, PTO, reforms. They are all funded by patent fees, not \ntaxes.\n  Innovation drives the Nation's economy, and that entrepreneurial \nspirit can only be protected by a patent system that promotes invention \nand spurs new ideas. We need to reform our patent system so that these \ninnovations can more quickly get to market. A modernized patent \nsystem--one that puts American entrepreneurs on the same playing field \nas those throughout the world--is a key to that success. This is an \nidea that cuts across the political spectrum.\n  During Senate debate over the last week our bill has been improved by \na number of Senators who have contributed amendments. Senators Bennet, \nCoons, Schumer, Menendez, Pryor, Stabenow, Baucus, Bingaman, Coburn and \nKirk have all contributed, and I thank them for working with us. \nSenator Cardin attempted to offer germane amendments, and I regret that \nthese were blocked.\n  I thank our ranking Republican on the committee and the comanager of \nthis measure, Senator Grassley, and his staff, Kolan Davis and Rita \nLari, for their dedication to this effort. I commend Senator Hatch for \nsticking with it for these many years, and Senator Kyl for helping get \nthis done.\n  I also extend my personal thanks, as well, to Senator Klobuchar of \nMinnesota who was active during committee consideration and helped \nmanage this legislation effort in the Senate. She has been outstanding.\n  The Senate's action today could not have been accomplished without \nthe hard work of many dedicated staffers. I would like to thank in \nparticular the steadfast work of Aaron Cooper of my Judiciary Committee \nstaff. Aaron has spent countless hours in meetings and briefings, with \nMembers, other staff, and interested parties, working to help me ensure \nthat the America Invents Act preserved the meaningful reforms we have \nbeen working toward since 2005. I would also like to thank Ed Pagano, \nmy chief of staff, and Bruce Cohen, my chief counsel, who have worked \non this issue since the start, as well as Susan Davies who served as my \nchief Intellectual Property counsel through the formative stages of \nthis legislative effort. Erica Chabot, Curtis LeGeyt and Scott Wilson \nof my Judiciary Committee staff also deserve thanks for their committed \nwork on this legislation.\n  I also commend the hardworking Senate floor staff, Tim Mitchell and \nTrish Engle, as well as Dave Schiappa, and the staffs of other \nSenators, including Tim Molino, Joe Matal, and Matt Sandgren, for their \ndedicated efforts.\n  I also thank the many individuals, companies, associations and \ncoalitions that have helped with this effort. This legislation has been \nsupported by both business and labor, including the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the United Steelworkers, the AFL-CIO, the \nAssociation of American Universities, the American Bar Association, the \nAssociation of Public and Land-Grant Universities, the Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges, the Association of University Technology \nManagers, the American Council on Education, the Council on Government \nRelations, PhRMA, BIO, the Intellectual Property Owners Association, \nthe American Intellectual Property Law Association, the Coalition for \n21st Century Patent Reform, the Association for Competitive Technology, \nthe Coalition for Patent and Trademark Information Dissemination, IBM, \nGeneral Electric, Eli Lilly and Company, Bose Corporation, Johnson and \nJohnson, 3M, General Mills, Honeywell, Monsanto, Motorola, Cargill, \nInc., Caterpillar, Enventys, Abbott, Astra Zeneca, AdvaMed, Air \nLiquide, Bayer, Beckman Coulter, Boston Scientific, BP, Bridgestone \nAmerican Holdings, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, the California \nHealthcare Institute, the Colorado BioScience Association, Cummins, The \nDow Chemical Company, DuPont, Eastman Chemical Company, ExxonMobil, \nGenentech, Genzyme, GlaxoSmithKline, the Healthcare Institute of New \nJersey, Henkel Corporation, Hoffman-LaRoche, Illinois Tool Works, \nInternational Game Technology, Kodak, Medtronic, Merck & Co., Inc., \nMillenium Pharmaceuticals, Milliken and Company, Northrop Grumman, \nNovartis, PepsiCo., Inc., Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, SanDisk \nCorporation, Sangamo BioSciences, Inc., United Technologies, USG \nCorporation, the Virginia Biotechnology Association, Weyerhaeuser, the \nAmerican Institute for CPAs, the American Institute of Certified Public \nAccountants, the Tax Justice Network USA, the New Rules for Global \nFinance, the American College of Tax Counsel, Consumer Action, The \nAmerican College of Trust and Estate Counsel, the Partnership for \nPhilanthropic Planning, Global Financial Integrity, the International \nAssociation for Registered Financial Consultants, the National \nAssociation of Enrolled Agents, USPIRG, the Certified Financial Planner \nBoard of Standards, the Financial Planning Association, the American \nAssociation of Attorney-Certified Public Accountants, the Citizens for \nTax Justice, the National Treasury Employees Union, the Independent \nCommunity Bankers of America, and numerous other organizations and \ncompanies representing all sectors of the patent community that have \nbeen urging action on patent reform proposals for years.\n  The America Invents Act will accomplish 3 important goals, which have \nbeen at the center of the patent reform debate from the beginning: It \nwill improve and harmonize operations at the\n\n[[Page S1362]]\n\nPTO; it will improve the quality of patents that are issued; and it \nwill provide more certainty in litigation. In particular, the \nlegislation will move this Nation's patent system to a first-inventor-\nto-file system, make important quality enhancement mechanisms, and \nprovide the PTO with the resources it needs to work through its backlog \nby providing it with fee setting authority, subject to oversight. The \nAmerica Invents Act provides the tools the PTO needs to separate the \ninventive wheat from the chaff, which will help business bring new \nproducts to market and create jobs.\n  Innovation has always been at the heart of America and American \nsuccess. From the founding of our Nation, we recognized the importance \nof promoting and protecting innovation, and so the Constitution \nexplicitly grants Congress the power to ``promote the progress and \nscience and useful arts, by securing for limited times to . . . \ninventors the exclusive right to their respective . . . discoveries.'' \nThe patent system plays a key role in encouraging innovation and \nbringing new products to market. The discoveries made by American \ninventors and research institutions, commercialized by our companies, \nand protected and promoted by our patent laws have made our system the \nenvy of the world.\n  High quality patents are the key to our economic growth. They benefit \nboth patent owners and users who can be more confident in the validity \nof issued patents. Patents of low quality and dubious validity, by \ncontrast, enable patent trolls who extort unreasonable licensing fees \nfrom legitimate businesses, and constitute a drag on innovation. Too \nmany dubious patents also unjustly cast doubt on truly high quality \npatents.\n  After 6 years of debate and discussion, more than a dozen hearings \nand mark up sessions, and countless hours of member and staff meetings \nwith two presidential administrations and interested parties across the \nspectrum, the Senate is finally acting to make the first meaningful, \ncomprehensive reforms to the nation's patent system in nearly 60 years. \nThe Senate debate has now extended for more than a week. Passage of the \nAmerica Invents Act demonstrates what we can accomplish when we cast \naside partisan rhetoric, and focus on working together for the American \npeople and for our future.\n  It has been almost 6 years since Chairman Smith and Congressman \nBerman introduced the first version of patent reform legislation in \n2005, but the structure and guiding principles of the legislation \nremain the same. The bill will speed the process by which the Patent \nOffice considers applications and should improve the quality of patents \nit issues.\n  Innovation and economic development are not uniquely Democratic or \nRepublican objectives, so we worked together to find the proper balance \nfor America--for our economy, for our inventors, for our consumers. \nWorking together, we can smooth the path for more interesting--and \ngreat--American inventions. That is what this bipartisan, comprehensive \npatent reform bill will do. No one claims that ours is a perfect bill. \nIt is a compromise that will make key improvements in the patent \nsystem. Having coordinated with the leaders in the House through this \nprocess, I hope that the House will look favorably on our work and \nadopt this measure so that it can be sent to the President without \ndelay and its improvements can take effect in order to encourage \nAmerican innovation and promote American invention.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Reid amendment \nNo. 152 be withdrawn; that the Reid amendment No. 143 be modified with \nthe changes at the desk; the Senate proceed to vote on the amendment, \nas modified, with no amendments in order prior to the vote; that there \nthen be 30 minutes of debate equally divided between the two managers \nor their designees; that S. 23 be read a third time; that a budgetary \npay-go statement be read; the Senate then proceed to a vote on passage \nof the bill, as amended; and the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon Wednesday, March 9, \nthe Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 14, H.R. 1, the \nDefense appropriations long-term continuing resolution for fiscal year \n2011; that there be 3 hours of debate on H.R. 1 and the Democratic \nalternative, the Inouye substitute amendment No. 149, with the time \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees prior to a \nvote on passage of H.R. 1; that the vote on passage be subject to a 60-\nvote threshold; that if the bill achieves 60 affirmative votes, the \nbill be read a third time and passed; that if the bill does not achieve \n60 affirmative votes, the majority leader be recognized to offer the \nInouye substitute amendment No. 149; the Senate then proceed to a vote \non the substitute amendment; that the substitute amendment be subject \nto a 60-vote threshold; if the substitute amendment achieves 60 \naffirmative votes, the substitute amendment be agreed to; the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; if the substitute amendment \ndoes not achieve 60 affirmative votes, H.R. 1 be returned to the \ncalendar; that no motions or amendments be in order to the substitute \namendment or to the bill prior to the votes; further, that all of the \nabove occur with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with this agreement, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the cloture vote with respect to the motion to proceed to H.R. 1 \nbe vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, even though there have been a few turns in \nthe road, we are at the place where we need to be. We need to be able \nto show the American people where we are on these two measures. I \nexpress my appreciation to my friend, the Republican leader. As I said, \nthings don't always work smoothly around here, but they usually work. \nNow we are at a point where we can vote on these two measures which is \nwhat we need to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 152 is \nwithdrawn.\n  Under the previous order, amendment No. 143 is modified with the \nchanges at the desk.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To include public institutions of higher education in the \n                     definition of a micro entity)\n\n       On page 93, before line 18, insert the following:\n       ``(d) State Institutions of Higher Education.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For purposes of this section, a micro \n     entity shall include an applicant who certifies that--\n       ``(A) the applicant's employer, from which the applicant \n     obtains the majority of the applicant's income, is a State \n     public institution of higher education, as defined in section \n     102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1002); or\n       ``(B) the applicant has assigned, granted, conveyed, or is \n     under an obligation by contract or law to assign, grant, or \n     convey, a license or other ownership interest in the \n     particular application to such State public institution.\n       ``(2) Director's authority.--The Director may, in the \n     Director's discretion, impose income limits, annual filing \n     limits, or other limits on who may qualify as a micro entity \n     pursuant to this subsection if the Director determines that \n     such additional limits are reasonably necessary to avoid an \n     undue impact on other patent applicants or owners or are \n     otherwise reasonably necessary and appropriate. At least 3 \n     months before any limits proposed to be imposed pursuant to \n     this paragraph shall take effect, the Director shall inform \n     the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the \n     Senate of any such proposed limits.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n143, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 143), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COBURN. I wish to express my opposition to Reid amendment No. \n143, as modified. I do not believe public institutions of higher \neducation, or any entity, should be carved out of the definition of \nmicro entity in the underlying legislation. Had a rollcall vote \noccurred, I would have voted no.\n\n[[Page S1363]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, with \nunanimous consent that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Check 21 Act Patents\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would like to clarify some concerns I have about the \nSchumer-Kyl program that was included in the managers' amendment to the \nAmerica Invents Act, adopted on March 1. I am specifically concerned \nthat this provision revives an amendment that had been included in \nprevious versions of the bill--that amendment specifically targeted \npatents related to the Check 21 Act and eliminated the ability of the \nholder of such patents to collect damages. Is that the purpose of the \nSchumer-Kyl language?\n  Mr LEAHY. No, the amendment is entirely different from the 2008 \namendment related to patents that place on tax on implementation of the \nCheck 21 Act. The Schumer-Kyl program addresses certain business method \npatents and does not target any specific patents. The Schumer-Kyl \nprogram is intended to provide a cost-effective alternative to \nlitigation to examine business-method patents.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Am I correct then that the Schumer-Kyl program is simply \ntrying to address the problem of business method patents of dubious \nvalidity that are commonly associated with the Federal Circuit's 1998 \ndecision in State Street Bank v. Signature?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is correct. It is still unclear whether the subject \nmatter of these patents qualifies as patentable subject matter under \ncurrent law. Patents of low quality and dubious validity, as you know, \nare a drag on innovation because they grant a monopoly right for an \ninvention that should not be entitled to one under the patent law.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Can the Senator describe how the program would work in \npractice?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Certainly. If a petitioner provides evidence to the PTO \nand the PTO determines that the patent is on a ``covered business \nmethod patent'' then the PTO would institute a post-grant review of \nthat patent. In this review, the PTO could consider any challenge that \ncould be heard in court.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Is it correct then that the Schumer proceeding would only \nhave an effect if the PTO determines it is more likely than not that a \nclaim of the patent is invalid and, even then, the proceeding would \nhave no effect on a patent unless the petitioner can demonstrate that \nunder current law the patent is not valid?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is correct. The proceeding has a higher threshold \nthan current reexamination before the PTO will even undertake a review \nof the patent. So as a practical matter, a patent without any serious \nchallenge to its validity would never be subject to a proceeding.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Would the Senator agree that in a case in which the \nvalidity of the patent has been upheld by a district court but the case \nremains on appeal, that this amendment would likely not affect the \npending appeal?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would. The patent may still be subject to the \nproceeding, but since the court did not hold the patent invalid or \nunforceable, it would not likely have an effect on the pending appeal.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to take the opportunity to explain \nfurther a few elements of the Schumer-Kyl provision in the patent bill. \nThe Transitional Program for business method patents addresses a \ncritical problem in the patent world, and it is crucial that it be \nadministered and implemented appropriately by both the Patent and \nTrademark Office and the courts.\n  Business method patents are the bane of the patent world. The \nbusiness method problem began in 1998 with the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Federal Circuit decision in State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. \nSignature Financial Group, Inc. State Street created a sea-change in \nthe patentability of business-methods, holding that any invention can \nbe patented so long as it produces a ``useful, concrete, and tangible \nresult'' and meets other requirements of the patent laws.\n  State Street launched an avalanche of patent applications seeking \nprotection for common business practices. The quality of these business \nmethod patents has been much lower than that of other patents, as \nJustice Kennedy noted in his concurring opinion in eBay Inc. v. \nMercExchange. Justice Kennedy wrote about the ``potential vagueness and \nsuspect validity'' of some of ``the burgeoning number of patents over \nbusiness methods.'' Commentators like Rochelle Dreyfuss have also \nlamented ``the frequency with which the Patent Office issues patents on \nshockingly mundane business inventions.'' Malla Pollack pointed out \nthat ``[M]any of the recently-issued business method patents are \nfacially (even farcically) obvious to persons outside the USPTO.''\n  One of the main reasons for the poor quality of business method \npatents is the lack of readily accessible prior art references. Because \nbusiness methods were not patentable prior to 1998 when the State \nStreet decision was issued, the library of prior art on business method \npatents is necessarily limited--as opposed, say, to more traditional \ntypes of patents for which there can be centuries of patents and \nliterature about them for the PTO to examine. Furthermore, information \nabout methods of conducting business, unlike information about other \npatents, is often not documented in patents or published in journals. \nThis means a patent examiner has significantly less opportunity than he \nmight with a traditional patent to weed out undeserving applications. \nUnfortunately, that means the burden falls on private individuals and \nan expensive court process to clean up the mess.\n  The ability to easily obtain business method patents without a \nrigorous and thorough review in the Patent Office has created a flood \nof poor quality business method patents and a cottage industry of \nbusiness method patent litigation. The Federal courts have recognized \nthis problem, and indeed even the Supreme Court has begun to address \nit. In KSR Intl Co. v. Teleflex, Inc. and Bilski v. Kappos, the Court \narticulated a new standard for obviousness and made clear that abstract \nbusiness methods are not patentable. While these legal developments are \nimportant, the leave in limbo the many patents that were issued by the \nPTO since State Street that are not in fact valid.\n  Litigation over invalid patents places a substantial burden on U.S. \ncourts and the U.S. economy. Business-method inventions generally are \nnot and have not been patentable in countries other than the United \nStates. In order to reduce the burden placed on courts and the economy \nby this back-and-forth shift in judicial precedent, the Schumer-Kyl \ntransitional proceeding authorizes a temporary administrative \nalternative for reviewing business method patents.\n  It is important to clarify two elements of the Schumer-Kyl program's \noperation in particular. First, there is the issue of how a district \ncourt should treat a motion for a stay of litigation in the event the \nPTO initiates a pilot program. Second, there is the issue of how the \nFederal circuit will treat interlocutory appeals from stay decisions. \nFinally, there is the issue of which patents should be considered to be \ncovered business method patents.\n  The transition program created by the Schumer-Kyl amendment is \ndesigned to provide a cheaper, faster alternative to district court \nlitigation over the validity of business-method patents. This program \nshould be used instead of, rather than in addition to, civil \nlitigation. To that end, the amendment expressly authorizes a stay of \nlitigation in relation to such proceedings and places a very heavy \nthumb on the scale in favor of a stay being granted. It is \ncongressional intent that a stay should only be denied in extremely \nrare instances.\n  When Congress initially created ex parte reexamination, it did not \nexpressly provide for a stay of litigation pending the outcome of an ex \nparte reexamination proceeding. Rather, Congress relied on the courts' \ninherent power to grant stays and encouraged courts to liberally grant \nstays. However, relying on the courts' inherent\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\npower to grant stays did not result in courts liberally granting stays. \nFor example, one commentator who surveyed the grant rates on motions \nfor stay pending reexamination, Matthew A. Smith, found that numerous \ndistrict courts granted stays less than half the time. In fact, Eastern \nDistrict of Texas grants stays only 20 percent of the time. Due to low \ngrant rates for stays in several jurisdictions, this amendment \ninstructs courts to apply the four-factor test first announced in \nBroadcast Innovation, L.L.C. v. Charter Communications when evaluating \nstay motions.\n  The amendment employs the Broadcast Innovation test, rather than \nother multifactor tests employed by other district courts, because this \ntest properly emphasizes a fourth factor that is often ignored by the \ncourts: ``whether a stay will reduce the burden of litigation on the \nparties and on the court.'' Too many district courts have been content \nto allow litigation to grind on while a reexamination is being \nconducted, forcing the parties to fight in two fora at the same time. \nThis is unacceptable, and would be contrary to the fundamental purpose \nof the Schumer-Kyl amendment to provide a cost-efficient alternative to \nlitigation.\n  Absent some exceptional circumstance, the institution of a business-\nmethods proceeding--which requires a high up-front showing and will be \ncompleted in a relatively short period of time--should serve as a \nsubstitute for litigation, and result in a stay of co-pending district \ncourt litigation.\n  By adopting this four-factor test, rather than one of the three-\nfactor tests used by other courts, the amendment also precludes the use \nof additional factors that are not codified here and that have \noccasionally been used by some district courts. For example, a few \ncourts have occasionally employed a different de facto fourth factor: \nwhether the challenger offers ``to forgo invalidity arguments based on \nprior art patents and/or printed publications considered during an ex \nparte reexamination process.'' The proceeding authorized by this \namendment, at subsection (b)(1)(D), sets its own standard for \ndetermining what issues may still be raised in civil litigation if a \npatent survives PTO review. By codifying the exclusive set of factors \nthat courts are to consider when granting stays, the amendment \nprecludes courts from inventing new factors such as extra-statutory \nestoppel tests.\n  Several unique features of this proceeding further make it \nappropriate to grant stays in all but the most unusual and rare \ncircumstances. These proceedings will only be instituted upon a high \nup-front showing of likely invalidity. The proceeding is limited to \ncertain business method patents, which, as noted above, are generally \nof dubious quality because unlike other types of patents, they have not \nbeen thoroughly reviewed at the PTO due to a lack of the best prior \nart. And the proceeding will typically be completed within 1 year.\n  In summary, it is expected that, if a proceeding against a business \nmethod patent is instituted, the district court would institute a stay \nof litigation unless there were an extraordinary and extremely rare set \nof circumstances not contemplated in any of the existing case law \nrelated to stays pending reexamination. In the rare instance that a \nstay is not granted, the PTO should make every effort to complete its \nreview expeditiously. We encourage the PTO Director to promulgate \nregulations to this effect to ensure that petitioners know that in \nextreme circumstance where a gay is not granted, the PTO will complete \nits review in a compressed timeframe, such as within 6 months.\n  To ensure consistent and rigorous application of the Broadcast \nInnovation standard, the amendment also allows the parties, as of \nright, to have the Federal Circuit closely review the application of \nthis test in a manner that ensures adherence to these precedents and \nconsistent results across cases. As such, either party may file an \ninterlocutory appeal directly with the Federal Circuit. Because this \namendment provides an automatic right to an interlocutory appeal, the \ndistrict court does not need to certify the appeal in writing, as it \nwould ordinarily need to do under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b). Also, unlike \nthe discretion typically afforded an appellate court under 28 U.S.C. \nSec. 1292(b), under this amendment the Federal Circuit may not decline \nto hear an interlocutory appeal.\n  Since the denial of a stay pending post-grant review under this \namendment is an extraordinary and extremely rare circumstance, the \nfiling of an interlocutory appeal should result in the stay of \nproceedings in the district court pending the appeal. Staying the lower \ncourt proceedings while the Federal Circuit reviews the question of \nwhether the case should be stayed pending the post-grant review will \nhelp ensure that requests to stay are consistently applied across cases \nand across the various district courts.\n  On appeal the Federal Circuit can and should review the district \ncourt's decision de novo. It is expected that the Federal Circuit will \nreview the district court's decision regarding a stay de novo, unless \nthere are unique circumstances militating against a de novo review, \nsuch as subsequent requests for an interlocutory appeal in the same \ncase. A de novo review is central to the purpose of the interlocutory \nappeal provision in the Schumer-Kyl amendment, which is to ensure \nconsistent application of standards and precedents across the country \nand to avoid one particular court with a favorable bench becoming the \npreferred venue of business method patent plaintiffs.\n  The definition of covered business method patents in the transitional \nprogram was developed in close consultation with the PTO to capture all \nof the worst offenders in the field of business method patents, \nincluding those that are creatively drafted to appear to be true \ninnovations when in fact they are not.\n  The amendment only applies to ``covered business method patents.'' If \nthe PTO determines that a patent is a ``covered business method \npatent''--and the other applicable requirements of this amendment and \nChapter 32 are met--the patent will be subject to post-grant review \nunder this amendment regardless of whether the patent has been through \nprior PTO proceedings, such as ex parte reexamination, or current or \nprior litigation.\n  The definition of a ``covered business method patent'' includes ``a \nmethod or corresponding apparatus.'' The phrase ``method or \ncorresponding apparatus'' is intended to encompass, but not be limited \nto, any type of claim contained in a patent, including, method claims, \nsystem claims, apparatus claims, graphical user interface claims, data \nstructure claims--Lowry claims--and set of instructions on storage \nmedia claims--Beauregard claims. A patent qualifies as a covered \nbusiness method patent regardless of the type or structure of claims \ncontained in the patent. Clever drafting of patent applications should \nnot allow a patent holder to avoid PTO review under this amendment. Any \nother result would elevate form over substance.\n  Not all business method patents are eligible for PTO review under \nthis amendment. Specifically, ``patents for technological inventions'' \nare out of scope. The ``patents for technological inventions'' \nexception only excludes those patents whose novelty turns on a \ntechnological innovation over the prior art and are concerned with a \ntechnical problem which is solved with a technical solution and which \nrequires the claims to state the technical features which the inventor \ndesires to protect. It is not meant to exclude patents that use known \ntechnology to accomplish a business process or method of conducting \nbusiness--whether or not that process or method appears to be novel. \nThe technological invention exception is also not intended to exclude a \npatent simply because it recites technology. For example, the \nrecitation of computer hardware, communication or computer networks, \nsoftware, memory, computer-readable storage medium, scanners, display \ndevices or databases, specialized machines, such as an ATM or point of \nsale device, or other known technologies, does not make a patent a \ntechnological invention. In other words, a patent is not a \ntechnological invention because it combines known technology in a new \nway to perform data processing operations.\n  The amendment covers not only financial products and services, but \nalso the ``practice, administration and management'' of a financial \nproduct or service. This language is intended to\n\n[[Page S1365]]\n\nmake clear that the scope of patents eligible for review under this \nprogram is not limited to patents covering a specific financial product \nor service. In addition to patents covering a financial product or \nservice, the ``practice, administration and management'' language is \nintended to cover any ancillary activities related to a financial \nproduct or service, including, without limitation, marketing, customer \ninterfaces, Web site management and functionality, transmission or \nmanagement of data, servicing, underwriting, customer communications, \nand back office operations--e.g., payment processing, stock clearing.\n  The amendment also requires a patent to relate to a ``financial \nproduct or service.'' To meet this requirement, the patent need not \nrecite a specific financial product or service. Rather the patent \nclaims must only be broad enough to cover a financial product or \nservice. For example, if a patent claims a general online marketing \nmethod but does not specifically mention the marketing of a financial \nproduct, such as a savings account, if that marketing method could be \napplied to marketing a financial product or service, the patent would \nbe deemed to cover a ``financial product or service.'' Likewise, if a \npatent holder alleges that a financial product or service infringes its \npatent, that patent shall be deemed to cover a ``financial product or \nservice'' for purposes of this amendment regardless of whether the \nasserted claims specifically reference the type of product of service \naccused of infringing.\n  In conclusion, I am very pleased that the Senate has adopted the \nSchumer-Kyl provision and trust that it will go a long way towards \naddressing the havoc that frivolous business method patent litigation \nhas wreaked upon the courts and the economy. Indeed, Senator Kyl and I \nreceived a letter of thanks and appreciation from the Independent \nCommunity Bankers of America, who represent nearly 5,000 community \nbanks. As they point out, the money they are required to spend \ndefending litigation from business method patent trolls--and the \ncapital they must reserve against these contingent liabilities--is \nmoney which ``cannot find its way into the hands of worthy borrowers, \nretarding economic growth and job creation at the time such activity is \nmost needed.''\n  To that end, I would ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nIndependent Community Bankers of America be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Independent Community\n\n\n                                           Bankers of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2011.\n     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Schumer and Kyl: On behalf of the Independent \n     Community Bankers of America (ICBA) and the nearly 5,000 \n     community banks that we represent, we thank you for your \n     efforts to improve S. 23 the Patent Reform Act of 2011 \n     through your amendment to establish an oppositional \n     proceeding at the United States Patent and Trademark Office \n     (PTO) where business-method patents can be examined using the \n     best available prior art. Such patents have, unfortunately, \n     become the preferred method of extracting large settlements \n     from community banks and these practices threaten our \n     bankers' ability to provide banking and banking related \n     services to their local communities and to local small \n     businesses.\n       Under the current system, business method patents of \n     questionable quality are used to force community banks to pay \n     meritless settlements to entities that may have patents \n     assigned to them, but who have invented nothing, offer no \n     product or service and employ no one. In addition, all public \n     companies are required by accounting rules to reserve capital \n     against contingent liabilities. For community banks, this is \n     money which cannot find its way into the hands of worthy \n     borrowers, retarding economic growth and job creation as the \n     precise time such activity is most needed. The Schumer-Kyl \n     amendment is critical to stopping this economic harm.\n       We appreciate that you have worked hard with the Patent and \n     Trademark Office and other stakeholders to refine the \n     amendment and make compromises to enable the amendment to \n     move forward. We support those efforts and will continue to \n     push to ensure that business method patents cannot be used as \n     a weapon by those who seek to game the patent granting and \n     litigation system at the expense of legitimate businesses.\n       We are pleased to learn that the Senate has adopted much of \n     the Schumer-Kyl amendment into the base text of S. 23. We \n     encourage the Senate to only strengthen this provision, where \n     possible, for the good of our nation's community banks and \n     the countless neighborhoods and communities that they serve.\n       Thank you again.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Stephen J. Verdier,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                                          Congressional Relations.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record materials concerning the America Invents Act that were \ndistributed by the Republican Policy Committee last week. These consist \nof a legislative notice describing the bill that was brought to the \nSenate floor, and a summary of the Senate managers' amendment that was \nadopted on Tuesday.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   [From the Republican Policy Committee, U.S. Senate, Feb. 28, 2011]\n\n                           Legislative Notice\n\n                  S. 23--The Patent Reform Act of 2011\n\n     Calendar #6\n     Reported by the Judiciary Committee with amendments on \n         February 3, 2011 by a vote of 15-0. No written report.\n\n\n                               Noteworthy\n\n       At 3:30 p.m. today, the Senate will begin consideration of \n     S. 23.\n       The Act adopts a ``First Inventor to File'' patent regime. \n     Currently the United States is the only country in the world \n     operating under a ``First to Invent'' regime.\n       The Act grants the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) \n     authority to set its own fees to better ensure proper funding \n     for its operations.\n       The Act makes a variety of changes to improve the quality \n     of patents, including allowing for greater submission of \n     information by third parties while a patent application is \n     pending and establishing a post-grant review procedure for \n     promptly raised challenges to a patent.\n       Unlike prior patent reform bills, the Act does not disturb \n     substantive damages law; but it does take steps to improve \n     the consistency and predictability of the application of that \n     law.\n\n\n                          Background/Overview\n\n       Innovation is a key facet of American economic power, as \n     our Founders recognized in the Constitution by giving \n     Congress the power to ``promote the progress of science and \n     useful arts'' by granting inventors time limited monopolies--\n     patents--on their discoveries. This basic framework set the \n     course for centuries of American innovation, but the law has \n     not been substantially updated since the Patent Act of 1952. \n     Responding to concerns about the quality and timeliness of \n     patents issued by the PTO, the last several Congresses have \n     considered substantial patent reform measures. [In the 109th \n     Congress Senators Hatch and Leahy introduced the Patent \n     Reform Act of 2006 (S. 3818). The next year, Senators Leahy \n     and Hatch introduced the Patent Reform Act of 2007 (S. 1145). \n     This bill was reported from the Judiciary Committee, as \n     amended, on January 24, 2008, with a Committee Report (S. \n     Rep. 110-259), but it was not considered by the full Senate. \n     On March 3, 2009, Senators Leahy and Hatch introduced the \n     Patent Reform Act of 2009, which was reported with amendments \n     on April 2, 2009, with a Committee Report (S. Rep. 111-18). \n     Again the bill was not considered by the full Senate. During \n     this time, the Senate Judiciary Committee has held eight \n     hearings on patent reform, and the House has held hearings on \n     the subject as well.]\n       Over the course of these Congresses the substance of the \n     reform proposals evolved. On January 25, 2011, Senator Leahy \n     and Senator Hatch introduced the current bill, the Patent \n     Reform Act of 2011 (S. 23), which was reported with \n     amendments on February 3, 2011. Significant features of the \n     legislation include: a transition to a ``First Inventor to \n     File'' patent regime consistent with other industrialized \n     countries; PTO fee setting authority to ensure proper \n     funding; and post-grant and supplemental review procedures to \n     improve patent quality.\n\n\n                            Bill Provisions\n\n     Section 1. Title/Table of Contents\n     Section 2. First Inventor to File\n       The United States, alone among advanced economies, \n     currently operates under a ``First to Invent'' rather than a \n     ``First Inventor to File'' patent regime in which the date of \n     filing with the patent office is the most important \n     determinant of who is the legitimate patent holder. Defenders \n     of the First to Invent regime claim that it has served \n     America well, that it favors small inventors by allowing them \n     to focus on inventing rather than paperwork, and that it \n     avoids overburdening the PTO with prematurely filed \n     applications.\n       However, the system poses challenges for American inventors \n     who must operate under one regime domestically and another if \n     they wish to profit from their innovation abroad. The First \n     to Invent system also results in less certainty about the \n     validity of patents and often leads to expensive and lengthy \n     litigation. Many commentators and organizations, including \n     the National Academy of Sciences, have urged the United \n     States to\n\n[[Page S1366]]\n\n     adopt a First Inventor to File system. S. 23 moves the \n     United States to a First Inventor to File regime. As part \n     of that, it creates an administrative proceeding to ensure \n     that the first person to file is actually the true \n     inventor. It also preserves and strengthens current law's \n     grace period, by providing that disclosures made by the \n     true inventor, or someone who got the information from the \n     inventor, less than one year before the application is \n     filed will not be held against their application.\n       Additionally, during the one-year period before the \n     application is filed, if the inventor publicly discloses his \n     invention, no subsequently-disclosed ``prior art,'' \n     regardless of whether it is derived from the inventor, can be \n     used to invalidate the patent. Prior art is a term of art in \n     intellectual property law. S. 23 defines ``prior art'' as \n     actions by the patent owner or another (such as publication, \n     public use, or sale) that make the invention available to the \n     public.] This effectively creates a ``first to publish'' rule \n     within the one year grace period. An inventor who publishes \n     his invention retains an absolute right to priority if he \n     files an application within one year of his disclosure. No \n     application effectively filed after his disclosure, and no \n     prior art disclosed after his disclosure, can defeat his \n     patent application.\n     Section 3. Inventor's Oath or Declaration\n       U.S. patent law requires oaths or declarations by inventors \n     as part of the application process. This can be challenging \n     when applications are pursued by company-assignees for whom a \n     variety of past and present employees may have played a role \n     in developing the invention. This section makes it easier for \n     assignees to file and prosecute a patent application where \n     the inventor is unable to do so or unwilling and \n     contractually obligated to do so.\n     Section 4. Damages\n       The current damage statute is vague, and juries must \n     evaluate up to 15 factors developed by the courts. This has \n     led to inconsistent and unpredictable damage awards. Section \n     4 does not upset the existing substantive law, but it makes \n     certain changes to increase predictability in damages by \n     authorizing courts to play a gatekeeper role, in which they \n     will provide detailed instructions to juries on what factors \n     are most relevant to the case before them.\n     Section 5. Post-Grant Review\n       This section establishes a new administrative procedure for \n     challenging the validity of granted patents within a nine-\n     month post-grant window, providing an early opportunity to \n     improve the quality of patents.\n       The bill also changes procedures for later challenges by \n     third parties to the validity of patents (the so-called \n     ``inter partes reexamination'' process, under current law). \n     These reforms add additional procedural protections to the \n     process by converting the reexamination into an adjudicative \n     proceeding to be known as ``inter partes review.'' Inter \n     partes review must be completed within one year of being \n     instituted (though this deadline can be extended by six \n     months for good cause). The proceedings will take place \n     before a panel of three administrative judges whose decisions \n     are appealable directly to the Federal Circuit.\n     Section 6. Patent Trial and Appeal Board\n       This section renames the Patent Board the ``Patent Trial \n     and Appeal Board'' and clarifies its role in administering \n     the new proceedings established by the Act.\n     Section 7. Pre-Issuance Submissions by Third Parties\n       Current law restricts what third parties can file with the \n     PTO when they possess relevant information on pending patent \n     applications. This section would permit third parties, \n     typically another innovator in the same or a similar field, \n     to submit relevant information and make statements explaining \n     their submissions.\n     Section 8. Venue\n       Codifies the standard for transfers of venue established by \n     the Federal Circuit in the case In re TS Tech USA Corp and \n     applies it to patent cases generally. [551 F.3d 1315 (Fed. \n     Cir. 2008).] That standard provides for transfer to the \n     judicial district that is ``clearly more convenient'' for \n     both the parties and witnesses. The section also clarifies \n     that venue for litigation against the PTO is the Eastern \n     District of Virginia, where the PTO is headquartered, rather \n     than the District of Columbia, where it used to be based.\n     Section 9. Fee Setting Authority\n       In order to provide sufficient funding to the PTO's \n     operations, this section grants the office the ability, and \n     sets forth procedures, to set or adjust the fees it charges \n     applicants.\n     Section 10. Supplemental Examination\n       This provision authorizes a supplemental examination \n     process by which patent holders can correct errors or \n     omissions in past proceedings with the PTO. During the \n     process, additional information can be presented to the \n     office and, if it does not undermine the original patent \n     determination, the earlier omission of that information \n     cannot be later used in a lawsuit alleging inequitable \n     conduct.\n     Section 11. Residency Requirement for Federal Circuit Judges\n       This section repeals the requirement that judges on the \n     Federal Circuit reside within 50 miles of Washington, DC. The \n     duty station of Federal Circuit judges, however, will remain \n     in Washington.\n     Section 12. Micro-Entity Defined\n       Under current law, the PTO charges small businesses and \n     nonprofits lower fees than it charges large corporations. \n     This section establishes an even smaller category--truly \n     independent inventors--for which the PTO may make additional \n     accommodations.\n     Section 13. Funding Agreements\n       This section changes the formula for what universities, \n     nonprofits, and others may do with royalties or other income \n     generated by inventions developed using federal funds. Under \n     current law, if such royalties exceed the annual budget of \n     the entity, 75 percent of the excess is returned to the \n     government. In order to encourage innovation and \n     commercialization, this section allows the entity to retain \n     85 percent of that excess for further research. The remainder \n     would be paid to the government.\n     Section 14. Tax Strategies Deemed within Prior Art\n       This section ends the patentability of tax strategies. The \n     bill, as reported, does not change the patentability of other \n     forms of business method patents.\n     Section 15. Best Mode Requirement\n       As part of a patent application, an applicant must disclose \n     the ``best mode'' for carrying out his or her invention. In \n     subsequent litigation an accused infringer can offer as a \n     defense that the best mode was not properly disclosed by the \n     patent holder. This section eliminates that defense, which \n     many consider subjective and possibly irrelevant, as the best \n     mode may change over time. Best mode disclosure remains a \n     requirement for patentability.\n     Section 16. Technical Amendments\n       This section contains technical amendments to reorganize \n     the patent statute.\n     Section 17. Clarification of Jurisdiction\n       This section clarifies exclusive federal jurisdiction over \n     patent claims.\n     Section 18. Effective Date\n       Except where otherwise provided by specific provisions in \n     the Act, the effective date of the Act is 12 months after \n     enactment, meaning it would apply to all patents issued on or \n     after that date.\n\n\n                        Administration Position\n\n       As of the publication of this Notice, no Statement of \n     Administration Policy (SAP) has been issued.\n\n\n                                  Cost\n\n       As of the publication of this Notice, no Congressional \n     Budget Office cost estimate for S. 23 has been issued.\n\n\n                          Possible Amendments\n\n       At this time, there is no unanimous consent agreement with \n     respect to consideration of S. 23 or limiting the submission \n     of amendments.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Summary of the Managers' Amendment\n\n       The title is changed to the ``America Invents Act''.\n       The date of the repeal of statutory invention \n     registrations, which are used only in first-to-invent, is \n     changed to conform to the date of the switch to first to \n     file.\n       All remaining damages language--gatekeeper, sequencing, and \n     recodification of current law as subsection (a)--is struck. \n     The bill now makes no changes to section 284.\n       In PGR, the subsection imposing a six-month deadline on \n     filing after litigation is commenced is replaced with the \n     ``shoot first'' provision requiring a court to consider a PI \n     request without taking a PGR petition or its institution into \n     account if the patent owner sues within 3 months of the \n     issuance of patent. The six-month deadline did not work well \n     here--PGR can only be requested within 9 months of patent \n     issuance anyway, and no suit can be brought until the patent \n     issues. Also, a much broader range of issues can be raised in \n     PGR than in IPR, justifying more time for filing.\n       PGR is limited to only FTF patents--no FTI patents can be \n     challenged in PGR. This is done because FTI patents raise \n     discovery-intensive invention-date and secret-prior-art \n     issues that would be difficult to address in an \n     administrative proceeding. This also effectively gives PTO a \n     much easier ramp up for PGR. In light of this change, the \n     time for implementing PGR is moved back to 1 year after \n     enactment, so that it is done at the same time as new IPR is \n     implemented, which is PTO's preference.\n       During the first four years after new IPR is implemented, \n     the Director has discretion to continue to use old inter \n     partes reexam. This is done because the Director believes his \n     reforms of the CRU have greatly improved old inter partes, \n     and it may actually work more efficiently than new IPR during \n     the ramp up. Old inter partes can also be used for PGR \n     proceedings that are instituted only on the basis of patents \n     and printed publications, which are the only issues that can \n     be raised in old inter partes (as well as new IPR).\n       The codification of the TS Tech transfer-of-venue rule is \n     struck. TS Tech already applies as a matter of caselaw in the \n     Fifth Circuit. (The Federal Circuit applies regional circuit \n     law to procedural matters, and reads Fifth Circuit law as \n     applying the transfer of venue rule.) Complaints about venue \n     generally focus on EDTX, so there is little need to apply TS \n     Tech nationally, and it seemed odd for Congress to regulate \n     such matters in any event.\n       A blue-slip fix to the Director's fee setting authority. \n     The revised language identifies\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\n     with great specificity the sources of authority to impose \n     patent and trademark user fees, in order to avoid a violation \n     of the Origination Clause.\n       A new provision requiring the Director to charge reduced \n     fees to small entities for use of accelerated examination.\n       Language is added making clear that the repeal of the \n     Baldwin rule (which rule requires Federal Circuit judges to \n     live within 50 miles of Washington, D.C.) shall not be \n     construed to require the AOC to provide judges office space \n     or staff outside of D.C.\n       A PTO-approved broadening of the definition of \n     ``microentity,'' a status that entitles applicants to reduced \n     fees.\n       In the tax patents section, language is added: [(1) \n     clarifying that the language does not bar patenting of tax \n     software that is novel as software--i.e., where the \n     innovation is in the software] (this may be dropped); and (2) \n     establishing that making tax strategies unpatentable shall \n     not be construed to imply that other business methods are \n     patentable or valid. In Bilski v. Kappos, (2010), the Supreme \n     Court interpreted Congress's 1999 enactment of a prior-user \n     right that only applied against business-method patents as \n     implying that business methods qualify as patentable subject \n     matter under section 101, which was enacted in 1793.\n       Language is added to the part of the Holmes Group fix \n     allowing removal of patent cases from state to federal court \n     to clarify that derivative jurisdiction is not required in \n     such cases. Derivative jurisdiction is the doctrine that, \n     even if a federal district court would have had original \n     jurisdiction over an action, on removal, the district court \n     can only have jurisdiction if the state court from which the \n     action is removed properly had jurisdiction. (In other words, \n     the federal court's removal jurisdiction is regarded as \n     derivative of the state court's jurisdiction.) This silly \n     form-over-substance doctrine was abrogated by Congress, but \n     some courts have continued to read it into other parts of the \n     law, and thus it was thought best to also make clear here \n     that derivative jurisdiction is not required.\n       The Schumer-Kyl business-methods proceeding, as modified to \n     accommodate industry concerns and PTO needs. In its 1998 \n     State Street decision, the Federal Circuit greatly broadened \n     the patenting of business methods. Recent court decisions, \n     culminating in last year's Supreme Court decision in Bilski \n     v. Kappos, have sharply pulled back on the patenting of \n     business methods, emphasizing that these ``inventions'' are \n     too abstract to be patentable. In the intervening years, \n     however, PTO was forced to issue a large number of business-\n     method patents, many or possibly all of which are no longer \n     valid. The Schumer proceeding offers a relatively cheap \n     alternative to civil litigation for challenging these \n     patents, and will reduce the burden on the courts of dealing \n     with the backwash of invalid business-method patents. The \n     proceeding has been limited since mark up so that: (1) only \n     defendants or accused infringers may invoke the proceeding; \n     (2) prior art is limited to old 102(a), which must be \n     publicly available, or prior art of old 102(a) scope that \n     shall be presumed to beat old 102(a) invention-date limits \n     but that falls outside the old 102(b) grace period (i.e., \n     effectively, old 102(b) prior art but limited to old 102(a)'s \n     publicly-available prior-art scope); (3) the proceeding may \n     not be used to challenge a patent while it is eligible for a \n     PGR challenge (i.e., an FTF patent during the first 9 months \n     after its issue); (4) the proceeding is available only for \n     four years; (5) district courts decide whether to stay \n     litigation based on the four-factor Broadcast Innovation \n     test, and the Federal Circuit reviews stay decision on \n     interlocutory appeal to ensure consistent application of \n     established precedent; (5) the definition of business-method \n     patent, which tracks the language of Class 705, is limited to \n     data processing relating to just a financial product or \n     service (rather than also to an enterprise).\n       PTO is given greater flexibility in paying and compensating \n     the travel of APJs. A large number of APJs will need to be \n     recruited, trained, and retained to adjudicate PGR and new \n     IPR. This change's enhancements will be paid for out of \n     existing funds.\n       The Coburn end to fee diversion. Currently, PTO fees go \n     into a Treasury account and are only available to the Office \n     as provided in appropriations. In the last two decades, about \n     $800 million in PTO user fees has been diverted from PTO to \n     other federal spending. The Coburn amendment creates a \n     revolving fund, giving PTO direct access to its fees without \n     the need for enactment of an appropriations act.\n       Budget Committee paygo language is added at the end.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 23, the \nAmerica Invents Act. This bipartisan bill is the product of a great \ndeal of hard work and negotiation, and I congratulate Senators Leahy, \nHatch and Grassley on their accomplishment. This bill is a reasonable \ncompromise that will update and strengthen our U.S. Patent system so \nthat American businesses can better compete in the 21st Century.\n  The American system of patenting inventions has helped make our \ncountry the center of innovation for more than two centuries. The \nAmerica Invents Act will ensure that inventors and those who invest in \ntheir discoveries are able to rely on their most important asset--their \npatent. Patents are vital components in the research and development \ncycle that help create small businesses and jobs.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, we have a strong tradition of \ninvention and innovation--from the invention of the first practical \ntypewriter in 1869 to a cure for Rickets disease in 1925 to cutting \nedge drug therapies for the 21st Century. More than 50 Wisconsin based \nstartup companies have been fueled by patents that resulted from \nresearch at the University of Wisconsin. And there are countless other \nWisconsin companies that rely on patents to sustain and grow their \nbusiness.\n  I am able to support the Patent Reform Act because of the \nimprovements made to the bill since it was first introduced. As is the \nnature of compromise, I recognize that we cannot all get every change \nwe want. I thank Senator Leahy for making substantial changes to \naccommodate many of my concerns.\n  Specifically, I appreciate your willingness to strike a major section \nof the bill regarding prior user rights--which would have done serious \nharm to the University of Wisconsin and its patent licensing business. \nThe bill incorporates additional changes that were important to \nresearch universities, including provisions related to venue, grace \nperiod for first inventor to file, oath, and collaborative research.\n  Patent protection will be stronger with the inclusion of ``could have \nraised'' estoppel, strong administrative estoppel, and explicit \nstatutory authority for the Patent and Trademark Office, PTO, to reject \npetitions by third parties and order joinder of related parties. \nImprovements have also been made regarding damages. Finally, I am \npleased that we were able to address the PTO's funding needs in a way \nthat maintains Congress' duty to carefully oversee the PTO while \nensuring that it has the resources necessary to issue top quality \npatents in a timely manner.\n  Again, I commend Senator Leahy for his many years of work on this \nbill, and I look forward to the House taking up this legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Leahy, who \nis the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Senator Grassley, who \nis the ranking Republican, for including in the Patent Reform Act a \nprovision that a number of us have been working on for several years to \nstop the granting of tax strategy patents.\n  The key provision contains the text of legislation that Senators \nBaucus, Grassley and I, as well as others, introduced earlier this \nyear, S. 139, the Equal Access to Tax Planning Act, to end the \ntroubling practice of persons seeking patents for tax-avoidance \nstrategies. Issuing such patents perverts the Tax Code by granting what \nsome could see as a government imprimatur of approval for questionable \nor illegal tax strategies, while at the same time penalizing taxpayers \nseeking to use legitimate strategies.\n  Since 1998, when Federal courts ruled that business practices were \neligible for patent protection, the Patent and Trademark Office has \nissued more than 130 patents for tax strategies, with more than 150 \napplications pending. These patents are a terrible idea for two \nreasons.\n  First, they may be providing unintended support for abusive tax \nshelters. Some unscrupulous tax shelter promoters may claim that the \npatent represents an official government endorsement of their tax \nscheme and evidence that the scheme would withstand IRS challenge. \nGiven the well-documented problem we have with tax avoidance in this \ncountry, allowing persons to patent tax strategies is not only a waste \nof government resources needed elsewhere, but an invitation to \nwrongdoers to misuse those government resources to promote tax \navoidance.\n  Second, the granting of tax patents threatens to penalize taxpayers \nseeking to use legal tax strategies to minimize their tax bills. If a \ntax practitioner is the first to discover a legal advantage and secures \na patent for it, that person could then effectively charge a toll for \nall other taxpayers to use the same strategy, even though as a matter \nof public policy all persons ought to be able to take advantage of the \nlaw to minimize their taxes. Companies could even patent a legal method \nto minimize their taxes and then\n\n[[Page S1368]]\n\nrefuse to license that patent to their competitors in order to prevent \nthem from lowering their operating costs. Tax patents could be used to \nhinder productivity and competition rather than foster it.\n  Federal patent law is supposed to encourage innovation, productivity, \nand competition by encouraging inventors to innovate, secure in the \nknowledge that they can profit from their efforts. In the tax arena, \nthere is already ample incentive for taxpayers to seek legitimate ways \nof reducing their tax burden, as the wealth of advice and consulting in \nthis area demonstrates. Injecting patents into the mix encourages \nabusive tax avoidance while raising the cost of legal tax planning at \nthe same time, both to society's detriment.\n  I introduced the first bill to ban tax patents back in 2007. Since \nthen, Senators on both sides of the aisle have been trying to get this \nproblem fixed. The language in the bill before us today is designed to \nput a halt to the issuance of patents for tax strategies once and for \nall, including for the 155 pending applications. Although the bill does \nnot apply on its face to the 130-plus tax patents already granted, if \nsomeone tries to enforce one of those patents in court by demanding \nthat a taxpayer provide a fee before using it to reduce their taxes, I \nhope a court will consider this bill's language and policy \ndetermination and refuse to enforce the patent as against public \npolicy.\n  The tax patent provisions of this bill are significant, but they are \nnot the only reasons to support passage. This legislation will create \njobs, help keep our manufacturers competitive and strengthen and expand \nthe ability of our universities to conduct research and turn that \nresearch into innovative products and processes that benefit Michigan \nand our Nation. It also will assist the new satellite Patent and Trade \nOffice that will be established in Detroit by modernizing the patent \nsystem and improving efficiency of patent review and the hiring of \npatent examiners. One objective of the new office in Detroit is to \nrecruit patent examiners to reduce the backlog of patent applications. \nThis legislation is a huge step forward in that effort.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to discuss an important component \nof the patent reform legislation that protects against frivolous and \nvexatious litigation arising from qui tam suits for false patent \nmarkings. The bill before the Senate abolishes this qui tam procedure \nand I would like to discuss why I support doing so, even though I am \ngenerally a strong proponent of using the qui tam mechanism to protect \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act specifically allow the \ngovernment to intervene and control litigation when the government has \nbeen harmed through false or fraudulent billing. The qui tam provisions \nof the patent law do not.\n  In fact, a recent Federal court decision struck down the qui tam \nprovisions of the patent law as unconstitutional because the false \npatent marking statute does not give the executive branch sufficient \ncontrol over the litigation to ensure that the President can ``take \nCare that the Laws be faithfully executed.''\n  As I mentioned, the False Claims Act is completely different. The \nJustice Department has the right to intervene, to prosecute, or to \ndismiss a False Claims Act qui tam. I was instrumental in ensuring such \ncontrols on frivolous lawsuits were inserted into the False Claims Act \nand the absence of similar controls in the false patent marking law is \nproblematic.\n  I would not want anyone watching the patent reform bill to conclude \nthat Congress will weaken or undermine the False Claims Act qui tam \nstatute because we have stricken a flawed qui tam provision in the \npatent bill. I will vigorously defend the False Claims Act and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same. The False Claims Act is the Federal \nGovernment's strongest weapon to protecting the taxpayer dollars from \nfraud and abuse. It would be a serious miscalculation for anyone to \nimply or attempt to characterize my support for the removal of the \npatent qui tam as a starting point for striking or reforming the False \nClaims Act qui tam provisions.\n  The False Claims Act qui tam provisions have helped the Federal \nGovernment recover over $28 billion since I amended it to add the qui \ntam provisions in 1986. With the recent amendments to the False Claims \nAct that I, along with Senator Leahy, included in the Fraud Enforcement \nand Recovery Act of 2009, the False Claims Act will continue to serve \nas the Federal Government's most valuable tool to combat fraud in \ngovernment programs for decades to come.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few comments about the \npresent bill, which has now been retitled the ``America Invents Act.'' \nThis bill is almost identical to the managers' amendment that was \nnegotiated by Chairman Leahy and then-Ranking Member Sessions during \nthe last Congress and announced in March 2010. I cosponsored and \nstrongly supported that managers' amendment, which substantially \naddressed all of the concerns that Senators Feingold, Coburn, and I \nraised in our Minority Report to the 2009 committee report for the \nbill, Senate Report 111-18, at pages 53 through 61. As the bill was \nrenegotiated in the fall of 2009 and early 2010, improvements and \ncorrections were made throughout the bill, and a number of new \nprovisions were added. I would like to take a moment to comment on some \nof those changes and additions.\n  In section 2(a) of the bill, the definition of ``effective filing \ndate'' in section 100(i) has been modified in several ways. In \nsubparagraph (A), the word ``actual'' is added before ``filing date.'' \nWhen the word ``filing date'' is used in current law, it is sometimes \nused to mean the actual filing date and sometimes used to mean the \neffective filing date. Since section 100 is a definitional section, it \nshould be clear in its language, and thus the word ``actual'' is added \nin order to avoid a lingering ambiguity. Also, the language of \nsubparagraph (B) is streamlined to clarify that a patent gets the \nbenefit or priority of an earlier application if it is entitled to such \nbenefit or priority as to the invention in question under the relevant \ncode sections, which require satisfaction of the requirements of \nsection 112(a), a specific reference to the prior application, and \ncopendency.\n  The new language makes it clear that the definition of effective-\nfiling date does not create new rules for entitlement to priority or \nthe benefit of an earlier filing date. Rather, the definition simply \nincorporates the rules created by existing code sections. Also, since \nthose rules expressly require an enabling disclosure, there is no need \nto separately require such disclosure in this definition, and thus the \nreference at the end of subparagraph (B) to the first paragraph of \nsection 112 that appeared in earlier versions of the bill is dropped. \nKeeping that citation would have created a negative implication that \nunless such a requirement of section 120 was expressly incorporated \ninto the definition of effective-filing date, then such requirement \nneed not be satisfied in order to secure the benefit of an earlier \neffective-filing date.\n  It should be noted that, for purposes of subparagraph (A) of section \n100(i)(1), a patent or application for patent contains a claim to an \ninvention even if the claim to the particular invention was added via \nan amendment after the application was filed. Of course, such an \namendment may not introduce new matter into the application--it may \nonly claim that which was disclosed in the application.\n  Finally, new section 100(i)(2) of title 35 governs the effective date \nof reissued patents. Consistent with section 251, this new paragraph \neffectively treats the reissue as an amendment to the patent, which is \nitself treated as if it were a still-pending application. It bears \nemphasis that the first paragraph of section 251, which is designated \nas subsection (a) by this bill, bars the introduction of new matter in \nan application for reissue. Moreover, paragraph (3) of section 251, now \ndesignated as section 251(c), makes the rules governing applications \ngenerally applicable to reissues. A reissue is treated as an amendment \nto the patent, and the last sentence of section 132(a) bars the \nintroduction of new matter in an amendment. See In re Rasmussen, 650 \nF.2d 1212, 1214-15, CCPA 1981. Thus a claim that relies for its support \non new matter introduced in a reissue would be invalid.\n  Section 2(b) of the bill recodifies section 102 of title 35. In the \npresent bill, this recodification is reorganized by\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n\nconsolidating all exceptions to the definition of prior art in section \n102(b)--and excluding from subsection (b) provisions that do not define \nexceptions to prior art, such as the CREATE Act and the definition of \nthe effective date of patents and applications cited as prior art. Thus \nwhat previously appeared as section 102(a)(1)(B) in earlier versions of \nthe bill is now 102(b)(1)(A), and former paragraphs (3) and (4) of \nsubsection (b) are now subsections (c) and (d), respectively.\n  Also, the wording of subparagraph (B) of section 102(b)(2), which \nappeared at the same place in earlier versions of the bill, is changed \nso that it tracks the wording of subparagraph (B) of subsection (b)(1). \nThese two subparagraph (B)s are intended to operate in the same way, \nand their previous differences in wording, although not substantive, \ntended to create an implication that they were intended to operate in \ndifferent ways.\n  Under the first subparagraph (B), at section 102(b)(1)(B), if an \ninventor publicly discloses his invention, no subsequent disclosure \nmade by anyone, regardless of whether the subsequent discloser obtained \nthe subject matter from the inventor, will constitute prior art against \nthe inventor's subsequent application for patent in the United States. \nThe parallel provision at section 102(b)(2)(B) applies the same rule to \nsubsequent applications: if the inventor discloses his invention, a \nsubsequently filed application by another will not constitute prior art \nagainst the inventor's later-filed application for patent in the United \nStates, even if the other filer did not obtain the subject matter from \nthe first-disclosing inventor. And of course, the inventor's earlier \ndisclosure will constitute prior art that invalidates the other filer's \nsubsequent application.\n\n  In other words, under the regime of the two subparagraph (B)s, an \ninventor's disclosure of his invention to the public not only \ninvalidates anyone else's subsequently filed application, but no one \nelse's subsequent disclosure or filing of an application during the 1-\nyear grace period will constitute prior art against that inventor's \napplication. The bill thus effectively creates a ``first to publish'' \nrule that guarantees patent rights in the United States to whoever \ndiscloses the invention to the public first.\n  Of course, until the Europeans and the Japanese adopt a more \nsubstantial grace period, an inventor's pre-filing disclosure will \nprevent patenting in Europe and Japan. An inventor who is concerned \nabout protecting his invention from theft, but who also wants to \npreserve his rights overseas, can instead file a provisional \napplication in the United States. This inexpensive alternative protects \nthe inventor's rights both in the United States and abroad.\n  Another change that this bill makes to chapter 10 is that the CREATE \nAct, formerly at section 103(c) of title 35, has been moved to section \n102(c). The present bill departs from earlier versions of the bill by \ngiving the CREATE Act is own subsection and making several clarifying \nand technical changes. In particular, the citation at the end of the \nchapeau is made more specific, and in paragraph (1) the words ``was \ndeveloped'' are added because subject matter is not always ``made,'' \nbut is always ``developed.'' Also in the same paragraph, the reference \nto ``parties'' is replaced with ``1 or more parties'', to further \nclarify that not all parties to the joint research agreement need have \nparticipated in developing the prior art or making the invention. \nFinally, as noted previously, the definition of ``joint research \nagreement'' is moved to section 100, which contains other definitions \nrelevant to CREATE. As section 2(b)(2) of this bill notes, these \nchanges are made with the same ``intent'' to promote joint-research \nactivities that animated the CREATE Act. None of the changes in this \nlegislation alter the meaning of the original law.\n  The present bill's new subsection 102(d) of title 35 makes several \nchanges to earlier bills' version of this provision. Specifically, the \nchapeau of this subsection, which defines the effective date of patents \nand applications cited as prior art, is modified in the first clause by \nexpressly stating the purpose of this subsection, and by otherwise \nclarifying the language employed. In paragraph (1), a clause is added \nat the outset to make clear that the paragraph applies only if \nparagraph (2) does not apply. Paragraph (2) is unmodified save for the \nnonsubstantive addition of a comma.\n  Though the language of section 102(d)(2) remains unchanged from \nearlier versions of the bill, that language deserves some comment. \nParagraph (2) is intended to overrule what remains of In re Wertheim, \n646 F.2d 527 (CCPA 1981), which appeared to hold that only an \napplication that could have become a patent on the day that it was \nfiled can constitute prior art against another application or patent. \nSee id. at 537, noting that:\n\n       If, for example, the PTO wishes to utilize against an \n     applicant a part of that patent disclosure found in an \n     application filed earlier than the date of the application \n     which became the patent, it must demonstrate that the \n     earlier-filed application contains sections 120/112 support \n     for the invention claimed in the reference patent. For if a \n     patent could not theoretically have issued the day the \n     application was filed, it is not entitled to be used against \n     another as `secret prior art,' the rationale of Milburn being \n     inapplicable.\n\n  Wertheim, however, was already almost completely overruled by the \nAmerican Inventors Protection Act of 1999, Public Law 106-113, which, \nby making any published application prior art, effectively displaced \nWertheim's requirement that the application have been capable of \nbecoming a patent on the day that it was filed. Two recent BPAI \ndecisions, Ex parte Yamaguchi, 88 U.S.P.Q.2d 1606, BPAI 2008, and Ex \nparte Jo Anne Robbins, 2009 WL 3490271, BPAI October 26, 2009, confirm \nthis overruling, holding that any application that is ultimately \npublished is prior art as of its filing date, and that provisional \napplications--which typically cannot become patents as filed--also are \nprior art. See Robbins at page *4, noting that ``[i]n our opinion, a \npublished patent application which is statutorily destined to be \npublished constitutes prior art for all that it discloses on its \nearliest filing date,'' and Yamaguchi at page 9, noting that ``a \nprovisional application--like a regular utility application--\nconstitutes prior art for all that it teaches,'' and the same case at \npage 13, Judge Torczon concurring that ``[i]f [the majority] is \ncorrect, In re Wertheim is no longer tenable authority.'' Moreover, \nthese BPAI decisions' holding that a patent has a patent-defeating \neffect as of the filing date of the provisional application to which it \nclaims priority was recently affirmed by the Federal Circuit in In re \nGiacomini, 612 F.3d 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2010).\n  The caselaw also teaches that parent applications to the published \napplication set the effective date of the prior art if they describe \nthe invention and the invention is enabled before the filing of the \npatent under review, even if that prior-art description, standing \nalone, may not be adequate to show enablement. This point is \nillustrated by Application of Samour, 571 F.2d 559, CCPA 1978, which \nholds that prior art must be enabled before the effective filing date \nof the application or patent under review, but this enablement need not \nbe disclosed at the same place and time as the primary reference relied \non as prior art--and can even come later than the primary reference, so \nlong as it still comes before the effective-filing date of the \napplication under review. Samour at page 563, notes that:\n\n     we do not believe that a reference showing that a method of \n     preparing the claimed subject matter would have been known \n     by, or would have been obvious to, one of ordinary skill in \n     the pertinent art, must antedate the primary reference. The \n     critical issue under 35 U.S.C. Sec. 102(b) is whether the \n     claimed subject matter was in possession of the public more \n     than one year prior to applicant's filing date, not whether \n     the evidence showing such possession came before or after the \n     date of the primary reference.\n\n  Technically, In re Wertheim still controls the prior-art effect of \nthe limited universe of applications that are not published before they \nare patented, but the Office's examination guidelines ignore even this \nvestigial effect, and extend prior-art effect to all prior applications \nthat describe an invention as of the date of their filing. MPEP \n21360.03, part IV, which notes that:\n\n       For prior art purposes, a U.S. patent or patent application \n     publication that claims the benefit of an earlier filing date \n     under 35 U.S.C. 120 of a prior nonprovisional application \n     would be accorded the earlier filing date as its prior art \n     date under 35 U.S.C. 102(e), provided the earlier-filed \n     application properly supports the subject matter relied upon \n     in any rejection in compliance with 35 U.S.C. Sec. 112, first \n     paragraph.\n\n\n[[Page S1370]]\n\n\n  A prior-art parent application, however, must be copendent, have some \ncontinuity of disclosure, and be specifically referred to in the patent \nor published application. The continuous disclosure must be a \ndescription of the subject matter that is relied on as prior art. That \ndescription can become narrower in the intervening applications. But so \nlong as there is still some description of the subject matter in the \nintervening applications, the Office can rely on an earlier \napplication's fuller description as prior art.\n  The language of paragraph (2) is somewhat indirect in its imposition \nof these requirements. They are mostly incorporated through the \nparagraph's mandate that the prior-art application be ``entitled to \nclaim * * * priority or benefit'' under section 120 et al. In section \n100(i), which defines the effective-filing date of the patent under \nreview, the patent must be entitled to the priority or benefit itself \nunder the relevant sections. Here again in section 102(d), however, the \napplication need only be entitled to claim the benefit or priority \nunder those sections. This difference in language, which offers an \nexcellent example of why people hate lawyers, distinguishes between the \ncore requirement of section 120 et al.--that the application include an \nenabling disclosure--and the ministerial requirements of that section--\nthat the application be copendent and specifically referenced. In \neffect, an application that meets the ministerial requirements of \ncopendency and specific reference is entitled to claim the benefit or \npriority, but only an application that also offers an enabling \ndisclosure is actually entitled to the benefit or priority itself. The \nlanguage of paragraph (2) also expressly requires that the earliest \napplication ``describe'' the subject matter, and the Office has \ntraditionally required that this disclosure be continuous, as discussed \nabove.\n  Paragraph (2) can be criticized as codifying current BPAI common law \nand examination practice without fully describing that practice. \nHowever, a fully descriptive codification of the principles codified \ntherein would be unduly long, requiring repetition of the already \nsomewhat inelegant language of section 120.\n  Another aspect of the bill's changes to current section 102 also \nmerits special mention. New section 102(a)(1) makes two important \nchanges to the definition of non-patent prior art. First, it lifts \ncurrent law's geographic limits on what uses, knowledge, or sales \nconstitute prior art. And second, it limits all non-patent prior art to \nthat which is available to the public. This latter change is clearly \nidentified in Senate Report 110-259, the report for S. 1145, the \npredecessor to this bill in the 110th Congress. The words ``otherwise \navailable to the public'' were added to section 102(a)(1) during that \nCongress's Judiciary Committee mark up of the bill. The word \n``otherwise'' makes clear that the preceding clauses describe things \nthat are of the same quality or nature as the final clause--that is, \nalthough different categories of prior art are listed, all of them are \nlimited to that which makes the invention ``available to the public.'' \nAs the committee report notes at page 9, ``the phrase `available to the \npublic' is added to clarify the broad scope of relevant prior art, as \nwell as to emphasize the fact that it [i.e., the relevant prior art] \nmust be publicly available.'' In other words, as the report notes, \n``[p]rior art will be measured from the filing date of the application \nand will include all art that publicly exists prior to the filing date, \nother than disclosures by the inventor within one year of filing.''\n\n  The Committee's understanding of the effect of adding the words ``or \notherwise available to the public'' is confirmed by judicial \nconstruction of this phraseology. Courts have consistently found that \nwhen the words ``or otherwise'' or ``or other'' are used to add a \nmodifier at the end of a string of clauses, the modifier thus added \nrestricts the meaning of the preceding clauses. Strom v. Goldman, Sachs \n& Co., 202 F.3d 138, 146-47, Second Cir. 1999, states that:\n\n       The position of the phrase `or any other equitable relief' \n     in the sentence in which it appears indicates that it \n     modifies one or both of the two specific remedies referred to \n     just before it in the same sentence * * * [T]he use of the \n     words `other' immediately after the reference to back pay and \n     before `equitable relief' demonstrated Congress' \n     understanding that the back pay remedy is equitable in \n     nature.\n\n  Strom construed the phrase ``may include * * * back pay, * * * or any \nother equitable relief.'' Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes, \n111 F.Supp.2d 294, 325, S.D.N.Y. 2000, holds that:\n\n       The statute makes it unlawful to offer, provide or \n     otherwise traffic in described technology. To `traffic' in \n     something is to engage in dealings in it, conduct that \n     necessarily involves awareness of the nature of the subject \n     of the trafficking. * * * The phrase `or otherwise traffic \n     in' modifies and gives meaning to the words `offer' and \n     `provide.' In consequence, the anti-trafficking provision of \n     the DMCA is implicated where one presents, holds out or makes \n     a circumvention technology or device available, knowing its \n     nature, for the purpose of allowing others to acquire it.\n\n  Reimerdes construed the phrase ``offer to the public, provide, or \notherwise traffic in any technology.'' Williamson v. Southern Regional \nCouncil, Inc., 223 Ga. 179, 184, 154 S.E.2d 21, 25 (Ga. 1967), noted \nthat:\n\n       The words `carrying on propaganda' in this statute must be \n     construed in connection with the words following it, `or \n     otherwise attempting to influence legislation.' The use of \n     the word `otherwise' indicates that `carrying on propaganda' \n     relates to `attempting to influence legislation.'\n\n  Williamson construed the phrase ``carrying on propaganda, or \notherwise attempting to influence legislation.''\n  In other words, the Judiciary Committee's design in adding the 2007 \namendment to section 102(a)(1), as expressed in the relevant committee \nreport, is consistent with the unanimous judicial construction of the \nsame turn of phrase. It appears that every court that has considered \nthis question agrees with the committee's understanding of the meaning \nof this language.\n  Moreover, the fact that the clause ``or otherwise available to the \npublic'' is set off from its preceding clauses by a comma confirms that \nit applies to both ``public use'' and ``on sale.'' Finisar Corp. v. \nDirecTV Group, Inc., 523 F.3d 1323, 1336, Fed. Cir. 2008, notes that \n``when a modifier is set off from a series of antecedents by a comma, \nthe modifier should be read to apply to each of those antecedents.'' \nThus new section 102(a)(1) imposes a public-availability standard on \nthe definition of all prior art enumerated by the bill--an \nunderstanding on which the remainder of the bill is predicated.\n  Whether an invention has been made available to the public is the \nsame inquiry that is undertaken under existing law to determine whether \na document has become publicly accessible, but is conducted in a more \ngeneralized manner to account for disclosures of information that are \nnot in the form of documents.\n\n       A document is publicly accessible if it has been \n     disseminated or otherwise made available to the extent that \n     persons interested and ordinarily skilled in the subject \n     matter or art, exercising reasonable diligence, can locate it \n     and recognize and comprehend therefrom the essentials of the \n     claimed invention without need of further research or \n     experimentation.\n\n  That is a quotation from Cordis Corp. v. Boston Scientific Corp., 561 \nF.3d 1319, 1333, Fed. Cir. 2009. That decision also states that ``[i]n \ngeneral, accessibility goes to the issue of whether interested members \nof the relevant public could obtain the information if they wanted \nto.'' See also In re Lister, 583 F.3d 1307, Fed. Cir. 2009.\n  Another important aspect of public availability or accessibility is \nthe doctrine of inherency. ``Under the doctrine of inherency, if an \nelement is not expressly disclosed in a prior art reference, the \nreference will still be deemed to anticipate a subsequent claim if the \nmissing element is necessarily present in the thing described in the \nreference, and that it would be so recognized by persons of ordinary \nskill,'' a point noted in Rosco, Inc. v. Mirror Lite Co., 304 F.3d \n1373, 1380, Fed. Cir. 2002. This doctrine applies to products sold to \nthe public as well as published references. Thus once a product is sold \non the market, any invention that is inherent to the product becomes \npublicly available prior art and cannot be patented.\n\n  The present bill's elimination of the patent forfeiture doctrines in \nfavor of a general public availability standard also limits and \nreconciles the various purposes that previously have been ascribed to \nsection 102's definition of prior art. Current 102(b), which imposes \nthe forfeiture doctrines, has been described as being ``primarily \nconcerned\n\n[[Page S1371]]\n\nwith the policy that encourages an inventor to enter the patent system \npromptly,'' a quotation from Woodland Trust v. Flowertree Nursery, \nInc., 148 F.3d 1368, 1370, Fed. Cir. 1998. And the ``overriding concern \nof the on-sale bar'' has been described as ``an inventor's attempt to \ncommercialize his invention beyond the statutory term,'' as stated in \nNetscape Communications Corp. v. Konrad, 295 F.3d 1315, 1323, Fed. Cir. \n2002.\n  By adopting the first-to-file system, however, the present bill \nalready provides ample incentive for an inventor to enter the patent \nsystem promptly. There is no need to also require forfeiture of patents \nsimply because the inventor has made some use of the invention that has \nnot made the invention available to the public. And the current on-sale \nbar imposes penalties not demanded by any legitimate public interest. \nThere is no reason to fear ``commercialization'' that merely consists \nof a secret sale or offer for sale but that does not operate to \ndisclose the invention to the public.\n  The current forfeiture doctrines have become traps for unwary \ninventors and impose extreme results to no real purpose. In \nBeachcombers International, Inc. v. Wildewood Creative Products, Inc., \n31 F.3d 1154, 1159-60, Fed. Cir. 1994, for example, an improved \nkaleidoscope was held to be ``in public use'' within the meaning of \ncurrent section 102(b) because the inventor had demonstrated the device \nto several guests at a party in her own home. And in JumpSport, Inc. v. \nJumpking, Inc., 2006 WL 2034498, Fed. Cir. July 21, 2006, the court of \nappeals affirmed the forfeiture of a patent for a trampoline enclosure \non the ground that the enclosure had been in ``public use'' because \nneighbors had been allowed to use it in the inventor's back yard. \nObviously, neither of these uses made the inventions accessible to \npersons interested and skilled in the subject matter. The only effect \nof rulings like these is to create heavy discovery costs in every \npatent case, and to punish small inventors who are unaware of the \npitfalls of the current definition of prior art.\n  The present bill's new section 102(a) precludes extreme results such \nas these and eliminates the use of the definition of prior art to \npursue varied goals such as encouraging prompt filing or limiting \ncommercialization. Instead, the new definition of prior art will serve \nonly one purpose: ``to prevent the withdrawal by an inventor of that \nwhich was already in the possession of the public,'' as noted in \nBruckelmyer v. Ground Heaters, Inc., 335 F.3d 1374, 1378, Fed. Cir. \n2006. The new definition is ``grounded on the principle that once an \ninvention is in the public domain, it is no longer patentable by \nanyone,'' as stated in SRI International, Inc. v. Internet Security \nSystems, Inc., 511 F.3d 1186, 1194, Fed. Cir. 2008.\n  The present definition thus abrogates the rule announced in Egbert v. \nLippman, 104 U.S. 333, 336 (1881), one of the more unusual patent cases \nto come before the Supreme Court. That case held that:\n\n     whether the use of an invention is public or private does not \n     necessarily depend upon the number of persons to whom its use \n     is known. If an inventor, having made his device, gives or \n     sells it to another, to be used by the donee or vendee, \n     without limitation or restriction, or injunction of secrecy, \n     and it is so used, such use is public, even though the use \n     and knowledge of the use may be confined to one person.\n\n  Egbert v. Lippman is another case whose result can fairly be \ncharacterized as extreme. The invention there was an improved corset \nspring. The evidence showed only that the inventor had given the \nimproved corset spring to one lady friend, who gave it to no other, and \nwho used it in a corset, which of course was worn under her dress. The \nU.S. Supreme Court deemed this to be a ``public use'' of the invention \nwithin the meaning of section 102(b).\n  Justice Miller dissented. He began by noting that the word ``public'' \nin section 102(b) is ``an important member of the sentence.'' Justice \nMiller went on to conclude:\n\n       A private use with consent, which could lead to no copy or \n     reproduction of the machine, which taught the nature of the \n     invention to no one but the party to whom such consent was \n     given, which left the public at large as ignorant of this as \n     it was before the author's discovery, was no abandonment to \n     the public, and did not defeat his claim for a patent. If the \n     little steep spring inserted in a single pair of corsets, and \n     used by only one woman, covered by her outer-clothing, and in \n     a position always withheld from public observation, is a \n     public use of that piece of steel, I am at a loss to know the \n     line between a private and a public use.\n\n  In this bill's revisions to section 102, vindication has finally come \nto Justice Miller, albeit 130 years late.\n  I emphasize these points about the bill's imposition of a general \npublic availability standard and its elimination of secret prior art \nbecause they are no small matter. A contrary construction of section \n102(a)(1), which allowed private and non-disclosing uses and sales to \nconstitute invalidating prior art, would be fairly disastrous for the \nU.S. patent system. First, the bill's new post-grant review, in which \nany validity challenge can be raised, would be utterly unmanageable if \nthe validity of all patents subject to review under the new system \ncontinued to depend on discovery-intensive searches for secret offers \nfor sale and non-disclosing uses by third parties. Only patents issued \nunder the new prior-art rules can be efficiently reviewed under chapter \n32.\n  Second, a general public-availability standard is a necessary \naccompaniment to this bill's elimination of geographic restrictions on \nthe definition of prior art. As unwieldy as the current rules may be, \nat least those rules allow only those secret sales and private third-\nparty uses that occur in the United States to constitute prior art. \nUnder the new regime, however, sales and uses occurring overseas will \nalso constitute prior art. A sale or use that discloses an invention to \nthe public is relatively hard to falsify. If the invention truly was \nmade available to the public by sale or use, independent validation of \nthat sale or use should be readily available. By contrast, the \nexistence of a secret offer for sale, or a nondisclosing third-party \nuse, largely will turn on the affidavits or statements of the parties \nto such an occurrence. Unfortunately, some foreign countries continue \nto have weak business ethics and few scruples about bending the rules \nto favor domestic interests over foreign competitors. A system that \nallowed foreign interests to invalidate a U.S. patent simply by \nsecuring statements from individuals that a secret offer for sale or \nnon-disclosing third-party use of the invention had occurred in a \nforeign country would place U.S. inventors at grave risk of having \ntheir inventions stolen through fraud. That is not a risk that Congress \nis willing to accept.\n  In section 2(c), the present bill, for clarity's sake, changes the \nprevious bills' recodification of section 103 of title 35 by replacing \nthe word ``though'' with ``, notwithstanding that''. The modified text \nreflects more conventional English usage. Also, in both the present \nbill and earlier versions, former subsection (b) of section 103 has \nbeen dropped, since it has already been subsumed in caselaw. And \nsubsection (c), the CREATE Act, has been moved to subsection (d) of \nsection 102.\n  In section 2(e) of the present bill, an effective date is added to \nthe repeal of statutory invention registrations. SIRs are needed only \nso long as interferences exist. The bill repeals the authority to \ninitiate interferences 18 months after the date of enactment. The added \neffective-date language also repeals SIRs 18 months after enactment, \nmaking clear that preexisting SIRs will remain effective for purposes \nof pending interferences, which may continue under this bill.\n  Section 2(e)(2) of the bill strikes the citation to section 115 from \nsection 111(b)(8)'s enumeration of application requirements that do not \napply to provisionals. This conforming change is made because, in \nsection 3 of the bill, section 115 itself has been amended so that it \nonly applies to nonprovisionals. In other words, there is no longer any \nneed for section 111(b)(8) to except out the oath requirement because \nthat requirement no longer extends to provisionals. There is no need \nfor an exception to a requirement that does not apply.\n  Sections 2(h) and (i) of the present bill make a number of changes to \nthe previous bills' treatment of remedies for derivation. These changes \nare made largely at the Patent Office's suggestion. In particular, the \nnew section 135 proceeding is simplified, the Office is given authority \nto implement the proceeding through regulations, the Office is \npermitted to stay a derivation proceeding pending an ex parte\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\nreexamintion, IPR, or PGR for the earlier-filed patent, and the Office \nis permitted but not required to institute a proceeding if the Office \nfinds substantial evidence of derivation. In lieu of a section 135 \nproceeding, parties will be allowed to challenge a derived patent \nthrough a civil action under a revised section 291.\n  New section 2(k) of the bill eliminates the qui tam remedy for false \nmarking, while allowing a party that has suffered a competitive injury \nas a result of such marking to seek compensatory damages. Section 292 \nof title 35 prohibits false patent marking and imposes a penalty of \n$500 for each such offense. Under current law, subsection (b) allows \n``any person'' to sue for the penalty, and requires only that one half \nof the proceeds of the suit shall go to the United States. Current \nsubsection (b) is, in effect, a qui tam remedy for false marking, but \nwithout any of the protections and government oversight that normally \naccompany qui tam actions.\n  The changes made by section 2(k) of the bill would allow the United \nStates to continue to seek the $500-per-article fine, and would allow \ncompetitors to recover in relation to actual injuries that they have \nsuffered as a result of false marking, but would eliminate litigation \ninitiated by unrelated, private third parties.\n  In recent years, patent attorneys have begun to target manufacturers \nof high-volume consumer products with section 292(b) actions. Since the \nfine of up to $500 is assessed for each article that is falsely marked, \nsuch litigants have an incentive to target products that are sold in \nhigh volume. Though one might assume that section 292 is targeted at \nparties that assert fictitious patents in order to deter competitors, \nsuch a scenario is almost wholly unknown to false-marking litigation. \nFalse-marking suits are almost always based on allegations that a valid \npatent that did cover the product has expired, but the manufacturer \ncontinued to sell products stamped with the patent, or allegations that \nan existing patent used to mark products is invalid or unenforceable, \nor that an existing and valid patent's claims should not be construed \nto cover the product in question.\n  Indeed, a recent survey of such suits found that a large majority \ninvolved valid patents that covered the products in question but had \nsimply expired. For many products, it is difficult and expensive to \nchange a mold or other means by which a product is marked as patented, \nand marked products continue to circulate in commerce for some time \nafter the patent expires. It is doubtful that the Congress that \noriginally enacted this section anticipated that it would force \nmanufacturers to immediately remove marked products from commerce once \nthe patent expired, given that the expense to manufacturers of doing so \nwill generally greatly outweigh any conceivable harm of allowing such \nproducts to continue to circulate in commerce.\n  Indeed, it is not entirely clear how consumers would suffer any \ntangible harm from false marking that is distinct from that suffered \nwhen competitors are deterred from entering a market. Patent marking's \nprimary purpose is to inform competitors, not consumers, that a product \nis patented. I doubt that consumers would take any interest, for \nexample, in whether a disposable plastic cup is subject to a patent, to \ntake one case recently decided by the courts. Even less clear is how \nthe consumer would be harmed by such marking, absent a deterrence of \ncompetition. Current section 292(b) creates an incentive to litigate \nover false marking that is far out of proportion to the extent of any \nharm actually suffered or the culpability of a manufacturer's conduct.\n  To the extent that false patent marking deters competition, the \nbill's revised section 292(b) allows those competitors to sue for \nrelief. This remedy should be more than adequate to deter false marking \nthat harms competition. And to the extent that false marking somehow \nharms the public in a manner distinct from any injury to competitors \nand competition, revised section 292(a) would allow the United States \nto seek relief on behalf of the public. The Justice Department can be \nexpected to be more judicious in its use of this remedy than is a \nprivate qui tam litigant seeking recovery that will benefit him \npersonally. These revisions to section 292 should restore some \nequilibrium to this field of litigation.\n  Finally, because the Federal Circuit's recent decision in Forest \nGroup, Inc. v. Bon Tool Co., 590 F.3d 1295, Fed Cir. 2009, appears to \nhave created a surge in false-marking qui tam litigation, the changes \nmade by paragraph (1) of section 2(k) of the bill are made fully \nretroactive by paragraph (2). Because the courts have had difficulty \nproperly construing effective-date language in recent years, paragraph \n(2) employs the language of section 7(b) of Public Law 109-366, the \nMilitary Commissions Act of 2006, which recently was given an \nauthoritative construction in Boumediene v. Bush, 476 F.3d 981, 987, \nD.C. Cir. 2007. As that court noted when construing effective-date \nlanguage identical to that of section 2(k)(2):\n\n       Section 7(b) could not be clearer. It states that ``the \n     amendment made by subsection (a)''--which repeals habeas \n     jurisdiction--applies to ``all cases, without exception'' \n     relating to any aspect of detention. It is almost as if the \n     proponents of these words were slamming their fists on the \n     table shouting ``When we say `all,' we mean all--without \n     exception!''\n\n  It is anticipated that courts will find the same clarity in the \nlanguage of section 2(k)(2), and will apply the revised section 292(b) \nto cases pending at any level of appeal or review.\n  Section 2(l) of the present bill modifies the statute of limitations \nfor initiating a proceeding to exclude an attorney from practice before \nthe Office. Under this provision, a section 32 proceeding must be \ninitiated either within 10 years of when the underlying misconduct \noccurred, or within 1 year of when the misconduct is reported to that \nsection of PTO charged with conducting section 32 proceedings, \nwhichever is earlier.\n  It is not entirely clear how the time limitation applies under \npresent law. A recent D.C. Circuit case, 3M v. Browner, 17 F.3d 1461 \nD.C. Cir. 1994, effectively makes the 5-year statute of limitations \nthat generally applies to enforcement of civil penalties, at 28 U.S.C. \nSec. 2462, run from the date when a violation occurred, rather than \nfrom the date when the enforcement agency first learned of the \nviolation or reasonably could have learned of it. A recent Federal \nCircuit case, Sheinbein v. Dudas, 465 F.3d 493, 496, Fed. Cir. 2006, \napplies the section 2462 5-year limitation to section 32 proceedings, \nand applies 3M v. Browner's general rule, as described by Sheinbein, \nthat ``[a] claim normally accrues when the factual and legal \nprerequisites for filing suit are in place.'' However, another court \ncase, S.E.C. v. Koenig, 557 F.3d 736, 739, 7th Cir. 2009, has recently \nheld that when a fraud has occurred, section 2462 only runs from when \nthe fraud ``could have been discovered by a person exercising \nreasonable diligence.''\n  Although the Federal Circuit appears to be inclined to follow 3M v. \nBrowner, it is not entirely clear that it would reject Koenig's \nexception for cases of fraud, Koenig having been decided subsequently \nto Sheinbein. In any event, neither rule would be entirely satisfactory \nfor section 32 proceedings. On the one hand, a strict five-year statute \nof limitations that runs from when the misconduct occurred, rather than \nfrom when it reasonably could have been discovered, would appear to \npreclude a section 32 proceeding for a significant number of cases of \nserious misconduct, since prosecution misconduct often is not \ndiscovered until a patent is enforced. On the other hand, a fraud \nexception that effectively tolls the statute of limitations until the \nfraud reasonably could have been discovered would be both overinclusive \nand underinclusive. Such tolling could allow a section 32 proceeding to \nbe commenced more than two decades after the attorney's misconduct \noccurred. This is well beyond the time period during which individuals \ncan reasonably be expected to maintain an accurate recollection of \nevents and motivations. And yet, a fraud exception would also be \nunderinclusive, since there is a substantial range of misconduct that \nPTO should want to sanction that does not rise to the level of fraud, \nwhich requires reliance on the perpetrator's misrepresentations.\n  Section 2(1) of the bill adopts neither 3M v. Browner nor Koenig's \napproach, but instead imposes an outward limit of 10 years from the \noccurrence of the misconduct for the initiation of a section 32 \nproceeding. A 10-year limit\n\n[[Page S1373]]\n\nwould appear to allow a proceeding for the vast bulk of misconduct that \nis discovered, while also staying within the limits of what attorneys \ncan reasonably be expected to remember.\n  Paragraph (2) of section 2(l) requires the Office to report to \nCongress every two years on incidents of misconduct that it becomes \naware of and would have investigated but for the 10 year limit. By \nproviding a description of the character and apparent seriousness of \nsuch incidents, these reports will alert a future Congress if there is \na need to revisit the 10-year limit. If the number and seriousness of \nsuch incidents is substantial enough, it may outweigh the interest in \nrepose with regard to such matters.\n  Section 2(m) of the present bill requires the Small Business \nAdministration to report to Congress on the expected impact of the \nfirst-to-file system on small businesses. On the one hand, some parties \nhave suggested that the first-to-file system will be relatively \nburdensome for small businesses because it will require patent \napplicants to file their applications earlier, and will require that \nmore applications be filed for a complex invention. On the other hand, \nothers have suggested that the first-to-file system will be far simpler \nand cleaner to administer, that the ability to file provisional \napplications mitigates the burden of filing earlier, and that by \ninducing American patent applicants to file earlier, the first-to-file \nsystem is more likely to result in American patents that are valid and \nhave priority elsewhere in the industrialized world.\n  Under current law, even if an American small business or independent \ninventor is legally sophisticated enough to maintain the type of third-\nparty validation that will preserve his priority under the first-to-\ninvent system, if that American inventor relies on first-to-invent \nrules to delay filing his application, he runs a serious risk that \nsomeone in another country will file an application for the same \ninvention before the American does. Because the rest of the world uses \nthe first-to-file system, even if the American inventor can prove that \nhe was the first to have possession of the invention, the foreign filer \nwould obtain the patent rights to the invention everywhere outside of \nthe United States. In today's world, patent rights in Europe and Asia \nare valuable and important and cannot be ignored.\n  Section 2(n) of the bill requires the Director to report on the \ndesirability of authorizing prior-user rights, particularly in light of \nthe adoption of a first-to-file system.\n  In section 2(o) of the bill, the time for implementing the first-to-\nfile system has been moved to 18 months, so that Congress might have an \nopportunity to act on the conclusions or recommendations of the reports \nrequired by subsections (m) and (n) before first-to-file rules are \nimplemented.\n  Subsection (o) generally adopts the Office's preferred approach to \ntransitioning to the first-to-file system. Under this approach, if an \napplication contains or contained a claim to an invention with an \neffective-filing date that is 18 months after the date of enactment of \nthe Act, the entire application is subject to the first-to-file regime. \nAs a practical matter, this allows applicants to flip their \napplications forward into the first-to-file system, but prevents them \nfrom flipping backward into the first-to-invent universe once they are \nalready subject to first-to-file rules.\n\n  New section 100(i)(2) of title 35 ensures that reissues of first-to-\ninvent patents will remain subject to first-to-invent rules. Also, \ncontinuations of first-to-invent applications that do not introduce new \nmatter will remain subject to first-to-invent rules. This last rule is \nimportant because if a continuation filed 18 months after the enactment \nof the Act were automatically subject to first-to-file rules, even if \nit introduced no new matter, the Office likely would see a flood of \ncontinuation filings on the eve of the first-to-file effective date. \nUnder subsection (o), an applicant who wants to add to his disclosure \nafter this section's 18-month effective date can choose to pull the \nwhole invention into the first-to-file universe by including the new \ndisclosure in a continuation of his pending first-to-invent \napplication, or he can choose to keep the pending application in the \nfirst-to-file world by filing the new disclosure as a separate \ninvention.\n  Paragraph (2) of subsection (o) provides a remedy in situations in \nwhich interfering patents are issued, one of which remains subject to \nfirst-to-invent rules, and the other of which was filed earlier but has \na later date of conception and has transitioned into the first-to-file \nsystem. Paragraph (2) subjects the latter patent to the first-to-invent \nrule, and allows the other patent owner and even third parties to seek \ninvalidation of that later-conceived interfering patent on that basis.\n  In section 3(a) of the present bill, the language of section 115 of \ntitle 35, the inventor's oath requirement, has been tidied up from that \nappearing in earlier versions of the bill. A grammatical error is \ncorrected, an unnecessary parenthetical is struck, and stylistic \nchanges are made.\n  In the new section 115(g), a paragraph (2) has been added that allows \nthe Director to require an applicant claiming the benefit of an \nearlier-filed application to include copies of previous inventor's \noaths used in those applications. The Office cannot begin examining an \napplication until it knows who those inventors are, since their \nidentity determines which prior art counts as prior art against the \nclaimed invention. However, a later-filed application is not currently \nrequired to name inventors. Such information is included in an \napplication data sheet, but such data sheets are not always filed--the \nrequirement is not statutory. Moreover, a later-filed application often \nwill cite to multiple prior applications under section 120, each of \nwhich may list several inventors. Thus unless the Office can require \nthe applicant to identify which oath or other statement applies to the \nlater-filed application, the Office may not be able to figure out who \nthe inventor is for that later application.\n  In new section 115(h)(2), the present bill replaces the word \n``under'' with ``meeting the requirements of'' in order to conform to \nthe formulation used later in the same sentence.\n  In section 3(a)(3) of the bill, the changes to section 111(a) are \nmodified to reflect that either an oath or declaration may be \nsubmitted.\n  In section 3(b), the present bill adds a new paragraph (2) that \nmodifies section 251 to allow an assignee who applied for a patent to \nalso seek broadening reissue of the patent within two years of its \nissue. Notwithstanding the language of the fourth paragraph of current \nsection 251, the Office currently does allow assignees to seek \nbroadening reissue, so long as the inventor does not oppose the \nreissue. The Office views such unopposed applications for reissue as \neffectively being made ``in the name'' of the inventor. Expanding an \nassignee's right to seek broadening reissue is consistent with the \nbill's changes to sections 115 and 118, which expand assignees' rights \nby allowing assignees to apply for a patent against the inventor's \nwishes. If an assignee exercises his right to apply for a patent \nagainst the inventor's wishes, there is no reason not to allow the same \nassignee to also seek a broadening reissue within the section 251 time \nlimits.\n  Turning to the issue of damages, at the end of the 110th Congress, I \nintroduced a patent reform bill, S. 3600, that proposed restrictions on \nthe use of some of the factors that are used to calculate a reasonable \nroyalty. Discussions with patent-damages experts had persuaded me that \nseveral of the metrics that are employed by litigants are unsound, \nunduly manipulable and subjective, and prone to producing excessive \nawards. The most significant of the restrictions that I proposed in S. \n3600 were limits on the use of supposedly comparable licenses for other \npatents to value the patent in suit, and limits on the use of \nstandardized measures such as the so-called rule of thumb. These \nproposals are discussed in my statement accompanying the introduction \nof S. 3600, at 154 Congressional Record S9982, S9984-85, daily ed. \nSeptember 27, 2008. I argued at the time that the only way to ensure \nthat courts and juries would stop using these metrics ``is for Congress \nto tell the courts to disallow them.''\n  It appears that I underestimated the courts' ability and willingness \nto address these problems on their own. And I certainly did not \nanticipate the speed with which they might do so. Three recent \ndecisions from the Federal Circuit\n\n[[Page S1374]]\n\nhave sharply restricted the use of licenses for supposedly comparable \npatents to value the patent in suit. Lucent Technologies, Inc. v. \nGateway, Inc., 580 F.3d 1301, 1328, Fed. Cir. 2009, makes clear that \nmere ``kinship'' in a field of technology is not enough to allow use of \nevidence of licenses for other patents. Lucent bars the use of other-\npatent licenses where there is no showing of the significance of such \nother patented inventions to their licensed products, or no showing of \nhow ``valuable or essential'' those other licensed inventions are. In a \nsimilar vein, ResQNet.com, Inc. v. Lansa, Inc., 594 F.3d 860, 870, 872, \nFed. Cir. 2010, condemns the use of ``unrelated'' licenses for other \npatents as a measure of value and makes clear that a supposedly \ncomparable license must have ``an economic or other link to the \ntechnology in question.'' And Wordtech Systems, Inc. v. Integrated \nNetwork Solutions, Inc., 609 F.3d 1308, 1320, Fed. Cir. 2010, recently \nreiterated that ``comparisons of past patent licenses to the \ninfringement must account for the technological and economic \ndifferences between them.''\n\n  And just two months ago, I was particularly pleased to see the \nFederal Circuit announce, in Uniloc USA, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.,____ \nF.3d____, 2011 WL 9738, Fed. Cir. 2011, that the ``court now holds as a \nmatter of Federal Circuit law that the 25 percent rule of thumb is a \nfundamentally flawed tool for determining a baseline royalty rate in a \nhypothetical negotiation.'' The court ruled that testimony based on the \nrule of thumb is inadmissible under the Daubert standard.\n  The rule of thumb is a particularly arbitrary and inaccurate measure \nof patent value. I am glad to see that it will no longer be used.\n  The Lucent case that I quoted earlier also struck down a damages \naward that was based on the entire market value of the infringing \nproduct. The court did so because there was no substantial evidence \nthat the patented invention was the basis for consumer demand for the \nproduct. See Lucent, 580 F.3d at 1337-38. This holding addresses one of \nthe principal complaints that I have heard about patent-damages \ncalculations. And it effects a reform that Congress itself cannot \nenact. Existing law already required that the invention be the basis \nfor consumer demand before damages can be assessed on the whole \nproduct, and the law already required parties to support their \ncontentions with legally sufficient evidence. Congress can change the \nunderlying law, but it cannot make the courts enforce it. The Lucent \ncase did so.\n  The limits that I had proposed in S. 3600 on the use of metrics such \nas the rule of thumb, and that bill's restrictions on the use of \nlicenses for comparable patents to value the patent in suit, are \nrendered superfluous by these intervening judicial decisions. The \npresent bill appropriately leaves patent-damages law to common law \ndevelopment in the courts.\n  The present bill also makes no changes to the standard for awards of \ntreble damages. As noted in the Minority Report to the committee report \nfor the 2009 bill, Senate Report 111-18 at pages 58-60, that bill's \ngrounds for allowing awards of treble damages were exceedingly narrow, \nand its safe harbors were overly broad. That bill would have created \nimmunity from willfulness damages even for an infringer who was fully \naware of a patent and had no real doubts as to its validity. It also \ncreated immunity, in some cases, even for infringers who had engaged in \nwanton conduct such as deliberate copying.\n  Awards of enhanced damages play an important role in the U.S. patent \nsystem. It is not uncommon that a manufacturer will find itself in a \nsituation where it feels great pressure to copy a competitor's patented \ninvention. In a typical scenario, the sales staff report that they are \nlosing sales because the competitor's product has a particular feature. \nThe manufacturer's engineers discover that the feature is protected by \na valid patent, and they find that they are unable to produce the same \nfeature without infringing the patent. The company then has two \nchoices. It can choose to continue to try to reproduce or substitute \nfor the patented feature, and as it does so, continue to lose market \nshare, and in some cases, lose convoyed sales of associated products or \nservices. Or it can choose to infringe the competitor's patent.\n  Treble damages are authorized in order to deter manufacturers from \nchoosing the second option. Absent the threat of treble damages, many \nmanufacturers would find that their most financially reasonable option \nis simply to infringe patents. Lost-profits damages are often hard to \nprove or unavailable. The patent owner is always entitled to a \nreasonable royalty, but under that standard, the infringer often can \nkeep even some of the profits produced by his infringing behavior. \nWithout treble damages, many companies would find it economically \nrational to infringe valid patents. Section 284's authorization of \ntreble damages is designed to persuade these companies that their best \neconomic option is to respect valid patents.\n  If patents were routinely ignored and infringed, the patent system \nwould cease to be of use to many companies and other entities that do \nsome of our nation's most important research and development. These \ncompanies are profitable because people respect their patents and \nvoluntarily pay a license. They would not be viable enterprises if they \nalways had to sue in order to get paid for others' use of their \npatented inventions.\n  By dropping the 2009 bill's restrictions on treble-damages awards, \nthe present bill preserves these awards' role as a meaningful deterrent \nto reckless or wanton conduct. Ultimately, we want a treble-damages \nstandard that creates an environment where the most economically \nreasonable option for a party confronted by a strong patent is to take \na license--and where no one thinks that he can get away with copying.\n  Section 4(c) of the present bill adds a new section 298 to title 35. \nThis section bars courts and juries from drawing an adverse inference \nfrom an accused infringer's failure to obtain opinion of counsel as to \ninfringement or his failure to waive privilege and disclose such an \nopinion. The provision is designed to protect attorney-client privilege \nand to reduce pressure on accused infringers to obtain opinions of \ncounsel for litigation purposes. It reflects a policy choice that the \nprobative value of this type of evidence is outweighed by the harm that \ncoercing a waiver of attorney-client privilege inflicts on the \nattorney-client relationship. Permitting adverse inferences from a \nfailure to procure an opinion or waive privilege undermines frank \ncommunication between clients and counsel. It also feeds the cottage \nindustry of providing such opinions--an industry that is founded on an \nunhealthy relationship between clients and counsel and which amounts to \na deadweight loss to the patent system. Some lawyers develop a \nlucrative business of producing these opinions, and inevitably become \naware that continued requests for their services are contingent on \ntheir opinions' always coming out the same way--that the patent is \ninvalid or not infringed. Section 298 reflects legislative skepticism \nof the probative value of such opinions.\n  Section 298 applies to findings of both willfulness and intent to \ninduce infringement--and thus legislatively abrogates Broadcom Corp. v. \nQualcomm Inc., 543 F.3d 683, Fed. Cir. 2008. That case held, at page \n699, that:\n\n       Because opinion-of-counsel evidence, along with other \n     factors, may reflect whether the accused infringer `knew or \n     should have known' that its actions would cause another to \n     directly infringe, we hold that such evidence remains \n     relevant to the second prong of the intent analysis. \n     Moreover, we disagree with Qualcomm's argument and further \n     hold that the failure to procure such an opinion may be \n     probative of intent in this context.\n\n  Section 5 of the bill has been substantially reorganized and modified \nsince the 2009 bill. In general, the changes to this part of the bill \naim to make inter partes and post-grant review into systems that the \nPatent Office is confident that it will be able to administer. The \nchanges also impose procedural limits on post-grant administrative \nproceedings that will prevent abuse of these proceedings for purposes \nof harassment or delay.\n  Accused infringers, however, also will benefit from some of the \nchanges made by the present bill. The bill eliminates current law's \nrequirement, at section 317(b) of title 35, that an inter partes \nreexamination be terminated if litigation results in a final judgment. \nIt also removes the bar on challenging pre-1999 patents in inter partes \nproceedings. All patents can now be challenged in inter partes review.\n  In addition, the bill creates a new post-grant review in which a \npatent\n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\ncan be challenged on any validity ground during the first nine months \nafter its issue. Challengers who use this proceeding will be estopped \nin litigation from raising only those issues that were raised and \ndecided in the post-grant review, rather than all issues that could \nhave been raised, the standard employed in inter partes reexamination.\n  The present bill also softens the could-have-raised estoppel that is \napplied by inter partes review against subsequent civil litigation by \nadding the modifier ``reasonably.'' It is possible that courts would \nhave read this limitation into current law's estoppel. Current law, \nhowever, is also amenable to the interpretation that litigants are \nestopped from raising any issue that it would have been physically \npossible to raise in the inter partes reexamination, even if only a \nscorched-earth search around the world would have uncovered the prior \nart in question. Adding the modifier ``reasonably'' ensures that could-\nhave-raised estoppel extends only to that prior art which a skilled \nsearcher conducting a diligent search reasonably could have been \nexpected to discover.\n  Section 5(a) of the 2009 version of the bill, which would amend \nsection 301, has been modified and moved to section 5(g) of the bill. \nThis provision allows written statements of the patent owner regarding \nclaim scope that have been filed in court or in the Office to be made a \npart of the official file of the patent, and allows those statements to \nbe considered in reexaminations and inter partes and post-grant reviews \nfor purposes of claim construction. This information should help the \nOffice understand and construe the key claims of a patent. It should \nalso allow the Office to identify inconsistent statements made about \nclaim scope--for example, cases where a patent owner successfully \nadvocated a claim scope in district court that is broader than the \n``broadest reasonable construction'' that he now urges in an inter \npartes review.\n  The present bill preserves the agreement reached in the 2009 \nJudiciary Committee mark up to maintain the current scope of inter \npartes proceedings: only patents and printed publications may be used \nto challenge a patent in an inter partes review.\n  One important structural change made by the present bill is that \ninter partes reexamination is converted into an adjudicative proceeding \nin which the petitioner, rather than the Office, bears the burden of \nshowing unpatentability. Section 5(c) of the previous bill eliminated \nlanguage in section 314(a) that expressly required inter partes \nreexamination to be run as an examinational rather than adjudicative \nproceeding, but failed to make conforming changes eliminating \nprovisions in section 314(b) that effectively would have required inter \npartes reexamination to still be run as an examinational proceeding. In \nthe present bill, section 316(a)(4) gives the Office discretion in \nprescribing regulations governing the new proceeding. The Office has \nmade clear that it will use this discretion to convert inter partes \ninto an adjudicative proceeding. This change also is effectively \ncompelled by new section 316(e), which assigns to the petitioner the \nburden of proving a proposition of unpatentability by a preponderance \nof the evidence. Because of these changes, the name of the proceeding \nis changed from ``inter partes reexamination'' to ``inter partes \nreview.''\n  The present bill also makes changes to the petition requirements that \nappear in new sections 312(a)(5) and 322(a)(5). These sections have \nbeen modified to require petitioners to provide to the patent owner the \nsame identification of any real parties in interest or privies that is \nprovided to the Office. The Office anticipates that patent owners will \ntake the initiative in determining whether a petitioner is the real \nparty in interest or privy of a party that is barred from instituting a \nproceeding with respect to the patent.\n  Language that previously appeared as the last sentences of what are \nnow sections 312(c) and 322(c), and which stated that failure to file a \nmotion to seal will result in pleadings' being placed in the record, \nhas been struck. At best this sentence was redundant, and at worst it \ncreated an ambiguity as to whether material accompanying the pleadings \nalso would be made public absent a motion to seal.\n  Many of the procedural limits added to inter partes and post-grant \nreview by the present bill are borrowed from S. 3600, the bill that I \nintroduced in the 110th Congress. My comments accompanying the \nintroduction of that bill, at 154 Congressional Record S9982-S9993, \ndaily ed. Sept. 27, 2008, are relevant to those provisions of the \npresent bill that are carried over from S. 3600, particularly to the \nextent that the comments disclose understandings reached with the \nPatent Office, conscious use of terms of art, or the reasoning behind \nvarious provisions. Relevant passages include page S9987's discussion \nof the use of the adjudicative or oppositional model of post-grant \nreview and estoppel against parties in privity, and page S9988's \ndiscussion of what is now section 324(b)'s additional threshold for \ninstituting a post-grant review, the expectation that the Director will \nidentify the issues that satisfied the threshold for instituting an \ninter partes or post-grant review, the meaning of ``properly filed'' \nwhen used in the joinder provisions in sections 315(c) and 325(c), the \nauthorization to consolidate proceedings in sections 315(d) and 325(d), \nand the standards for discovery in sections 316(a)(6) and 326(a)(5). \nAlso relevant is page S9991's discussion of the excesses and effects of \ninequitable-conduct litigation, which informs this bill's provisions \nrelating to that doctrine.\n  Among the most important protections for patent owners added by the \npresent bill are its elevated thresholds for instituting inter partes \nand post-grant reviews. The present bill dispenses with the test of \n``substantial new question of patentability,'' a standard that \ncurrently allows 95% of all requests to be granted. It instead imposes \nthresholds that require petitioners to present information that creates \nserious doubts about the patent's validity. Under section 314(a), inter \npartes review will employ a reasonable-likelihood-of-success threshold, \nand under section 324(a), post-grant review will use a more-likely-\nthan-not-invalidity threshold.\n  Satisfaction of the inter partes review threshold of ``reasonable \nlikelihood of success'' will be assessed based on the information \npresented both in the petition for review and in the patent owner's \nresponse to the petition. The ``reasonable likelihood'' test is \ncurrently used in evaluating whether a party is entitled to a \npreliminary injunction, and effectively requires the petitioner to \npresent a prima facie case justifying a rejection of the claims in the \npatent.\n  Post-grant review uses the ``more likely than not invalid'' test. \nThis slightly higher threshold is used because some of the issues that \ncan be raised in post-grant review, such as enablement and section 101 \ninvention issues, may require development through discovery. The Office \nwants to ensure that petitioners raising such issues present a complete \ncase at the outset, and are not relying on obtaining information in \ndiscovery in the post-grant review in order to satisfy their ultimate \nburden of showing invalidity by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  Subsections (a) and (b) of sections 315 and 325 impose time limits \nand other restrictions when inter partes and post-grant review are \nsought in relation to litigation. Sections 315(a) and 325(a) bar a \nparty from seeking or maintaining such a review if he has sought a \ndeclaratory judgment that the patent is invalid. This restriction \napplies, of course, only if the review petitioner has filed the civil \naction. These two subsections (a) do not restrict the rights of an \naccused infringer who has been sued and is asserting invalidity in a \ncounterclaim. That situation is governed by section 315(b), \nwhich provides that if a party has been sued for infringement and wants \nto seek inter partes review, he must do so within 6 months of when he \nwas served with the infringement complaint.\n\n  Section 325(b) provides that if a patent owner sues to enforce his \npatent within three months after it is granted, a court cannot refuse \nto consider a motion for a preliminary injunction on the basis that a \npost-grant review has been requested or instituted. A patent owner who \nsues during this period is likely to be a market participant who \nalready has an infringer intruding on his market, and who needs an \ninjunction in order to avoid irreparable harm.\n\n[[Page S1376]]\n\nThis provision strengthens and carries over to post-grant review the \nrule of Procter & Gamble Co. v. Kraft Foods Global, Inc., 549 F.3d 842, \nFed. Cir. 2008.\n  Sections 315(c) and 325(c) allow joinder of inter partes and post-\ngrant reviews. The Office anticipates that joinder will be allowed as \nof right--if an inter partes review is instituted on the basis of a \npetition, for example, a party that files an identical petition will be \njoined to that proceeding, and thus allowed to file its own briefs and \nmake its own arguments. If a party seeking joinder also presents \nadditional challenges to validity that satisfy the threshold for \ninstituting a proceeding, the Office will either join that party and \nits new arguments to the existing proceeding, or institute a second \nproceeding for the patent. The Director is given discretion, however, \nover whether to allow joinder. This safety valve will allow the Office \nto avoid being overwhelmed if there happens to be a deluge of joinder \npetitions in a particular case.\n  In the second sentence of section 325(d), the present bill also \nauthorizes the Director to reject any request for ex parte \nreexamination or petition for post-grant or inter partes review on the \nbasis that the same or substantially the same prior art or arguments \npreviously were presented to the Office. This will prevent parties from \nmounting attacks on patents that raise issues that are substantially \nthe same as issues that were already before the Office with respect to \nthe patent. The Patent Office has indicated that it currently is forced \nto accept many requests for ex parte and inter partes reexamination \nthat raise challenges that are cumulative to or substantially overlap \nwith issues previously considered by the Office with respect to the \npatent.\n  The second sentence of section 325(d) complements the protections \nagainst abuse of ex parte reexamination that are created by sections \n315(e) and 325(e). The estoppels in subsection (e) will prevent inter \npartes and post-grant review petitioners from seeking ex parte \nreexamination of issues that were raised or could have been raised in \nthe inter partes or post-grant review. The Office has generally \ndeclined to apply estoppel, however, to an issue that is raised in a \nrequest for inter partes reexamination if the request was not granted \nwith respect to that issue. Under section 325(d), second sentence, \nhowever, the Office could nevertheless refuse a subsequent request for \nex parte reexamination with respect to such an issue, even if it raises \na substantial new question of patentability, because the issue \npreviously was presented to the Office in the petition for inter partes \nor post-grant review.\n  Under paragraph (1) of sections 315(e) and 325(e), a party that uses \ninter partes or post-grant review is estopped from raising in a \nsubsequent PTO proceeding any issue that he raised or reasonably could \nhave raised in the post-grant or inter partes review. This effectively \nbars such a party or his real parties in interest or privies from later \nusing inter partes review or ex parte reexamination against the same \npatent, since the only issues that can be raised in an inter partes \nreview or ex parte reexamination are those that could have been raised \nin the earlier post-grant or inter partes review. The Office recognizes \nthat it will need to change its regulations and require that ex parte \nreexamination requesters identify themselves to the Office in order for \nthe Office to be able to enforce this new restriction.\n  The present bill also incorporates S. 3600's extension of the \nestoppels and other procedural limits in sections 315 and 325 to real \nparties in interest and privies of the petitioner. As discussed at 154 \nCongressional Record S9987, daily ed. Sept. 27, 2008, privity is an \nequitable rule that takes into account the ``practical situation,'' and \nshould extend to parties to transactions and other activities relating \nto the property in question. Ideally, extending could-have-raised \nestoppel to privies will help ensure that if an inter partes review is \ninstituted while litigation is pending, that review will completely \nsubstitute for at least the patents-and-printed-publications portion of \nthe civil litigation. Whether equity allows extending privity estoppel \nto codefendants in litigation, however, will depend in large measure \nupon the actions of the patent owner, and whether he has made it \nreasonably and reliably clear which patent claims he is asserting and \nwhat they mean. If one defendant has instituted an inter partes review, \nbut other defendants do not have an opportunity to join that review \nbefore it becomes reasonably clear which claims will be litigated and \nhow they will be construed, it would be manifestly unfair to extend \nprivity estoppel to the codefendants.\n  The Office also has the authority to address such scenarios via its \nauthority under section 316(a)(5), which gives the Office discretion in \nsetting a time limit for allowing joinder. The Office has made clear \nthat it intends to use this authority to encourage early requests for \njoinder and to discourage late requests. The Office also has indicated \nthat it may consider the following factors when determining whether and \nwhen to allow joinder: differences in the products or processes alleged \nto infringe; the breadth or unusualness of the claim scope that is \nalleged, particularly if alleged later in litigation; claim-\nconstruction rulings that adopt claim interpretations that are \nsubstantially different from the claim interpretation used in the first \npetition when that petition's interpretation was not manifestly in \nerror; whether large numbers of patents or claims are alleged to be \ninfringed by one or more of the defendants; consent of the patent \nowner; a request of the court; a request by the first petitioner for \ntermination of the first review in view of strength of the second \npetition; and whether the petitioner has offered to pay the patent \nowner's costs.\n\n  Sections 316(a)(6) and 326(a)(5) prescribe standards for discovery. \nIn inter partes review, discovery is limited to deposition of witnesses \nsubmitting affidavits or declarations, and as otherwise necessary in \nthe interest of justice. In post-grant review, discovery is broader, \nbut must be limited to evidence directly related to factual assertions \nadvanced by either party. For commentary on these standards, which are \nadopted from S. 3600, see 154 Congressional Record S9988-89, daily ed. \nSept. 27, 2008.\n  Sections 316(a)(12) and 326(a)(11) provide that inter partes and \npost-grant reviews must be completed within 12 months of when the \nproceeding is instituted, except that the Office can extend this \ndeadline by 6 months for good cause. Currently, inter partes \nreexaminations usually last for 3 to 5 years. Because of procedural \nreforms made by the present bill to inter partes proceedings, the \nPatent Office is confident that it will be able to complete these \nproceedings within one year. Among the reforms that are expected to \nexpedite these proceedings are the shift from an examinational to an \nadjudicative model, and the elevated threshold for instituting \nproceedings. The elevated threshold will require challengers to front \nload their case. Also, by requiring petitioners to tie their challenges \nto particular validity arguments against particular claims, the new \nthreshold will prevent challenges from ``mushrooming'' after the review \nis instituted into additional arguments employing other prior art or \nattacking other claims.\n  Although sections 316 and 326 do not regulate when and how \npetitioners will be allowed to submit written filings once a review is \ninstituted, the Office has made clear that it will allow petitioners to \ndo so via the regulations implementing the proceedings. Sections 316 \nand 326 do clearly allow petitioners to obtain some discovery and to \nhave an oral hearing. Obviously, it would make no sense to do so if \npetitioners were not also allowed to submit written arguments. The bill \nconforms to the Office's preference, however, that it be given \ndiscretion in determining the procedures for written responses and \nother filings, in order to avoid the formalism of current chapter 31, \nwhich adds substantially to the delays in that proceeding.\n  The bill also eliminates intermediate administrative appeals of inter \npartes proceedings to the BPAI, instead allowing parties to only appeal \ndirectly to the Federal Circuit. By reducing two levels of appeal to \njust one, this change will substantially accelerate the resolution of \ninter partes cases.\n  Sections 5(c)(2)(C) and 5(c)(3) of the bill provide for a transition \nfrom current inter partes reexamination to new inter partes review. To \nprotect the Office from being overwhelmed by the\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\nnew inter partes and post-grant proceedings, sections 5(c)(2)(C) and \n5(f)(2) allow the Director to place a limit on the number of post-grant \nand inter partes reviews that will be instituted during the first four \nyears that the proceedings are in effect. It is understood that if the \nOffice rejects a petition during this period because of this numerical \nlimit, it will make clear that the rejection was made because of this \nlimit and not on the merits of the validity challenges presented in the \npetition. Otherwise, even a challenger with strong invalidity arguments \nmight be deterred from using inter partes or post-grant review by fear \nthat his petition might be rejected because of the numerical limit, and \nthe fact of the rejection would then be employed by the patent owner in \ncivil litigation to suggest that the experts at the Patent Office found \nno merit in the challenger's arguments.\n  Similarly, under subsection (a)(2) of sections 316 and 326, the \nOffice is required to implement the inter partes and post-grant review \nthresholds via regulations, and under subsection (b) of those sections, \nin prescribing regulations, the Office is required to take into \naccount, among other things, the Office's ability ``to timely complete \nproceedings instituted under'' those chapters. It is expected that the \nOffice will include in the threshold regulations a safety valve that \nallows the Office to decline to institute further proceedings if a high \nvolume of pending proceedings threatens the Office's ability to timely \ncomplete all proceedings. The present bill's inclusion of this \nregulations consideration in subsection (b) reflects a legislative \njudgment that it is better that the Office turn away some petitions \nthat otherwise satisfy the threshold for instituting an inter partes or \npost-grant review than it is to allow the Office to develop a backlog \nof instituted reviews that precludes the Office from timely completing \nall proceedings. Again, though, if the Office rejects a petition on the \nbasis of this subsection (b) consideration, rather than on the basis of \na failure to satisfy the substantive standards of the thresholds in \nsection 314 or 324, it is expected that Office will make this fact \nclear when rejecting the petition.\n\n  Section 5(c)(3) of the present bill applies the bill's new threshold \nfor instituting an inter partes review to requests for inter partes \nreexamination that are filed between the date of enactment of the bill \nand one year after the enactment of the bill. This is done to ensure \nthat requesters seeking to take advantage of the lax standards of the \nold system do not overwhelm the Office with requests for inter partes \nreexamination during the year following enactment of the bill.\n  Finally, section 5(h)(2) of the bill addresses an issue raised by a \nrecent publication, Charles E. Miller & Daniel P. Archibald, The \nDestructive Potential of the Senate Version of the Proposed Patent \nReform Act of 2010: The Abolition of de novo Review in Ex parte Patent \nReexaminations (circulated April 16, 2010). This article criticizes the \ndraft managers' amendment that Senators Leahy and Sessions circulated \nin March 2010 on the ground that it eliminates authority for a patent \nowner to have relief by civil action under section 145 from an adverse \ndecision in the BPAI on review of an ex parte reexamination. It is \nfairly apparent, however, that this authority was intended to be \neliminated by the amendments made by section 4605 of the American \nInventors Protection Act of 1999, Public Law 106-113, to sections 134 \nand 141 of title 35. The 2010 managers' amendment simply maintained the \nAIPA's changes to sections 134 and 141.\n  The AIPA neglected, however, to eliminate a cross reference to \nsection 145 in section 306 of title 35, which delineates the appeals \navailable from ex parte reexaminations. The maintenance of this cross \nreference in section 306 created an ambiguity as to whether the AIPA \ndid, in fact, eliminate a patent owner's right to seek remedy in the \ndistrict court under section 145 from an adverse BPAI decision on \nreview of an ex parte reexamination. See Sigram Schindler \nBeteiligungsgesellschaft mbH v. Kappos, 93 USPQ2d 1752, E.D. Va. 2009, \n(Ellis, J.), notes that ``the fact that Sec. 306 continues to cross-\nreference Sec. 141 to 145 following the AIPA's enactment appears to be \nin tension with the AIPA amendment to Sec. 141.''\n  Section 5(h)(2) of the present bill eliminates this ambiguity by \nstriking the citation to section 145 from section 306 of title 35.\n  Section 6 of the bill includes all provisions of the bill addressing \nthe jurisdiction of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board and \nadministrative and judicial appeals. In section 6(a), the \nrecodification of section 6 of title 35 is modified so that all members \nof the PTAB can participate in all proceedings. Also, subsection (d) is \nadded to the recodification of section 6 of title 35. By omitting this \nprovision, the 2009 bill would have effectively repealed the APJ \n``appointments fix'' that had been enacted in 2008.\n  In section 6(c) of the bill, section 141 of title 35 is modified to \nallow appeals of PTAB decisions in inter partes and post-grant reviews, \nand the section is edited and reorganized. To address the continuing \nneed to allow appeals of pending interferences, language has been added \nto section 5(f)(3) of the bill that deems references to derivation \nproceedings in the current appeals statutes to extend to interferences \ncommenced before the effective date of the bill's repeal of \ninterferences, and that allows the Director to deem the PTAB to be the \nBPAI for purposes of pending interferences and to allow the PTAB to \nconduct such interferences.\n  In section 6(c)(2) of the bill, section 1295(a)(4)(A) of title 28 is \nmodified to authorize appeals of reexaminations and reviews. \nInterestingly, current 1295(a)(4)(A) only gives the Federal Circuit \njurisdiction over appeals from applications and interferences. It \nappears that Congress never gave the Federal Circuit jurisdiction over \nappeals from reexaminations when it created those proceedings. The \nlanguage of subparagraph (A) is also generalized and clarified, \nrecognizing that the details of what is appealable will be in sections \n134 and 141. Also, for logical consistency, language is added to \nsubparagraph (A) making clear that section 145 and 146 proceedings are \nan exception to the Federal Circuit's otherwise exclusive appellate \njurisdiction over applications and interferences under that \nsubparagraph.\n  In section 6(c)(3) of the bill, section 143 of title 35 is modified \nto allow the Director to intervene in the appeal of a decision of the \nPTAB in an inter partes or post-grant review or a derivation \nproceeding.\n  In the effective-date provision at the end of section 6, various \nexisting authorities are extended so that they may continue to apply to \ninter partes reexaminations commenced under the old system, and the \napparent gap in current section 1295(a)(4)(A)'s authorization of \njurisdiction is immediately filled with respect to all inter partes and \nex parte reexaminations.\n  In section 7, the present bill makes several PTO-recommended changes \nto previous bill versions' authorization to make preissuance \nsubmissions of prior art. In paragraph (1) of new section 122(e) of \ntitle 35, the word ``person'' has been replaced with ``third party,'' \nso that submissions may only be submitted by third parties. This \naddresses the Office's concern that applicants might otherwise use \nsection 122(e) to submit prior art and thereby evade other examination \ndisclosure requirements.\n\n  In subparagraph (A) of section 122(e)(1), the word ``given'' has been \nadded. This has the effect of including email notices of allowances.\n  In clause (i) of section 122(e)(1)(B), the word ``first'' has been \nadded. This change was sought by the Office, which prefers to limit \nsubmissions to the first publication for two reasons. First, \nrepublications overwhelmingly only narrow the claims, and in such cases \nanyone who would want to submit prior art could have done so at the \nfirst publication. Second, and more importantly, most republications \noccur only after the first office action, when there is usually rapid \nback-and-forth action on the application between the applicant and the \nOffice. Allowing third parties to make prior-art submissions at this \npoint would require the Office to wait six months after the \nrepublication in order to allow such submissions, and would otherwise \ngreatly slow down this otherwise relatively speedy final phase of \nprosecution.\n  Also in clause (i) of section 122(e)(1)(B), the words ``by the \nOffice'' are added to ensure that only publication by the United States \nPatent and Trademark Office begins the period for\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\nmaking pre-issuance submissions. The Office sought this change because \na foreign publication can be deemed a publication under section 122, \nand the Office wants to ensure that it is only required to collect \nthird-party submissions for an application if that application is \nactually filed in the United States.\n  Section 8 of the present bill omits provisions appearing in prior \nbills that would have created an expanded right to an interlocutory \nappeal from claim-construction rulings. Even as revised in the 2009 \nJudiciary Committee mark up, previous section 8(b) gave the Federal \nCircuit insufficient discretion to turn away such appeals and posed a \nserious risk of overwhelming the court. The 2009 mark-up revisions \nallowed the Federal Circuit to reject an interlocutory appeal if it \nfound clear error in the district court's certification that there is a \nsufficient evidentiary record for an interlocutory appeal and that such \nan appeal may advance the termination of the litigation or will likely \ncontrol the outcome of the case. It would be difficult in any case, \nhowever, to reject a finding that an interlocutory appeal of claim-\nconstruction rulings may lead to the termination of the litigation. \nMoreover, if a district judge has certified a case for interlocutory \nappeal, it is very unlikely that the record that he has created would \nsupport a finding that his decision is clearly erroneous. And finally, \ngiven the disdain for patent cases felt by a substantial number of \ndistrict judges, there is a serious likelihood that a large number of \njudges would take advantage of a new authorization from Congress to \nsend away such cases to the Federal Circuit, with the hope that they do \nnot return. Current law's grant of discretion to the Federal Circuit to \nentertain interlocutory appeals of claim-construction rulings strikes \nthe appropriate balance.\n  Section 10 of the present bill authorizes supplemental examination of \na patent to correct errors or omissions in proceedings before the \nOffice. Under this new procedure, information that was not considered \nor was inadequately considered or was incorrect can be presented to the \nOffice. If the Office determines that the information does not present \na substantial new question of patentability or that the patent is still \nvalid, that information cannot be used as a basis for an inequitable-\nconduct attack on the surviving patent in civil litigation. New section \n257(c)(1) follows the usual practice of referring to inequitable-\nconduct attacks in terms of unenforceability, rather than invalidity, \nthough courts have in the past used the terms interchangeably when \ndescribing the effect of fraud or inequitable conduct on a patent. J.P. \nStevens & Co., Inc. v. Lex Tex Ltd., Inc., 747 F.2d 1553, 1560, Fed. \nCir. 1984, notes that ``[w]hether the holding should be one of \ninvalidity or unenforceability has had no practical significance in \ncases thus far presented to this court.'' The term should be considered \nto be used interchangeably with ``invalidity'' in this bill as well. \nObviously, Congress would not create a procedure for reexamining \npatents that allowed them to be protected against subsequent \ninequitable-conduct challenges of unenforceability, only to allow the \nsame patents to be challenged on the same basis and declared invalid on \nthe basis of inequitable conduct.\n  While some critics of this proposal have suggested that it would \nimmunize misconduct by inventors and practitioners, I would note that \nthe Patent Office has ample authority to sanction such misconduct. \nUnder section 32 of title 35, the Office can bar an attorney from \nappearing before the Office if he has engaged in misconduct in any \nproceeding before the Office. In section 2(l) of this bill, we have \nextended the statute of limitations for initiating such a proceeding. \nUnder current regulations, the Office also sanctions misconduct by \nstriking offending filings or reducing the weight that they are given. \nAnd the Federal Circuit has recognized that the Office also ``has \ninherent authority to govern procedure before the [Office],'' as noted \nin In re Bogese II, 303 F.3d 1362, 1368, Fed. Cir. 2002, and that \ninherent authority to sanction attorneys for misconduct is not \nrestricted to Article III courts, a point noted in In re Bailey, 182 \nF.3d 860, 864 n.4, Fed. Cir. 1999.\n  Given the Office's existing tools for sanctioning misconduct, there \nis no need to make the courts into supervisors of attorney conduct in \nOffice proceedings. It is doubtful that a practitioner who is \ndiscovered to have engaged in substantial misconduct in proceedings \nbefore the Office would escape adequate and effective sanction by the \nOffice itself.\n\n  Section 11 of the bill repeals the so-called Baldwin rule, which \nrequires judges on the Federal Circuit to live within 50 miles of \nWashington, D.C. Subsection (b) provides that the repeal of the Baldwin \nrule shall not be construed to imply that the Administrative Office of \nthe Courts must provide court facilities or administrative support \nservices to judges who choose to reside outside of the District of \nColumbia. This proviso does not affect the AOC's existing authority to \nprovide services to judges outside of the District of Columbia. Its \nreference to ``court facilities'' means space within a courthouse or \nfederal building, and the reference to ``administrative support \nservices'' means those services that would be provided to judges within \na courthouse or federal building.\n  In section 15 of the bill, a conforming subsection (b) has been added \nto ensure that the best-mode requirement cannot be used to challenge a \npatent's entitlement to a right of priority or to the benefit of an \nearlier filing date. In the new effective-date subsection, the section \nis made applicable to all ``proceedings'' commenced after enactment of \nthe Act, in order to make clear that the section's changes to the law \nwill be immediately applicable not just in litigation but also in post-\ngrant reviews of patents under chapter 32.\n  At subsections (a) through (h), section 16 of the bill has been \nmodified by reinserting language that eliminates various deceptive-\nintent requirements that relate to correcting the naming of the \ninventor or a joint inventor, obtaining a retroactive foreign filing \nlicense, seeking section 251 reissue, or enforcing remaining valid \nclaims if a claim is invalidated. See generally Kearney & Trecker Corp. \nv. Giddings & Lewis, Inc., 452 F.2d 579, 596, 7th Cir. 1971. These \nchanges were first proposed in section 5 of the original Patent Reform \nAct of 2005, H.R. 2795, 109th Congress, and have been advocated by \nuniversities and their technology-transfer offices. For reasons that \nare not entirely clear, subsequent bills maintained this section and \nits addition of substructure and titles to the affected code sections, \nbut struck the substantive part of the section--i.e., its elimination \nof the deceptive-intent requirements.\n  Eliminating the various deceptive-intent requirements moves the U.S. \npatent system away from the 19th century model that focused on the \npatent owner's subjective intent, and towards a more objective-\nevidence-based system that will be much cheaper to litigate and more \nefficient to administer.\n  Section 16(i) of the present bill corrects several errors and typos \nthroughout title 35 that are noted in the reviser's notes to the U.S. \nCode.\n  Section 16(j) strikes unnecessary references to ``of this title'' \nthat are sprinkled throughout title 35. The 1952 Act included such \nunnecessary references, but more recent additions to the code have not, \nand the current bill's changes omit such references. Because the \nunnecessary references greatly outnumber the necessary references, the \nprovision is written to strike all references but then except out the \nnecessary references.\n  The present bill's new section 17 enacts the so-called Holmes Group \nfix, H.R. 2955, 109th Congress, which was reported out of the House \nJudiciary Committee in 2006. The committee report accompanying that \nbill, House Report 109-407, explains the bill's reasons for abrogating \nHolmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U.S. \n826 (2002), and more fully precluding state court jurisdiction over \npatent legal claims.\n  Section 17 makes two modifications to the reported version of H.R. \n2955. The first modification, at subsection (c), limits the bill's \nexpansion of Federal Circuit jurisdiction to only compulsory \ncounterclaims asserting patent rights, rather than the original bill's \nexpansion of jurisdiction to include any counterclaim asserting patent \nrights. Compulsory counterclaims are defined at Rule 13(a) and \nbasically consist of counterclaims that arise out of the same \ntransaction or occurrence and that do not require the joinder of \nparties over whom the court would lack\n\n[[Page S1379]]\n\njurisdiction. A compulsory counterclaim must be raised as a \ncounterclaim in the case in question, and cannot be asserted in a later \ncase. Without this modification, it is possible that a defendant could \nraise unrelated and unnecessary patent counterclaims simply in order to \nmanipulate appellate jurisdiction. With the modification, a defendant \nwith a permissive patent counterclaim who wanted to preserve Federal \nCircuit appellate review of that counterclaim could simply wait to \nassert it in a separate action.\n  The second modification, in subsection (d), corrects an error in H.R. \n2955 that would have required remand of patent and other intellectual-\nproperty counterclaims after their removal. H.R. 2955's proposed \nremoval statute, at section 1454(c)(1) of title 28, required a remand \nto the state court of all claims that are not within the original or \nsupplemental jurisdiction of the district court. Since the bill no \nlonger amends section 1338 to give district courts original \njurisdiction over patent counterclaims, however--and since, pursuant to \nHolmes Group itself, patent counterclaims are not within the district \ncourts' original jurisdiction--then under paragraph (1), district \ncourts would be required to remand the patent counterclaims. Courts \nwould probably strain to avoid reading the paragraph this way, since \ndoing so defeats the only apparent purpose of the section, and the \namendments to section 1338 strip the state courts of jurisdiction over \npatent counterclaims. But that is exactly what H.R. 2955's proposed \n1454(c)(1) ordered the court to do. In the modified text of section \n17(d) of this bill, the court is instructed to not remand those claims \nthat were a basis for removal in the first place--that is, the \nintellectual-property counterclaims.\n  Section 18 of the bill creates an administrative mechanism for \nreviewing the validity of business-method patents. In 1998, the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in its decision in State \nStreet Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group, Inc., 149 F.3d \n1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998), substantially expanded the patentability of \nbusiness-method inventions in the United States, holding that any \ninvention can be patented so long as it produces a ``useful, concrete, \nand tangible result'' and meets other requirements of title 35. In \nrecent years, federal judicial decisions, culminating in the U.S. \nSupreme Court's decision in Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. __, 130 S.Ct. \n3218 (2010), have overruled State Street and retracted the \npatentability of business methods and other abstract inventions. This \njudicial expansion and subsequent judicial retraction of U.S. \npatentability standards resulted in the issuance, in the interim, of a \nlarge number of business-method patents that are no longer valid. \nSection 18 creates a relatively inexpensive administrative alternative \nto litigation for addressing disputes concerning the validity of these \npatents.\n  This section grew out of concerns originally raised in the 110th \nCongress about financial institutions' inability to take advantage of \nthe authority to clear checks electronically pursuant the Check \nClearing for the 21st Century Act, at chapter 50 of title 12 of the \nU.S. Code, without infringing the so-called Ballard patents, patents \nnumber 5,910,988 and 6,032,137. See generally Senate Report 110-259 at \npages 33 through 34. Once the committee began to examine this issue in \ngreater depth, however, the question quickly turned from whether the \nBallard patents should be allowed to disrupt compliance with the Check \n21 Act, to how it is that the Ballard patents were issued in the first \nplace. These patents consist of long recitations of technology created \nby others to implement the supposed ``invention'' of transmitting and \nprocessing checks and other business records electronically. The first \nof these patents was assigned to the class of cryptography inventions, \nbut its specification itself concedes that the invention's \n``controller'' will ``execute[] an encryption algorithm which is well \nknown to an artisan of ordinary skill in the field.'' The second patent \nis assigned to Class 705, home to many of the most notorious business-\nmethod patents. Both of these patents are obviously business-method \npatents, and it is difficult to see how they were even novel and \nnonobvious and otherwise valid under the more liberal State Street \nstandard, much less how they could survive the strictures of Bilski.\n\n  Section 18's definition of business-method patent, and its \nauthorization to raise prior-art challenges in the petition for review, \nare designed to allow the Office to recognize a business-method patent \nas such despite its recitation of technological elements that are not \ncolorably novel and nonobvious. This definition does not require the \nOffice to conduct a merits inquiry into the nonobviousness of a \ntechnological invention, and should not be construed in a way that \nmakes it difficult for the Office to administer. But if a technological \nelement in a patent is not even assertedly or plausibly outside of the \nprior art, the Office should not rely on that element to classify the \npatent as not being a business-method patent. Thus when patents such as \nthe Ballard patents recite elements incorporating off-the-shelf \ntechnology or other technology ``know to those skilled in the art,'' \nthat should not preclude those patents' eligibility for review under \nthis program.\n  At the request of other industry groups, section 18's definition of \n``covered business-method patent'' has been limited to those patents \nthat relate to a financial product or service. Given the protean nature \nof many business-method patents, it often will be unclear on the face \nof the patent whether it relates to a financial product or service. To \nmake such a determination, the Office may look to how the patent has \nbeen asserted. Section 5(g) of the present bill modifies section 301 of \ntitle 35 to allow any person to submit to the Office the patent owner's \nstatements in federal court or in any Office proceeding about the scope \nof the patent's claims. With this and other information, the Office \nshould be able to determine whether the patent reads on products or \nservices that are particular to or characteristic of financial \ninstitutions.\n  As the proviso at the end of the definition makes clear, business \nmethods do not include ``technological inventions.'' In other words, \nthe definition applies only to abstract business concepts and their \nimplementation, whether in computers or otherwise, but does not apply \nto inventions relating to computer operations for other uses or the \napplication of the natural sciences or engineering.\n  One feature of section 18 that has been the subject of prolonged \ndiscussion and negotiation between various groups during the last few \nweeks is its subsection (c), which concerns stays of litigation. The \ncurrent subsection (c) reflects a compromise that requires a district \njudge to consider fixed criteria when deciding whether to grant a stay, \nand provides either side with a right to an interlocutory appeal of the \ndistrict judge's decision. The appeal right has been modified to \nprovide that such review ``may be de novo,'' and in every case requires \nthe Federal Circuit to ensure consistent application of established \nprecedent. Thus whether or not every case is reviewed de novo, the \ncourt of appeals cannot simply leave the stay decision to the \ndiscretion of the district court and allow different outcomes based on \nthe predilections of different trial judges.\n  It is expected that district judges will liberally grant stays of \nlitigation once a proceeding is instituted. Petitioners are required to \nmake a high threshold showing in order to institute a proceeding, and \nproceedings are required to be completed within one year to 18 months \nafter they are instituted. The case for a stay is particularly \npronounced in a section 18 proceeding, given the expectation that most \nif not all true business-method patents are abstract and therefore \ninvalid in light of the Bilski decision.\n  In pursuit of this congressional policy strongly favoring stays when \nproceedings are instituted under this section, subsection (c) \nincorporates the four-factor test for stays of litigation that was \nfirst announced in Broadcast Innovation, L.L.C. v. Charter \nCommunications, 2006 WL 1897165, D. Colo. 2006. Broadcast Innovation \nincludes, and gives separate weight to, a fourth factor that has often \nbeen ignored by other courts: ``whether a stay will reduce the burden \nof litigation on the parties and on the court.''\n  In order to ensure consistency in decisions whether to stay, \nregardless of the court in which a section 281 action is pending, \nparagraph (2) of subsection (c) requires consistent application of\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\n``established precedent.'' This particular requirement is based on \nsection 2245(d)(1) of title 28, which has been construed to require \nlower courts to look only to a fixed body of caselaw when making \ndecisions under section 2254. Currently, district judge's decisions \nwhether to stay litigation when a reexamination has been ordered are \nnot appealable and therefore have never been reconciled by the Federal \nCircuit. Unsurprisingly, the resulting district-court caselaw is a \ndog's breakfast of different combinations of factors and different \nmeanings ascribed to those factors. Although the cases applying \nBroadcast Innovation cite other opinions applying other tests as \nsources for some of its factors, by requiring application of \n``established precedent,'' subsection (c) limits the relevant precedent \nto that applying the four factors of Broadcast Innovation in \ncombination. By requiring courts to apply this limited and relatively \nconsistent body of caselaw when determining whether to grant a stay, \nsubsection (c) should ensure predictability and stability in stay \ndecisions across different district courts, and limit the incentive to \nforum shop. The existence of forum shopping is an embarrassment to the \nlegal system. Federal courts should apply equal justice, and give \nfederal law the same meaning, regardless of where they are located.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by noting that the present bill is the \nproduct of almost a decade of hard work. The path to this bill included \nthree Senate Judiciary Committee mark ups, as well as the untold hours \ndevoted by Chairman Smith and other members of the House of \nRepresentatives to the development of the Patent Reform Act of 2005, \nthe foundation of today's bill. The present bill will protect our \nheritage of innovation while updating the patent system for the current \ncentury. It will create clear and efficient rules for defining prior \nart and establishing patent priority. It will fix problems with current \nadministrative proceedings, and create new means for improving patent \nquality. And it will move us toward a patent system that is objective, \ntransparent, clear, and fair to all parties. I look forward to the \nSenate's passage of this bill and its enactment into law.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support final \npassage on the America Invents Act. The Judiciary Committee has held \nnumerous hearings on the need for patent reform, and has done a lot of \nwork over the past several Congresses. We have had a good process on \nthe floor. We adopted several amendments to improve the bill. We had \nvotes on amendments and a pretty good open process, which we have not \nseen much of in the last few years. We have a good bipartisan bill--the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee has successfully brought Senators \nand industry together to craft this compromise legislation. Now I urge \nmy colleagues to support final passage on this important bill so we can \nconclude our work in the Senate.\n  The America Invents Act will protect inventors' rights and encourage \ninnovation and investment in our economy. It will improve transparency \nand third party participation in the patent review process, which will \nstrengthen patent quality and reduce costs. The bill will institute \nbeneficial changes to the patent approval and review process, and will \ncurb litigation abuses and improve certainty for investors and \ninnovators. It will help companies do business more efficiently on an \ninternational basis.\n  The America Invents Act will also help small entities in their patent \napplications and provide for reduced fees for microentities and small \nbusinesses. The bill will prevent patents from being issued on claims \nfor tax strategies, which can add unwarranted fees on taxpayers simply \nfor attempting to comply with the Tax Code.\n  Finally, the America Invents Act will enhance operations of the \nPatent and Trademark Office with administrative reforms and will give \nthe Office fee setting authority to reduce backlogs. It will end fee \ndiversion, which will improve the ability of the Patent and Trademark \nOffice to manage its affairs and allocate resources where they are most \nneeded.\n  I thank Chairman Leahy and Senator Hatch for their hard work on this \nbill. Without their leadership, we would not be where we are today. I \nthank Senators Kyl, Sessions, and Coburn. They were instrumental in \nmaking improvements to the bill. I also wish to acknowledge the Senate \nJudiciary Committee staff for their efforts on this bill: in \nparticular, Bruce Cohen, Aaron Cooper, and Curtis LeGeyt of Chairman \nLeahy's staff, Matt Sandgren of Senator Hatch's staff, Joe Matal of \nSenator Kyl's staff, and Sarah Beth Groshart of Senator Coburn's staff. \nI especially thank Kolan Davis and Rita Lari Jochum of my staff for \ntheir good work on this bill.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to vote for the America Invents \nAct. This is a bill that will spur inventions, create innovative new \nproducts and services, and stimulate job creation. This bill will help \nupgrade and strengthen our patent system so America can stay \ncompetitive in an increasingly global environment. I urge my colleagues \nto support this carefully crafted bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the managers' amendment to the America \nInvents Act, adopted 97-2 on March 1, contained a rule of construction \nthat nothing in section 14 of the act should be construed to imply that \nother business methods are patentable or that other business-method \npatents are valid. This provision was included merely as a \nclarification. No inference should be drawn in any way from any part of \nsection 14 of the act about the patentability of methods of doing \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, I have discussed this with the Republican leadership, \nand we are prepared to yield back all time on both the Democratic and \nRepublican sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Director \n     shall prescribe regulations setting forth standards for the \n     conduct of derivation proceedings.\n       ``(c) Deferral of Decision.--The Patent Trial and Appeal \n     Board may defer action on a petition for a derivation \n     proceeding until 3 months after the date on which the \n     Director issues a patent that includes the claimed invention \n     that is the subject of the petition. The Patent Trial and \n     Appeal Board also may defer action on a petition for a \n     derivation proceeding, or stay the proceeding after it has \n     been instituted, until the termination of a proceeding under \n     chapter 30, 31, or 32 involving the patent of the earlier \n     applicant.\n       ``(d) Effect of Final Decision.--The final decision of the \n     Patent Trial and Appeal Board, if adverse to claims in an \n     application for patent, shall constitute the final refusal by \n     the Office on those claims. The final decision of the Patent \n     Trial and Appeal Board, if adverse to claims in a patent, \n     shall, if no appeal or other review of the decision has been \n     or can be taken or had, constitute cancellation of those \n     claims, and notice of such cancellation shall be endorsed on \n     copies of the patent distributed after such cancellation.\n       ``(e) Settlement.--Parties to a proceeding instituted under \n     subsection (a) may terminate the proceeding by filing a \n     written statement reflecting the agreement of the parties as \n     to the correct inventors of the claimed invention in dispute. \n     Unless the Patent Trial and Appeal Board finds the agreement \n     to be inconsistent with the evidence of record, if any, it \n     shall take action consistent with the agreement. Any written \n     settlement or understanding of the parties shall be filed \n     with the Director. At the request of a party to the \n     proceeding, the agreement or understanding shall be treated \n     as business confidential information, shall be kept separate \n     from the file of the involved patents or applications, and \n     shall be made available only to Government agencies on \n     written request, or to any person on a showing of good cause.\n       ``(f) Arbitration.--Parties to a proceeding instituted \n     under subsection (a) may, within such time as may be \n     specified by the Director by regulation, determine such \n     contest or any aspect thereof by arbitration. Such \n     arbitration shall be governed by the provisions of title 9, \n     to the extent such title is not inconsistent with this \n     section. The parties shall give notice of any arbitration \n     award to the Director, and such award shall, as between the \n     parties to the arbitration, be dispositive of the issues to \n     which it relates. The arbitration award shall be \n     unenforceable until such notice is given. Nothing in this \n     subsection shall preclude the Director from determining the \n     patentability of the claimed inventions involved in the \n     proceeding.''.\n       (j) Elimination of References to Interferences.--(1) \n     Sections 41, 134, 145, 146, 154, 305, and 314 of title 35, \n     United States Code, are each amended by striking ``Board of \n     Patent Appeals and Interferences'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``Patent Trial and Appeal Board''.\n       (2)(A) Sections 146 and 154 of title 35, United States \n     Code, are each amended--\n       (i) by striking ``an interference'' each place it appears \n     and inserting ``a derivation proceeding''; and\n       (ii) by striking ``interference'' each additional place it \n     appears and inserting ``derivation proceeding''.\n       (B) The subparagraph heading for section 154(b)(1)(C) of \n     title 35, United States Code, as amended by this paragraph, \n     is further amended by--\n       (i) striking ``or'' and inserting ``of''; and\n       (ii) striking ``secrecy order'' and inserting ``secrecy \n     orders''.\n       (3) The section heading for section 134 of title 35, United \n     States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 134.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been many years getting to this \npoint. I cannot tell you the amount of pride I have in my fellow \nSenators, both Republicans and Democrats. I thank the Senator from Iowa \nwho has been here with me and so many others I mentioned earlier. It is \nnice to finally have this bill through the Senate.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and thank the \npatent lawyers and Senate staff who have played a critical role in the \ndrafting and enactment of the present bill.\n  Among the Senate staff who have played a role with regard to this \nbill are Chip Roy, Holt Lackey, and Zina Bash of Senator Cornyn's \nstaff, David Barlow and Rob Porter of Senator Lee's staff, Walt Kuhn of \nSenator Graham's staff, and Danielle Cutrona and Bradley Hayes of \nSenator Sessions's staff. Special mention is merited for Matt Sandgren \nof Senator Hatch's staff, who fought tenaciously for the bill's \nsupplemental examination provision, and who worked hard to defeat the \namendment to strip the bill of its adoption of the first-to-file \nsystem, and Sarah Beth Groshart of Senator Coburn's staff, who helped \ndraft the Coburn amendment, which will create a revolving fund for the \nPTO and put an end to fee diversion. Past staff who played an important \nrole include Jennifer Duck of Senator Feinstein's staff, and Ryan \nTriplette, who managed the bill for Senator Hatch while he was chairman \nand for Senator Specter while he was the lead Republican on the \ncommittee. Miss Duck and Miss Triplette negotiated the managers' \namendment that was adopted during the bill's 2009 committee mark up, \nand which represented a major breakthrough on this bill, resolving the \ncontentious issues of damages and venue. In the House of \nRepresentatives, key staff include Blaine Merritt and Vishal Amin of \nChairman Lamar Smith's staff, and Christal Sheppard of Mr. Conyers's \nstaff. Bob Schiff of Senator Feingold's staff worked with my staff to \ndevelop minority views for the bill's 2009 committee report--I believe \nthat this is the only time that Senator Feingold and I ever submitted a \nminority report together. I should also acknowledge Tim Molino of \nSenator Klobuchar's staff, Rebecca Kelly of Senator Schumer's staff, \nCaroline Holland of Senator Kohl's staff, and Galen Roehl, who worked \nin past Congresses for Senator Brownback, and who currently staffs \nSenator Toomey. Much of S. 3600 was drafted in Senator Brownback's \nconference room. Let me also recognize the work of Rob Grant of Senate \nLegislative Counsel, who has drafted literally hundreds of versions of \nand amendments to this bill. And finally, I must acknowledge Rita Lari, \nwho managed this bill for Senator Grassley on the Senate floor this \npast week, and the indispensable Aaron Cooper, who has managed the bill \nfor the chairman since the beginning of 2009.\n\n[[Page S1394]]\n\n  Among those outside the Senate, I recognize and thank Hayden Gregory \nof the American Bar Association, Laurie Self and Rod McKelvie of \nCovington & Burling, and Hans Sauer, Mike Schiffer, Bruce Burton, Matt \nRainey, David Korn, Carl Horton, Steve Miller, Doug Norman, and Stan \nFendley. The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation has played an \nimportant role, particularly with regard to the bill's enhanced grace \nperiod. I thank Carl Gulbrandsen, Howard Bremmer, Andy Cohn, and Mike \nRemington. I thank Todd Dickinson and Vince Garlock of AIPLA, and Jim \nCrowne, who was willing to come to the Senate to double check the draft \nenrolled bill. I should also mention Herb Wamsley of Intellectual \nProperty Owners, as well as Dana Colarulli, who has worn two hats \nduring the course of his work on this bill, first with IPO, and \nsubsequently as the head of legislative affairs at the PTO. Key \nparticipants at the PTO have also included Mike Fleming, John Love, Jim \nToupin, and Rob Clarke. And of course I must mention the current \nDirector, David Kappos, without whose effort and dedication the passage \nof the present bill would not have been possible.\n  Finally, allow me to acknowledge the key members of the 21st Century \nCoalition for Patent Reform, who have devoted countless hours to this \nbill, and stuck with it through thick and thin. They have also formed \nan important ``kitchen cabinet'' that has been indispensable to the \ncommittee's drafting of this bill and to the resolution of difficult \ntechnical questions. I thus acknowledge and thank Phil Johnson, Gary \nGriswold, Bob Armitage, and Mike Kirk for their key role in the \ncreation of the America Invents Act.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1394-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, as someone who voted to freeze salaries, \nto end earmarks in this budget process, as someone who has already \nvoted to cut $45 billion from the budget, I rise today in recognition \nthat business as usual cannot continue. I recognize the critical \nimportance of addressing our Federal deficit--a deficit, I would add, \ninherited by this administration, a deficit driven by two wars, both \nunpaid for, and the unprecedented need for governmental action to \nmitigate the wild excesses of Wall Street and American financial \nmarkets, excesses that were effectively condoned by the last \nadministration, whose policies took this Nation to the brink of a \nsecond Great Depression and cost millions of American jobs.\n  I never forget that time in late 2008 when Chairman Bernanke, the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, came before members of the Banking \nCommittee and members of the leadership and described the circumstances \nthat were unfolding in the country in which a series of financial \ninstitutions, according to Chairman Bernanke and then-Secretary \nPaulson, the Secretary of the Treasury--they said: We are going to have \na series of financial institutions collapse, and if they collapse, they \nwill create systemic risk to the entire country's economy, and every \nAmerican will feel the consequences of that collapse. I remember how \nhushed that room was.\n  I remember also the question being put to Chairman Bernanke: Surely \nyou must have enough tools at the Federal Reserve to get us through \nthis period of time. I remember the response to that question, which \nwas basically: Senator, if you and your colleagues do not act in a \nmatter of days, maybe a week, we will have a global financial meltdown, \nwhich really meant a new depression.\n  Chairman Bernanke is an academician. His expertise is in depression-\nera economics, how this Nation got into the last depression, how \nRoosevelt got us out of it. So when he made that statement, it was all \nthe more chilling. It is from that moment in 2008, before this \nPresident took office and Democrats were in full control here, that, in \nfact, we were facing the challenges we are today.\n  Those of us who believe in a free market also know you cannot have a \nfree-for-all market. We had economic policies for the Bush 8 years, two \nwars raging abroad, an unregulated market that allowed for the free-\nfor-all that brought us on the brink of a new depression, and that is \nwhat we are meeting the challenges of today.\n  Those choices then and the choices we make, what we choose to cut and \nwhat we determine is in our interest, will speak volumes about our \nvalues, our priorities as a people and as a Nation.\n  Mr. President, I favor smart cuts, not dangerous ones. In an \nindependent analysis of H.R. 1, which we are going to be voting on \ntomorrow--the Republican vision of where we should take the country--\nshows we are losing about 700,000 jobs. But we are trying to grow jobs \nin America. We have finally gotten into positive gross domestic product \nof our Nation's economy. We are seeing job growth. I would like to see \nit be even more robust, but H.R. 1 takes us back the opposite way and \nthreatens the very essence of this economic recovery--700,000 jobs.\n  Don't believe what I say because I say it is so, but because those in \nthe know say it--Ben Bernanke: ``The GOP's plan will cut jobs.'' \nEconomist Mark Zandi: ``The GOP plan would cost 700,000 jobs.'' Here is \nanother analysis: House spending cuts will hurt economic growth. So \nwhat we have is economist after economist telling us that H.R. 1 is a \nrecipe for disaster when it comes to the question of jobs in America.\n  That analysis which says we would slash 700,000 jobs directly impacts \nthe lives of middle-class and working families struggling to get back \non their feet. They are severe cuts that run roughshod over the green \nshoots of economic recovery just to satisfy a political agenda. I favor \nsmart commonsense cuts--cuts made with a surgeon's knife not a meat ax; \ncuts that are thoughtful, surgically precise cuts that actually reduce \nthe deficit, not cuts that eliminate jobs and disinvest in educational \nopportunities for millions of promising young Americans, not cuts that \nhurt middle-class families struggling to make ends meet, make our \nworkforce less competitive, our communities less safe, and strip away \nbasic protections Americans have come to take for granted.\n  In my view, we can preserve our values and invest in the future, \ninvest in out-educating, out-innovating, out-greening, and out-growing \nthe world and still cut the deficit. To begin with, Secretary Gates of \nthe Department of Defense has identified $78 billion in defense \nspending cuts alone. He has identified $178 billion in program \nreductions over 5 years, including delaying or terminating high-profile \nweapon systems.\n  I agree with Secretary Gates that we can live without the Marine \nCorps variant of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter as well as the Marine \nCorps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle. The Secretary has identified $54 \nbillion in cuts in overhead costs and improved efficiency across \ndefense agencies and the civilian\n\n[[Page S1395]]\n\nbureaucracy by reducing the number of defense contractors and wholly \nredundant intelligence organizations, among other improvements. Again, \nthese are smart decisions that do not burden military families or \naffect our defensive capabilities.\n  I would add to that list of smart defense cuts the elimination of \n$1.75 billion for the F-22 aircraft and $439 million for an alternative \nengine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program, a cut for which I \nvoted. These, among others, are smart cuts. But I think it is a mistake \nto pursue a budget-cutting strategy that costs this Nation 700,000 jobs \nthrough 2012, as the Republican plan will do--20,000 of those jobs from \nmy home State of New Jersey, including more than 3,000 community health \ncenter jobs and 3,400 transportation and infrastructure jobs.\n  Another smart cut would be to do away with corporate subsidies that \ndo nothing but pad the profits of companies that do not need them to be \nprofitable and grow. We can repeal, for example, oil subsidies, as I \nhave proposed, that would save $33 billion over 10 years on a windfall \ngiveaway program to big oil that hardly needs a government handout. \nOver the past decade, BP, Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and Conoco have had \ncombined profits of just under $1 trillion. Yet we have a system that \nprovides them billions in subsidies every year. That is simply \noutrageous.\n  Even traditional oil industry supporters, such as former President \nGeorge W. Bush and Shell's former CEO, have admitted when oil prices \nare this high oil companies do not need subsidies. They have the \neconomic incentive they need to explore and drill. In 2010 alone, last \nyear, they made over $75 billion, and that includes the $41 billion BP \nhas spent trying to clean up the spill in the gulf--cleaning up the \nenvironment and paying for the economic damage they caused.\n  The fact is, cutting unnecessary defense programs and cutting oil \nsubsidies are among the smart cuts that will save money while doing no \nharm to middle-class families. But the Republican plan, on the other \nhand, will take money away from the one thing that will allow millions \nof young people to reach their goals and prepare them to help America \nmeet its competitive future; namely, a good education. That is a \nterrible mistake.\n  It is a mistake to cut the average New Jersey undergraduate's Pell \ngrant by more than $845, an 11-percent cut. It is a mistake to take \n$115 million in Pell grants from 183,000 promising students in my \nState, as the Republican cuts would do. It is a mistake to cut funding \nto 18,000 students in Union County, NJ, or 16,500 in Middlesex County \nand 15,500 in Essex County, and to continue to cut Pell grants by $56 \nbillion over the next 10 years. It is simply a mistake not to invest in \neducation.\n  We are globally challenged for human capital in the delivery of a \nservice or the production of a product. The boundaries of mankind have \nlargely been erased in pursuit of that human capital so that an \nengineer's report is done in India and sent back to the United States \nfor a fraction of its cost, a radiologist's report is done in Northern \nIreland and read to your local hospital by your doctor, or if you have \na problem with your credit card--as I recently did because there was a \ncharge that wasn't mine--you end up with a call center in South Africa.\n  In the pursuit of human capital for the delivery of a service or a \nproduct we are globally challenged, which means for the Nation to \ncontinue to be a global economic leader it needs to be, at the apex of \nthe curve of intellect, the most highly educated generation of \nAmericans the Nation has ever had. That is how we will grow this \neconomy and prosper and compete in the world. Yet the Republican budget \nmoves us exactly the opposite way.\n  It is wrong to leave 4,000 New Jersey children without access to Head \nStart while at the same time continuing tax cuts for millionaires and \nmultimillionaires. It is shortsighted to cut job training.\n  I went to a job training site in one of our counties. The place was \npacked--packed with individuals who have worked in the past but are \nunemployed now and looking to get the additional training that will \nmake them competitive in a tough job market. So instead of helping our \nfellow Americans be as competitive as they can be for the job \nopportunities that may exist, we are going to cut job training for \n70,000 New Jerseyans rather than seriously look at cutting farm \nsubsidies. We need to be smarter about the cuts we make.\n  I think we would all agree that there are certain farm subsidies that \nare no longer needed, and we could certainly make smart cuts in some of \nthose programs. We are all well aware that farm subsidies are not about \nthe small American farm. I want to nurture that small American farm, \nincluding back home in New Jersey. We call New Jersey the Garden State. \nWe are proud we are No. 2 in blueberries, No. 4 in asparagus. If you \nhad cranberry for Thanksgiving last year, it probably came from the \npine barrens of New Jersey with cranberry bogs. But that small farmer \nis not who we are talking about. This is about systematic efforts to \nmove land from small farms to large corporate farms that mass-produce \ncommodity crops such as cotton.\n  We pay out billions in agricultural subsidies every year that have \ncreated problems such as the ones we saw in Brazil earlier this year. \nBrazil went to the World Trade Organization and complained that what we \nwere doing was an unfair trade practice, and the World Trade \nOrganization agreed. So to avoid retaliatory tariffs--in essence, taxes \nagainst our products by Brazil--the United States agreed to pay $147 \nmillion in assistance to Brazilian producers. Yes, you heard me right--\n$147 million that American taxpayers are now paying to subsidize not \nAmerican farmers but, because of our unfair trade practice, we are now \nsubsidizing Brazilian farmers with our tax dollars. Something is wrong \nabout that process.\n  We need to put an end to such ridiculous policies and save taxpayers \nbillions of dollars. But instead of saving billions in smart cuts like \nthat, the Republican plan under H.R. 1 goes after homeland security \nfunding. That bill will cut homeland security investments by $3 million \nin my home State of New Jersey alone--home, according to the FBI, of \nthe two most dangerous miles in America because of the chemical \ncauseway along the Hudson waterfront that creates a real challenge--\ndirectly affecting the budgets of first responders such as the \ncourageous men and women who responded on September 11. It is dangerous \nto cut more than $22 million in port security grants and more than $16 \nmillion in transit security grants from the Port Authority of New York \nand New Jersey.\n  I have worked hard, from implementing the 9/11 recommendations to \nfighting for port cargo screening. We don't need a nuclear or \nbiological weapon coming into our ports or a threat like we saw from \nthe terrorists in Mumbai in our transit systems that would result in a \ndevastating attack and then further threaten our economy. Yet that is \nexactly what the Republican budget does.\n  I believe it is dangerous to cut $4.5 million in transit security \ngrants for northern New Jersey, more than $3.5 million from the \nPhiladelphia area and southern New Jersey, leaving families in my State \nand throughout that corridor who travel between States less safe.\n  I have a different take than my Republican colleagues on how we \nachieve deficit reduction. Quite simply, it comes down to one truism \nthat we should keep in mind during this budget process, and that is \nthis: You show me your budget, and I will show you your values.\n  We have that in our own family budgets. Families struggle together to \nhave a place to call home for their families, to educate their \nchildren, to put food on the table, to be able to realize their hopes \nand dreams and aspirations. And how we spend our money as families \nspeaks to our values, and, of course, the work we do to earn that \nmoney. That is true about the Nation's budget. The Nation's budget is a \nreflection of our collective values as a country. Those values are \nclearly evident in what we choose to fund and what we choose to cut.\n  I would remind my colleagues this debate is about more than numbers \non a page. It is a portrait of America, a reflection of who we are and \nwhat we want this Nation to be. To make cuts simply to reach a \nnumerical goal that isn't established by any sound science is to say \nthat we care more about the\n\n[[Page S1396]]\n\nbottom line than about investing in people, investing in jobs, in \neducation, in infrastructure, in building and growing this economy, and \nprotecting a safe, clean way of life that we have too often come to \ntake for granted.\n  I want to talk about that for a moment.\n  From the moment we get up in the morning, to the moment we go to bed \nat night, the Republican plan would make cuts that affect the daily \nlives of millions of Americans and millions of jobs in every economic \nsector.\n  In America, when you turn on the tap for a glass of water or take \nyour child fishing at a local lake, someone is at work--someone with a \nfamily--who is making sure the water is safe to drink and the lake is \nnot polluted.\n  But the Republican plan cuts $700 million from the Clean Water State \nRevolving Fund and $250 million from the Drinking Water State Revolving \nFund that have helped municipalities and communities put people to work \non water quality protection projects.\n  The Republican plan cuts almost $1 billion from clean water and that \nmeans cutting not just funding, but jobs of those whose work is to keep \nour water safe and clean.\n  Is that a smart cut? Does that reflect who we are and what we want \nthis Nation to be?\n  If you live on a river, a flood plain, or on the coast and a storm \nstrikes, you know that in America there will be someone there to help \nif there is a flood or a coastal emergency.\n  The Republican plan, even after the disastrous experience in the wake \nof Katrina, cuts $30 million from flood control and coastal \nemergencies. Is that what we learned from New Orleans? Is that what we, \nas a nation, believe is a smart cut?\n  If you wake up in the middle of the night and your child is sick and \nyou don't know why, or you think that child may have accidently \ningested something poisonous, or your child is diagnosed with a life-\nthreatening disease, in America you can call the Poison Control Center, \ntake your child to a community health center, know that the Centers for \nDisease Control is doing its job.\n  In America you know that the National Institutes of Health is working \nevery day to find the next treatment or cure that affects our families, \nfriends, and neighbors, $300 million of that in New Jersey, bringing \nthousands of new 21st century jobs to my State to help continue our \neconomic recovery.\n  But the Republican plan cuts $755 million from the CDC; $1 billion \nfrom the National Institutes of Health; $27 million from Poison Control \nCenters; $1.3 billion from community health centers and 3,400 community \nhealth center jobs in my State of New Jersey--3,400 more unemployed New \nJerseyans.\n  We may not immediately make the connection between what these cuts \nmean and our lives, but they have consequences to our lives, to our \nfamilies, to our prosperity. It also means some people will lose their \njobs.\n  This morning millions of Americans got up and scrambled a few eggs \nand made some bacon for breakfast.\n  Fortunately, in this country we know it was someone's job to inspect \nthose eggs. It was someone's job to inspect that bacon and make sure it \nwas safe to eat. The Republican plan cuts $53 million from Food Safety \nand Inspection Service, the loss of more safety inspectors at a time \nwhen we have heard numerous reports of tainted food and the need for \nmore, not fewer, food inspectors keeping our food supply safe.\n  Is that reflective of our values? Is that what we think of as life in \nAmerica?\n  If you were a middle-class New Jerseyan who, after a year of looking \nfor a job, finally had an interview and wanted to take the train \nbecause you thought it would be a faster, easier, and more convenient \nway to get to that interview, you may find there are not as many \nopportunities because the Republican budget cuts $224 million from \nAmtrak. In a post-September 11 world in which multiple modes of \ntransportation are critical to our security, for so we learned on \nSeptember 11 that when there are no trans-Hudson crossings through the \ntunnels or through PATH, which is the rail connection between New York \nand New Jersey, we had ferries that took people out of Lower Manhattan \nand to New Jersey hospitals. Multiple modes of transportation is not \nonly about economic opportunity, it is about security in the post-\nSeptember 11 world. Yet the budget cuts $224 million from Amtrak, which \nis how we send our businesspeople to sell their products between \ncities, go to great research universities and to hospitals to be cured. \nYou would be forced to take the car, buy the gas, burn the fuel, fight \nthe traffic, and park in the city to get to your interview. Is that how \nwe invest in our infrastructure? Is that the type of smart growth that \nwill help us achieve a greener, cleaner future?\n  When you park the car and walk to your interview you expect to have \nenough police on the street to protect you from gangs and criminals.\n  Well, this Republican plan cuts the National Drug Intelligence Center \nby $11 million; law enforcement wireless communications by $52 million; \nthe U.S. Marshals Service by $10 million; the FBI that deals with \ndomestic terrorism by $74 million; State and local law enforcement \nassistance by $256 million; juvenile justice by $2.3 million; and the \nCOPS Program that puts police on the street and provides them with \nstate-of-the-art equipment they need by $600 million; $600 million from \nthe COPS Program means fewer cops on the beat.\n  Are those the kind of cuts that we want.\n  Are those the kind of cuts that will keep our communities safe? Are \nthey smart cuts that reflect our values in a post 9-11 world?\n  Let me also mention one thing that is not specifically a cut in the \nRepublican plan, but something it does that runs contrary to our belief \nas a nation that the air we breathe should be clean and safe.\n  The legislation presented by the Republicans eliminates many \nenvironmental protections with cuts to the EPA's budget, but it is also \nloaded with policy riders designed specifically to gut the Clean Air \nAct.\n  I believe that is wrong. I believe it runs contrary to American \nvalues, and I consider any attack on the Clean Air Act to be an attack \non New Jersey.\n  Because of the emissions of dirty, old out of state coal plants, \nevery county in my State is deemed to be out of compliance with the \nClean Air Act. One of these coal powerplants is the Portland Generation \nStation just across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania. It emitted \n30,000 tons of sulfur dioxide in 2009--almost three times the amount of \nall seven of New Jersey's coal plants combined.\n  This sulfur dioxide wafts into Warren, Sussex, Hunterdon and Morris \ncounties and acts to cause and exacerbate a whole host of respiratory \nillnesses from asthma to heart disease.\n  We simply cannot gut the one piece of legislation that protects the \nvery air we breathe and makes it safe for our children to go out and \nplay without fear of being sick. This Republican plan that guts the \nClean Air Act does not reflect our values as a Nation. It is simply not \nreflective of who we are, what we want this Nation to be, or what we \nwant for our children's future.\n  The list of H.R. 1's short-sighted dis-investments in this Nation's \nfuture goes on and on. ``Show me your budget and I'll show you your \nvalues.''\n  The Republican proposal before us is, in my view, an affront to \nAmerican values, not a reflection of them.\n  I for one do not believe for one second that it reflects who we are \nand what we want this Nation to be. I do believe that at a time that we \nare finally growing this economy, these indiscriminate cuts, as many \neconomists have said, will throw this economy right back to the deep \nrecession we are coming out of. That means fewer jobs here in America. \nThat certainly cannot be part of our values. That is why I will be \nvoting against H.R. 1, to protect American values and protect American \njobs.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1396-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1396-S1398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are living through one of the most \nimportant transformations in the history of the modern world. Some have \nlikened the wave of protests sweeping the Middle East to the \nrevolutions of 1848, which changed Europe's political landscape \nforever. They certainly call to mind the dramatic events of 1989, when\n\n[[Page S1397]]\n\nthe nations of Eastern Europe threw off the yoke of communism to \nembrace free markets and democracy. Like those upheavals, there is no \ndoubt that the events of this year will be studied for decades to come.\n  The challenges we face are great. We are being called upon to forge \nnew relationships in a part of the world that has been and will remain \nvital to our national security. And we have been given the opportunity \nto demonstrate conclusively to the young men and women of the Muslim \nworld and beyond that al-Qaida's belief that change requires violence \nand radicalization is wrong.\n  But, even as we try to navigate these momentous developments, we are \ncontemplating drastic cuts to our international affairs programs. I \nunderstand that we face a budget crisis in our own country. But we can \neither pay now to help brave people build a better, democratic future \nfor themselves, or we will certainly pay later with increased threats \nto our own national security.\n  The international affairs budget lays the foundation for our ability \nto fulfill our responsibilities abroad. The approximately $50 billion \nthat funds all our diplomats, development professionals, embassies, \nmissions, consular services, global health programs, food aid, and \ndisaster relief is a tiny investment for the great return we receive. \nConsider that this year we will spend approximately $700 billion on our \nmilitary. By contrast, the international affairs budget is less than \none-tenth of the Pentagon's. As Secretary Gates once pointed out, if \nyou took the entire Foreign Service roster, you could barely crew one \naircraft carrier.\n  And yet our diplomats are serving on the frontlines of multiple \nrevolutions and wars. They are making vital contributions in \nAfghanistan, and in Iraq they are planning the transition from a \nmilitary mission to a diplomatic one so that we can cement the \npolitical progress that has cost hundreds of billions of dollars and \nthousands of American lives.\n  In Africa, they are helping to midwife the birth of a new nation in \nSouth Sudan, to resolve the situation in Darfur, and, as we make \nprogress on those fronts, to forge a new relationship with the \ngovernment in Khartoum. They are leading the fight against global \nchallenges, like nuclear proliferation and climate change. And in \ncountless communities around the world they are providing essential \nhumanitarian assistance preventing the spread of cholera in Haiti, \ndistributing food to refugees in northern Kenya, and providing shelter \nto flood victims in Pakistan.\n  This is not a time for America to pull back from the world. This is a \ntime to step forward.\n  Yet H.R. 1 imposes draconian cuts that would completely undermine our \ncore national security priorities and our humanitarian commitments. The \nbill threatens our ability to stabilize Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq \nby slashing economic support funds by $2.2 billion, or nearly 30 \npercent below fiscal year 2011 levels. In Afghanistan, for example, \nthese cuts would make it extremely difficult to support high-priority \ninfrastructure programs that are critical to our counterinsurgency and \nstabilization efforts. And they would curtail our ability to support \ngovernance, economic development programs, and basic services to \ndistricts cleared by the military.\n  H.R. 1 would also threaten our efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan by \nzeroing out funding to meet our obligation to take up the U.S. shares \nin the Asian Development Bank, ADB. If we don't provide funding by \nApril of this year, we will give up our leadership position at ADB and \nallow Chinese influence at the bank to surpass our own. The impact of \nthat loss of influence cannot be overstated. The ADB funds projects \nthroughout Pakistan and Afghanistan, supporting U.S. efforts in this \ncritical region. GEN David Petraeus himself wrote to Treasury Secretary \nTimothy Geithner to praise the Asian Development Bank for supporting \nU.S. interests, stating that ``strong partnership with the ADB is part \nof our overall United States purpose and goals in these areas of \ncritical importance.''\n  The House bill also cuts our humanitarian aid by 50 percent, \ndecimating our ability to provide food, shelter, and medicine after \nnatural disasters and putting hundreds of thousands of lives at risk. \nIn Pakistan, USAID would be unable to meet emergency and recovery needs \nin the south, where an estimated 4 million people remain displaced and \nrequire critical support. In Haiti, over 1 million displaced persons \nliving in transitional shelters may lose funding and support. And with \nthese cuts, more than 1.6 million internally displaced persons in \nDarfur will not receive critical health care, access to water, or help \nin meeting other basic needs.\n  H.R. 1 decreases global health funding by over $1 billion, which \nmeans that over 400,000 people who would have been able to enroll in \nlife-saving treatment programs through PEPFAR will now linger on \nwaiting lists as their HIV diagnosis becomes a death sentence. It also \nmeans that 300,000 orphans and children will not receive care and \nsupport, and that 100,000 women who would have received medication to \nprevent the transmission of HIV to their newborn children will not, \nresulting in tens of thousands of babies that will be born HIV-\npositive.\n  H.R. 1 also slashes support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis, and Malaria. The Global Fund is a public-private \npartnership where every American tax dollar is leveraged twice over by \nthe rest of the world. Its programs are also deeply intertwined with \nU.S. efforts: In Haiti, for example, Global Fund grants support the \npurchase of anti-retroviral drugs for AIDS patients, while PEPFAR \nensures their delivery to patients. Thus, these drastic reductions to \nthe Global Fund will affect U.S. efforts as well.\n  Our global health programs represent some of our most successful and \neffective international policies. In Pakistan, as I discussed today \nwith Bill Gates, working with the government there, we could eliminate \npolio entirely. Our malaria programs have already virtually eliminated \nthat killer of children in parts of Africa. The Centers for Disease \nControl are working to reduce the spread of drug-resistant diseases, \nsuch as tuberculosis, before they come to our own shores. Cutting off \nthese programs is poor foreign policy, it is poor public health policy, \nand it stands in sharp contradiction to American values.\n  The House bill also cuts nearly two-thirds of the funds devoted to \npromoting clean energy and increasing resilience to climate change in \nthe most vulnerable regions of the world. This includes eliminating \nfunding for the climate investment funds, which support exports of \nclean energy technology, help developing countries respond to the \nimpacts of climate change, and promote increased carbon sequestration \nfrom forests. H.R. 1 also eliminates government positions needed to \nnegotiate international agreements on climate change that are favorable \nto the United States, while ensuring that other nations live up to \ntheir commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\n  H.R. 1 also slashes food and education for the world's poorest \nchildren by 50 percent. It eliminates feeding programs for 18 million \nof the world's poorest and hungriest people, and approximately 2.5 \nmillion young children benefiting from the McGovern-Dole program would \nlose their daily school meal. Another 15 million people, primarily \nwomen and children, would lose access to the sustenance provided \nthrough title II. These cuts are not abstractions. These are people.\n  The House bill would even eliminate fiscal year 2011 funding for the \nUnited States Institute of Peace, USIP. USIP is more than a Washington \nthink tank. Created by Congress and President Ronald Reagan, it is a \nworking instrument, utilized by the Department of Defense as well as \nthe Department of State. Defunding USIP would significantly reduce \nAmerica's ability to find nonviolent solutions to conflict, just as we \nare trying to resolve wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. USIP's personnel \noperate on the ground in dangerous areas where America's security is \nthreatened. For example, in 2007 USIP's reconciliation efforts between \nShia authorities and Sunni sheiks helped dramatically reduce U.S. troop \ndeaths in the ``Triangle of Death'' near Baghdad. That in turn allowed \nthe U.S. Army to reduce its presence in the area by about 2,000 troops \nand save a significant amount of money. In a letter to the Office of \nManagement and Budget, General Petraeus called this a ``striking \nsuccess story.''\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\n  I have long been impressed with USIP's work in Sudan, where the \nInstitute's training in electoral violence prevention contributed to \nthe relatively peaceful referendum and the low levels of violence in \nits aftermath. USIP is now actively assisting in the development of a \nnew constitution for Southern Sudan through its Rule of Law Program. \nRecognizing the volatility of the north/south border areas and the \npotential for an outbreak of contagious violence, USIP has instituted a \ncross-border grazing corridor project and designed a popular \nconsultations process in the troubled border states of Blue Nile and \nSouthern Kordofan.\n  In Pakistan, another area of great concern to me, USIP is developing \na network of conflict management facilitators to work at the local \nlevel, training Pakistani parliamentarians and women leaders in \nconflict resolution and developing a curriculum for schools based on \nprinciples of gender equality, tolerance, pluralism, and peace.\n  Under the Senate substitute, USIP's funding would be reduced by \nalmost 20 percent. But any greater reduction would threaten this \nFederal institute that has proven it saves American lives and money. \nThe drastic action of the House to defund USIP must not stand.\n  These sorts of severe cuts, which will reduce our capacity from \nAfghanistan to Sudan, from war zones to earthquake zones, will do \nalmost nothing to rein in our budget deficit. But they will costs \nthousands of lives overseas, and they will increase the threats to our \nown country. At a time of great challenge to American interests abroad, \nwe must step up at home and provide the vital funds that our diplomats \nneed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             U.S. Central Command,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Commander,\n\n                               MacDill AFB, FL, February 11, 2009.\n     Mr. Rob Goldberg,\n     Director, International Affairs Division, National Security \n         Programs, The Office of Management and Budget, 17th \n         Street, NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Goldberg, I would like to underscore the \n     importance of the U.S. Institute for Peace (USIP) to the \n     missions the United States is currently pursuing in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. While I have long been an avid reader of USIP's \n     analytical products, which are second to none in tracking the \n     challenges we face in both countries and in outlining policy \n     options, I have more recently been impressed with USIP's on-\n     the-ground peacebuilding efforts.\n       In Iraq, the Institute stepped up to the plate beginning in \n     August 2007 to assist the 10th Mountain Division in a \n     reconciliation effort in Mahmoudiya, a community on the \n     southern edge of Baghdad that was once known as the \n     ``Triangle of Death.'' Since then, General Odierno and I have \n     often cited Mahmoudiya as a striking success story. USIP's \n     continuing reconciliation efforts at the community level, \n     especially in Diyala and Ninewa, as well as at the national \n     level in Baghdad, hold great promise for the future.\n       In Afghanistan, USIP's work on the informal justice system \n     has been invaluable as we work toward improving the rule of \n     law at the provincial level. Their plans for reconciliation \n     efforts at the community level on the Afghanistan/Pakistan \n     border are likewise a potential key to success in the \n     enormous challenges we face.\n       USIP's experience working closely with the U.S. military \n     will be a great asset in developing stronger unity of effort \n     between civilian and military elements of government In fact, \n     I hope soon to see U.S. military officers training alongside \n     civilian governmental and nongovernmental counterparts in \n     USIP's headquarters at 23rd and Constitution. Their facility \n     is not just an important symbol of our nation's commitment to \n     peace; it is also home to a wonderful training center that we \n     hope to leverage to increase understanding and unity of \n     effort in today's complex operations.\n       We can be proud of what USIP has done in the past, and I \n     look forward with confidence to the contributions the \n     Institute will make in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            David H. Petraeus,\n\n                                      General, United States Army,\n     Commanding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1398-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          9/11 HEALTH FUNDING\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, we rise today to engage in a colloquy \nregarding funding for the 9/11 health program. The chairman has been a \ntireless supporter of the 9/11 World Trade Center health program at the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention's, CDC, National Institute \nfor Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH. This program has helped our \nfirst responders who bravely rushed in on September 11 and thousands of \nothers who were in the area on that terrible day.\n  The 2011 continuing resolution proposed by Senator Inouye that the \nSenate will vote on today makes fiscally prudent adjustments to our \nNation's spending, but I wanted to clarify with the Senator, through \nthis colloquy, that none of the spending reductions in the CR will \nimpact the current health care screening and treatment for first \nresponders, survivors, residents, students and others related to the \nSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. As the Senator knows, we successfully enacted a \nbipartisan bill to provide mandatory funding to take care of the first \nresponders and others who became sick from toxic fumes, dust, and smoke \nafter the 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. This new law was our \nChristmas miracle. It is very important to me and my constituents that \nthere is no disruption in the care that eligible responders and victims \ncan receive.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senators. The Senator is absolutely correct, \nthe 2011 continuing resolution that was proposed by Senator Inouye will \nnot reduce any services or treatment available to responders in the \nWorld Trade Center Health Program. In fact, we have been assured by the \nstaff at HHS that there are sufficient funds for treatment and \nscreening of the responders and victims to continue without \ninterruption.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It's my understanding that the fiscal year 2010 \nappropriation included $70.7 million for the World Trade Center Health \nProgram, but that the 2011 continuing resolution proposed by Senator \nInouye does not specify an amount for the implementation of the new \nlaw.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, the $70.7 million provided to the program in the \nfiscal year 2010 omnibus remains available to NIOSH to use until \nexpended. It is our understanding that $13 million remains of that \n$70.7 million and that it will be used to continue access to the \nprogram.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Senator for that clarification. I too am \nvery concerned about continuity in the World Trade Center Health \nProgram. The mandatory funding will start on July 1, 2011, and it is \ncritically important that the transition be as smooth as possible. I \nwould like to thank the Senator for ensuring that this program will be \nable to continue under the 2011 CR, and I would like to ask, on behalf \nof all of us and our constituents, that we work together to ensure that \nthe fiscal year 2011 discretionary funds support the full and timely \nimplementation of the mandatory program. It is very important that \nfunding is provided to ensure that NIOSH and the World Trade Center \nmonitoring and treatment programs can seamlessly continue their work.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I commit to working with the Senator. I commit to \nthe Senators that we will specifically allocate in the CR that will \npass the Senate the amount of funds that are necessary to ensure a \nsmooth transition in July.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I thank the Chairman for that clarification and for \nensuring that these American heroes were not forgotten. I hope we can \nall work together each year on this important program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1398-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1398-S1399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARGENTINA'S DEBTS\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the treatment of \nAmerican creditors by the Republic of Argentina. Almost 10 years ago, \nthe Argentine government defaulted on over $81 billion in sovereign \ndebt. Nearly $9 billion of this debt was held by the U.S. Government \nand American citizens. Following its default, Argentina made take-it-\nor-leave-it settlement offers well below international norms for \nsettling sovereign debt defaults.\n  I am glad to report that recently Argentina has shown a willingness \nto negotiate in settling some of this debt. Argentina recently informed \nthe Paris Club, a group of sovereign governments that includes the \nUnited States and represents 19 creditor countries, that it will pay \nits outstanding sovereign debt,\n\n[[Page S1399]]\n\nincluding $360 million owed to the United States. Argentina's \nwillingness to pay its debts to the Paris Club demonstrates its \ncapacity to go further and compensate private American creditors, who \nhave been trying to collect outstanding debt from Argentina for years. \nThe fact that Argentina has agreed to pay its public debts to other \nsovereign nations is a welcomed first step. However, private U.S. \ncreditors are still owed billions of dollars.\n  As I mentioned before in this Chamber, these private creditors have \nwon over 100 U.S. Federal court judgments against Argentina. Now that \nArgentina has shown that it can and will pay its debts through the \nParis Club negotiations, the administration should work to get this \nissue resolved for the remaining American bondholders and taxpayers.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in urging the administration to \nprotect the well-being of the American citizens impacted by Argentina's \nfailure to pay its debts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1399-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             Rx IMPACT DAY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today in advance \nof the Third Annual National Association of Chain Drug Stores RxIMPACT \nDay to recognize pharmacy contributions to the American health care \nsystem. Over the course of the next 2 days, over 300 members of the \npharmacy community, including practicing pharmacists, pharmacy school \nfaculty and students, State pharmacy leaders and pharmacy company \nexecutives, will visit Capitol Hill to share their views with Congress \nabout the importance of protecting access to neighborhood pharmacies \nand utilizing pharmacists to improve quality and reduce health costs.\n  Pharmacists play an important role in improving our health care \nsystem by providing services and expertise that help patients manage \ntheir medications and overall health. In many communities, pharmacists \nare the most accessible health care provider group. Today's pharmacies \noffer a variety of preventive healthcare services including \nimmunizations and vaccinations, health screening services, disease \nmanagement services and routine advice on the best and most effective \nover-the-counter products for patients' specific needs.\n  Through medication therapy management, MTM, pharmacists reduce \nmedical errors and help patients manage and adhere to their prescribed \ntherapies. Drug therapy management services can play a critical role in \nimproving the quality of care and containing health care costs, as \nthese services help patients make the best possible use of their \nmedications. MTM services require a partnership of the pharmacist, the \npatient or their caregiver, and other health professionals to promote \nthe safe and effective use of medications and help patients achieve \ntargeted health outcomes. I am pleased the Affordable Care Act \nrecognized the health benefits and cost savings associated with MTM and \nincludes a series of grant programs to encourage MTM as part of \ncoordinated care models and chronic disease initiatives. Reform also \nimproves the MTM benefit in Medicare Part D and establishes a bonus \npayment for Medicare Advantage plans that promote MTM.\n  Analysis conducted by the New England Healthcare Institute estimates \nthat the overall cost of incorrect use of medication is as much as $290 \nbillion per year, not to mention the avoidable loss of quality of life \nfor patients and their loved ones. With increasing evidence this \nbenefit can improve patient health outcomes, I support community \npharmacy's efforts to strengthen the MTM benefit. I joined colleagues \nearlier this year in introducing the Medication Therapy Management \nEmpowerment Act. In addition to extending MTM services to seniors and \nothers struggling with chronic conditions, this bill provides \nappropriate reimbursement for pharmacists' time and service. The bill \nalso establishes standards for data collection to evaluate and improve \nthe Part D MTM benefit.\n  Throughout my service in Congress, I have been a strong supporter of \npharmacies and recognize their important role in our health care \nsystem. Today, I celebrate the value of pharmacy and support efforts to \nprotect access to neighborhood pharmacies and utilize pharmacies to \nimprove the quality and reduce the costs of health care. I commend \npharmacy leaders, pharmacists, students, and executives and the \npharmacy community for their contributions to improving the health of \nthe American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1399-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise today, March 8, to celebrate \nInternational Women's Day, on which we honor the economic, political, \nand social achievements of women in Colorado and across the world. It \nalso happens to be the 100-year anniversary of International Women's \nDay. For 100 years, diverse nations have spoken as one to honor the \nachievements of women and look forward hopefully to a future with \ngreater economic opportunities for all women, including my three \ndaughters, Caroline, Halina, and Anne.\n  I would like to celebrate today by discussing ways that we can build \ntoward that future and create better economic opportunities for women \nin all countries--from Afghanistan to Zambia, two countries which, \nincidentally, celebrate International Women's Day as an official \nholiday.\n  All too often, in many developing countries, women represent a \ndisproportionate number of the poor. According to the United Nations \nDevelopment Program, women represent 60 percent of the 1.4 billion \npeople living on less than $1.25 a day. They also lack access to the \nsame educational and health services as men. For example, two-thirds of \nthe world's illiterate people are women.\n  These disparities are stark, and their causes are the product of \nhistorical second-class citizenship for women. Such historical \ndisadvantages are pervasive and systemic. Only with the determined \neffort of the international community can we begin to break down these \nbarriers and foster true economic opportunities for women.\n  Many women and girls are trapped in the vicious cycle of poverty \nbecause of their limited access to basic financial services. Women \noften manage the household and produce food for the entire family, but \nthey are unable to save money, protect against calamity, or obtain a \nsmall loan--simple banking tools you and I take for granted.\n  For example, 75 percent of the world's women cannot obtain formal \nbank loans, partly because they lack permanent employment, capital, and \nassets, such as land. In some countries, like Burkina Faso, laws do not \nspecifically discriminate against women, but they do establish \nlandowner criteria that effectively exclude women.\n  One way to bridge this gap is to connect women with access to \nfinancial services and microfinance. Very small loans can help some \nwomen start and expand small businesses. Others need a safe place to \nstore money as they save for school fees and health care services for \ntheir children. Some small businesswomen and female heads of households \nwish to purchase simple forms of insurance to protect against \nunexpected illnesses, which can often wipe a family out. By increasing \nwomen's access to such basic financial services, we can help countless \nwomen weather unexpected storms and gain agency over their economic \nwell-being.\n  Creating economic and financial opportunities for women worldwide is \nthe right thing to do, and it is also the smart thing to do. In \ncountries like Pakistan and Yemen, supporting women can lead to \nmeasurable progress in the economic success of families and the \ndirection of tomorrow's youth. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, \nthese efforts can help small-scale, subsistence farmers, most of whom \nare women, prevent future food crises and help stabilize struggling \ndemocracies.\n  Mr. President and all other Members here today, please join me in \ncelebrating International Women's Day by supporting efforts to expand \neconomic opportunities for women around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1399-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1399-S1400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TEACHING GEOGRAPHY IS FUNDAMENTAL ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Teaching \nGeography is Fundamental Act, introduced by Senator Cochran and myself \nlast week. Increasing geography literacy is essential to STEM \neducation, and investing in our children's science\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\neducation is essential to making America smarter and more innovative. \nThis bill would authorize the Secretary of Education to meet that \ncritical need by doling out competitive grants to proven nonprofits \nwith a track record of promoting geography literacy in our schools \nthrough activities such as teacher professional development and \nresearch. As chairwoman of the appropriation subcommittee that funds \nNational Science Foundation, NSF, I have directed National Science \nFoundation's education team to work with experts like National \nGeographic to strengthen geography education. NSF is now working with \nNational Geographic Society to explore new ways to improve geography \nteaching, training, and research in our schools. This pilot program has \nproven successful and deserves national support.\n  For a number of years, I have promoted geography locally in my home \nState of Maryland by working with geographic trailblazers like National \nGeographic Society's Chesapeake watershed education programs and Pat \nNoonan's Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoys--bringing real-time \nenvironmental information to Maryland schoolchildren in a meaningful \nand understandable way. I can tell that making geography education \nlocal is where to start. Hook a child's interest with what they know, \nand their geographic knowledge will open up to the rest of the world.\n  I strongly support this bill because I know it can enhance tremendous \nwork already being done. National Geographic is a great example of an \norganization that could partner with the Department of Education to \nprovide schools with the intellectual and organizational capacity to \neffectively teach geography literacy. It is an institution whose \nmembers have explored the world's tallest peaks and discovered our \nocean's deepest depths. They support exploration and discovery--from \nPeary and Hanson's expedition to the North Pole in 1906 to Ballard's \ndiscovery of the Titanic in 1985. But they also fund geography \neducation programming through grants to educational organizations and \nby providing professional development to classroom teachers. Their \nmagazine alone has an incredible impact because of its loyal and \nmassive readership of more than 360 million people. There is no need \nfor the administration to reinvent the wheel when there are willing \ngeographic partners ready and willing to take this Teaching Geography \nis Fundamental bill and run with it.\n  We live in an age when our innovative economy is becoming ever more \nglobal and new cyber technology connects schoolchildren not only to \ntheir friend across the street but to their friend across the ocean, \nBetter geography literacy at a young age--along with an understanding \nand appreciation of other cultures--is so important nowadays. I think \nit is both fitting and appropriate that we continue to encourage that \ncuriosity with our children, and this bill helps us get there. That is \nwhy I am proud to cosponsor this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport it as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1400-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1400-S1405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF ISSUANCE\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Adoption of regulations. Section 4(c)(4)(A) of the VEOA \n     generally authorizes the Board to issue regulations to \n     implement section 4(c). In addition, section 4(c)(4)(B) of \n     the VEOA directs the Board to promulgate regulations that are \n     ``the same as the most relevant substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive branch) promulgated \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     paragraph (2)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA. Those statutory \n     provisions are section 2108, sections 3309 through 3312, and \n     subchapter I of chapter 35, of title 5, United States Code. \n     The regulations issued by the Board herein are on all matters \n     for which section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA requires a \n     regulation to be issued. Specifically, it is the Board's \n     considered judgment based on the information available to it \n     at the time of promulgation of these regulations, that, with \n     the exception of the regulations adopted and set forth \n     herein, there are no other ``substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive branch) promulgated \n     to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     paragraph (2)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA that need be \n     adopted.\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\n       (b) Modification of substantive regulations. As a \n     qualification to the statutory obligation to issue \n     regulations that are ``the same as the most substantive \n     regulations (applicable with respect to the Executive \n     branch)'', section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA authorizes the \n     Board to ``determine, for good cause shown and stated \n     together with the regulation, that a modification of such \n     regulations would be more effective for the implementation of \n     the rights and protections under'' section 4(c) of the VEOA.\n       (c) Rationale for Departure from the Most Relevant \n     Executive Branch Regulations. The Board concludes that it \n     must promulgate regulations accommodating the human resource \n     systems existing in the Legislative branch; and that such \n     regulations must take into account the fact that the Board \n     does not possess the statutory and Executive Order based \n     government-wide policy making authority underlying OPM's \n     counterpart VEOA regulations governing the Executive branch. \n     OPM's regulations are designed for the competitive service \n     (defined in 5 U.S.C. 2102(a)(2)), which does not exist in the \n     employing offices subject to this regulation. Therefore, to \n     follow the OPM regulations would create detailed and complex \n     rules and procedures for a workforce that does not exist in \n     the Legislative branch, while providing no VEOA protections \n     to the covered Legislative branch employees. We have chosen \n     to propose specially tailored regulations, rather than simply \n     to adopt those promulgated by OPM, so that we may effectuate \n     Congress's intent in extending the principles of the \n     veterans' preference laws to the Legislative branch through \n     the VEOA.\n\n     SEC. 1.104. COORDINATION WITH SECTION 225 OF THE \n                   CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.\n\n       Statutory directive. Section 4(c)(4)(C) of the VEOA \n     requires that promulgated regulations must be consistent with \n     section 225 of the CAA. Among the relevant provisions of \n     section 225 are subsection (f)(1), which prescribes as a rule \n     of construction that definitions and exemptions in the laws \n     made applicable by the CAA shall apply under the CAA, and \n     subsection (f)(3), which states that the CAA shall not be \n     considered to authorize enforcement of the CAA by the \n     Executive branch.\n\n          Subpart B--Veterans' Preference--General Provisions\n\nSec.\n1.105 Responsibility for administration of veterans' preference.\n1.106 Procedures for bringing claims under the VEOA.\n\n     SEC. 1.105.

VETERANS' PREFERENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO NON-\n                   RESTRICTED COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) Where an employing office has duly adopted a policy \n     requiring the numerical scoring or rating of applicants for \n     covered positions, the employing office shall add points to \n     the earned ratings of those preference eligible applicants \n     who receive passing scores in an entrance examination, in a \n     manner that is proportionately comparable to the points \n     prescribed in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3309. For example, five \n     preference points shall be granted to preference eligible \n     applicants in a 100-point system, one point shall be granted \n     in a 20-point system, and so on.\n       (b) In all other situations involving appointment to a \n     covered position, employing offices shall consider veterans' \n     preference eligibility as an affirmative factor in the \n     employing office's determination of who will be appointed \n     from among qualified applicants.\n\n     SEC. 1.109. CREDITING EXPERIENCE IN APPOINTMENTS TO COVERED \n                   POSITIONS.\n\n       When considering applicants for covered positions in which \n     experience is an element of qualification, employing offices \n     shall provide preference eligible applicants with credit:\n       (a) for time spent in the military service (1) as an \n     extension of time spent in the position in which the \n     applicant was employed immediately before his/her entrance \n     into the military service, or (2) on the basis of actual \n     duties performed in the military service, or (3) as a \n     combination of both methods.

WAIVER OF PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS IN APPOINTMENTS \n                   TO COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) Subject to (c) below, in determining qualifications of \n     a preference eligible for appointment, an employing office \n     shall waive:\n       (1) with respect to a preference eligible applicant, \n     requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the \n     requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of \n     the position; and\n       (2) with respect to a preference eligible applicant to whom \n     it has made a conditional offer of employment, physical \n     requirements if, in the opinion of the employing office, on \n     the basis of evidence before it, including any recommendation \n     of an accredited physician submitted by the preference \n     eligible applicant, the preference eligible applicant is \n     physically able to perform efficiently the duties of the \n     position;\n       (b) Subject to (c) below, if an employing office \n     determines, on the basis of evidence before it, including any \n     recommendation of an accredited physician submitted by the \n     preference eligible applicant, that an applicant to whom it \n     has made a conditional offer of employment is preference \n     eligible as a disabled veteran as described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108(3)(C) and who has a compensable service-connected \n     disability of 30 percent or more is not able to fulfill the \n     physical requirements of the covered position, the employing \n     office shall notify the preference eligible applicant of the \n     reasons for the determination and of the right to respond and \n     to submit additional information to the employing office, \n     within 15 days of the date of the notification. The head of \n     the employing office may, by providing written notice to the \n     preference eligible applicant, shorten the period for \n     submitting a response with respect to an appointment to a \n     particular covered position, if necessary because of a need \n     to fill the covered position immediately. Should the \n     preference eligible applicant make a timely response, the \n     highest ranking individual or group of individuals with \n     authority to make employment decisions on behalf of the \n     employing office shall render a final determination of the \n     physical ability of the preference eligible applicant to \n     perform the duties of the position, taking into account the \n     response and any additional information provided by the \n     preference eligible applicant. When the employing office has \n     completed its review of the proposed disqualification on the \n     basis of physical disability, it shall send its findings to \n     the preference eligible applicant.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any obligations it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 \n     et seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the Act, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n         Subpart D--Veterans' preference in reductions in force\n\nSec.\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\n1.111 Definitions applicable in reductions in force.\n1.112 Application of preference in reductions in force.\n1.113 Crediting experience in reductions in force.\n1.114 Waiver of physical requirements in reductions in force.\n1.115 Transfer of functions.\n\n     SEC. 1.111. DEFINITIONS APPLICABLE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       (a) Competing covered employees are the covered employees \n     within a particular position or job classification, at or \n     within a particular competitive area, as those terms are \n     defined below.\n       (b) Competitive area is that portion of the employing \n     office's organizational structure, as determined by the \n     employing office, in which covered employees compete for \n     retention. A competitive area must be defined solely in terms \n     of the employing office's organizational unit(s) and \n     geographical location, and it must include all employees \n     within the competitive area so defined. A competitive area \n     may consist of all or part of an employing office. The \n     minimum competitive area is a department or subdivision of \n     the employing office within the local commuting area.\n       (c) Position classifications or job classifications are \n     determined by the employing office, and shall refer to all \n     covered positions within a competitive area that are in the \n     same grade, occupational level or classification, and which \n     are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay \n     schedules, tenure (type of appointment) and working \n     conditions so that an employing office may reassign the \n     incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in \n     the position classification without undue interruption.\n       (d) Preference Eligibles. For the purpose of applying \n     veterans' preference in reductions in force, except with \n     respect to the application of section 1.114 of these \n     regulations regarding the waiver of physical requirements, \n     the following shall apply:\n       (1) ``active service'' has the meaning given it by section \n     101 of title 37;\n       (2) ``a retired member of a uniformed service'' means a \n     member or former member of a uniformed service who is \n     entitled, under statute, to retired, retirement, or retainer \n     pay on account of his/her service as such a member; and\n       (3) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is considered a preference \n     eligible only if\n       (A) his/her retirement was based on disability--\n       (i) resulting from injury or disease received in line of \n     duty as a direct result of armed conflict; or\n       (ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in \n     the line of duty during a period of war as defined by \n     sections 101 and 1101 of title 38;\n       (B) his/her service does not include twenty or more years \n     of full-time active service, regardless of when performed but \n     not including periods of active duty for training; or\n       (C) on November 30, 1964, he/she was employed in a position \n     to which this subchapter applies and thereafter he/she \n     continued to be so employed without a break in service of \n     more than 30 days.\n       The definition of ``preference eligible'' as set forth in 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2108 and section 1.102(p) of these regulations \n     shall apply to waivers of physical requirements in \n     determining an employee's qualifications for retention under \n     section 1.114 of these regulations.\n       H Regs:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis, or (3) attributable to \n     a change in party leadership or majority party status within \n     the House of Congress where the employee is employed.\n       C Regs:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis.\n       (f) Undue interruption is a degree of interruption that \n     would prevent the completion of required work by a covered \n     employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a \n     different position under this part. The 90-day standard \n     should be considered within the allowable limits of time and \n     quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, \n     deadlines, and other demands. However, work generally would \n     not be considered to be unduly interrupted if a covered \n     employee needs more than 90 days after the reduction in force \n     to perform the optimum quality or quantity of work.

APPLICATION OF PREFERENCE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       Prior to carrying out a reduction in force that will affect \n     covered employees, employing offices shall determine which, \n     if any, covered employees within a particular group of \n     competing covered employees are entitled to veterans' \n     preference eligibility status in accordance with these \n     regulations. In determining which covered employees will be \n     retained, employing offices will treat veterans' preference \n     as the controlling factor in retention decisions among such \n     competing covered employees, regardless of length of service \n     or performance, provided that the preference eligible \n     employee's performance has not been determined to be \n     unacceptable. Provided, a preference eligible employee who is \n     a ``disabled veteran'' under section 1.102(i) above who has a \n     compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or \n     more and whose performance has not been determined to be \n     unacceptable by an employing office is entitled to be \n     retained in preference to other preference eligible \n     employees. Provided, this section does not relieve an \n     employing office of any greater obligation it may be subject \n     to pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq.) as applied by \n     section 102(a)(9) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(9).\n\n     SEC. 1.113. CREDITING EXPERIENCE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       In computing length of service in connection with a \n     reduction in force, the employing office shall provide credit \n     to preference eligible covered employees as follows:\n       (a) a preference eligible covered employee who is not a \n     retired member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit \n     for the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces;\n       (b) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit for:\n       (1) the length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which \n     a campaign badge has been authorized; or\n       (2) the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces if he is included under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3501(a)(3)(A), \n     (B), or (C); and\n       (c) a preference eligible covered employee is entitled to \n     credit for:\n       (1) service rendered as an employee of a county committee \n     established pursuant to section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation \n     and Domestic Allotment Act or of a committee or association \n     of producers described in section 10(b) of the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act, reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural \n     Marketing Agreement Act of 1937; and\n       (2) service rendered as an employee described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c) if such employee moves or has moved, on or after \n     January 1, 1966, without a break in service of more than 3 \n     days, from a position in a nonappropriated fund \n     instrumentality of the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard to a position in the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard, respectively, that is not described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c).\n\n     SEC. 1.114. WAIVER OF PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS IN REDUCTIONS IN \n                   FORCE.\n\n       (a) If an employing office determines, on the basis of \n     evidence before it, that a covered employee is preference \n     eligible, the employing office shall waive, in determining \n     the covered employee's retention status in a reduction in \n     force:\n       (1) requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the \n     requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of \n     the position; and\n       (2) physical requirements if, in the opinion of the \n     employing office, on the basis of evidence before it, \n     including any recommendation of an accredited physician \n     submitted by the employee, the preference eligible covered \n     employee is physically able to perform efficiently the duties \n     of the position.\n       (b) If an employing office determines that a covered \n     employee who is a preference eligible as a disabled veteran \n     as described in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108(3)(C) and has a \n     compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or \n     more is not able to fulfill the physical requirements of the \n     covered position, the employing office shall notify the \n     preference eligible covered employee of the reasons for the \n     determination and of the right to respond and to submit \n     additional information to the employing office within 15 days \n     of the date of the notification. Should the preference \n     eligible covered employee make a timely response, the highest \n     ranking individual or group of individuals with authority to \n     make employment decisions on behalf of the employing office, \n     shall render a final determination of the physical ability of \n     the preference eligible covered employee to perform the \n     duties of the covered position, taking into account the \n     evidence before it, including the response and any additional \n     information provided by the preference eligible. When the \n     employing office has completed its review of the proposed \n     disqualification on the basis of physical disability, it \n     shall send its findings to the preference eligible covered \n     employee.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any obligation it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 \n     et seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n     SEC. 1.115.

ADOPTION OF VETERANS' PREFERENCE POLICY.\n\n       No later than 120 calendar days following Congressional \n     approval of this regulation, each employing office that \n     employs one or more covered employees or that seeks \n     applicants for a covered position shall adopt its written \n     policy specifying how it has integrated the veterans' \n     preference requirements of the Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act of 1998 and these regulations into its \n     employment and retention processes. Each such employing \n     office will make its policies available to applicants for \n     appointment to a covered position and to covered employees in \n     accordance with these regulations. The act of adopting a \n     veterans' preference policy shall not relieve any employing \n     office of any other responsibility or requirement of the \n     Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 or these \n     regulations. An employing office may amend or replace its \n     veterans' preference policies as it deems necessary or \n     appropriate, so long as the resulting policies are consistent \n     with the VEOA and these regulations.\n\n     SEC. 1.117.

The term ``personnel records \n     relevant to the claim'', for example, would include records \n     relating to the veterans' preference determination regarding \n     the person bringing the claim and records relating to any \n     veterans' preference determinations regarding other \n     applicants for the covered position the person sought, or \n     records relating to the veterans' preference determinations \n     regarding other covered employees in the person's position or \n     job classification. The date of final disposition of the \n     charge or the action means the latest of the date of \n     expiration of the statutory period within which the aggrieved \n     person may file a complaint with the Office or in a U.S. \n     District Court or, where an action is brought against an \n     employing office by the aggrieved person, the date on which \n     such litigation is terminated.\n\n     SEC. 1.118.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide \nimmunity for reports of suspected terrorist activity or suspicious \nbehavior and response; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator Lieberman, in introducing the See Something, Say Something Act \nof 2011.\n  The number of thwarted and failed attacks in the past few years and \nthe Fort Hood attack, which left 13 people dead and wounded dozens, are \nsobering reminders that terrorists continue to threaten our nation. We \nhave seen, however, that an alert citizenry can be our first line of \ndefense against terrorist attacks as evidenced by events only a few \nweeks ago in Texas.\n  Tips from alert citizens led to an investigation and the eventual \narrest of Khalid Aldawsari on a federal charge of attempted use of a \nweapon of mass destruction. Specifically, an alert chemical supplier \nreported Aldawsari's suspicious attempt to purchase a toxic chemical \ncalled phenol to the FBI. Shipping company personnel also notified \nlocal police officers about related suspicious behavior. Without these \ncalls to law enforcement, it is possible that a person who wrote in his \ndiary ``it is time for Jihad'' would have carried out an attack or \nattacks on his numerous intended targets, including dams, nuclear power \nplants, and former President George W. Bush.\n  Individuals must be protected from frivolous lawsuits when they \nreport, in good faith, suspicious behavior that may indicate terrorist \nactivity. That is why I am again introducing legislation, along with \nSenator Lieberman, that will provide these important protections.\n  In the 2007 homeland security law, Senator Lieberman and I authored a \nprovision to encourage people to report potential terrorist threats \ndirected against transportation systems. This legislation would expand \nthose protections to reports of suspicious behavior in sectors other \nthan transportation. For example, reports of suspicious activity could \nbe equally important in detecting terrorist plans to attack ``soft \ntargets'' like hotels, shopping malls, restaurants, and religious \ninstitutions.\n  In December 2008, a Federal jury convicted five men from New Jersey \nof conspiring to murder American soldiers at Fort Dix. According to law \nenforcement officials, the report of an alert store clerk, who stated \nthat a customer had brought in a video showing men firing weapons and \nshouting in Arabic, triggered their investigation. If not for the \nreport of this vigilant store clerk, law enforcement may not have \ndisrupted this plot against military personnel at Fort Dix. Real life \nexamples like these highlight the need for this bill.\n  That store clerk's action likely saved hundreds of lives. It reveals \na core truth of the dangerous times in which we live. Our safety \ndepends on more than just police officers, intelligence analysts, and \nsoldiers. It also depends on the alertness and civic responsibility of \nall Americans. So we must encourage citizens to be watchful and to \nreport suspicious activity whenever it occurs.\n  As a result of the devastating 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, Senator \nLieberman and I convened hearings held by the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to examine lessons learned from those \nattacks. These hearings helped bring to light the reality that \nterrorists might shift their attention from high-value, high-security \ntargets to less secure commercial facilities, where there remains the \npotential for mass casualties and widespread panic.\n  Many of the Committee's witnesses during these hearings endorsed the \nidea of expanding the 2007 law beyond the transportation sector. \nIndeed, NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said that the 2007 law ``made \neminently good sense'' and recommended ``that it be expanded [to other \nsectors] if at all possible.''\n  The threat is real, and we must encourage citizens to be watchful and \nto report suspicious activity whenever it occurs. Our legal system, \nhowever, can be misused to chill the willingness of citizens to come \nforward and report possible dangers. As widely reported by the media in \n2006, US Airways removed 6 Islamic clerics from a flight after other \npassengers expressed concerns that some of the clerics had moved out of \nthe their assigned seats and had requested, but were not using, seat \nbelt extenders that could possibly double as weapons. In response to \nthese concerns, US Airways officials removed these individuals from the \nplane so that they could further investigate.\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\n  For voicing their reasonable fears that these passengers could be \nrehearsing or preparing to execute a hijacking, these concerned \ncitizens found themselves as defendants in a civil rights lawsuit and \naccused of bigotry.\n  The existence of this lawsuit illustrates how unfair it is to allow \nprivate citizens to be intimidated into silence by the threat of \nlitigation. Would the passengers have spoken up if they had anticipated \nthat there would be a lawsuit filed against them? Even if such suits \nfail, they can expose citizens to heavy costs in time and legal fees.\n  The bill we introduce today would provide civil immunity in American \ncourts for any person acting in good faith who reports any suspicious \ntransaction, activity, or occurrence related to an act of terrorism. \nSpecifically, the bill would encourage people to pass on information to \nfederal officials with responsibility for preventing, protecting \nagainst, disrupting, or responding to a terrorist act, or to Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement officials, without fear of being sued \nfor doing their civic duty. Only disclosures made to those responsible \nofficials would be protected by the legislation.\n  Once a report is received, those officials would be responsible for \nassessing its reasonableness and determining whether further action is \nrequired. If they take reasonable action to mitigate the reported \nthreat, they, too, would be protected from lawsuits. Just as we should \nnot discourage reporting suspicious incidents, we also should not \ndiscourage reasonable responses to them.\n  Let me be very clear that this bill does not offer any protection \nwhatsoever if an individual makes a statement that he or she knows to \nbe false. No one will be able to use this protection as cover for \nmischievous, vengeful, or biased falsehoods.\n  Our laws and legal system must not intimidate people into silence or \nprevent our officials from responding to terrorist threats. Protecting \ncitizens who make good faith reports--and that's an important condition \nin this bill--of potentially lethal activities is essential to \nmaintaining homeland security. Our bill offers protection in a measured \nway that discourages abuses.\n  Each of us has an important responsibility in the fight against \nterrorism. It is not a fight that can be left to law enforcement alone. \nThe police simply can't be everywhere all the time. Whether at a hotel, \na mall, or an arena, homeland security and law enforcement officials \nneed all citizens to alert them to unattended packages and behavior \nthat appears out of the ordinary.\n  Along these lines, I applaud DHS Secretary Napolitano for \nestablishing the Department's ``If you see something, say something'' \ncampaign and the recent partnerships with various organizations \nincluding the NFL. The Department is taking steps to expand this effort \nwith public education and materials for businesses, communities, and \ncitizens. As the Department's campaign continues to grow, there will be \na greater need for this legislation as our citizens become better \neducated.\n  The National Sheriffs' Association, the National Association of Town \nWatch, and other national organizations have endorsed this legislation.\n  If someone ``sees something'' suspicious, Congress should encourage \nhim or her to ``say something'' about it. This bill promotes and \nprotects that civic duty. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 507. A bill to provide for increased Federal oversight of \nprescription opioid treatment and assistance to States in reducing \nopioid abuse, diversion, and deaths; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an \nimportant piece of legislation, the Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention \nand Treatment Act of 2011--an important bill that is needed to address \nthe rapid increase in deaths and overdoses from methadone and other \nopioid prescription drugs in the United States. These deaths have hit \nmy home state of West Virginia particularly hard, but I know that every \nState is struggling with this serious problem.\n  In the 111th Congress, Senator Corker and I, along with our \ncolleague, the late Senator Kennedy, introduced the Methadone Treatment \nand Protection Act of 2009 a similar piece of legislation that stemmed \nfrom a disturbing rise in deaths due to methadone, a synthetic opioid \nprescription drug that had been increasingly used for pain management. \nBefore 1990, it was used primarily to treat opioid addiction. Because \nof its high efficacy and low cost, methadone is frequently used for \npain management. However, if not used correctly, methadone can be a \npowerful and deadly drug because it works differently than other \npainkillers. Methadone stays in a person's body for a longer period of \ntime than the pain relief lasts so a person who does not know better \nmight take far too much of the drug, possibly leading to respiratory \ndistress, cardiac arrhythmia and even death.\n  Methadone prescriptions for pain management grew from about 531,000 \nin 1998 to about 4.1 million in 2006--nearly eightfold. During that \ntime, poisoning deaths involving methadone increased nearly sevenfold, \nfrom almost 790 in 1999 to 5,420 in 2006. Deaths from other opioids \nhave also skyrocketed in the last decade. And, these deaths may \nactually be underreported, because there is no comprehensive reporting \nsystem for opioid-related deaths in the United States.\n  Overdoses from methadone are part of a larger disturbing trend of \noverdoses and deaths from prescription painkillers, or opioid drugs--a \ntrend driven by a knowledge gap about how to treat serious pain in a \nsafe and effective manner, by misperceptions about the safety of \nprescription drugs, and by the diversion of prescription drugs for \nillicit uses. In 2009, there were nearly 4.6 million drug-related \nemergency department, ED, visits of which nearly \\1/2\\, 45.1 percent, \nor 2.1 million, were attributed to prescription drug misuse or abuse, \naccording to data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network, DAWN. And, \nemergency department visits involving misuse or abuse of \npharmaceuticals nearly doubled between 2004 and 2009, to over 1.2 \nmillion visits.\n  This bill begins to address these problems. First, with respect to \nthe knowledge gap about safe pain management, the bill for the first \ntime includes a training requirement for health care professionals to \nbe licensed to prescribe these powerful drugs. Currently, the \nControlled Substances Act requires that every person who dispenses or \nwho proposes to dispense controlled narcotics, including methadone, \nwhether for pain management or opioid treatment, obtain a registration \nfrom the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA. Unfortunately there is \nno requirement as a condition of receiving the registration that these \npractitioners receive any education on the use of these controlled \nnarcotics, including methadone. Physicians struggle every day with \ndetermining who has a real need for pain treatment, and who is addicted \nor at risk. And yes, they struggle with our failure to provide adequate \ntreatment facilities for those who are addicted. This bill will help \nphysicians get the information they need to prescribe safely and better \nrecognize the signs of addiction in their patients.\n  Second, this bill addresses the knowledge gap among consumers--with a \ncompetitive grant program to states to distribute culturally sensitive \neducational materials about proper use of methadone and other opioids, \nand how to prevent opioid abuse, such as through safe disposal of \nprescription drugs. Preference will be given to states with a high \nincidence of overdoses and deaths.\n  Third, this bill creates a Controlled Substances Clinical Standards \nCommission to establish patient education guidelines, appropriate and \nsafe dosing standards for all forms of methadone and other opioids, \nbenchmark guidelines for the reduction of methadone abuse, appropriate \nconversion factors for transition patients from one opioid to another, \nand guidelines for the initiation of methadone and other opioids for \npain management. A standards commission will provide much-needed \nevidence-based information to improve guidance for the safe and \neffective use of these powerful and dangerous controlled substances.\n  Fourth, this bill provides crucial support to state prescription drug \nmonitoring programs. As of 2008, 38 states had enacted legislation \nrequiring prescription drug monitoring programs\n\n[[Page S1409]]\n\nand many states were able to fund these initiatives in part from grants \navailable through the Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring \nProgram. A second program created in 2005 through the National All \nSchedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act, NASPER, would provide \neven more assistance, and requires interoperability between states to \nreduce doctor shopping across state lines and diversion. Unfortunately, \nNASPER has only recently been funded with $2 million in the fiscal year \n2009 Omnibus legislation and $2 million in fiscal year 2010.\n  Here is just one example of why NASPER funding matters: recently, the \ngovernor of Florida announced a budget that would not fund a planned \nprescription monitoring program in his state, due to state budget \ndifficulties. This directly affects states in Appalachia because of the \nrampant drug trafficking between the two regions. In fact, the road \nfrom West Virginia to Florida is so well-travelled by drug traffickers \nand people seeking pain medication that it has been renamed the \n``OxyContin Highway,'' and flights from Huntington to Florida have been \nnicknamed ``the Oxy Express.'' It is crucial to finally give NASPER the \nfunding it needs, and this legislation would do so, with $25 million a \nyear to establish interoperable prescription drug monitoring programs \nwithin each state.\n  Finally, this bill would help solve the data gap when it comes to \nopioid-related deaths. Right now there is no comprehensive national \ndatabase of drug-related deaths in the United States, nor is there a \nstandard form for medical examiners to fill out with regard to opioid-\nrelated deaths. Since there is no comprehensive database of methadone-\nrelated deaths, the number of deaths may actually be underreported. In \norder to truly reduce the number of methadone-related deaths, quality \ndata must be collected and made available. This bill would create a \nNational Opioid Death Registry to track all opioid-related deaths and \nrelated information, and establish a standard form for medical \nexaminers to fill out which would include information for the National \nOpioid Death Registry.\n  Today we have an opportunity to change the harrowing statistics and \nstem the rising tide of deaths from methadone and other opioids by \nsupporting the Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of \n2011. This legislation provides a multifaceted approach to preventing \ntragic overdoses and deaths from methadone and other opioids. This is \nexactly what we need to improve the coordination of efforts and \nresources at the local, state, and federal level.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this timely and important piece of \nlegislation. In doing so, we will be on our way to saving lives and \nreducing the needless deaths that otherwise will continue to cause so \nmuch suffering among the people of this country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of New Mexico (for himself, Mr. Corker, Mr. Brown of \n        Ohio, Mr. Begich, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Franken, \n        Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 510. A bill to prevent drunk driving injuries and fatalities, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ROADS \nSAFE Act of 2011. I am pleased to be joined in introducing this \nlegislation by my colleague, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker and \n7 other colleagues.\n  This legislation will encourage the development of new tools to fight \ndrunk driving. It has the potential to save 8,000 lives every year by \nensuring that no one celebrating Fat Tuesday or St. Patrick's Day--or \nat any other time of the year--drives home drunk.\n  Tragic drunk driving crashes often prompt communities to more to \nprevent drunk driving. This was the case in my home State of New Mexico \nback in December of 1992. That is when a drunk driver killed a mother \nand her three girls on Christmas Eve. He was speeding down the highway \n90 miles an hour, going the wrong way down an interstate highway.\n  This crash helped change attitudes in my State. I was the state \nAttorney General back then and I went after drunk drivers. I worked to \nimpose stronger penalties for repeat drunk driver offenders, a lower \nlegal limit for intoxication, and shut down drive-through liquor \nwindows. I was successful in these efforts, in part, due to the new \nfocus, throughout the state on eliminating drunk driving.\n  We made progress in New Mexico on drunk driving, but we have a long \nway to go and it should not take yet another tragedy for us to do even \nmore to prevent drunk driving.\n  In 2009, drunk driving killed nearly 11,000 Americans, including 114 \npeople in New Mexico. That is an average of 30 people killed every day \nby drunk driving. This death toll is unacceptable. And it is all the \nmore shocking when you consider that each one of those deaths was \npreventable.\n  The United States has made significant progress in reducing drunk \ndriving over the years. Compared to 20 years ago, our roads are much \nsafer today. Yet even as the overall number of people killed on our \nhighways has declined, drunk driving still accounts for about one-third \nof all traffic fatalities.\n  It is even more worrisome that a drunk driver has just a 2 percent \nchance of being caught. In fact, one study found that a first-time \ndrunk driving offender has, on average, driven drunk 87 times before \nbeing arrested. Imagine, 87 times. Something must be done to prevent \nthese drivers from getting on the road in the first place.\n  The good news is there are potential technologies out there that \ncould do just that, which is why Senator Corker and I are introducing \nthe ROADS SAFE Act today. New safety technology has already transformed \nthe automobile and saved countless lives. For example, airbags and \nantilock brakes are now standard features in many vehicles. These \nsafety devices are built into the car and are unobtrusive to the \ndriver. Such technologies are an important reason we have fewer traffic \nfatalities today.\n  Imagine a future where vehicles could detect whether a driver is \ndrunk when he gets behind the wheel--before he even starts his vehicle. \nThat would mean no drunk driving crashes if it were impossible for \ndrunk drivers to drive. If such technology were widely deployed in \ncars, approximately 8,000 lives could be saved every year.\n  I realize many may think this is a farfetched idea. But consider \nthis: vehicles today can already give driving directions, thanks to GPS \nsatellite navigation devices. Some cars can even parallel park \nthemselves. New Mexico and other states require convicted drunk drivers \nto use an ignition interlock, a breathalyzer device they blow into \nbefore their vehicle's engine will start. The success of ignition \ninterlocks for preventing repeat drunk driving offenses suggests a \nbetter technology could be used to prevent all drunk driving.\n  In 2008, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration partnered \nwith leading automakers to explore the feasibility of in-vehicle \ntechnologies to prevent drunk driving. The Driver Alcohol Detection \nSystem for Safety Program--or DADSS--is a great example of how we can \nleverage federal funds with private investment to improve the safety of \nour transportation system. The goal of DADSS is to explore the \nfeasibility, potential benefits, and public policy challenges \nassociated with using in-vehicle technology to prevent drunk driving. \nThe recent progress of this cooperative effort fuels optimism that such \ntechnology could be deployed within 5 to 10 years.\n  Clearly, such advanced technologies must win widespread public \nacceptance in order to be effective. They must be moderately priced, \nabsolutely reliable, and unobtrusive to sober drivers.\n  Some of the industry groups will claim that this initiative is meant \nto stop all social alcohol consumption. They claim that you will no \nlonger be able to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. They are wrong. \nThe aim is to stop drunk driving, not discourage responsible social \ndrinking. If deployed the technology will be set to detect drunk \ndrivers, those with a BAC of 0.08 or higher.\n  Development of this technology is also widely supported by the \npublic, many of whom have a glass of wine with dinner. A recent \nInsurance Institute for Highway Safety poll found that 64 percent of \nAmericans believe advanced alcohol detection technology is a good idea \nand that it is reliable.\n\n[[Page S1410]]\n\n  So, what would the ROADS SAFE Act do? This legislation would \nauthorize $12 million annually for the DADSS program. This is not new \nspending. Funding for this program would come from the existing, and \noften unspent, Seat Belt Incentive grants program.\n  This is a smart investment in public safety. In addition to the human \ncosts, drunk driving also has direct and indirect economic costs. Those \ninclude damaged property, medical bills, and lost productivity. In \neconomic terms, drunk driving costs $129 billion dollars per year. Of \ncourse, such monetary costs cannot be compared to the value of saving \n8,000 lives every year.\n  Several organizations dedicated to fighting drunk driving already \nsupport this bipartisan proposal. Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the \nCentury Council, and the Distilled Spirits Council all have signed on \nin support of the ROADS SAFE Act.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to join me, Senator Corker, and these \nimportant organizations in the fight against drunk driving. We urge you \nto support the ROADS SAFE Act. We have made much progress in our \nefforts to prevent drunk driving, but there is so much more to be done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 510\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to provide \nenhanced penalties for marketing controlled substances to minors; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with \nSenator Grassley, the Saving Kids From Dangerous Drugs Act of 2011.\n  For years, law enforcement has seen drug dealers flavoring and \nmarketing their illegal drugs to entice minors, using techniques like \ncombining drugs with chocolate and fruit flavors, and even packaging \nthem to look like actual candy and soda. This bill would address this \nserious and dangerous problem by providing stronger penalties when drug \ndealers alter controlled substances by combining them with beverages or \ncandy products, marketing or packaging them to resemble legitimate \nproducts, or flavoring or coloring them with the intent to sell them to \nminors.\n  Recent media reports demonstrate the need for this legislation. The \nSanta Cruz Sentinel had an article earlier this month about someone who \nis planning to market sodas laced with THC, the psychoactive component \nin marijuana. Some of his planned sodas include orange-flavored \n``Orange Krush'' and grape-flavored ``Grape Ape'' which actually was \nthe name of a children's cartoon character!\n  Regrettably, this is a problem that has persisted for many years, \nwith drug dealers trying various methods of luring kids to try many \ndangerous drugs. For example, in March of 2008, Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, DEA, agents seized cocaine near Modesto, California, \nthat had been flavored like cinnamon, coconut, lemon and strawberry.\n  Similarly, there have been many incidents involving methamphetamine. \nIn a 2007 article entitled Flavored Meth Use on the Rise, USA Today \nstated that ``reports of candy-flavored methamphetamine are emerging \naround the nation, stirring concern among police and abuse prevention \nexperts that drug dealers are marketing the drug to younger people.''\n  The size and sophistication of some of these operations is \nparticularly alarming. In March of 2006, DEA discovered large-scale \nmarijuana cultivation and production facilities in Emeryville and \nOakland, California. Thousands of marijuana plants, and thousands of \nmarijuana-related soda, candy, and other products were seized from the \ndrug dealers' facilities. The products were designed and packaged to \nlook like legitimate products, including an item called ``Munchy Way'' \ncandy bars.\n  Current law already provides an enhanced penalty if someone \ndistributes drugs to a minor. Under this provision, the maximum \nsentence for the underlying distribution offense is doubled, and \ntripled if it is a repeat offense.\n  Similarly, this bill would provide an enhanced penalty in those \nsituations where drug dealers are altering controlled substances in \nways that could make them more appealing to minors. Someone who is \naltering a controlled substance in ways prohibited by the legislation \nwould be subject to a penalty of up to ten years, in addition to the \npenalty for the underlying offense. If someone commits a second offense \nprohibited by the act, they would be face an additional penalty of up \nto 20 years.\n  This bill sends a strong and clear message to drug dealers--if you \nflavor or candy up your drugs to try to entice our children, there will \nbe a very heavy price to pay. It will help stop drug dealers from \nengaging in these activities, and punish them appropriately if they \ndon't.\n  The Senate passed a similar version of this legislation in the last \nCongress, but it was not considered in the House.\n\n[[Page S1411]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 513\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Saving Kids From Dangerous \n     Drugs Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. OFFENSES INVOLVING CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES MARKETED TO \n                   MINORS.\n\n       Section 401 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     841) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Offenses Involving Controlled Substances Marketed to \n     Minors.--\n       ``(1) Unlawful acts.--Except as authorized under this \n     title, including paragraph (3), it shall be unlawful for any \n     person at least 18 years of age to knowingly or intentionally \n     manufacture or create, with intent to manufacture, create, \n     distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance listed in \n     schedule I or II that is--\n       ``(A) combined with a beverage or candy product;\n       ``(B) marketed or packaged to appear similar to a beverage \n     or candy product; or\n       ``(C) modified by flavoring or coloring the controlled \n     substance with the intent to distribute, dispense, or sell \n     the controlled substance to a person under 18 years of age.\n       ``(2) Penalties.--Except as provided in section 418, 419, \n     or 420, any person who violates paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection shall be subject to--\n       ``(A) an additional term of imprisonment of not to exceed \n     10 years for a first offense involving the same controlled \n     substance and schedule; and\n       ``(B) an additional term of imprisonment of not to exceed \n     20 years for a second or subsequent offense involving the \n     same controlled substance and schedule.\n       ``(3) Exceptions.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any \n     controlled substance that--\n       ``(A) has been approved by the Secretary under section 505 \n     of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355), \n     if the contents, marketing, and packaging of the controlled \n     substance have not been altered from the form approved by the \n     Secretary; or\n       ``(B) has been altered at the direction of a practitioner \n     who is acting for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual \n     course of professional practice.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENTENCING GUIDELINES.\n\n       Pursuant to its authority under section 994 of title 28, \n     United States Code, and in accordance with this section, the \n     United States Sentencing Commission shall review its \n     guidelines and policy statements to ensure that the \n     guidelines provide an appropriate additional penalty increase \n     to the sentence otherwise applicable in Part D of the \n     Guidelines Manual if the defendant was convicted of a \n     violation of section 401(h) of the Controlled Substances act, \n     as added by section 2 of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Feinstein, in cosponsoring the Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs \nAct of 2011. I believe we have an ongoing moral obligation to ensure \nour young people have every opportunity to grow up without being \naccosted by drug pushers at every turn, whether on TV, in the movies, \nor on the way to school.\n  This bipartisan legislation--which has previously passed the Senate \nwith unanimous consent--comes in response to ongoing warnings issued by \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, and the White House's Office \nof National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP, about highly addictive and \ndangerous drugs being colored, packaged, and flavored in ways that \nappear to be designed to attract use by children. As ranking member of \nthe Committee on the Judiciary and cochairman of the Senate Drug \nCaucus, I can tell you that the most at-risk population for drug abuse \nis our young people. Sadly, recent youth surveys are indicating youth \ndrug use is increasing. Research has shown time and again that if you \ncan keep a child drug free until they turn 20, chances are very slim \nthat they will ever try or become addicted to drugs. Unfortunately, \nunscrupulous drug dealers are all too aware of statistics like these \nand have developed new techniques and marketing gimmicks to lure in \nyounger users. As a parent and grandparent, this is extremely \ntroubling.\n  Drug dealers are now flavoring and disguising drugs to make them \nappear and taste like candy. For instance, some drugs that have been \nrecovered by the DEA and local law enforcement have been flavored to \ntaste like strawberry and are known on the street as ``Strawberry \nQuick.'' Other flavors, such as lemon, coconut, cinnamon and chocolate \nare clearly being used to make highly addictive drugs like meth and \ncocaine seem less harmful and more appealing. Soft drinks are also \nbeing laced with THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, and marketed \nwith names like ``Canna Cola'' and ``Doc Weed.'' Law enforcement has \nalso recovered drugs that have unique designs which could be appealing \nto children. For example, Ecstasy pills imprinted with President \nObama's likeness or with images of popular cartoon characters have been \nseized in raids. These flavored and disguised drugs are also being \nmarketed in smaller amounts, making it cheaper and more accessible to \nchildren. According to an article in USA Today, at least 8 States have \nreported instances involving candy flavored drugs, and many law \nenforcement officials are expecting these deadly substances to \ninfiltrate their States in the near future.\n  The DEA has made an effort to stop these practices. For example, the \nDEA arrested three men in an undercover operation in California where \ncandy flavored cocaine was being distributed. The DEA seized at least \nfour different flavors of cocaine along with other dangerous \nsubstances. The estimated street value of the flavored cocaine seized \nin this operation was $272,400. The DEA also arrested 12 people in \nconnection to a marijuana-laced candy and soft drink operation in 2006. \nThe marijuana-laced candy that was seized in this operation was \npackaged to look like well known brand name candy bars. These drug \nbusts further illustrate the fact that drug dealers will stop at \nnothing to hook a new generation on these deadly substances.\n  Currently, Federal law enhances the criminal penalties that apply \nwhen a person sells drugs to anyone under the age of 21. When this \noccurs, the Federal penalties are doubled--or tripled for a repeat \noffense--and a mandatory minimum of at least 1 year must also apply. \nHowever, this penalty applies only to someone who actually sells drugs \nto someone under 21.\n  The Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act would increase the prison \nsentence to anyone who knowingly or intentionally manufactures or \ncreates with the intent to distribute a controlled substance that has \nbeen flavored, colored, packaged or otherwise altered in a way that is \ndesigned to make it more appealing to a person under 18 years of age. \nThe DEA busts are prime examples of why we need this bipartisan bill to \nkeep drug dealers from peddling their poison to our children.\n  The fight against deadly drugs is an ongoing struggle. In light of \nthe fact that youth drug use is increasing we must do all we can to \nprotect the most vulnerable among us. We must send a clear message to \nthose wishing to prey on our youth that you risk serious prison time \nwhen you target our future.\n  Although this bill was passed out of the Senate unanimously in 2010, \nthe House never passed the bill in the 111th Congress. I ask that my \ncolleagues join us again in support of this important legislation and \npass the Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act, and I encourage the \nHouse of Representatives to take up this important bill and help remove \nthese dangerous candy flavored drugs from our communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, and Mr. \n        Akaka)\n  S. 514. A bill to amend chapter 21 of title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide that fathers of permanently disabled or deceased veterans shall \nbe included with mothers of such veterans as preference eligibles for \ntreatment in the civil service; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the sacrifices of military families all too \noften go unrecognized. For every one of the 186,000 troops currently \ndeployed in Iraq and Afghanistan, there is a family that patiently \nwaits for their servicemember's safe return. There are countless wives \nand husbands, separated by a deployment, who celebrate anniversaries \nover email and deployed parents who see their children age in \nphotographs. None of these military families ask for recognition, but \ntheir sacrifices deserve our respect.\n  I am pleased by the President and First Lady's recent efforts to \nrecognize the challenges facing military families. Their leadership on \nthis issue will help\n\n[[Page S1412]]\n\nensure that all agencies and departments of the Federal Government will \nlend a hand to servicemembers, veterans, and their families.\n  Our Nation asks a lot of military families. Military families must \nprovide support in innumerable ways during a deployment. From child \ncare, to paying bills, dealing with legal issues and household repairs, \nmilitary families work together to deal with the absence of the \nservicemember. Should a servicemember return home wounded or weakened \nby the tolls of war, we ask military families to help take care of \ntheir son or daughter, husband or wife.\n  We hope and pray that all those who are sent to war will return \nsafely to the arms of their loved ones. However, we know that this is \nnot always the case. Since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began, \nthere have been far too many funerals of talented and patriotic \nOregonians who have died in service to their country.\n  Although nothing the Government can do will ever make up for the loss \nof a loved one, we do extend certain benefits to the parents of those \nwho are killed in war. Today, along with Senators Lieberman, Collins, \nAkaka, I am introducing the Gold Star Fathers Act to update one of \nthose benefits; the preferences for Federal hiring to ensure that the \nparents of fallen servicemembers have no barriers to Federal service.\n  The Office of Personnel Management currently allows unmarried mothers \nof fallen soldiers to claim a 10-point veterans' preference when \napplying for Federal jobs. The Gold Star Fathers Act would simply \nextend this preference to unmarried fathers of fallen soldiers. This \nlegislation will expand opportunities for Gold Star families to bring \ntheir dedication, compassion, and patriotism to the Federal Government. \nIt is my hope that this legislation can be passed quickly.\n  These Gold Star Mothers and Gold Star Fathers have sacrificed more \nthan we as a country can ever hope to repay. All we can ever hope to do \nis to ensure that these sacrifices are never made in vain.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 514\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 95\n\n       Whereas over 700,000 individuals in the United States, from \n     young children to senior citizens, have an ostomy, a surgical \n     procedure that creates an artificial opening from the abdomen \n     to the intestines or urinary system to allow for the \n     elimination of bodily wastes;\n       Whereas active duty military personnel who are wounded in \n     battle often receive an ostomy as a result of penetrating \n     colorectal injuries;\n       Whereas an ostomy procedure can be essential to many \n     patients who suffer on a daily basis from serious, chronic, \n     or life-threatening traumatic injury to the abdomen, or other \n     illnesses and conditions, such as colorectal or bladder \n     cancer, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, birth defects, \n     or other intestinal or urinary medical conditions;\n       Whereas following ostomy surgery, patients may need \n     specially-fitted medical products to manage intestinal or \n     urinary system function, temporarily or permanently restore \n     intestinal or urinary system function, or re-establish \n     activities of daily living, and improve quality of life;\n       Whereas ostomy products are prosthetic devices prescribed \n     by health care providers, and ostomy products are prosthetic \n     devices, as defined in section 1861(s)(8) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(s)(8));\n       Whereas policy and reimbursement approaches to ostomy \n     products may affect access for patients in need;\n       Whereas ostomy products are customized to the clinical \n     needs of individual patients and are not the same as other \n     easily interchangeable medical supplies, such as gauze or \n     bandages;\n       Whereas ostomy care and prosthetics can be important to \n     restoring function and improving quality of life for patients \n     in need of this care;\n       Whereas ongoing advances and innovation in ostomy \n     prosthetics technology can dramatically improve the lives of \n     individuals who undergo ostomy surgery by helping to \n     normalize the intestinal or urinary system function of such \n     individuals, improve physical well-being, and often enable \n     the individual to rejoin the workforce; and\n       Whereas Congress recognizes the importance of encouraging \n     and facilitating the development and use of new medical \n     technologies: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the life-saving role of ostomy care and \n     prosthetics in the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of \n     people in the United States;\n       (2) recognizes that if a surgical procedure results in a \n     patient needing a prosthetic that manages or restores \n     intestinal or urinary system function, specifically the \n     control of the elimination of the body's waste products, it \n     is important for such patient to have access to the care that \n     will best meet the patient's needs; and\n       (3) encourages innovation of, and access to, medical \n     devices that restore or improve intestinal or urinary system \n     function of people in the United States with an ostomy.\n\n[[Page S1413]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/08/senate-section/article/S1413-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 158.
