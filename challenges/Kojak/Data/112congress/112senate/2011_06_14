Madam President, on this side of the aisle, we Democrats \nwant to protect seniors on Medicare. That is our top priority. I have \nheard my friend, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, come here \nand talk for hours, and he keeps talking about things that really have \nno bearing on what I think is important for the country today.\n  We know the Republicans have put forward a budget that destroys \nMedicare. That is what we received. We voted on it over here, and it \nwas turned down. It must be the Republicans' top priority because we \nhave had votes on the Senate floor protecting taxpayer handouts, \nespecially to oil companies. We had a full debate here that suggested \nwe take this money that now goes to these oil companies--and even \nexecutives have said that they do not want the money, that they do not \nneed the money--and apply it toward the deficit. Overwhelmingly, the \nRepublicans voted no, so we couldn't get it done. So it appears clear \nthey would rather balance the budget on the backs of seniors and \nMedicare than end the constant giveaways to oil and gas companies \nmaking billions a year in profits. These oil companies have made the \nlargest profits in the history of the world. In the last quarter, they \nhad $36 billion in net profits.\n  The Republicans' plan to end Medicare as we know it would put \ninsurance company bureaucrats between seniors and their doctors and \nraise seniors' drug costs, forcing them to pay $6,400 more out-of-\npocket costs every year. The American people are overwhelmingly opposed \nto this plan to end Medicare. A poll released yesterday showed that \nless than half the Republicans support the Republicans' plan to end \nMedicare. Overwhelmingly, Independents and Democrats joined with these \nRepublicans who oppose the Republicans' plan to end Medicare.\n  We believe there is a need to reduce our deficit. That is why we have \nbeen working with Vice President Biden. Representing the Democrats in \nthe Senate, Senator Inouye, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nand\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\nSenator Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, are meeting with \nVice President Biden, and progress is being made.\n  There is no question we should be closing tax loopholes and targeting \nwasteful giveaways to oil companies. I am sure Vice President Biden is \nleading the Senators and House Members toward that end. Closing these \ntax loopholes and targeting wasteful giveaways to the oil companies \nmaking these record profits while charging--Madam President, here in \nthe Washington, DC, area, as I do my morning exercise, I walk past a \nstation right off the waterfront where gasoline is $5 a gallon. I \nhaven't looked at it since this past week, but that is what it is. It \nis over $4 a gallon all over the United States, in many, many different \nplaces. We should be focusing on that instead of ending Medicare.\n  So I tell my friend, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, come \nand talk about the Republican plan to end Medicare as we know it. And \nwhat about the subsidies for these oil companies. Shouldn't we get rid \nof them? It is time the Republicans abandoned their ideological plan to \nend Medicare and work with us to strengthen and preserve our promise to \nseniors instead.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, since the attacks on 9/11 and the \nvery beginning of the war on terror in 2001, most Americans have \nunderstood that we could no longer kind of passively wait for the next \nenemy attack. In order to defeat, dismantle, and disrupt al-Qaida, our \nintelligence, military, and law enforcement officials would have to \nwork together to defeat terrorist cells, whether they are in the tribal \nareas of Pakistan or, frankly, here in our own backyard. Yet, if some \nhad begun to think, after the killing of Osama bin Laden, that we could \nnow sit back and relax a little, the recent arrest in my State, in the \nhometown of my colleague, Senator Paul, of two foreign fighters who \nhave openly admitted to conducting attacks against U.S. soldiers and \nmarines in Iraq shows how mistaken a notion that is.\n  Let's look at that again. Here are two Iraqi terrorists arrested in \nBowling Green, KY, within the last couple of weeks. And the Director of \nCentral Intelligence stated in an open hearing on Capitol Hill last \nweek that about 1,000 members of al-Qaida in Iraq continue to fight us \nover in Iraq. Now we know that at least two of them--at least two of \nthem--have left the battlefield over there to live right here in the \nUnited States.\n  The case of Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi shows us \nthat terrorists continue to pose an imminent threat. We owe a debt of \ngratitude to the men and women who made sure they couldn't inflict more \nharm on Americans here or abroad once they arrived here. Anyone who has \nread about the investigation into their activities can only be \nimpressed with the courage, the skill, and the professionalism of those \nwho were involved in this effort.\n  Specifically, I wish to thank the men and women from the FBI's \nLouisville Division, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western \nDistrict of Kentucky, the Louisville Joint Terrorism Task Force, and \nthe Justice Department's National Security Division. Every one of those \nfolks involved clearly did their job, and they did it very well.\n  That having been said, I think it is safe to say that a lot of \nKentuckians, including me, would like to know why two men who either \nkilled or plotted to kill U.S. soldiers and marines over in Iraq aren't \nsitting in a jail cell in Guantanamo right now. When it comes to enemy \ncombatants, our top priority, as I have said repeatedly, should be to \ncapture, detain, and interrogate. That wasn't done here. These men are \nforeign fighters--unlawful enemy combatants--who should be treated as \nsuch.\n  Alwan is on tape admitting to having procured explosives and missiles \nin Iraq and to using them daily--daily--to conduct strikes.\n  He said he had personally used improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, \nhundreds of times over a period of several years. He has talked about \nusing them against U.S. troops and the damage he has done to U.S. \nmilitary vehicles such as Humvees. He told undercover agents he was \n``very good with a sniper rifle end.'' In a reference to attacks on \nU.S. troops, he said his lunch and dinner would be ``an American.'' He \nadmitted that he ``collected everything,'' TNT, electronic detonators, \ntank explosive detonators, IED detonators, mortar shells, and rocket-\npropelled grenades. He also said that he often placed IEDs after the \ncurfew, and it was this activity that led to his being asked to join \nthe mujahedin.\n  He even tried to demonstrate his expertise as a foreign fighter by \ndrawing diagrams of four types of IEDs, explaining how to build them \nand discussing various occasions in which he used these devices against \nU.S. troops in Iraq. In describing one particular type of IED, Alwan \nsaid, ``Anything lethal could be stuffed into it, such as ball \nbearings, nails, gravel, and whatever item that kills.'' Alwan's \nfingerprints have also allegedly been found on IEDs over in Iraq in an \narea in which he is known to have lived.\n  Once Alwan made his way to the United States, he is alleged to have \nrecruited Hammadi to continue his fight against Americans over in Iraq \nby burrowing himself into a community where he thought he would go \nundetected. Like Alwan, Hammadi was an experienced insurgent fighter in \nIraq. He too had participated in IED attacks and was part of an \ninsurgent group that had 11 surface-to-air missiles.\n  Together, these two men organized shipments of money and weapons, \nincluding rocket grenade launchers, Stinger missiles, and C4 explosives \nthat they thought they were sending back to the war zone in Iraq.\n  Anyone who has taken up arms against U.S. forces in the field of \nbattle is an enemy combatant, pure and simple, and should be treated \nlike one. They should be hunted and captured, detained and \ninterrogated, and tried away from civilian populations according to the \nlaws of war.\n  Unfortunately, since the earliest days of this administration when \nthe President signed a series of Executive orders which directed the \nclosing of the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, and \nlimited the ability of the military and intelligence community to \ndetain and interrogate prisoners, a higher priority has been placed \nupon prosecution than on executing the war on terror.\n  But I can say with certainty that Kentuckians don't want foreign \nfighters who have bragged about killing and maiming U.S. soldiers in a \ncombat theater treated like common criminals in their own backyards. \nThey don't want foreign fighters to be afforded all of the legal rights \nand privileges of U.S. citizens. They don't want foreign fighters to \nhave their interrogations curtailed. And they don't want their fellow \ncitizens in Kentucky subjected to the risk of reprisal that is \nassociated with these kinds of cases, reprisals against civilian \njudges, reprisals against civilian jurors, and the broader community in \nwhich civilian trials are held. That was one of the many reasons that \nresidents and lawmakers in New York City rebelled against the \nadministration's equally foolhardy plan to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed \nin a courtroom in New York. That is to say nothing of the security \ncosts and the disruption that civilian trials for terrorists create for \nany American community. We have firsthand experience of this from the \n2006 murder trial of Zacarias Moussaoui in Alexandria, VA.\n  Despite all of this, however, the administration seems fixated on the \nidea that once we have caught terrorists, the goal isn't to get as much \nintelligence out of them as quickly as possible to prevent further \nattacks on soldiers and citizens but to prove that we can treat them \nthe same way we treat everybody else.\n\n[[Page S3743]]\n\n  My response to that is, maybe we could. Maybe we can do that. And you \ncan put them in a U.S. court, but why in the world would you want to? \nYou could, but should you?\n  The administration likes to tout its confidence in the U.S. legal \nsystem. Well, I don't believe the American people need to try any enemy \ncombatants in our own hometowns and cities to prove that our court \nsystem works. We know it works. We are American citizens.\n  Prosecution is certainly important. But let's be clear, prosecution \nis not our ultimate goal in this war. Our goal is to capture or kill \nthose who want to kill us, here and abroad, and who are plotting even \nnow, as this case clearly proves, to wreak havoc on our troops \noverseas.\n  This is quite simple: Those whom we capture should be interrogated \nand, if necessary, indefinitely detained and tried in a military \nsetting. Through these interrogations additional intelligence can be \nderived that leads to additional targets, thereby weakening al Qaeda \nand other associated terror groups at a moment when they are \nvulnerable.\n  The good news is we already have the perfect solution for a case such \nas the one I have been discussing in Kentucky. These men don't belong \nin a courtroom in Kentucky. They belong in a secured detention facility \nat Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, far away from U.S. civilians. Sending them to \nGitmo is the only way to ensure they will not enjoy all the rights and \nprivileges of U.S. citizens. Sending them to Gitmo is the only way we \ncan be certain there won't be retaliatory attacks in Kentucky. How \nwould you like to be the judge in this case? How would you like to be \nthe jurors in this case? Do they run the risk of being targets for the \nrest of their lives? Are they in sort of witness protection programs \nindefinitely? Why should we subject U.S. citizens to this kind of risk?\n  Sending them to Gitmo is the only way we can prevent Kentuckians from \nhaving to cover the cost and having to deal with the disturbance and \ndisruptions that would come with a civilian trial, and sending them to \nGitmo is the best way to ensure they get what they deserve.\n  Today I am calling on the administration to change course. Get these \nmen out of Kentucky. Send them to Guantanamo where they belong. Get \nthese terrorists out of the civilian system, get them out of our \nbackyards, and give them the justice they deserve.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3743-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nEthanol Subsidy and Tariff Repeal Act, which Senator Coburn has offered \nand I have cosponsored, along with Senators Burr, Cardin, Collins, \nCorker, Lieberman, Risch, Shaheen, Toomey, and Webb.\n  I know the fact that this amendment is on the floor scheduled to be \nvoted on at 2:15 this afternoon has caused some deep consternation on \nmy side of the aisle. There is objection to the procedures used. I am \nnot going to get into that. I am going to say a vote is a vote, and we \nare facing a vote at 2:15 unless something changes.\n  To be candid, if there were an offer to bring this to the floor next \nweek or the week after for a time specific and a commitment specific, I \nbelieve the author and myself and our cosponsors would certainly agree \nto that. But in the absence of that offer, it is important that the \nSenate take a position on a program that has become both gross and \negregious, and I want to explain why I feel that way.\n  No other product I know of has the triple crown of government support \nthat corn ethanol enjoys in this country. Its use is mandated by law. \nOil companies are paid by the Federal Government to use it, so there is \na subsidy, and corn ethanol is protected by a rather high tariff. \nConsequently, it has been very profitable for farmers. This amounts to \nalmost $6 billion a year of taxpayers' money that goes to support the \ncorn ethanol industry in this country.\n  Put another way, that is $15 million each and every day spent on this \nsubsidy at a time when, candidly, we simply can't afford it.\n  They say there are very few privileges left out there. This is one \nthat is enormous, and I think we have to take a look at it. I think if \nthis amendment passes, nearly $3 billion is saved between July 1 and \nthe end of the year. That is not insignificant. It goes into the \ngeneral fund and it helps abate the deficit.\n  Since 2005, we have spent $22.6 billion on this subsidy, and it gets \nmore expensive every year. In 2011, the government will spend $5.7 \nbillion; in 2012, $5.9 billion; in 2013, $6.2 billion. And you can see, \nsince the program came into being in 2005--and I voted against it \nthen--it was at $1.5 billion; the next year, $2.6 billion; the next \nyear, $3.3 billion; the next year $4.4 billion, the next year, $5.2 \nbillion; and 2010, $5.7 billion of a trifecta of triple-crown subsidies \nto go to recompense people for using corn ethanol. It is wrong.\n  On top of this subsidy, we have imposed a 54-cent-per-gallon tariff \non ethanol products from Brazil, India, and Australia and others that \ncould import it more cheaply than it is grown here. This then \ncontributes to making the United States more dependent on oil imports \nfrom OPEC.\n  Our amendment is simple. Beginning July 1, we would repeal the 45-\ncent-per-gallon ethanol subsidy, which goes overwhelmingly to large oil \ncompanies, and it would eliminate the 54-cent-per-gallon tariff on \nimported ethanol.\n  I believe very strongly that we need to act to repeal these subsidies \nand these tariffs before another $2.7 billion in taxpayer money, which \nis $15 million a day, is wasted over the remaining 6 months of this \nyear.\n  Let me describe the real-world impact of these unwise subsidies and \ntariffs to our economy.\n  Last week, I was in the Central Valley at an event and I would say \nanywhere from six to eight farmers came up to me and said, ``Thank you \nfor trying to end the ethanol business. I can no longer afford feed.'' \nI began to think, and so we took a look at what the situation is. The \nfact is this ethanol policy is inflating the price of corn and \nimpacting other sectors of the economy.\n  Today, approximately 39 percent of our corn crop is now used to \nproduce ethanol in this country. Here is where it has gone: The percent \nof corn for 2000, 7 percent; 2005, 14 percent; and 2010, 39 percent of \nthe entire corn crop goes to produce ethanol. Corn futures reached a \nrecord $7.99 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade last week. Prices \nare up 140 percent in the past 12 months and continue to rise. In 2006, \nprices were $2 a bushel. Today they are $7.99 a bushel.\n\n  This has been a real spike in the price of feed. If it continues one \ncan expect major price increases in grain and food as well. The average \nprice of corn has risen 225 percent since 2006.\n  Here it is, here it goes on this chart. It goes down slightly and \nthen it has gone up.\n  In California, the annual feed costs for Foster Farms--this is the \nlargest poultry producer on the west coast--has tripled over the past \nyear, increasing Foster Farms' cost for feed by more than $2 million. \nThis is more than the largest profit the company has ever made.\n  I hear similar stories from small producers, from co-ops, from \ndairymen and cattlemen throughout California. The price of feed is \nrising to such an extent that experts are predicting a mass slaughter \nof hogs and dairy cows this summer. In other words, it is becoming \ncheaper to slaughter the animals rather than to feed them. That is \nwrong.\n  Paul Cameroon of Imperial County, CA, recently wrote to me:\n\n       As a cattle producer who has never asked for a subsidy of \n     any kind, I only ask that\n\n[[Page S3744]]\n\n     ethanol production stand on its own and allow true supply and \n     demand to dictate the real price of corn.\n\n  It seems to me he is spot on. It seems to me when we look at charts \nlike this on grain prices, on the huge subsidy that oil companies get, \non the protective tariff, we have to say enough is enough. The USDA \npredicts that continued demand from the livestock, ethanol, and food \nindustry will reduce corn reserves to the lowest level since the mid-\n1990s. These low grain reserves will have repercussions globally. We \nknow rising food prices exacerbate global poverty and could intensify \npolitical unrest in some parts of the world. But the bottom line is, \ndiverting 39 percent of our crop toward ethanol is artificially driving \nup corn prices, which in turn is straining people and industries that \ndepend on affordable corn.\n  In addition to impacting the price of corn, the $6 billion annual \nethanol subsidy is fiscally irresponsible. If the current subsidy were \nto exist through 2014, as the industry has proposed, the Treasury would \npay oil companies at least $31 billion to use 69 billion gallons of \ncorn ethanol that the Federal renewable fuels standard already requires \nthem to use under the Clean Air Act. The biggest recipient receiving \nmoney is BP. According to reports, it receives $55 million. We cannot \nafford and should not pay oil companies such as ExxonMobil and BP to \nfollow the law to the tune of $6 billion a year. As the GAO has found, \nthe mandate for the use ``is duplicative in stimulating domestic \nproduction and use of ethanol, and can''--and is--``resulting in \nsubstantial loss of revenue to the Treasury.''\n  Let me just say one thing about the tariff. The tariff on low-carbon \nsugarcane ethanol, which I proposed repealing in 2006, makes our Nation \nmore dependent on foreign oil. How? The combined tariffs on ethanol are \n60 cents per gallon, at least 15 cents per gallon higher than the \nethanol subsidies they supposedly offset. So this is essentially a \nmajor trade barrier.\n  We have a real problem with this triple crown: We mandate its use, we \npay people to use it, and then we set a large tariff barrier to prevent \nanybody from importing any ethanol, whether it is corn or sugar, that \nis cheaper. This is expensive, $15 million a day, $6 billion, as I \nsaid, a year.\n  I know many of my colleagues agree with the substance of this \nlegislation, and I appreciate very much that the amendment is being \nconsidered under somewhat unusual circumstances and procedures. I hope \nwe can have a fair vote. I hope Members will not disregard the import \nof what we are doing. We are essentially saving the government nearly \n$6 billion a year by simply repealing the subsidy, repealing the \nmandate, and repealing the tariff. I believe the time has come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today because I \nbelieve the United States is headed down a slippery path toward an \nescalation of military force in Libya. I also believe if the U.S. \nmilitary is to be involved in such an escalation, then the Congress \nmust exercise its constitutional authority and approve or disapprove \nthe President's proposal.\n  I supported President Obama's initial decision to engage in a limited \nmilitary operation to prevent an imminent humanitarian catastrophe. \nPresident Obama and the international community were clear that \ntargeting of civilians by Muammar Qadhafi would not be tolerated. It \nhas been over 60 days since the President notified the Congress that he \nintended to use military force in Libya. We are adrift. We are without \ndirection. We are in danger of fighting an expanded war, a war that was \noriginally justified as a limited military operation, a no-fly zone, to \nprevent civilian casualties and imminent catastrophe. This war has now \nbeen slowly expanded for one that is pushing for regime change.\n  We have been down this path before. Let's not go there. In Libya we \nare now receiving reports that helicopter gunships are being used to \ntarget ground forces--something that was never originally intended \nunder the premise of a no-fly zone. In fact, it seems that the no-fly \nzone has slowly evolved into what some have called a no-drive zone. \nCongress has not approved this action.\n  I do not believe the U.N. Security Council approved such an action in \nU.N. Security Council Resolution 1973.\n  We also hear it is now the policy to support regime change and that \nthere are some plans to arm rebel groups. Some outside groups and \nMembers of Congress are clamoring to escalate the war in Libya. They \nbelieve air power will never dislodge Muammar Qadhafi and his family. \nThe Congress has not approved the use of military force to achieve \nregime change. Flooding the region with small arms is also being \nproposed. This would be a major mistake and could lead to a host of \nunintended consequences.\n  We do not know enough about the rebels fighting Qadhafi, but we do \nknow there are plenty of mercenaries, as well as members of al-Qaida, \nwaiting to exploit any chaos. If arms are flooded into the region, \nthere is no guarantee they will be able to account for those arms. In \nmy opinion, there is a high likelihood those arms could end up in the \nhands of some very unsavory and dangerous individuals.\n  The bottom line is this: Congress has not had the opportunity to \nweigh in. Like my colleagues, I deplore Muammar Qadhafi. I support a \ndemocratic transition and his departure from power, but the military \ngoals should be defined and limited as a matter of policy. It should \nnot include regime change. This would be a dangerous escalation.\n  As many of you know, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was \nplanning a markup for last Thursday of S. Res. 194, titled ``Expressing \nthe Sense of the Senate on the United States Military Operations in \nLibya.'' I had strong concerns about the resolution we were scheduled \nto consider. A sense of the Senate is clearly not an authorization for \nuse of military force. A sense of the Senate does not meet the \nrequirements of the War Powers Act. And a sense of the Senate falls \nshort of meeting our constitutional obligation to declare war.\n  I drafted an amendment to S. Res. 194. I ask unanimous consent the \ntext of this amendment be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. My amendment stated:\n\n       The President is not authorized to deploy ground forces, \n     including special operations forces, in pursuance of any \n     goals related to United States policy in Libya, unless \n     expressly authorized by Congress or as determined necessary \n     by the President to protect a member of the United States \n     Armed Forces currently deployed in the region.\n\n  I believe any authorization of military force should contain similar \nlanguage. I understand Senator Webb and Senator Corker have introduced \na resolution with these prohibitions and exceptions to protect our \ntroops and I support these efforts to limit the mission in Libya. It is \nimportant that we do not escalate military actions in Libya. An \nescalation would be a dangerous course, and it would be costly to the \nregion and our country.\n  While the markup has been postponed, it is my understanding that \nSenator Kerry and others are working on language that would fulfill our \nconstitutional obligations and comply with the War Powers Act. I look \nforward to consideration of a resolution of this kind in the Foreign \nRelations Committee and strongly believe it should include language \nsimilar to the amendment I was going to offer.\n  I have been proud to serve in the Congress for more than a decade. We \nhave fought two lengthy wars during this period of time. I have seen \nthe impact on our military, on their families, on our national deficit. \nBefore the United States escalates its involvement in another overseas \nconflict, Congress must weigh in. It is our constitutional duty.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     Draft Amendment to S. Res. 194\n\n       That the President is not authorized to deploy ground \n     forces, including special operations forces, in pursuance of \n     any goals related to United States policy in Libya, unless \n     expressly authorized by Congress or as determined necessary \n     by the President to protect a member of the United States \n     Armed Forces currently deployed in the region.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S3745]]\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico, my \ncolleague on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, for his statement \non the floor this morning. It reflects my sentiments completely. I have \nbelieved since I was first elected to the House of Representatives and \nmy time in the Senate that we have an awesome responsibility under the \nConstitution to speak for the American people when the United States of \nAmerica makes a decision to engage in conduct that relates to our \nmilitary--particularly when it comes to a declaration of war.\n  It is clearly understood that if American citizens are under attack \nor American soil is under threat of attack, the President has the power \nto move, and move quickly, as Commander in Chief to protect us. In this \ninstance, the War Powers Act suggests that it is now, after 60 days, at \nthat point the responsibility of Congress to step forward, to speak for \nthe American people, and to make a decision as to whether we go forward \nwith a military commitment.\n  What the Senator from New Mexico has suggested I believe goes right \nto the heart of our constitutional responsibility. It is a \nresponsibility which we swore to uphold. It is also a responsibility \nwhich politically we try to avoid. It is a hard debate and a hard \ndecision.\n  I am sure the Senator from New Mexico believes, as I do, that some of \nthe toughest votes we have ever had to face as Members of Congress \nrelate to this decision because if the decision is made to go to war, \nwe know the lives of Americans are at risk.\n  That is why I believe what the Senator from New Mexico said on the \nSenate floor this morning is so critically important. I am going to \nwork with him and with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee to move forward on a resolution which is consistent with the \nWar Powers Act which expressly states the feelings of the American \npeople through their Representatives in Congress about this decision \nand our constitutional responsibility.\n  I sincerely hope we can resolve this before we end this work period, \nwhich will be about July 1. If we can bring an issue forward on the \nfloor for that purpose, I believe it is in the best interests of our \nsenatorial responsibility.\n  I might say, because I have discussed this with the Senator from New \nMexico, we know one of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwants to expressly authorize the use of ground forces in Libya. Let me \nmake it clear, the President has not asked for that. He is not engaged \nwith ground forces, land forces in Libya. At this time I would not only \nreject it, I would fight it. I think it is a bad decision. I think to \nengage the United States in a third theater of war with ground forces \nis way too much at this moment in our history.\n  So I thank the Senator from New Mexico for not letting this issue \ndisappear amidst the hubbub of all the agendas we face on the floor of \nthe Senate but coming to the floor and reminding us of our \nconstitutional responsibility.\n  I will close by thanking Senator Cardin of Maryland as well, who has \nbeen a lead sponsor in our efforts. I will be working with him and the \nSenator from New Mexico and other like-minded Senators.\n  I thank the Senator for coming to the floor.\n  I know that wasn't in the nature of a question, but I ask the \nSenator, does he agree?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the Senator for his statement. I \nbelieve with all of us working together--our chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Cardin, and others, as well as the \nPresiding Officer, who is also on the Foreign Relations Committee with \nus--we can come to a resolution which complies with what the President \nhas stated.\n  The President says he has no intention of sending ground forces into \nLibya. But it is important at this point in time, as the Senator from \nIllinois pointed out and as the Constitution mandates, that we step in \nand express the will of the American people on this issue. That is the \nwhole purpose of what I am on the floor for today, and I look forward \nto working very closely with the Senator from Illinois.\n  With that, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I know the Democratic side has not used \nits full allotment of time, but because another speaker is not here, I \nwill go ahead, and hopefully we will be able to yield time if someone \nelse does come forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3745-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3745-S3746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I have been on the Senate floor several \ntimes now during the last few weeks to discuss our grave economic \ncondition, the need to reduce Washington's out-of-control spending, \nand, most importantly, the urgent need to start taking action before \ntime runs out.\n  If there is any remaining doubt in anyone's mind that the U.S. \neconomy is facing a historic and unprecedented fiscal crisis, consider \na few of the recent news reports since I last spoke on the floor, which \nwas not that many days ago. Reports came out saying that the national \nunemployment rate increased to 9.1 percent, with over 22 million \nAmericans unemployed or underemployed. This is not how we rebound from \na recession, historically. There is something more going on here than \nthe normal downturns and upturns of the economic cycle. This is \nsomething of historic proportion.\n  Since I last spoke on this floor, two more rating agencies--Moody's \nand Fitch--have issued serious warnings that they may downgrade \nAmerica's AAA debt rating. This comes after S already lowered its \noutlook of the U.S. economy to negative.\n  Just last week, on its cover, USA TODAY published the frightening \nheadline ``U.S. owes $62 trillion; unfunded obligations amount to \n$534,000 per household.'' Those are unfunded obligations. We have \nfunded obligations we currently owe in addition to that, and some put \nthose even higher.\n  There was an interview yesterday with Bill Gross, who heads up PIMCO, \nthe largest bondholder in the country--in the world, actually. Bill \nGross indicated in this interview that the money owed to cover future \nliabilities in entitlement programs in the United States is actually in \nworse financial shape than Greece and other debt-laden European \ncountries. Much of the attention, of course, is focused on our public \ndebt, which is running at $14.3 trillion, but what hasn't been focused \non as much are the unfunded liabilities that will come due, the \nobligations and promises already made that will have to be paid for, \nthat will be in addition to the $14.3 trillion already on the books. \nTaken together, Gross said this is going to equal nearly $100 trillion. \nIt is a number beyond anyone's comprehension, it is hard to fathom what \n$100 trillion means to the American taxpayer, to America's abilities, \nobligations and financial responsibilities. Now, maybe $100 trillion is \na little high. It doesn't matter whether it is $80 trillion or $90 \ntrillion or $100 trillion; it is certainly going to put our country in \na very, very difficult position.\n  I wish to read one more piece from the CNBC interview with Bill \nGross:\n\n       We've always wondered who will buy Treasurys after the \n     Federal Reserve purchases the last of its $600 billion to end \n     the second leg of its quantitative easing program later this \n     month. It's certainly not Pimco and it's probably not the \n     bond funds of the world.\n\n  I quoted Erskine Bowles, who is a Democrat, was Chief of Staff for \nPresident Clinton and was one of the coauthors of the fiscal commission \nreport presented at the request of the President laying out the dire \ncrisis we face and recommendations on how to address it. Erskine \nBowles, co-chair of the President's fiscal reform commission, said that \nthe growing national debt and Federal deficits are ``a cancer and they \nare truly going to destroy this country from within, unless we have the \ncommon sense to do something about it.''\n  This is the challenge before us--each Member of the House of \nRepresentatives and each Member of the Senate\n\n[[Page S3746]]\n\nand the President of the United States. This dwarfs all other matters \nbefore this Congress. With all due respect, the Senate spending several \nweeks on the Small Business Innovation Research Act, the Federal \nAviation Administration's bill, and now the Economic Development \nRevitalization Act has left little time for the debate that ought to be \nundertaken on this floor in continuous fashion to address this fiscal \nsituation. The crisis has implications for the future of our country, \nthe future of this Nation.\n  The rapid escalation of the deficit and debt requires our full \nengagement--not later but now. The growing consensus among those who \nhave given serious analysis to our fiscal plight calls for an all-of-\nthe-above approach in addressing the problem, including--dare I say \nit--entitlement spending, which essentially is Social Security, \nMedicaid, and Medicare.\n  If Congress and the White House are serious about preventing the \ndestruction of our economy, it is time we get serious about talking \nabout entitlements, including Medicare, because the hard truth is that \nif Medicare is not included in the debate, any effort to put together \nany kind of a credible plan necessary to bring about fiscal stability \nwill be defeated.\n  Medicare has proven to be the greatest fiscal challenge facing this \ncountry. It alone last year took in $1.8 trillion of new liabilities, \nwhich is more than we spend on all nondefense discretionary spending. \nNondefense discretionary spending is that spending which goes to every \nother function of the Federal Government other than interest on our \nnational debt and mandatory spending.\n  The Medicare trustees recently sounded alarm bells in a report \nannouncing that the program's total of unfunded future obligations is a \nstaggering $38.4 trillion. They cautioned that the hospital trust fund, \nknown as Medicare Part A, will be exhausted by 2024. This is 5 years \nearlier than what they had predicted just a year earlier. So 1 year has \npassed, and the trustees are now so alarmed they are saying we are \ngoing to run out of money 5 years earlier than we thought. What are \nthey going to say next year? They will probably shorten that time even \nmore.\n  Economists and policy experts on both sides of the aisle--Republican, \nDemocratic, conservative, liberal--have been warning about the dangers \nof Medicare spending and the impact on our national debt for years. Yet \nCongress has punted its responsibilities, saying ``we will take care of \nit after the next election.''\n  Back in 2006, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan warned \nlawmakers, saying that Medicare spending is unsustainable and could one \nday drive debt and government interest rates substantially higher. I \nsuggest that date is here, and this crisis is knocking on our door.\n  Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato \nInstitute, said: Nothing presents as great a threat to the Federal \nbudget--and therefore to economic growth--as the persistent and rapid \ngrowth of Medicare spending.\n\n  At a White House summit last year, President Obama recognized the \nunsustainability of entitlement spending. This is a quote from our \nPresident:\n\n       Almost all of the long-term deficit and debt that we face \n     relates to the exploding costs of Medicare and Medicaid. \n     Almost all of it. That is the single biggest driver of our \n     federal debt. And if we don't get control over that, we can't \n     get control over our federal budget.\n\n  I am quoting the words of the President of the United States, who now \nhas taken the position that we shouldn't address the Medicare problem. \nYet, as President, he has said that almost all of the deficit and debt \nwe face relates to the exploding costs of these two programs, Medicare \nand Medicaid. He repeats it by saying ``almost all of it'' and ``the \nsingle biggest driver of our Federal debt.''\n  Alice Rivlin, who served as budget director under President Bill \nClinton, said it best: ``There's no mystery about what we ought to do, \nwe just need to get on with it.''\n  Madam President, we just need to get on with it. But that hasn't \nhappened. Despite the President's own recognition of the single biggest \ndriver of our Federal debt and despite the warning sirens from \neconomists and even the Medicare trustees, the President has yet to \nsubmit a single proposal to address this urgent problem.\n  Others in positions of leadership have also decided to ignore these \ncritical warnings about Medicare and its looming insolvency and threat \nto our fiscal house. They have rejected any proposals for changing \nMedicare as we know it. Well, the category for these people are the \n``do-nothings.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Let me skip forward here.\n  Despite the President's own recognition of this problem, we have not \ntaken this plan forward. There are do-nothings who think that if we do \nnot act, Medicare will be secure. Actually, the do-nothings are the \nones who are making Medicare's future unstable. It is those who have \ntaken the responsibility to stand up and recognize this problem and be \nfree and open in debate and honest with the American people who are the \nones who have had the courage to go forward. Yet they get reviled for \n``throwing grandma under the bus'' or taking Medicare away.\n  I was approached by a person in a factory in Indiana who came up to \nme and said: You are taking away my 88-year-old mother's health care. \nHe was upset, and rightfully so, but I told him he is upset at the \nwrong person because we are trying to save that health care. We are \ntrying to save Medicare.\n  We have two options: We can either continue with the status quo and \nlet Medicare go bankrupt or we can step up to the plate, debate \nthoughtful proposals, and work to keep our promise to America's seniors \nby enacting meaningful reform. It is those of us who are willing to \nstep up to the plate who are here to save Medicare, not destroy \nMedicare. It is those who are saying we need to do nothing or who \nrefuse to do anything who are going to cause Medicare to go bankrupt \nand take benefits away from seniors.\n  This is the debate we need to have. We are burdened by this. We need \nto address it. It is the challenge of the day. Let's go forward, stand \nup, and do the right thing.\n  I appreciate the extension of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about the \namendment offered by my colleague, the Senator from Oklahoma, to the \nEconomic Development Revitalization Act which would repeal the \nvolumetric ethanol excise tax credit. His amendment is No. 436.\n  For months, there has been very heated public debate surrounding the \nblender tax credit for ethanol and the tariff on imported ethanol. Some \nof my colleagues advocate repealing ethanol tax incentives immediately, \nwhile others are adamantly opposed to changing course on tax policy \nthat was enacted at the end of the last Congress and would extend these \ntax credits through the end of this year. Regardless, it is clear that \nCongress must make a decision on whether to reform the ethanol blenders \ntax credit and import tariff this year.\n  In my home State of Georgia, I see both the positive and the negative \neffects this tax policy has had. While it has spurred the growth of the \nethanol industry, some say it has caused drastic increases in the price \nof corn-based feedstock.\n  A new study prepared for the upcoming G20 meeting shows that biofuel \nsubsidies are directly related to food price volatility. I believe that \nbecause the credit is set to expire in December of this year and many \nethanol producers have the credit embedded in their business plans, \nCongress should not immediately repeal the tax credit. When it expires \nat the end of this year--even though I have supported this tax credit \nfor all the years I have\n\n[[Page S3747]]\n\nserved in both the House and the Senate--I think the time has come for \nit to end. If we tell the blenders today that at the end of this year \nthis tax credit is going to expire, it needs to expire then. So I do \nnot intend to support an extension of that tax credit beginning upon \nthe expiration at the end of this year.\n  Regardless of where one stands on the underlying issue itself, I \nbelieve the amendment deserves to have a vote on its merits and not be \nblocked by procedural tactics. Because so much attention has been paid \nto the issue and because we have had such extensive debates, this \namendment deserves an up-or-down vote, rather than being stopped by a \nfilibuster. For this reason, I intend to vote in favor of the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma, and I \nencourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, may I make an inquiry of the Chair?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. How much time remains for the Republicans in morning \nbusiness?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 15 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  These are interesting days in our country. We find ourselves in a \nvery deep hole, and it is not the fault of the people; it is the fault \nof the Congress. We continue to spend money we do not have on things we \ndo not need. When we do that personally, we end up filing bankruptcy. \nPretty soon, we run out of new credit cards to take on, and we get to \nthe point where we can't pay our debts. That is a question that is in \nfront of our country today as our economy is struggling and we have \nthis massive debt. We ought to be about every small, medium, and large \nstep we can take to solve the problem, not to solve the problem by \nsaying we can't pay our bills but to solve the problem so we create a \nprosperous future for our kids and those who follow us.\n  There is a lot of controversy over the amendment I offered, and it is \ninaccurately claimed by the majority leader that this amendment was \nrule XIV'd. It was not rule XIV'd. According to the procedures of the \nSenate, you can file cloture on any amendment at any time. That is a \nprivilege every Senator has. Why would somebody file cloture on an \namendment? It is because, over the first 5\\1/2\\ months of this year, \nthrough the leadership of the Senate, we have been unable to have a \nfree and open debate and free and open offering of amendments. Because \nthe procedure is rarely used does not mean it is not ethical and not \naccurate. As a matter of fact, the reason the procedure was put there \nwas in case at a point in time your rights as a Senator to offer \namendments are being limited by the majority. That is why we have this \nrule. Because you can take 16 of your colleagues and file a cloture \npetition and, therefore, have a vote on your amendment.\n  So what we are hearing going on in the background today is, the \nreason you shouldn't vote for this amendment, even though you agree we \nshould get rid of and save $3 billion, much as the Senator from \nCalifornia outlined, $3 billion that the very people who are blending \nand receiving the $3 billion don't want, the argument is, it is because \nthey don't like the way the amendment came to the floor. Explain to the \npeople at home, you have an opportunity to save this country $3 billion \nand you know it is the right policy, but you are not going to vote for \nit because you don't like the way the amendment came to the floor. I \nwould remind my colleagues that of the $3 billion we are going to save, \n1.2 billion of it we are going to borrow from China, if we go on and \nspend it, and we are going to charge that 1.2 billion to our kids and \ngrandkids. The interesting point is, we have grown, over 20-some years, \nto rely on ethanol for 7 percent of our fuel, and it has been a very \nexpensive process. It is expensive directly because when you go to buy \ngasoline today, it is not the price you pay at the pump that you are \nactually paying. Take all the subsidies and all the tax credits and all \nthe low-interest loans and all the nonrepayment of all the grants and \nall the moneys that have been put into this program, and when you buy \nthat tank of gas, every gallon that you put into your car after you pay \nfor it, you already paid $1.72 through your taxes to have that gallon \nthere.\n  So we are not getting rid of the mandate on ethanol. It is 7\\1/2\\ \npercent. It has helped us in some ways. It is a very inefficient fuel \nthat causes us to consume more fuel, produce more CO2. But \nthe fact is, we have an amendment in the Chamber that is designed to \ntake away a subsidy, and the only reason we are taking away the subsidy \nis because in law we are saying you have to do it anyway.\n  I would introduce, for the record, a letter from the refiners that \nstates--this is the National Petroleum Refiners Association, \nrepresenting 97 percent of the people who get this tax credit--97 \npercent of the $3 billion. They say they don't want the $3 billion. The \nvote is going to come down to something very clear. We are going to \ngive $3 billion to some of the most profitable companies in America or \nwe are not. The interesting fact is, they are saying: Please don't give \nit to us. Please don't give us this money.\n  Think of the time when we are borrowing the money to give to them and \nthey are saying don't give it to us. We are going to have a vote in the \nChamber and very likely not win because of a procedure or because of \nparochial interests. The fact is, every gallon of ethanol that is \nblended to gasoline, whoever does the blending, gets 45 cents a gallon, \nand they don't need it because they are going to blend it anyway. So \nthe real question is, Will we continue to be ignorant in Washington of \nthe common sense the American people want us to have? The common sense \nis, if you are paying somebody to do something and by law they have to \ndo it anyway and then they write you a letter and say: Please don't pay \nme anymore to do this, I am going to do it anyway, why would we \ncontinue to send them the money? Why would we continue to do that, \nespecially when 40 percent of it we have to borrow from the Chinese to \nbe able to pay it to the American oil company? It makes no sense. There \nis no logic you can come up with. The calculations out of Iowa State \nUniversity on this $3 billion is that the amount of jobs that have come \nout of this in the past cost $14 million a year per job--14 million a \nyear per job created out of this subsidy.\n  No wonder we are broke. No wonder we are failing financially. No \nwonder we are failing our children and our grandchildren, because we \ncontinue to do things that don't have any correlation with logic or \ncommon sense. I know the arguments. I know the argument is that, well, \nwe passed this last year as part of the extension. Well, as a \nRepublican, I was one of the few Republicans who did not vote for that \nextension. Because not only did we pass additional tax cuts and \nadditional unpaid programs, we cut no spending to be able to pay for \nit. So what we did was borrow a whole bunch more money and not solve \nany of the critical issues that lie in front of our country.\n  Forty percent of last year's corn crop went to ethanol. As a matter \nof fact, there is so much ethanol production, last year we shipped 400 \nmillion gallons overseas. That is great, except when you take the time \nto think about that with that 400 million gallons, we sent $500 million \nworth of subsidy. So now we are subsidizing the ethanol that goes to \nEurope with your tax dollars so they can have cheaper gasoline than we \nhave, because they are taking $1.72 per gallon and getting the benefit \nof our tax dollars to have cheaper ethanol in Europe than they can get \nfrom other places.\n\n  So there is nothing about this that makes sense, other than if you \nare a wonk and study the politics and the procedures and the \nparochialism that goes on inside the political body. That is what has \ngotten us into trouble. We are more interested in power and position \nand party. I am sick of both parties. We better start focusing on the \nreal problems in front of our country. We are going to have a $1.7 \ntrillion deficit this year, and the way you get rid of that is 1 \nbillion or 2 billion or 3 billion at a time.\n  Here is something that makes absolutely no sense. Here is something \nthat has no true demand for it. Here is something that is $3 billion \nthat the people we are paying it to say they don't want, and we are not \ngoing to take them up on it? What part of stupid are we? This is like a \nFerrell movie. It doesn't make sense. It is comedic.\n\n[[Page S3748]]\n\nWe have had a lot of debate. Let me just talk for a minute about what \nis going on in the agricultural community throughout this country if \nyou are a poultry, milk or livestock producer.\n  You can't bring your cattle to feedlots right now because corn is too \nexpensive--$7.65 a bushel yesterday. You can't afford to fatten your \ncattle, so they are not bringing them in from the range. We are \nslaughtering dairy cows all across this country because 70 percent of \nthe cost of dairy cattle is the corn you feed them. We are going to get \nall sorts of untoward interruptions and price increases in our food if \nwe continue this policy. Seventy percent of the cost for chickens is \nfeed. We are having chicken processors close and go into bankruptcy. We \nare having chicken raisers, the actual chicken farms--a lot in \nOklahoma, a lot in Arkansas, a lot throughout the South, even over in \nDelaware and in Virginia--can't afford to feed the chickens. So what is \ngoing to happen because we have this false subsidy? The fact is, right \nnow, 15 percent of the food increases in this country that you have \nseen in the last year are directly associated with this policy--\ndirectly associated with this policy. That doesn't have any effect on \nthe fact that what could we do by sending $7 corn out of this country \nto our balance of payments, which would help our trade imbalance? \nInstead, we are burning it, and it is a highly inefficient fuel. It is \na highly inefficient fuel. Everybody knows that when they fill up with \n15 percent or 10 percent ethanol, they get much poorer gas mileage. \nEverybody knows that. In Oklahoma, we have all these stations where it \nsays ``ethanol free.'' Why do people pay 10 or 15 cents more a gallon? \nBecause they win on mileage. They actually get better performance when \nthey don't have ethanol in their fuel. We all know that. It is just in \nsome States you don't have that option. We are fortunate. We can still \nbuy real gas.\n  I understand we have about 3 minutes remaining. I will close with the \nfollowing statement. This is going to be a historic vote, not about \nethanol, not about subsidies. It is going to be a historic vote that \nsends a signal to the American people. Either the people in Washington \nget it and are going to stop wasting money on programs they don't need \nto waste money on and they are going to start acting in the best long-\nterm interests of the country, they are either going to do that or they \nare not. So when we see the results of this vote, you are going to have \na hard time explaining: I voted against that because I didn't like the \nway the amendment came up. The fact is, here is $3 billion we don't \nhave to spend over the next 6 months. If we don't spend it, that is $3 \nbillion we are not going to have to borrow from our children and that \nthey are not going to be paying interest on for the next 30 years.\n  This comes down to the point in time, does this Senate recognize the \namount of trouble we are in, and are Senators willing to give up \nparochial interests, procedural interests, are they willing to do what \nis necessary to put this country back on course? My hope and prayer is \nthey are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3748-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3748-S3749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise this morning to talk about \nAmerica's energy future. The reality is we need a diversified energy \nfuture. What I mean by that is we need to develop all of our energy \nresources. In my home State of North Dakota, we are doing just that. We \nhave coal, and we are developing clean coal technologies. We have oil \nand gas. We have hydro. We have biofuels--ethanol and biodiesel. We \nhave solar. We have wind. We have biomass. We are working aggressively \nto develop all of them, both traditional sources of energy and our \nrenewable sources of energy.\n  Ten years ago, in 2000 when I started as Governor of North Dakota, we \nset a course to develop a comprehensive energy plan to develop all of \nour energy resources, both traditional and renewable, and to do it in \ntandem, by encouraging private investment that would spur the \ndevelopment of new technologies--new technologies to develop \ntraditional sources of energy and renewable sources of energy, and \ncreate new and exciting synergistic partnerships that would both \ndiversify our energy mix, help us produce more energy most cost \neffectively, create good-quality jobs and improve environmental \nstewardship.\n  That is exactly what is happening. That is exactly what is happening \nin our State. That is exactly what we need to do as a nation. Let me \ngive you some examples from our State. Oil and gas. Oil and gas \ndevelopment has taken off in North Dakota. We are now the fourth \nlargest oil-producing State in the Union. We recently passed States \nsuch as Oklahoma and Louisiana, producing more oil, and we are \nproducing it from new formations such as the Bakken Shale and the Three \nForks, and we are doing it with new technologies: directional and \nhorizontal drilling. We figured out how to use those technologies such \nas directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing in new ways that \nproduce more energy but do it with good environmental stewardship. For \nexample, in the case of hydraulic fracturing, we recycle the water. We \ngo down 2 miles underground, we drill directionally underground for \nmiles. So it is a small footprint. One well now produces what maybe 10 \nor 12 wells used to produce. The water we use to force the oil to the \nsurface we send back down; we recycle it--we use it again--and \nultimately we put it back down the hole where we drew it from in the \nfirst place when it came up with much of the oil that is produced.\n  In the case of coal, we take lignite coal and we produce synthetic \nnatural gas. We put it in pipelines and we send it to other parts of \nthe country, just like the gas you pull out of the ground. At the same \ntime, in one of our plants, we are capturing CO2, the carbon \ndioxide. We are capturing it, we are compressing it, we are putting it \nin pipelines, and we are sending it off to the oilfields for second or \ntertiary oil recovery.\n  Those are some of the new developments we are undertaking in \ntraditional sources of energy. But as we do that with things such as \noil and gas and coal, we are also developing the renewables. For \nexample, wind. Our State is now the ninth largest wind energy State of \nall 50. We are continuing to move up the ranks, and that includes \ninvesting billions of dollars to make it happen. Again, that is more \nenergy for our country, from more diversified sources, creating good \njobs in the process.\n  Think how important that is. Think how important it is to create good \njobs at a time when we have more than 9 percent unemployment, 15-plus \nmillion people out of work, an economy that we need to get going and \ngrowing. Energy development represents an incredible opportunity to \nmake that happen. But when we talk about energy development, we need \nall of the different sources of energy. Each has strengths and each has \nweaknesses. That is why we need the mix.\n  In our State we also produce biofuels: ethanol and biodiesel. Clearly \nthe discussion today is how do we best create that environment to \ncontinue the development, the production, and the growth of ethanol in \na way that is cost effective, that serves the taxpayers of the country, \nbut continues to develop that vital industry for our country at a time \nwhen we need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, when we need more \ndomestically produced energy, when we need quality jobs, when we need a \ngrowing economy.\n  We can do it. We can do it with the right kind of energy policy--with \nthe right kind of energy policy--and that is what we are talking about \ntoday. Think about ethanol. It helps reduce our dependence on foreign \noil. For every gallon of ethanol we use as part of the fuel mix, that \nis 1 less gallon of gasoline we are bringing in from the Middle East, \nand by increasing supply we help reduce the cost of gasoline at the \npump for our consumers.\n  In addition to that, we are creating good-paying American jobs. In \n2010, the ethanol industry employed 400,000 workers in good jobs \nthroughout the United States--400,000 jobs. It provided an important \nmarket for American farmers throughout our country. It displaced the \nneed for 445 million barrels of foreign oil. Let me repeat that. It \ndisplaced the need for 445 million barrels of foreign oil. It reduced \nthe price of gasoline at the pump by 80 cents a gallon for the American \nconsumer.\n\n[[Page S3749]]\n\n  In addition to all of that, the ethanol industry paid $11 billion in \nFederal taxes in 2010. I want to emphasize that point. In 2010, the \nethanol industry paid $11 billion in Federal tax. So it is an important \nindustry to our country and we need it to continue.\n  The point of the discussion today, though, is how best to do that. So \nfor this discussion today, how do we create the right environment to \nstimulate private investment so we have that growing economy, we have \nmore jobs, we have more energy, but we also generate more tax revenues \nwith less government spending so we both grow our way out of this debt \nand deficit, we get this economy going, we create a better energy \nfuture for these young people and young people all over our great \ncountry.\n  That is why I have sponsored legislation, along with Senator Thune \nand Senator Klobuchar, that will reform the ethanol tax credit. It will \nprovide deficit reduction and set us on the right path for alternative \nfuel development in our country for the long run. The legislation is \ncalled the Ethanol Tax Reform and Deficit Reduction Plan.\n  It is the right way to transition from the current VEETC, the \nvolumetric ethanol excise tax credit, rather than the amendment today \nto simply do away with VEETC. This is the right transition for us to \nmake from the VEETC to creating the right environment to stimulate \ninvestment and energy growth in biofuels for the future. The ethanol \ntax reform and deficit reduction plan provides $1 billion in deficit \nreduction right away--provides $1 billion in deficit reduction. But it \nalso provides the right transition for ethanol by providing the right \nkind of energy policy. Specifically, we provide incentives for things \nsuch as blender pumps that offer consumers choice. We provide the right \nkind of incentives for research, development, and deployment of second-\ngeneration ethanol, specifically cellulosic ethanol, so that instead of \nmaking ethanol from food products, we make it from stover and wheat \nstraw and other sources.\n  By combining blender pumps, flex fuel vehicles, and commonsense \nregulation on the part of the EPA that encourages higher fuel blends, \nwe create the business environment that will foster growth in the \nethanol industry.\n  What does that mean? That means, No. 1, we avoid the ongoing cost of \nsubsidies such as the VEETC. Second, we set the ethanol industry up for \nlong-term growth. Third, we gain jobs. We gain jobs at a time when we \nbadly need them. We produce more energy, which reduces our dependence \non foreign oil, and we gain tax revenues. We gain tax revenues to help \nreduce our deficit.\n  So we not only spend less directly, helping to reduce the deficit, we \ngrow our economy, and that growing economy builds on the $11 billion \nthat the industry is already paying in Federal taxes, and we grow that \nbase while we are growing our jobs. That is the right way to move \nforward, to move out of our deficit situation in this economy, to get \nour economy going and also to produce more energy.\n  This is a market-based approach that will give customers more choice \nand also reduce their fuel costs. For example, you go into the station, \nthere is a blender pump there. You have a flex fuel vehicle. You can \ndial up whatever blend you choose, anywhere from 0 percent biofuels all \nthe way up to 85 percent, whatever works best for you, whatever works \nbest for your pocketbook, whatever works best for your vehicle.\n  We have blender pumps in my State. We have an incentive for blender \npumps in my State. As a result, we have more blender pumps than any \nother State in the country. The reality is today, if you buy fuel in \nNorth Dakota, almost all of the fuel you buy will have ethanol in it \nand you do not even realize it. Why? Because at a 90-10 percent blend, \nevery vehicle can use it, and it is the lowest price gasoline at the \npump, so dealers want to sell it. Consumers buy it. They simply buy it \nbecause they pick the lowest priced fuel at the pump. It is a 90-10 \nblend.\n  That is where we are going with this, a market-based approach. That \nis how it can work for the benefit of our economy, for the benefit of \nour energy future, for the benefit of reducing spending, and for the \nbenefit of growing our tax revenues. That is the choice we have today. \nThat is the right way to approach job creation and energy development \nin our country. We are reducing spending. We are improving and creating \nan environment for private sector investment that will help us build a \nprobusiness climate for energy and economic growth in our country.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to make that progrowth choice.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3749-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Claire C. \nCecchi, of New Jersey, to be United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of New Jersey, and Esther Salas, of New Jersey, to be United \nStates District Judge for the District of New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nfor debate equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today is a distinct honor for me to \nhave the opportunity to fulfill the constitutional commitment that each \nof us has to assure the public at large that justice is being \nadministered as it should be. We fulfill this commitment by making sure \nvacancies on the Federal bench are filled with individuals who have the \nproper experience and will provide the kind of fairness and balance in \ndecisionmaking that confirms America's basic tenets.\n  Mr. President, during a 2-year hiatus that I took from the Senate, I \nwas honored with the naming of a Federal courthouse in Newark after me, \nand I was so pleased to have that association with the justice \nadministered in our society. Before the building was dedicated, I asked \nthat an inscription that I authored be placed on the wall. It reads \nexactly as I labored to write it. It says:\n\n       The true measure of a democracy is the dispensation of \n     justice.\n\n  As a matter of fact, when I shared that moment with my dear departed \ncolleague, Senator Ted Kennedy, who questioned whether I wrote it \nbecause he knew I wasn't a lawyer, we joked about it, and I confirmed \nit. That is the way I saw things.\n  The sentiment behind that quote underscores how seriously I take my \nrole in recommending New Jersey District Court nominees to President \nObama. That is why I am so proud to come to the floor today and urge my \ncolleagues to confirm President Obama's nomination of Judge Claire \nCecchi and Judge Esther Salas to the U.S. District Court for New \nJersey. Both are well qualified for the court, having devoted their \ncareers to upholding the rule of law.\n  Throughout her career, Judge Cecchi has demonstrated her ability to \nnavigate complicated legal matters and manage complex cases. During the \nconfirmation process, she showed her temperament and diligence, she let \nus know something of her candor, and displayed the kind of character \nthat she brings to the bench.\n  For the past 5 years, Judge Cecchi has served as a U.S. magistrate \njudge in the District of New Jersey, where she has presided over \nhundreds of civil and criminal cases.\n  Before joining the bench, Judge Cecchi spent 14 years in private \npractice, focusing on complex civil litigation. One of her passions is \nto encourage young people to pursue a career in the law. She has hosted \nBring Your Child to Work Day programs in the district court, as well as \na mock trial for\n\n[[Page S3750]]\n\na local sixth grade class, to let young people have some understanding \nof what goes into making sure justice is fairly served in the Federal \ncourts.\n  Judge Cecchi's community spirit is pronounced in her activities. She \nhas volunteered for the Junior League, Orphans with AIDS, the Human \nNeeds Food Pantry, and the Salvation Army, to name just a few.\n  She graduated from Fordham University Law School, and cum laude from \nBarnard College at Columbia University. Before being appointed to the \nbench, she was a partner at two New Jersey law firms, and she was an \nassistant corporation counsel for the City of New York.\n  Like Judge Cecchi, Judge Salas has earned the respect and admiration \nof New Jersey's legal community--first as an accomplished litigator \nand, for the past 5 years, as a U.S. magistrate judge. She was the \nfirst Latina in New Jersey to serve as a magistrate judge.\n  In a newspaper profile a few years ago, Judge Salas recalled how, \nwhen she was 10 years old, her family lost everything in a fire in the \napartment building where they lived. The judge's mother said to her:\n\n       Things are going to be fine. We've gotten this far, and we \n     are going to make it.\n\n  What determination that showed. I like to tell this story because I \nbelieve it demonstrates how Judge Salas's experiences have shaped her \nlife and her career. She has known hardship, but she has also known \ngreat success as a member of New Jersey's legal community.\n  Before Judge Salas became a magistrate judge, she served 9 years as \nan assistant Federal public defender in Newark, representing indigent \nclients in a variety of cases. In addition, Judge Salas has worked in \nprivate practice, handling appellate work for a New Jersey law firm. \nShe is a graduate of the Rutgers University School of Law, and she \nclerked for New Jersey Superior Court Judge Eugene Codey.\n  Additionally, Judge Salas has served as the president of the Hispanic \nBar Association of New Jersey, an organization to which she has devoted \ncountless volunteer hours throughout her career.\n  As I shared with the Judiciary Committee when I introduced Judge \nCecchi and Judge Salas in March, I am not a lawyer, but I have a deep \nand abiding respect for the law. I was pleased to recommend Judge \nClaire Cecchi and Judge Esther Salas because both are unquestionably \nqualified to serve on the district court, and they will bring honor to \nthe people of New Jersey and our country.\n  I am confident that my colleagues in the Senate will agree and vote \noverwhelmingly to confirm their nominations.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be equally divided, and I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote for \nthe confirmation of two of New Jersey's most outstanding judicial \nprofessionals to fill two vacancies for United States District Court \njudges for the District of New Jersey. I understand that vote will be \ntaking place around noon. Both of these very qualified women are now \nU.S. magistrate judges.\n  Judge Claire Cecchi and Judge Esther Salas are among the most \nrespected leaders in New Jersey's judicial community. Both have \ndemonstrated skill and professionalism on the bench and an impressive \nability to manage the heavy and complex dockets before them.\n  Judge Cecchi has a broad range of litigation experience, having \nworked in the private sector for over 14 years. After serving in the \nOffice of Corporation Counsel for the City of New York, she practiced \nwith Robinson, St. John & Wayne, and later with Robinson, Lapidus, and \nLivelli, both large and well-respected New Jersey firms.\n  She has been no stranger to complex litigation for both defendants \nand plaintiffs. In the course of her distinguished career, she has \nfocused on a range of challenging issues--from security litigation and \ncomplex tort matters to employment law, criminal cases, construction \ncases, and contracts. In handling a case involving a suit by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission--a prominent case against two \ncompanies in Federal Court in the Southern District of New York--Judge \nCecchi demonstrated outstanding legal skills. She was singled out by \nmany in the legal profession in New Jersey for her depth and range of \nknowledge on the subject and for her conduct of the case.\n  Judge Cecchi later went to the firm of Carpenter, Bennet & Morrisey, \nthe second oldest law firm in New Jersey, where she worked for almost a \ndecade developing a range of experience in environmental and toxic tort \ncases, class actions, patent cases, and employment law.\n  She is a graduate of Fordham University and Barnard College at \nColumbia University, and began her career clerking for the Honorable \nKevin Thomas Duffy of the Southern District of New York.\n  As a U.S. magistrate judge, she has shown a unique set of judicial \nskills that makes her an exceptional choice for the position of United \nStates District Court Judge for the District of New Jersey, and I urge \nmy colleagues to vote to confirm her nomination.\n  Magistrate Judge Esther Salas has been an exceptional public servant. \nIn 2006, she became the first Hispanic to serve as a U.S. magistrate \njudge for the District of New Jersey. In her handling of a docket of \nwell over 400 cases, she has earned the respect of many in the legal \ncommunity who have said she is the finest judge they have worked with \nin many years of practice.\n  In a 10-year environmental dispute involving 350 attorneys, she \nmanaged the resulting avalanche of motions and countermotions involving \nFederal and State claims for more than $300 million in cleanup costs \nand damages. Her handling of the case prompted several lawyers not only \nto credit her with being the principal moving force in bringing the \nparties to agreement but recommending her to the Judiciary Committee \nwith their unqualified support.\n  Prior to serving as a U.S. magistrate judge, Judge Salas worked for \nalmost 10 years in the Federal Public Defenders Office, where she \nzealously provided her clients with her best legal advice and a skilled \ndefense in what were often difficult and complex cases.\n  Judge Salas clerked with distinction for Superior Court Judge Eugene \nCodey, and--a proud New Jerseyan--she earned her degrees from Rutgers \nUniversity and Rutgers University Law School.\n  She is a respected member of the New Jersey State Bar, a past \npresident of the Hispanic bar of New Jersey, and an extraordinary \njurist.\n  These two extraordinary nominees--two of New Jersey's most respected \nlegal professionals--both deserve confirmation by the full Senate as \nU.S. District Court Judges for the District of New Jersey. I urge my \ncolleagues to confirm their nominations and give New Jersey two \nrespected and distinguished District Court judges who have earned the \nconfidence of the legal community in my State, the recommendation of \nthe Judiciary Committee and, in my view, deserve a unanimous vote in \nthe full Senate.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate last confirmed a judicial \nnominee on May 17, almost 1 month ago. This is despite the fact that \nalmost a score of\n\n[[Page S3751]]\n\nqualified nominees have been awaiting final consideration since that \ndate. Last month, the Senate recessed for Memorial Day with 19 judicial \nnominees pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar. Of those, 16 are \nby anyone's definition consensus nominees. All 16 were unanimously \napproved by every Republican and every Democratic Senator on the \nJudiciary Committee after thorough review. They are all supported by \ntheir home State Senators, Republicans and Democrats. These are the \nkind of nominees who in past years would be confirmed within days of \nbeing reported to the Senate and without the extended delays that now \nburden every nomination.\n  With judicial vacancies continuing at crisis levels, affecting the \nability of courts to provide justice to Americans around the country, I \nhave been urging the Senate to vote on the judicial nominations \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee and pending on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar. My efforts have not yielded much success \nor sense of urgency. Nor have the statements by the Chief Justice of \nthe United States, the Attorney General of the United States, the White \nHouse counsel, the Federal Bar Association and a number of Federal \njudges across the country.\n  Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must \nunderstand that they are delaying and preventing the administration of \njustice. We can pass all the bills we want to protect American \ntaxpayers from fraud and other crimes, but you cannot lock up criminals \nor recover ill-gotten gains if you do not have judges. The mounting \nbacklogs of civil and criminal cases are growing larger.\n  We should have regular votes on President Obama's highly qualified \nnominees, instead of more delays. With vacancies still totaling more \nthan 90 on Federal courts throughout the country, and with nearly two \ndozen future vacancies on the horizon, there is no time to delay \nconsideration of these nominations. Had we taken positive action on the \nconsensus nominees, vacancies would have been reduced to below 80 for \nthe first time since the beginning of President Obama's administration.\n  All of the nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee and \npending on the Senate's Executive Calendar have been through the \ncommittee's fair and thorough process. We review extensive background \nmaterial on each nominee. All Senators on the committee, Democratic and \nRepublican, have the opportunity to ask the nominees questions at a \nlive hearing. Senators also have the opportunity to ask questions in \nwriting following the hearing and to meet with the nominees. All of \nthese nominees which the committee reported to the Senate have a strong \ncommitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the \nConstitution. All have the support of their home state Senators, both \nRepublican and Democratic. They should not be delayed for weeks and \nmonths needlessly after being so thoroughly and fairly considered by \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Today, the Senate is being allowed to vote on two more of President \nObama's outstanding judicial nominees, Esther Salas and Claire Cecchi--\nboth currently Federal magistrate judges for the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of New Jersey, the court to which they are nominated. \nJudge Salas previously served as a Federal public defender and in \nprivate practice. She is a graduate of Rutgers University and Rutgers \nUniversity School of Law. Judge Cecchi previously worked in private \npractice and for the city of New York. She graduated from Barnard \nCollege of Columbia University and Fordham University School of Law. \nJudge Salas and Judge Cecchi both have the strong support of their home \nstate Senators, Senator Lautenberg and Senator Menendez.\n  After today's votes on the two New Jersey nominees, there will remain \nmore than a dozen other judicial nominations that were reported \nunanimously and that are being stalled for no good reason and without \njustification. They include several nominees to fill judicial emergency \nvacancies, including Paul Engelmayer and William Kuntz of New York, \nRichard Brooke Jackson of Colorado, Kathleen Williams of Florida, and \nNelva Gonzales Ramos of Texas, as well as Henry Floyd of South Carolina \nto the Fourth Circuit.\n  Other nominations reported unanimously and without any opposition are \nPaul Oetken of New York, Romana Manglona of the Mariana Islands, Sara \nLynn Darrow of Illinois, John Andrew Ross of Missouri, Timothy M. Cain \nof South Carolina, Nanette Jolivette Brown of Louisiana and Nancy \nTorreson of Maine. Some have been needlessly stalled before the Senate \nfor months. Those with home state Republican Senators in support \ninclude Bernice Donald of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit, Henry Floyd \nof South Carolina to the Fourth Circuit, Sara Lynn Darrow of Illinois, \nKathleen Williams of Florida, Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Texas, John \nAndrew Ross of Missouri, Timothy Cain of South Carolina, Nannette \nJolivette Brown of Louisiana, and Nancy Torresen of Maine. In spite of \nall this, we continue to be unable to secure consent from the \nRepublican leadership for the Senate to consider and vote on these \nnominations. They will all be confirmed if allowed to be considered.\n  We could have made significant progress helping Americans seeking \njustice in our Federal courts before the Memorial Day recess. I hope \nSenators across the aisle can join together with us and work with the \nPresident to provide needed judicial resources before our Fourth of \nJuly recess.\n  I congratulate both of the outstanding nominees we will confirm \ntoday, and their families on what I expect will be their unanimous \nconfirmations today.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will confirm two more \nof President Obama's judicial nominees. Both nominees are for seats in \nthe District of New Jersey. With these confirmations today, the \nDistrict of New Jersey will be fully staffed, with no vacancies.\n  I have been working throughout this Congress to confirm consensus \nnominees. Yet we continue to hear complaints in the blogs and elsewhere \non the lack of confirmations or on the slow pace of confirmations. I \nthink the record demonstrates otherwise. We have taken positive action \non more than 60 percent of President Obama's nominees in this Congress. \nWe have reported out of committee more than half the nominees. Twenty-\nsix nominees will have been confirmed after today. Even with this pace, \nI remind my colleagues that we continue to carefully review the \nqualifications of all nominees. This is not a pro forma process. We \nexpect quality nominations from the President, not just quantity.\n  Today, the Senate will consider two nominations, both to be U.S. \ndistrict judge for the District of New Jersey. Since 2006, both have \nbeen serving as a U.S. magistrate judge for the District of New Jersey. \nI congratulate these nominees.\n  The first nominee is Claire Cecchi. Judge Cecchi received her \nbachelor's degree from Barnard College, Columbia University in 1986, \nand her juris doctorate from Fordham University School of Law in 1989.\n  Upon graduation, Judge Cecchi worked for the Office of Corporation \nCounsel for the city of New York. In 1992 she became an associate with \nthe firm of Robinson, St. John & Wayne and its successor firm, \nRobinson, Lapidus & Livelli. There she focused her work in general \npractice with an emphasis on securities litigation. In 1997 Judge \nCecchi joined the firm of Carpenter, Bennett & Morrissey, where she \nhandled general litigation, including products liability, employment, \nantitrust, and patent law cases. She became a partner in that firm in \n2001. In 2004 she joined the firm McElroy, Deutsch, Mulvaney & \nCarpetner, as of counsel. She was a partner in that firm in 2005 to \n2006. Judge Cecchi also served as a State-certified mediator for the \nNew Jersey State courts system while in private practice. She was \nappointed a magistrate judge in 2006, where she presides over pretrial \nmotions, mediations, and settlements.\n  The American Bar Association has rated Judge Cecchi ``majority \nqualified, minority well qualified.''\n  The second nominee, Esther Salas, received both her bachelor's and \njuris doctorate from Rutgers University in 1991 and 1994, respectively.\n  Judge Salas began her legal career as a law clerk for Judge Eugene \nCody of the Superior Court of New Jersey. After her clerkship, Judge \nSalas worked at the firm of Garces & Grabler, where she handled \ncriminal\n\n[[Page S3752]]\n\nwork and appellate matters. In 1997, she joined the Office of the \nFederal Public Defender as an assistant public defender, working for \nindigent criminals in Federal criminal matters. She was appointed as a \nU.S. magistrate judge for the District of New Jersey in 2006.\n  The American Bar Association has rated Judge Salas unanimously ``well \nqualified.''\n  I support these two nominees and congratulate them for their \nachievement and public service.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I now yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Claire C. Cecchi, of New Jersey, to be United States District Judge \nfor the District of New Jersey?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 5 \nminutes for debate only equally divided on amendment No. 436, as \nmodified, offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  Who yields time? No one has yielded time. Time will be charged \nequally to both sides.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am speaking on this amendment. I \noppose the amendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same. There is \ngoing to be a change with biofuels in this country. We are going to see \na phasing out of the support for biofuels in terms of Federal policy. \nBut the time to do it is not in the middle of the year after 7 years of \nFederal support with 5 days' notice.\n  Senator Thune and I have an alternative bill that actually takes the \nrest of the year, the last 6 months of this year, the funding, and puts \n$1 billion into deficit reduction, and then allows the industry to keep \nits footing so it can actually compete with oil.\n  I would remind my colleagues that this is now 10 percent of our fuel \nsupply. There have been studies done that show the price of gasoline \nwould escalate up to $1 more a gallon if the rug were suddenly pulled \nout from under this industry. It is the only competition with oil. So \nwhile this industry, unlike the oil industry, has acknowledged that \nthere is change ahead and that they are willing to be part of this \nchange and actually put money on the\n\n[[Page S3753]]\n\ntable, the time to do it is not now on an unrelated bill with no \ndiscussion of a comprehensive energy plan for this country.\n  I know Senator Thune would like to talk about his opposition to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on this \nmotion. As the Senator from Minnesota has pointed out, there is a \nbetter way to do this. I think we can all work together in a \nconstructive way and accomplish what the proponents of this amendment \nwant to do, but do it in a way that does not disrupt this industry.\n  In December, 81 Senators--81 Senators--voted for tax policy. Here we \nare 6 months later and we are going to say we are going to pull the rug \nout. We are going to tell you guys just to go pound sand--after giving \nthem a commitment back in December that we would have this tax policy \nin place until the end of the year.\n  That is not the way to do business. This can be done in the right \nway. I urge my colleagues to defeat this motion, and then we can work \ntogether to try to get to where we have a solution in place that is \ngood for jobs, good for the energy industry in this country, and good \nfor the taxpayers of America.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one negative aspect of Senator Coburn's \namendment No. 436, as modified, to the Economic Development \nRevitalization Act of 2011 is that it is a tax increase that is not \noffset by a tax cut of an equal or greater amount.\n  It takes away a tax incentive and therefore increases taxes but fails \nto cut taxes in another area, such as by lowering tax rates. I do not \nfavor taking away tax incentives without cutting taxes in other areas \nto reach a revenue-neutral result.\n  Revenue-neutrality should be judged using a current-policy baseline \nand not the unrealistic current-law baseline that builds in trillions \nof dollars of tax increases.\n  However, in this case, the policy considerations regarding ending the \ntax incentive for corn-based ethanol outweigh this general principle. I \nwill note that this is not the case for the larger-dollar, and more \nsignificant, tax incentives such as the home mortgage interest \ndeduction.\n  With respect to these tax incentives, any changes that increase \nrevenue must be offset with a tax cut in another area, such as by \nlowering tax rates. My vote in favor of the Coburn amendment should not \nbe viewed as a precedent for increasing taxes.\n  Taxes are already headed higher than they historically have been \naccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Americans are \nnot undertaxed, Washington overspends, and we need to get that spending \nunder control.\n  In terms of energy policy for our Nation, I think the case is more \nclear in favor of this amendment. I do not believe it makes sense to \nprovide a tax incentive for a product that is also mandated by the \nFederal Government, which is what we have with ethanol. Moreover, \nenergy tax incentives should be a temporary boost, not a long-term \nstrategy to support an energy source that cannot compete on its own. I \nbelieve the time has come for corn ethanol to stand on its own as a \ntransportation fuel.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I will vote today against cloture on \namendment No. 436, dealing with subsidies for the ethanol industry, \nbecause its author used inappropriate procedural tactics to attach it \nto an unrelated bill devoted to economic development.\n  I support eliminating unnecessary tax subsidies to the ethanol \nindustry, but today's vote is a political maneuver orchestrated by \nmembers of the minority party. I am pleased that the Senate will have \nan opportunity to vote on the merits of this issue, without extraneous \ndebates over Senate procedure and process, in the coming days.\n  I will then support this measure to eliminate subsidies to the \nethanol industry, which is necessary to save taxpayer dollars, reduce \nthe deficit, and rein in our national debt.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on Senator Coburn's amendment to the Economic \nDevelopment Revitalization Act of 2011 to repeal the volumetric ethanol \nexcise tax credit and the tariff on ethanol imports. I will vote \nagainst cloture on this amendment because of assurances that there \nwould be another vote on ethanol subsidies in the near future without \nthe extraordinary procedural problems occasioned by this amendment as \nit was brought to the floor.\n  My position on corn ethanol subsidies is clear. I am a cosponsor of \nSenator Coburn's Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit Repeal Act. I \nalso signed a letter last fall along with several of my colleagues \nopposing the current extension of the volumetric ethanol excise tax \ncredit and the tariff on ethanol imports.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we have introduced into the Record the \nindustry that gets this tax credit--they represent 97 percent of all of \nthe ethanol that is blended--does not want the $3 billion. They say it \nis not a disruption to them, and, in fact, it is $3 billion that we \ncannot afford to pay.\n  It is something that already has accomplished its purpose through a \ngovernment mandate. I would yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I \nthink everybody in this body now knows that I am strongly for this \nmeasure. Unfortunately, I think it has created a lot of feelings that \nreally do not work to the benefit of this body.\n  It is my understanding there is an offer from the leader that we will \nhave a vote by Friday next, which means a week from this Friday. I tend \nto just say what I think. On our side, I think there are real concerns \nabout the process used to bring this amendment to the floor. I think \nthat has created some, unfortunately, very bad feelings which even are \nenough to affect people's votes.\n  My view has been a little different. I have watched this ethanol \namendment go from $1.5 billion in the early part of the 2000s to where \nit costs $5.7 billion now. It is a triple crown. It is a subsidy, it is \na mandate, it is a protective tariff. It should go. I have no question \nabout that.\n  I also want to see this body have an ability to work together. It \nalso gives us a little bit of time to see if we can negotiate some \nagreement between the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from South \nDakota. That would be the best of all worlds. Whether we can do this, I \ndo not know, but I am certainly willing to try.\n  What I hate to see is this vote get so caught up--which it is now \ncaught up in process--that we have no chance of sorting it out. I have \nasked the Senator from Oklahoma would he consider withdrawing this \namendment so we can try and see if we could----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would ask unanimous consent for a couple of seconds \nmore.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.--so that we could try and see if we can work \nsomething out with Senators Klobuchar and Thune. I would implore him \nonce again, I think for the best interests of our body as a whole, both \nsides, we ought to take the time to try to work it out. I think we lose \nvotes right now on the basis of the process alone that we would not \nlose on just a straight vote.\n  I believe if it were not for the process, we would have 60 votes. \nThat is my belief. So I want the Senator from Oklahoma to know that \nright up front. I would implore him to let us withdraw the amendment, \ntry to negotiate a solution, and then take this up, as the leader has \npledged, by Friday next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the reason this amendment ended up the way \nit is, is because we don't have an open amendment process in the Senate \nanymore. Rule XXII gives every Senator the right to offer an amendment. \nWe\n\n[[Page S3754]]\n\nhave no Senate unless we have the right to offer an amendment.\n  There is no usurpation of the power of the majority leader. He gets \nto set what bills are on the floor. Every Senator has the right to file \ncloture on their amendments--every Senator. They also have every right \nto offer amendments.\n  We would not be in this position if we did not have a closed \namendment process instead of an open amendment process. I would like to \nsolve this problem. I recognize that this is going to be blue-slipped \nanyway. I thank the majority leader for his offer. I do not think it \naccomplishes what we want. I think we end up losing what we can get and \nwhat we should get.\n  I think the American people deserve to have us take this $3 billion \nout of the hands of the large oil companies now, not to the benefit of \nany American except to their detriment and their children.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have the honor of representing the people \nof the great State of Florida here in the Senate, and today I speak for \nthe first time on this floor on their behalf.\n  The Senate is a long ways away from where I come from, both literally \nand figuratively. I come from a hard-working and humble family, one \nthat was neither wealthy nor connected. Yet I have always considered \nmyself to be a child of privilege because growing up I was blessed with \ntwo very important things: I was raised by a strong and stable family, \nand I was blessed to be born here in the United States of America.\n  America began from a very powerful truth--that our rights as \nindividuals do not come from our government, they come from our God. \nGovernment's job is to protect those rights. And here, this Republic, \nhas done that better than any government in the history of the world.\n  Now, America is not perfect. It took a bloody civil war to free over \n4 million African Americans who lived in slavery. It took another 100 \nyears before they achieved full equality under the law. But since its \nearliest days, America has inspired people from all over the world, \ninspired them with the hope that one day their own countries would be \none like this one.\n  Many others decided they could not wait, and so they came here from \neverywhere to pursue their dreams and to work to leave their children \nbetter off than themselves. The result was the American miracle--a \nmiracle where a 16-year-old boy from Sweden, with no English in his \nvocabulary and $5 in his pocket, saved enough money to open a \nshoestore. Today, that store, Nordstrom's, is a multibillion-dollar \nglobal retail giant; a miracle that led to a young couple with no money \nand no business experience opening a toy company out of the garage of \ntheir home. Today, that company, Mattel, is one of the world's largest \ntoy manufacturers; a miracle where the French-born son of Iranian \nparents created a Web site called AuctionWeb in the living room of his \nhome. Today, that company, known as eBay, stands as a testament to the \nfamiliar phrase ``only in America.''\n  These are just three examples of Americans whose extraordinary \nsuccess began with nothing more than an idea. But it is important to \nremember that the American dream was never just about how much money \nyou made; it is also about something that typifies my home State of \nFlorida: the desire of every parent to leave their children with a \nbetter life. It is a dream lived by countless people whose stories will \nnever be told, people--Americans--who never made $1 million. They never \nowned a yacht or a plane or a second home. Yet they too live the \nAmerican dream because through their hard work and sacrifice, they were \nable to open doors for their children that had been closed for them.\n  It is the story of the people who clean our offices here in this \nbuilding, who work hard so that one day their children can go to \ncollege. It is the story of the men and women who serve our meals in \nthis building, who work hard so that one day their children can \naccomplish their own dreams.\n  It is the story of a bartender and a maid in Florida. Today, their \nson serves here in the Senate and stands as a proud witness of the \ngreatness of this land.\n  Becoming a world power was never America's plan, but that is exactly \nwhat the American economic miracle made her. Most great powers have \nused their strength to conquer, but America is different. For us, our \npower always has come with a sense that those to whom much is given, \nmuch is expected; a sense that with the blessings God bestowed upon \nthis land came the responsibility to make the world a better place. And \nin the 20th century, that is precisely and exactly what America did. \nAmerica led in two world wars so that others could be free. America led \nin the Cold War to stop the spread of and ultimately defeat communism. \nWhile our military and foreign policy contributions helped save the \nworld, it was our economic and cultural innovations that helped \ntransform it.\n  The fruits of the American miracle can be found in the daily lives of \npeople everywhere. Anywhere in the world, someone uses a mobile phone, \ne-mail, the Internet, or GPS; they are enjoying the benefits of the \nAmerican miracle. Anywhere in the world where a bone marrow, lung, or \nheart transplant saves a life, they are touched by the value of the \nAmerican miracle. On one night in July of 1969, the world witnessed the \nAmerican miracle firsthand, for on that night an American walked\n\n[[Page S3755]]\n\non the surface of the Moon, and it was clear to the world that these \nAmericans could do anything.\n  Now, clearly America's rise was not free of adversity. We faced a \ncivil rights struggle that saw Governors defy Presidents; that saw \npolice dogs attack innocent, peaceful protestors; that saw little \nchildren murdered in churches by bombs. We faced two oil crises. \nAmerica faced Watergate. America faced American hostages in Iran.\n  I grew up in the 1980s, a time when it was morning in America. Yet \neven then we faced the war on drugs. We lost soldiers in Beirut and \nastronauts on the Challenger. We faced a devastating oilspill in Alaska \nand a terrifying new disease called AIDS. Through challenges and \ntriumphs, the 20th century was the American century--a century where \nAmerica's political, economic, and cultural exceptionalism made the \nworld a more prosperous and peaceful place.\n  But now we find ourselves in a new century, and there is this growing \nsense that for America, things will never be the same, that maybe this \ncentury will belong to someone else. Indeed, we do now stand at a \nturning point in our history, one where there are only two ways forward \nfor us: We will either bring on another American century or we are \ndoomed to witness America's decline.\n  Another American century is fully within our reach because there is \nnothing wrong with our people. The American people haven't forgotten \nhow to start a business. The American people haven't run out of good \nideas. We Americans are as great as we have ever been. But our \ngovernment is broken, and it is keeping us from doing what we have done \nbetter than any people in the history of the world--create jobs and \nprosperity.\n  If we here in Washington could just find agreement on a plan to get \ncontrol of our debt, if we could just make our Tax Code simpler and \nmore predictable, if we could just get the government to ease up on \nsome of these onerous regulations, the American people will take care \nof the rest.\n  If this government will do its part, this generation of Americans \nwill do theirs. They will give us a prosperous, upwardly mobile \neconomy, one where our children will invent, build, and sell things to \na world where more people than ever can afford to buy them. If we give \nAmerica a government that can live within its means, the American \neconomy will give us a government of considerable means, a government \nthat can afford to pay for things government should be doing because it \ndoes not waste money on the things government should not be doing.\n  If we can deliver on a few simple but important things, we have the \nchance to do something that is difficult to imagine is even possible--\nan America whose future will be greater than her past. Sadly, that is \nnot where we are headed. We have made no progress on the issues of our \ntime because, frankly, we have too many people in both parties who have \ndecided that the next election is more important than the next \ngeneration. And our lack of progress on these issues has led to \nsomething even more troubling--a growing fear that maybe these problems \nare too big for us to solve, too big for even America.\n  Well, there is no reason to be afraid. Our story, the story of \nAmerica, is not the story of a nation that never faced problems. It is \nthe story of a nation that faced its challenges and solved them. Our \nstory, the story of the American people, is not the story of a people \nwho always got it right; it is the story of a people who in the end got \nit right.\n  We should never forget who we Americans are. Every single one of us \nis the descendant of a go-getter, of dreamers and of believers, of men \nand women who took risks and made sacrifices because they wanted their \nchildren to live better off than themselves. So whether they came here \non the Mayflower, on a slave ship, or on an airplane from Havana, we \nare all descendants of the men and women who built the Nation that \nsaved the world.\n  We are still the great American people, and the only thing standing \nin the way of our solving our problems is our willingness to do so. And \nwhether we do so is of great consequence not just to us but to the \nwhole world. I know some now say that because times are very tough at \nhome, we can no longer afford to worry about what happens abroad, that \nmaybe America needs to mind its own business. Well, whether we like it \nor not, there is virtually no aspect of our daily lives that is not \ndirectly impacted by what happens in the world around us. We can choose \nto ignore global problems, but global problems will not ignore us.\n  One of my favorite speeches is one that talks about our role in the \nworld. It was the speech President Kennedy was set to give had he lived \njust 1 more day, and it closes with these words:\n\n       We in this country, in this generation, are--by destiny \n     rather than by choice--the watchmen on the walls of world \n     freedom. We ask, therefore, that we may be worthy of our \n     power and responsibility, that we may exercise our strength \n     with wisdom and restraint, and that we may achieve in our \n     time and for all time the ancient vision of ``peace on Earth, \n     good will toward men.'' That must always be our goal, and the \n     righteousness of our cause must always underlie our strength. \n     For as was written long ago, ``except the Lord keep the city, \n     the watchman waketh but in vain.''\n\n  Almost a half century later, America is still the only watchman on \nthe wall of world freedom, and there is still no one to take our place.\n  What will the world look like if America declines? Well, today people \nall over the world are forced to accept a familiar lie, that the price \nof security is their liberty. If America declines, who will serve as \nliving proof that liberty, security, and prosperity can all exist \ntogether?\n  Today, radical Islam abuses and oppresses women, has no tolerance for \nother faiths, and it seeks to impose its will on the whole world. If \nAmerica declines, who will stand up to them and defeat them?\n  Today, children are used as soldiers and trafficked as slaves. \nDissidents are routinely imprisoned without trial, and they are \nsubjected to torture and forced into confessions and labor. If America \ndeclines, what nation on Earth will take these causes as their own?\n  What will the world look like if America declines? Who is going to \ncreate the innovations of the 21st century? Who will stretch the limits \nof human potential and explore the new frontiers? And if America \ndeclines, who will do all these things and ask for nothing in return, \nmotivated solely by the desire to make the world a better place?\n  The answer is, no one will. There is still no nation or institution \non this planet that is willing or able to do what America has done.\n  Ronald Reagan famously described America as a shining city on a hill. \nNow, some say that we can no longer afford the price we must pay to \nkeep America's light shining. Others like to say there are new shining \ncities that will soon replace us. I say they are both wrong.\n  Yes, the price we are going to pay to keep America's light shining is \nhigh. But the price we will pay if America's light stops shining is \neven higher.\n  Yes, there are new nations emerging with prosperity and influence. \nThat is what we always wanted. America never wanted to be the only \nshining city on the hill. We wanted our example to inspire the people \nof the Earth to build one of their own. You see, these nations, these \nnew emerging nations, these new shining cities, we hope they will join \nus. But they can never replace us because their light is but a \nreflection of our own.\n  It is the light of an American century that now spreads throughout \nthe Earth, a world that still needs America, a world that still needs \nour light, a world that needs a new American century. I pray that, with \nGod's help, that will be our legacy to our children and to the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican Leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of all of our colleagues, I \ncommend our new Senator from Florida for his remarkable speech. No one \nis a better example of the American dream than he is, and no one \nexpresses American exceptionalism better than Senator Rubio. I \ncongratulate him on behalf of all of our colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I join with my Republican counterpart in \ncongratulating my friend from Florida for his fine speech. But I wish, \nin his remarks, he would have once in a while\n\n[[Page S3756]]\n\nmentioned where he spent a lot of his youth: Las Vegas and North Las \nVegas, NV.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague \nfrom Florida, and I want him to know that it is a great pleasure for me \nto serve with him. It has been a tradition in Florida that the two \nSenators get along. This has been a great tradition that goes back to \nwhen Bob Graham and Connie Mack were the two Senators. It continued \nwith Mel Martinez and me, and now I have the privilege of continuing \nthat kind of relationship with Senator Rubio.\n  The maiden speech is a big deal for a Senator, and it is always a \nmemory that is forever etched in my mind.\n  I was in one of those desks over there as a very junior member, and I \nwill never forget in the course of my speech--and it was mostly an \nempty Chamber--that I mentioned that it was my maiden speech. In a few \nminutes, all of a sudden those side doors flung open and in strode \nSenator Robert Byrd. So here I am giving my maiden speech and Senator \nByrd is sitting in his seat. As I finished, he said: Would the Senator \nyield?\n  I said: Of course, I yield to the Senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Senator Byrd, off the top of his head, gave an oration about the \nhistory of maiden speeches in the Senate. Now, of course, that is \nindelibly etched in my memory. Surely, the Senator's maiden speech \ntoday will be indelibly etched in his, and I congratulate him.\n  I thank him for his personal friendship. I thank him also for the \nprivilege of the professional relationship that we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, very briefly, I have come to know Senator \nRubio. We have early morning seminars, and we have come to know one \nanother a little better. I hope that continues. But at this point, I \nespecially thank him for that speech because it was clearly a speech \nwith a lot of personal reflection on one's own life and on the life of \nAmerica. What he said will endure. There are things in there that we \nall should remember about this Nation and about our responsibility as \nSenators.\n  I thank the Senator for that fine speech, and I am glad that I was \nhere to be a witness to it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3756-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy in \nallowing us to proceed and discuss issues at this point in time and \nwanted to recall for my colleagues that we are now at 776 days since \nthe Senate has agreed to a budget. We have not passed a budget in 776 \ndays. This is not responsible at a time in which we are having the \nlargest deficits this country has ever seen.\n  This year it is projected our deficit, as of September 30, when the \nfiscal year ends, will have been $1.5 trillion. I think this is a big \nissue.\n  Last year the Budget Committee moved a budget out to the floor of the \nSenate, and Senator Reid chose not to bring it up, the majority leader. \nThis year he declared that it would be foolish to bring up a budget to \nthe floor even though he has a majority in the Senate. We can pass a \nbudget with a simple majority. It is a priority item. He has apparently \nasked, and the Budget Committee has not even had a markup.\n  The Budget Act requires a markup to begin by April 1 and a budget to \nbe passed by April 15 so we can go about the business of funding next \nyear's government. We need a budget. States have budgets, cities have \nbudgets, counties have budgets. No city, county, or state that I am \naware of is anything close to borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we \nspend as this Congress is doing. We are spending $3.7 trillion. We are \ntaking in $2.2 trillion. That is a stunning number.\n  One reason we are so out of control is we do not have a budget. I \nhave been harping away at that, and I have been talking about its \nimpact on jobs. The Rogoff and Reinhart study makes it clear from \nnations around the world they have studied that when the debt reaches \n90 percent of the economy, the entire economy of the country equal to \nthat much debt, median growth drops 1 percent. Really the average is \nabove that, I believe, but at any rate, 1 percent.\n  We had 1.8 percent growth the first quarter. Could we have had 2.8 \npercent? We are talking about more than 30 percent reduction in our \ngrowth and 1 percent in growth in our economy equals the creation of 1 \nmillion jobs. So that is the kind of thing I have been talking about \nand going into some detail about and have been unhappy and disappointed \nthat my majority leader would have the gall to attack the House \nMembers.\n  I have a chart. We do not want to forget this number. It is a pretty \nbig number. It is 776. That is how long it has been since we had a \nbudget. So I complained about that. My friend, Senator Reid, has the \ntoughest job in Washington, being the majority leader in the Senate. I \ndo not know how he does it, but he has to lead.\n  As my wife says to me: Don't blame me. You asked for the job. Well, \nhe asked for the job to be the leader, and he announced it was foolish \nfor us to have a budget just a few weeks ago. When will we ever have \none presumably?\n  Just today, earlier this morning, I guess he got a little tired of my \nharping, and he said: I heard our friend, the ranking member on the \nBudget Committee--that is me--come here and talk for hours, and he \nkeeps talking about things that really have no bearing on what I think \nis important to the country today, and that is we know that the \nRepublicans have put forward a budget that destroys Medicare.\n  Republicans did not destroy Medicare. Give me a break--and that is \nnot the only problem we have facing the country. Medicare is going \nbroke and we need to do something to save it, that is true. There are \nbig issues. One of them is the surging debt that Erskine Bowles, \nappointed by President Obama to head the fiscal commission, testified \nabout before the Budget Committee just a few weeks ago. He said we are \nfacing the most predictable economic crisis in our Nation's history. \nThis has the potential to put us into another doubledip recession. The \neconomy is not doing well.\n  The things I have been talking about do have bearing on the future of \nour country, and I am disappointed my good friend, the Democratic \nleader, does not agree.\n  Housing prices continue to drop. They are expected to go down another \n5 percent or 6 percent this year. We thought we had hit the bottom on \nhousing. Gasoline is still close to $4 a gallon. Unemployment just went \nup. We had a meager increase in 54,000 jobs last month. We need to have \nabout 200,000 to actually reduce unemployment. As a result, \nunemployment went up. It is the lowest and worst job numbers we have \nhad in some time.\n  The debt, the economy, gasoline prices, jobs--those are matters that \nhave no bearing on what is important to our country? I think they have \na bearing on what is important. What does the majority leader believe? \nWhat does he think we should be doing?\n  This bill we have been fiddling with for weeks has no monumental or \nsignificant ability to alter the debt trajectory which is taking us on \nthe most predictable course to fiscal disaster, that is what we need to \nbe addressing. It is the most important issue facing our country. Of \nthat I have no doubt. I do not think anybody has any doubt.\n\n[[Page S3757]]\n\n  Listen to the news programs. Listen to the business channels. Read \nyour newspaper. The debt we are facing is critical to our country.\n  The instability of our entitlement programs, such as Medicare, is an \nissue we have to talk about. We cannot deny that. We have opposition \nhere to doing things that make sense, such as producing more oil and \ngas. We have a permitorium, a blocking of permits on drilling for oil \nand gas off our shore presumably so we can buy more oil and gas \nproduced offshore in Brazil or Nigeria or Venezuela but not off our \nshores, transferring our wealth abroad that could be creating jobs and \ntax revenue for the United States Government.\n  What about this Medicare problem? Let me talk about it because it is \na part of the problem. It is one of the difficulties we have to deal \nwith, although certainly not the only one. The biggest problem we have \nnow is discretionary spending that is out of control, not Medicare \nright now, not Social Security right now. In the last 2 years, under \nPresident Obama, nondefense--not defense--nondefense discretionary \nspending--not Social Security, not Medicare--went up 24 percent at a \ntime when the deficits have been $1.2 trillion, $1.3 trillion, and this \nyear $1.5 trillion, perhaps. We have never had deficits that large. The \nproblem is, it is systemic. We have never had this kind of challenge.\n  I know there was a big fight in the mid-1990s, and the government was \nshut down, and Newt Gingrich and his team fought and said they wanted \nto balance the budget, and they balanced the budget. The country didn't \nsink into the ocean as that little shutdown occurred, but they balanced \nthe budget. Now we are in a much deeper hole, I am telling my \ncolleagues. I have looked at the numbers. I am the ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee. It is not easy for us to get out of this fix, not \neasy at all. It is going to take some real effort and leadership.\n  The President submitted a budget that came before the Congress and \nwas voted down 97 to nothing in the Senate. Not a single Member voted \nfor his budget, which would have doubled the debt over the next 10 \nyears. He made it worse than the baseline we were already on, which was \nutterly unsustainable.\n  So is Medicare something that absolutely cannot be discussed even \nthough it is going into default? Let me tell my colleagues what some of \nour Democratic leaders have said about Medicare.\n  Steny Hoyer, the House whip, one of the top Democratic leaders in the \nHouse, said this:\n\n       Do I believe that there are other things we can do related \n     to Medicare? The answer is I do. I am not going to get into \n     articulating each one, but my expectation is they will be \n     under discussion by the Biden group.\n\n  They have a little secret group down there meeting with the White \nHouse--some Republicans and Democrats--and we are supposed to all relax \nnow because they are going to solve our problems and put it on a silver \nplatter for us, and we are just going to vote for it, and it will be \ngood for the country. Well, I am a little dubious about it, but I am \nanxious to hear about what they are going to produce. The longer they \nwait, the more critical our situation is.\n  What about the House minority leader, the former Speaker, Nancy \nPelosi? She was on Larry Kudlow, CNBC business channel. Mr. Kudlow is a \nvery articulate moderator, and he asked this question of former Speaker \nPelosi: Is Medicare on the table or entitlements on the table?\n  Answer: Yes. I think Medicare is on the table.\n  What about President Obama and his health care summit on February 25 \nof last year?\n\n       Almost all of the long-term deficit and debt that we face \n     relates to the exploding costs of Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n  That is his direct quote, the President of the United States.\n  He goes on:\n\n       Almost all of it. That is the single biggest driver of our \n     Federal debt, and if we don't get control over that, we can't \n     get control of our Federal budget.\n\n  Our former President, Bill Clinton, I guess maybe the spiritual head \nof the Democratic Party, one of the most respected Democrats, said:\n\n       I am afraid that the Democrats will draw the conclusion . . \n     . that we shouldn't do anything. I completely disagree with \n     that. The Democrats may have to give up some short-term \n     political gain by whipping up fear, if it's a reasonable \n     Social Security program, if it's a reasonable Medicare \n     proposal. You cannot have health care devour the economy.\n\n  Well, that is the truth. Of course we have to talk about it because \nit is on an unsustainable path.\n  Let me talk a little bit more about that because Congressman Ryan and \nI wrote a letter to the President today asking him to do his duty with \nregard to Medicare on a matter that just came up.\n  On May 13, the Medicare trustees issued their annual report on the \nfinancial status of the Medicare Program. Medicare has a trust fund. \nThey have trustees who are committed to preserving the program, trying \nto make sure they can pay the recipients what they have been promised \nin the years to come and make sure the money is well handled. They do \nannual reports on this massive program. The Medicare Hospital Insurance \ntrust fund--that is the HI trust fund--ran an annual cash-flow deficit \nof $32.3 billion last year, in 2010, and will continue to run deficits \nthroughout the decade. That is what the trustees say about Medicare.\n  They went on to say this: The Medicare trust fund will become \ninsolvent in 2024--5 years earlier than last year's date of exhaustion. \nCan we imagine that? They redid the numbers and have concluded it is \ngoing to be in default, become insolvent, 5 years sooner than they were \npredicting just last year.\n  They went on to say: If current law remains unchanged, Medicare's \nunfunded obligation is $24.4 trillion over the next 75 years. In other \nwords, to put this on a sound basis, investing today, you need $24.4 \ntrillion.\n  Like last year, the nonpartisan Chief Actuary of the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, Richard Foster, used his statement of \nactuarial opinion at the end of the report to warn that:\n\n       The financial projections shown in this report for Medicare \n     do not represent a reasonable expectation for actual program \n     operations in either the short range (as a result of the \n     unsustainable reductions in physician payment rates) or in \n     the long range (because of the strong likelihood that \n     statutory reductions in price updates for most categories of \n     Medicare provider services will not be viable).\n\n  On May 20, a week after the trustees' report was released, the Chief \nActuary, Mr. Foster, produced his ``illustrative alternative'' \nprojections based on ``more sustainable assumptions.'' Those estimates \nindicate that under a more likely scenario for future spending, \nMedicare's unfunded obligations are $36.8 trillion over the next 75 \nyears--a figure that is far larger than the official trustees' estimate \nof $24.4 trillion.\n  Mr. Foster has been there a long time. He is a very serious person. \nHe understands his responsibility to tell us the truth. He understands \nthe responsibility to Medicare recipients. He is telling us we need to \ndo something about Medicare.\n  It goes on: The trustees projected that total Medicare spending will \ndraw more than 45 percent of its funding out of the Treasury's general \nfund in 2011.\n  A lot of people think Medicare is funded by the Medicare tax \ndeduction we see on our paycheck, the withholding tax we pay, and that \nis a significant amount of money, no doubt about it. But the Medicare \ntrustees just reported to us that of the total money Medicare spends, \n45 percent is funded directly out of the general fund--general tax \nrevenues--not the payroll withholding. As a consequence, for the sixth \nyear in a row, they say--2006 through 2011--the trustees made an \n``excess general revenue Medicare funding'' determination. Two \nconsecutive ``excess general revenue Medicare funding'' determinations \ntrigger a ``Medicare funding warning.'' This Medicare warning requires \nthat the President submit a legislative proposal to address this crisis \nwithin 15 days of his next budget. So for 5 years in a row there has \nbeen a Medicare funding warning issued. President Bush submitted a \nproposal when he was President to deal with the shortfall in Medicare, \nbut the Democratic majority in both Houses at the time failed to act on \nit, or do anything about the crisis. But now we have gone further and \ndeeper into debt and the trustees issued a Medicare funding warning for \nthe fifth consecutive time in their report this year, 2007 through \n2011. But President Obama is not responding.\n\n[[Page S3758]]\n\n  So who cares about Medicare? I think all of us do. But does anyone \ndispute that the trustees, the people who are statutorily required by \nlaw to superintend this fund, don't care about it, aren't worried about \nthe recipients? They have a lawful obligation to try to ensure that the \nprogram is on a sound basis.\n  Under the Medicare prescription drug bill that was passed here, \nPublic Law 108-173, Congress established the Medicare ``trigger'' to \ncall attention to the program's growing fiscal imbalance. If, in their \nreport, the Medicare trustees project that Medicare will draw more than \n45 percent of its funding out of the Treasury's general fund within a \n7-year period, the trustees must make an excess general revenue \nMedicare funding determination. By law, two consecutive excess general \nrevenue Medicare funding determinations produce a Medicare funding \nwarning, triggering action by the President. Under the public law, U.S. \nCode, the President is required to submit legislation--submit \nlegislation to whom? To the Congress, us--in response to a funding \nwarning within 15 days of the next budget, and the proposal would then \nreceive expedited consideration in Congress.\n  So when we have this 45-percent level breached, the President is \nsupposed to submit to us a plan, and we are supposed to give it \nexpedited attention. Why? Because Medicare is important. That is why. \nAnd when it is not on a sound financial basis, Congress has a \nresponsibility to do something about it--not do nothing, not criticize \nsomebody such as Congressman Ryan who proposed a sound, well-thought-\nout, long-term approach to Medicare. It may not be the one I would \nagree with or other Members would agree with, but no one can doubt, in \nmy opinion, that it was a serious, thoughtful effort that would have \nput Medicare on a sound footing. But if it is not the plan we want, \nlet's have another.\n  What is the President's plan? That is the one that is required by \nlaw. The President is required to submit a plan. While a Medicare \nfunding warning has been issued each year since he has taken office, \nPresident Obama has failed to submit a single proposal to Congress in \nresponse to these warnings.\n  So today I joined with Congressman Paul Ryan, the young chairman of \nthe House Budget Committee to write a letter to the President. Nobody \nhas worked harder. Nobody is smarter. Nobody loves this country more. \nNobody is prepared to stand before the American people and explain what \nhe thinks is best for the country and be prepared to defend it with \nfacts, with integrity, and with responsibility. What a refreshing face \nhe is. I have come to have the greatest admiration for him.\n  So what happened to Congressman Ryan? He helped write a budget, and \nin part of the budget, after 10 years, he proposed some changes to \nMedicare that would put it on a sound footing over the long term. When \nit came over to the Senate it was attacked by Democrats--but where is \nthe Senate budget? The House has produced a budget. It reduces spending \nin the short run. It had a responsible approach to dealing with some of \nthe long-term entitlement issues that threaten us in the long term.\n  It was a sound program the Congressman had, and I thought--but we \ncould disagree. So we are looking forward to what would happen over \nhere. Well, the majority leader said: We think it is foolish to have a \nbudget. We are not having a budget. Do not let the Budget Committee \ncommence its hearings. We have not even begun a markup in Budget \nCommittee. We do not have a budget. So instead we are having secret \ntalks. In a committee, you have to stand up before the world, offer \namendments, debate the issues, express your views. You cannot hide. It \nis on the record; they take down your words. But secret meetings with \nthe White House are off the record, and talk occurs behind closed \ndoors. So I do not know what is going to happen out of this. I am \nnervous about it, frankly. I would rather do it by the regular order. \nMaybe something good will come out of it. I am not going to prejudge \nit. If it is good, I am going to celebrate. If it is not good, I am \ngoing to oppose it.\n  We wrote to the President today, and we called on him to show some \nleadership. We noted that the trustees have projected general revenues \nwould account for more than 45 percent of Medicare spending for the \nsixth consecutive year. The Trustees have issued another funding \nwarning that requires the President to submit a legislative proposal to \nCongress. He knew this was coming. The numbers have been there for \nseveral years. They knew it was coming. He is supposed to submit a \nlegislative proposal to get Medicare on the right track. Does he plan \nto raise taxes? Cut benefits? Ration care? Or is he going to create a \nmore competitive system that does the job with a little less money. \nWhat are you going to do? What is your answer? We wrote: As chairman \nand ranking member of the House and the Senate committees, \nrespectively, we are deeply disappointed that the administration \ncontinues to ignore this legal obligation. In 2008, the previous \nadministration submitted a proposal to Congress that took steps to \naddress Medicare's fiscal imbalance. By contrast, your administration \nhas not provided a response to the annual Medicare trigger, ignoring \nthe law in each of the past 3 years. This year, your budget did not \neven acknowledge the existence of the Medicare funding warning.\n  I have the Medicare trustees report right here. Far from saying no \nchanges are necessary in Medicare, the trustees have pleaded with us in \ntheir reports. The trustees' chief actuary has noted that in his \nofficial reports to us. He says: Do something.\n  This cannot continue. So here we are. We are going down the road with \ndebt the likes of which this Nation has never seen before. At the end \nof last fiscal year, the gross debt of our country was 93 percent of \nGDP. By the end of this fiscal year it will be over 100 percent of GDP. \nI mentioned when you get to that level of debt, your growth goes down, \nand lower growth means a loss of jobs, and that you are not creating \nthe jobs you should have.\n  How serious is our debt situation? Well, look at the chart for those \naround the world. Greece in this critical crisis is above 100 percent. \nThey are at 142 percent. Their debt equals 142 percent of their \neconomy, and they are in a state of virtual collapse. Expert after \nexpert says they will default on their debt. They are not going to be \nable to work their way out of it. I hope that is not true, but that is \nwhat they are saying.\n  What about Ireland? You have heard Ireland. The ``PIGS'' as they call \nthem, these countries and others in debt, what is theirs? It is now 96 \npercent, 2 or 3 percent higher than ours--only. They are second in the \nEuropean Union. We are next at 93. Portugal is next. You have heard \nabout Portugal being in financial trouble. Their debt to GDP is 83 \npercent. Spain, you have heard them talked about as being in trouble \nfinancially. Their debt to GDP--gross debt is 60 percent. So we are \nwell above that. I am worried about the country. What is critical is we \nneed a budget that contains spending now. We need to demonstrate a \ncommitment to reform the unsustainable path of entitlement spending, \nand we need to do it in a way that focuses on creating economic growth \nand jobs in this country.\n  Growth and jobs, that is what our future should be focused on. I am \nconfident this country has not seen its best days, but we are on a path \nof decline now. I truly believe it. I hate to say it. But our policies, \nif they are not changed, will lead inevitably to economic decline as \nwitness after witness has told us in testimony.\n  How do we get out of it? We send a message through ourselves and the \nworld: We have got the message. We are reducing spending. We are \nputting ourselves on a path to a balanced budget. We also know that it \nis not just the short term, it is long term. Many of these \nunsustainable programs need to be changed and strengthened, and the way \nto do that is to make the changes now, and you will have massive \nimpacts in the years to come. Modest changes now will be good.\n  Those are the things that I think are important. Those are the things \nI think should be talked about. Those are the things I think my good \nfriend Mr. Reid apparently thinks are not important. Because he said--\nhe has come down here and talked for hours, and he keeps talking about \nthings that have no bearing on what I think is important for our \ncountry today.\n  I submit to my colleagues and to the American people, are the things \nI am talking about important, or are they\n\n[[Page S3759]]\n\nnot? He wanted to talk about how the Republicans have put forth a plan \nthat he says will destroy Medicare. That is what the majority leader \nwants to talk about. He wants to change the subject. Well, I wish it \nwere not so. I wish Medicare were healthy. I wish it had the money to \ncontinue to honor the commitments we have made in the years to come. \nBut it does not. It is just does not. We do not have the money to \ncontinue at this rate. It is not impossible, though, to fix it and it \nis even more possible to fix Social Security. Medicare is a little \nharder than Social Security. But both of these can be fixed and made \npermanent and sound. We need to talk to the Medicare trustees. We need \nto be honest with one another and see how we can make those plans \nsolvent.\n  But that is just one part of the problem. In the immediate time, we \nhave got to reduce discretionary spending, across the board. I think we \nhave to. I wish that were not so, but it is. Countries around the world \nare doing it. Cities are doing it. Governors are doing it. This \nCongress has done nothing of the sort. Indeed, as I mentioned, last \nyear--the last 2 years--discretionary spending--nondefense--has gone up \n24 percent. Defense went up. We hear a lot of complaints about defense. \nIt was up 2 or 3 percent a year for the last 2 years. Other nondefense \nwent up 24 percent.\n  I cannot tell you how deeply I believe our Nation is on a perilous \ncourse that needs to change. I want to say again, I have great \naffection for my friend Senator Reid. He has got a tough job. But he \nasked for it. He asked for it. And when the country is in financial \ncrisis, we expect the majority leader of the Senate to effectively \nlead, and not to attack people who are trying to do the right thing, \nand to bring this country onto a sound path.\n  To say it is foolish to have a budget, what he meant was, it is \nfoolish politically, of course. He was saying it is foolish politically \nto have a budget. It is not foolish for America to have a budget. It is \nfoolish for America not to have one. Certainly it is not foolish to \nattempt to have a budget.\n  I feel that we, in this Congress, have not quite assimilated the \nseverity of the situation in which we find ourselves. We remain in \ndenial about how seriously we are being impacted and what substantial \nchanges are going to be necessary. We are going to have to do like the \nBrits who are turning their country around. We might have to do as they \ndid in Estonia. Talk to the Estonian people. The cabinet members took a \n40-percent pay cut. I wonder what would happen around here if we talked \nabout taking a 40-percent pay cut? But their debt to GDP is 7 percent, \nnot 93. They intend to keep it that way. And their growth is coming \nback already. They are showing about 6-percent growth. Our growth is \n1.8 percent in the first quarter. Coming out of a recession, it should \nbe higher.\n  If we do the right thing, we get this country on the right path, we \nreduce our spending, we watch every dollar we spend, and we make our \ncountry more productive, we eliminate unnecessary regulation, we focus \non creating jobs and growth, the natural capabilities, work ethic, \nintegrity, the legal system of America will allow us to continue to be \nthe most prosperous Nation in the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter I \nreferred to earlier to the President.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 14, 2011.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     President, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Our country faces extraordinary \n     economic challenges: a soaring budget deficit, a jobs \n     deficit, and a leadership deficit in Washington that has \n     resulted in our failure to confront a looming debt crisis. \n     These fiscal problems are driven in large part by the \n     unsustainable growth in health care entitlement programs and \n     an inability to credibly face our budget challenges that \n     severely undermines confidence in our economy. The failure of \n     politicians to put forward real solutions that will save and \n     strengthen these critical programs is threatening the \n     economic security of American families and the health \n     security of America's seniors. Just last month, we learned \n     that Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will become \n     insolvent by 2024, only 13 years from now.\n       On May 13, 2011, the Medicare Trustees not only warned us \n     that Medicare's insolvency date had advanced five years since \n     last year's report but also confirmed that the program is now \n     running a $32 billion cash-flow deficit. To pay current \n     benefits, the program is redeeming tens of billions of \n     dollars in treasury debt instruments and dramatically \n     contributing to our nation's surging publicly held debt. More \n     troubling is that, in total, Medicare faces $36.8 trillion \n     dollars in unfunded obligations over the next 75 years, \n     according to Medicare's non-partisan Chief Actuary.\n       For the sixth consecutive year, the Trustees have projected \n     that general revenues will account for more than 45 percent \n     of all of Medicare's outlays. When Medicare breaches this \n     limit, section 802 of P.L. 108-173, the Medicare Prescription \n     Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), \n     requires the President to submit a legislative proposal to \n     Congress to respond to the warning within 15 days of the next \n     budget. Yet again, the Medicare Trustees have issued a \n     funding warning that requires action by your administration. \n     In fact, the Trustees have urged action ``sooner rather than \n     later'' in order to ``minimize adverse impacts on vulnerable \n     populations.''\n       As Chairman and Ranking Member of the House and Senate \n     Budget Committees, respectively, we are deeply disappointed \n     that your administration continues to ignore this legal \n     obligation. In 2008, the previous administration submitted a \n     proposal to Congress that took steps to address Medicare's \n     fiscal imbalance. By contrast, your administration has not \n     provided a response to the annual Medicare trigger, ignoring \n     the law in each of the past three years. This year your \n     budget did not even acknowledge the existence of the Medicare \n     funding warning.\n       The country deserves honest leadership on this critical \n     issue. The Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 budget that you submitted to \n     Congress this year showed a lack of seriousness about the \n     major fiscal challenges before the nation. And, although you \n     abandoned this budget in a subsequent speech, your \n     administration still has not formally submitted a revised \n     FY2012 budget to Congress. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have \n     not passed a budget in 776 days, disregarding legal statute \n     and further eroding the integrity of the federal budget \n     process. Now more than ever is the time to fulfill our \n     obligations under the law rather than skirt them, and we \n     would respectfully suggest that this mandate extends to the \n     Medicare warnings issued each year that you have been in \n     office.\n       Under the budget you submitted to Congress, Medicare as we \n     know it will soon be unable to meet its promises to current \n     beneficiaries. Rather than impose cuts on current \n     beneficiaries and leave Medicare bankrupt for future \n     generations, the House-passed FY2012 budget resolution \n     outlines reforms to preserve and protect Medicare for those \n     in or near retirement while saving and strengthening the \n     program for future generations. Given the severity of this \n     problem and your legal obligations, the nation needs \n     leadership on this issue. Therefore, we reasonably expect \n     your administration to submit a detailed legislative proposal \n     to Congress addressing the Medicare funding warning as \n     required by law.\n       We look forward to receiving a proposal from you that \n     responds to the Medicare warning and to working with you to \n     strengthen the health and economic security of those we have \n     the honor to serve.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul Ryan,\n       Member of Congress, Chairman, House Budget Committee.\n     Jeff Sessions,\n       U.S. Senator, Ranking Member, Senate Budget Committee.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCoats, who is on the floor, and I be allowed up to 15 minutes to pursue \na discussion about tax reform as if in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3759-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3759-S3761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX REFORM\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, Senator Coats and I have introduced \nbipartisan tax reform legislation. It is the first comprehensive \noverhaul of tax reform law in 25 years, since 1986, when then-President \nReagan and Democrats got together and worked on a bipartisan reform \nthat cleaned out scores of special interest tax breaks in order to hold \ndown rates for all Americans and keep progressivity.\n  Senator Coats and I have worked also with Senator Gregg. I had that \ngood fortune for a number of years, and\n\n[[Page S3760]]\n\nhave picked up on some of what was done in 1986 by President Reagan and \na large group of Democrats. He and I intend, in the days ahead, to come \nto the floor of the Senate and talk about some of the most offensive \naspects of our totally dysfunctional tax system.\n  Today, we thought we would begin by discussing the alternative \nminimum tax. It seems to be pretty much the poster child for what is \nbroken about the American tax system. It was enacted in 1969, after the \nCongress learned that 3 years earlier 155 wealthy taxpayers had paid no \ntax at all. The alternative minimum tax was designed to hit what \namounted to a small group of tax evaders and not the millions of \nmiddle-class taxpayers who get shellacked by the AMT every single \nspringtime. The problem has been that Congress has never indexed the \nAMT brackets for inflation.\n  While the regular tax bracket standard deductions and exemptions do \nget adjusted for inflation, the brackets and exemptions of the \nalternative minimum tax do not. As a result, millions of middle-class \ntaxpayers, whose only fault is their incomes grew with the economy, now \nslip into this nefarious alternative minimum tax zone each year.\n  I would be interested, for purposes of starting this colloquy, to get \nthe reaction of my friend and partner on it. We are going to bring up a \nnumber of these aspects of the tax system that cry out for overall \nreform. But I wonder what my friend's sense is about starting today \nwith the alternative minimum tax, and how important it is that reform \nis done there for middle-class folks in Indiana and around the country.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I want to thank my colleague from Oregon, \nSenator Wyden, for working with me, and particularly working with \nSenator Gregg who is now retired from this Chamber. They spent an \nextraordinary amount of time, very productive but very time consuming, \ntrying to put together a comprehensive tax reform, which, as Senator \nWyden has said, has been 25 years since we have tackled the Tax Code to \ntry to simplify it and try to take out egregious provisions that were \nput in it over the years that may benefit a special few but don't begin \nto address the average middle-income taxpayer who is bearing a very \nsubstantial burden of taxes paid in this country.\n  Probably the most egregious provision and, as Senator Wyden said, the \nposter child for the current dysfunction of the Tax Code and our tax \nsystem is the alternative minimum tax.\n  Senator Wyden and Senator Gregg's program that they put together--and \nSenator Gregg urged me as I was coming into the Senate and he was \nleaving to work with Senator Wyden in terms of working to keep this \nbipartisan effort going forward, and I have had the pleasure of doing \nso. We do have a comprehensive bill that we wish to debate and share \nwith our colleagues. But we also want to point out the reason why tax \nreform is so necessary.\n  A Tax Code that now comprises more than 70,000 pages with more than \n10,000 special exemptions and preferences is certainly something that \nis way beyond our Founders' intention or any intention of taxation of \nthe American people. This complexity is literally driving everybody \nnuts, including the tax accountants and CPAs and those who have to deal \nwith it every year but, more importantly, the tax filers, American \ncitizens, who each year start getting the sweats along about mid-March \nin terms of how they are going to get their tax return done. If they \ntry to do it themselves, they ought to be able to; and, if passed, \nWyden-Coats would give them the simplicity of reduced rates, easy \nfiling for information, and the ability to do their taxes at home.\n  We spend an extraordinary amount of money--I think it is Americans \nspend nearly 6 billion hours a year--to have tax preparers do their tax \nreturns. The alternative minimum tax is particularly egregious, as \nSenator Wyden has said. It is grossly unfair. It hammers working \nAmericans.\n  The temporary fix Congress has added in subsequent years from its \ninitiation now protects individuals with incomes up to $48,000-plus and \ncouples up to $74,000-plus. But taxpayers who earn more than that get \nwhacked by the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, and the problem just \ngets worse.\n  As Senator Wyden has said, it started with a few taxpayers in the \nhigh income brackets trying to evade paying any tax. That is how that \ncame into play. But in 1997, several years later from the initiation, \nthe AMT has hit 1 percent of all taxpayers. Next year, after this \ncurrent fix expires, it will hurt more than 20 percent of taxpayers. To \nbe exact, that is 34 million hard-working Americans. It is a poor fix \nthat is currently in place on a temporary basis.\n  In my State of Indiana, 42,700 taxpayers had to pay AMT taxes in \n2008, and without another extension of the patch or the fix, that will \nrise to 372,000 in 2012.\n  If you are a family with a number of children and you live in a high \ntax State or a local tax State, you are thrown into the alternative \nminimum tax computation. That means a double process by which you or \nyour preparer has to file your taxes, and it means higher taxes never \nintended to hit the working class.\n  So in continuing this, I wish to reaffirm my thanks to the Senator \nfrom Oregon for allowing me to be part of this effort, and we look \nforward to many opportunities to discuss some of the more egregious \nportions of the Tax Code and reasons why we need to continue to work \nfor comprehensive reform.\n  I would ask my colleague if he would delve a little more deeply into \nthis in this colloquy we currently are entertaining.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I hope that folks paying attention to \nthis tax reform debate pick up on what Senator Coats has just \ndescribed. When the alternative minimum tax was first debated, the \ncountry was talking about 155 people. These were the so-called wealthy \nfolks. They were paying no taxes at all. What Senator Coats has just \ndescribed is, next year, what started as a program to try to make sure \nthat 155 people didn't end up getting a sweetheart deal, now we are \ngoing to see 34 million people crushed by this inequitable kind of tax, \na kind of bureaucratic water torture.\n  We have about the same numbers in Oregon that Senator Coats has in \nIndiana. In 2008, 44,000 Oregon taxpayers had to pay the alternative \nminimum tax. Without some kind of extension or, as Senator Coats and I \nessentially want to do, abolishment of the alternative minimum tax, \nthat is going to rise to close to 400,000 next year. The people who are \ngetting hammered by this alternative minimum tax certainly don't fit \nthat small class of the so-called freeloading wealthy folks who are \nfiguring out ways to pay nothing.\n  For example, a woman earns $65,000 in 2010, say she manages a health \nclub, she has three kids, she has to file her taxes independent of her \nhusband because they are in the middle of a divorce. As someone who is \nmarried, filing separately, she would have been hit by the AMT in 2010, \naccording to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. \nThink about that, a woman who manages a health club making $65,000, \nwith three kids, filling out her taxes and going through the \nunbelievable headaches, being singled out under the alternative minimum \ntax.\n  I ask my friend from Indiana--and I am sure he has very similar \npeople in Indiana--is that the kind of person the alternative minimum \ntax was designed to scoop up back in 1969?\n  Mr. COATS. Absolutely not, I would say to the Senator from Oregon. \nClearly, if you go back to the origin of the alternative minimum tax, \nit was designed to go after those handful, in comparison to the total \nnumber of taxpayers in this country, who have found creative ways of \nnot paying any taxes whatsoever. Wealthy taxpayers have simply been \nable to manipulate the Tax Code legally but in a way that allowed them \nto avoid paying taxes altogether. That is how all of this started.\n  What has happened is that we are now in a situation where it is \ngrossly unfair to the majority of taxpayers in this country simply \nbecause they fall into categories that throw them into having the AMT \ncalculated in their tax returns. It is costing them a lot of money. It \nwas never intended to address the middle-class taxpayer, and it has \ngrown exponentially since it started.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Would the Senator agree that the difficulty of projecting \nthe AMT tax liability makes it tough\n\n[[Page S3761]]\n\nfor taxpayers to compute their estimated tax payments and creates a \nsituation in which, just because of its complexity, they can get hit \nwith penalties?\n  I think the reason Oregonians are concerned about this--we have heard \nabout it in the Senate Finance Committee--is that the AMT is \nessentially a separate tax system with its own tax rates and deduction \nrules which are less generous than regular rates and regular rules. \nThis contributes to the tax-filing nightmare. The only way you can tell \nif you owe the alternative minimum tax is by filling out the forms or \nby being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. If it turns out you \nshould have paid the alternative minimum tax and didn't, you owe back \ntaxes plus any penalties or interests the IRS wants to dole out.\n  My question is, I ask my good friend, how in the world is a typical \ntaxpayer going to be able to make sense out of something like that \nwhich lots of accountants tell me they cannot even sort through?\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator from Oregon is exactly right. I took three tax \ncourses in law school. I cannot do my taxes with any assurance that I \nam doing it right because this code has become so incredibly \ncomplicated. The alternative minimum tax adds an additional set of \ncalculations that make it even more complicated.\n  Today, 80 percent of the tax filers have to get help to file their \ntaxes, 20 percent of those buy software and hook it into their computer \nand try to work through it that way, and 60 percent take it to a \nprofessional. If you are not working as a professional in a career as a \nCPA or a tax return specialist, you cannot keep up with the 70,000 \npages and 10,000-plus exemptions and the complexity of filing a return. \nIt should not in any sense of the matter be a tax collection system \nthat requires 80 percent of our taxpayers to have to seek professional \nhelp at a significant cost. As I think I indicated earlier, $6 billion \na year is spent on transferring money from the person paying the taxes \nto someone just to prepare their returns.\n  Small businesses face a similar problem. Small businesses do not have \nthe big back room with the hired accountants and others to handle all \nthe paperwork. Small business men and women have to be out front \nselling the product and have to be talking to the customer. Yet they \nnow also are caught up in this web of complexity in terms of how to \nfile their taxes, and they are having to expend time and money on \ngetting their tax returns filed and making sure they are filed right.\n  Over time, as the deficit and debt problem has increased \nsignificantly, Members have been all the more reluctant to eliminate \nthis on a single stand-alone basis because of the impact it would have \non our ballooning deficit. But on comprehensive tax reform, if we can \nput this together with a package of comprehensive reforms, we can do it \nin a revenue-neutral basis so it does not have an adverse impact on the \neconomy.\n  Again, I commend Senator Wyden and Senator Gregg for putting together \na package that does just that, and I ask my colleague if he wants to \nelaborate on that a little bit. I thank him for the opportunity to come \ndown to discuss for the first if not the last time some of the \negregious aspects of the Tax Code in this country that I think will \ndictate how we should move forward and why we should move forward in \nenacting comprehensive tax reform.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The distinguished majority leader is here. I think we are \nabout to wrap up. I am certainly happy to yield to him if he needs a \nfew minutes to do the business of the Senate, and then Senator Coats \nand I will wrap up.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that the hour of 5 \no'clock has arrived.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, just to wrap up, Senator Coats and I are \ngoing to come to the floor in the weeks ahead to outline some of the \nmost outlandish examples of how broken our tax system is. We thought it \nwas appropriate to start with the alternative minimum tax because it \nreally is the poster child for how out of whack the American tax system \nhas become. I think we have highlighted a number of our big concerns, \nbut I want Senators to pick up on the last point Senator Coats made, \nand that is that the country cannot afford the status quo.\n  The idea that you would just go out and pass what is called a patch, \na kind of bandaid to try to make sure some of the pain is minimized for \nmiddle-class folks--the most recent patch for just 2 years cost $135 \nbillion. The 10-year cost to make the current patch permanent is $683 \nbillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A patch does not \nprotect everybody; it just limits the damage.\n  What we want to say as we start this debate about how to go forward \nwith tax reform is that the Congress cannot continue to handle the AMT \nwith a patch. The country cannot afford it. Patching the AMT costs way \ntoo much, especially given the discussions we are having here, \nbipartisan discussions about how to deal with the Federal debt.\n  The only affordable way to fix the alternative minimum tax, as \nSenator Coats has outlined this afternoon, is to fix it once and for \nall and do it within the context of comprehensive tax reform; to pick \nit up, as was done in the 1980s when a Republican President got \ntogether with Democratic Members of Congress and cleaned out special \ninterest loopholes to hold down rates for everybody and give all \nAmericans the opportunity to get ahead while still having a progressive \ntax system.\n  We would repeal the alternative minimum tax once and for all and do \nit in a way that does not add to the Federal deficit. This is not \nSenator Coats and I plucking a figure out of the sky. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has analyzed our bill, and under their analysis, \nSenator Coats and I eliminate the alternative minimum tax without \nadding to the Federal deficit. In my view, that is a pretty good way to \nstart tax reform, start it in a bipartisan way and particularly by \nfocusing on something that is so inequitable to hard-working middle-\nclass people.\n  I thank my good friend from Indiana. I am prepared to yield the floor \nif my colleague has anything else he wants to say. I want to express my \nappreciation for the chance to work with him. We cannot deal with these \nbig economic issues, the big economic challenges our country faces \nwithout going forward in a bipartisan way. I am very fortunate to have \nsuch an able partner. I thank him.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3761-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3761-S3763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SECRETARY OF COMMERCE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come today to visit on the floor of \nthe Senate because since last November the President has been trying to \nconvince the American people that he has a plan to restart our economy. \nHe was in North Carolina yesterday with his council to talk about \nissues. To me, the President's approach has left a lot to be desired. \nIf the White House created as many jobs as it creates speeches, things \nwould be a lot better. The President's empty words are not filling the \npockets of American citizens.\n  The President has been given a new chance to show his commitment to \neconomic growth, and that is the chance\n\n[[Page S3762]]\n\nhe has recently had to nominate a Secretary of Commerce for the United \nStates.\n  When I think about the Commerce Department, it is a department with a \njob, in terms of American businesses, to make those businesses more \ninnovative at home and more competitive overseas. Well, the mission of \nthe Commerce Department states that it ``promotes job creation, \neconomic growth, sustainable development and improved standards of \nliving for all Americans.'' So at a time of economic crisis such as the \none we have now, a nominee who can fulfill that mission, that very \nmission--of promoting job creation, economic growth, sustainable \ndevelopment, and improved standards of living for all Americans, that \nvery mission--is needed more than ever.\n  Despite the administration's promise that their so-called stimulus \nbill would keep unemployment rates below 8 percent, we know \nunemployment went to 10 percent. It is still over 9 percent, and our \njob growth last month was the slowest it has been in almost a year. \nOver 13 million Americans are still out of work, and nearly half of \nthem have been unemployed for 6 months or more. This is the highest \nrate of chronic unemployment we have had since the Great Depression.\n  These problems aren't just happening at home. America's position on \nthe international stage is slipping as well. America's ability to pay \nits debts has already been called into question by Standard & Poor's \ncredit ratings. Moody's is asking the same questions. Recently, Fitch \ncredit ratings also warned us that the United States was playing with \nfire. Gas prices are very high. I hear it every weekend at home in \nWyoming. Families are spending $800 on average more for gasoline this \nyear than last year. We spend $48 million more on goods from other \ncountries than we do on our own goods, and our economic situation is \nalready bad.\n  The headlines sound worse every day. Let me give a couple of \nexamples. From Gallup: ``U.S. Investor Optimism Declines.''\n  From Reuters: ``Wall Street ends down as jobs data disappoints.''\n  From Bloomberg: ``Economic Recovery Is Languishing as Americans Await \nSignal of Better Times.''\n  Even the Chairman of the Federal Reserve said the job market was \n``far from normal.''\n  The facts are clear. Americans deserve the best leadership in the \nCommerce Department--the Department that is responsible for trade, job \ncreation, and economic growth.\n  Last week, the President nominated John Bryson to be his new Commerce \nSecretary. Many may ask, who is this man? Is he a job promoter, someone \nwho can bring economic growth and improve the standard of living for \nall Americans? Well, John Bryson's record clearly shows he is not such \na nominee. In fact, his resume is exhibit No. 1 in proving that this \nadministration is not serious about job growth. At best, it is unclear \nwhy John Bryson is the President's nominee for this position. At worst, \nhis nomination is proof the President wants environmental activists \nrunning our economic development strategy.\n  When announcing Mr. Bryson's nomination, the President praised Mr. \nBryson's background. According to the President, Mr. Bryson would be a \ngood Commerce Secretary because ``he's been a fierce proponent of \nalternative energy.'' Well, if Mr. Bryson was being nominated to be \nEnergy Secretary or the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency or even Interior Secretary, that fact might be relevant. But Mr. \nBryson is being nominated to be Secretary of Commerce.\n  Mr. Bryson does have a background in the private sector. The problem \nis, his private sector success has more to do with government help than \nwith his own ability to create jobs or grow the economy.\n  Don't take my word for it. The Wall Street Journal already has \nwritten that Mr. Bryson believes ``wholeheartedly in a strategy of \npoliticized investment.'' They also wrote that the companies he has \nbeen associated with have generated revenue through handouts from the \nFederal Government rather than by being profitable.\n  We need a Commerce Secretary who knows how businesses turn a profit \nand how to create private sector jobs. We need a Commerce Secretary who \nwill make it easier and cheaper for the private sector to create jobs, \nnot someone who will make it harder and more expensive for the private \nsector to create jobs. We need a Commerce Secretary who can understand \nall sectors of the economy rather than someone who picks winners and \nlosers.\n  Already, to me, Mr. Bryson fails the test. His support for \npoliticizing U.S. investments is the least problematic element of his \nresume. Along with his private sector experience, he is also the \nfounder of a group called the Natural Resources Defense Council, or the \nNRDC. This organization is so radically antibusiness that even \nMassachusetts Democrat Congressmen Barney Frank and John Tierney think \nit is troubling that Mr. Bryson is associated with it.\n  These Members of Congress have described the NRDC as ``one of those \nenvironmental organizations that has reflexively attacked the fishing \nindustry inaccurately and without any real environmental basis.''\n  It is not just the fishing industry the NRDC reflexively attacks. \nMembers of the NRDC staff are on record saying: ``There is no such \nthing as clean coal.''\n  But while gas prices soar and energy jobs are needed, a spokesman for \nthe NRDC has said:\n\n       NRDC has been very active and proud to be active in \n     fighting new coal plant proposals in the United States.\n\n  They have also stood in the way of lifesaving sonar technology that \nwould enhance America's national security. Why? Well, out of fear that \nit might harm the whales.\n  They have also filed thousands of lawsuits to stop the production of \nAmerican energy, and American energy is critical and a part of our \nAmerican national security. This anti-energy agenda is so reflexive \nthat the NRDC has even filed lawsuits to further delay future energy \nexploration in the Gulf of Mexico. Well, the delay has already \nstretched on so long that even former President Bill Clinton has called \nit ``ridiculous.''\n  John Bryson's career has consistently shown that he agrees with this \noverzealous approach to environmental policy. When Mr. Bryson first \nstarted at Edison Electric, the Los Angeles Times said he had founded \n``one of the Nation's most aggressive environmental organizations.''\n  When it comes to being antibusiness, an unpopular policy such as cap \nand trade is one area where he is focused. He is one of its most \naggressive supporters, and the record shows it. More importantly, his \nown words show it. Most Americans recognize cap and trade as a job-\nkilling energy tax. That is why the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill \ncouldn't pass the Senate. However, when referring to this very bill, \nJohn Bryson called it ``moderate but acceptable.'' He called it a \nmoderate but acceptable piece of legislation. He even said the \nlegislation was good precisely because it was a good way to hide a \ncarbon tax--to hide a tax.\n  Mr. Bryson has repeatedly called for a national cap-and-trade system, \nand he has even put his money where his mouth is. But when someone says \n``a good way to hide a tax,'' is that what the role of the Secretary of \nCommerce is, to hide a tax on American businesses to make them less \ncompetitive, to make it more expensive to do business? I think not.\n  According to the Daily Caller, Mr. Bryson's own company spent over $1 \nmillion lobbying for cap and trade.\n  So John Bryson believes in politicizing American investment. He has \nfounded a radical environmental organization and has spent significant \namounts of money lobbying for a policy that he openly acknowledges is a \ncover for a job-killing energy tax.\n  We need a Commerce Secretary. We need a Commerce Secretary who will \nwork at making American businesses more innovative at home and more \ncompetitive abroad. We do not need a Commerce Secretary who is more \ninterested in taking our hard-earned dollars than in creating jobs at \nhome. The American people deserve a Commerce Secretary who is more \ninterested in free trade than in cap and trade.\n  The President may believe John Bryson is the right man at the right \ntime. I believe John Bryson is the wrong man at the worst possible \ntime.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3763]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3763-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3763-S3765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JOBS IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, rarely has Washington been so completely \nout of touch with the priorities and anxieties of ordinary working \nAmericans. Here on Capitol Hill, policymakers are obsessed--obsessed--\nwith the budget deficit. But the rest of America is most concerned with \na far more urgent deficit--the jobs deficit.\n  Our Nation remains deeply mired in the most protracted period of \njoblessness since the Great Depression. Officially, some 14 million \nAmericans are out of work. But real unemployment--the real \nunemployment, including those who are working part time but want to be \nworking full time; those who are marginally attached; those who have \nnever worked in the first place because they never got a job--if we add \nthat all up, we have closer to 25 million Americans unemployed, and \nmillions of Americans who are employed are increasingly anxious about \nholding on to their jobs or, at their present income, making ends meet.\n  But many of our political leaders in Washington are treating the jobs \ncrisis as yesterday's news. They are putting this deficit reduction \nabove all else. They are demanding extraordinary funding cuts--\ntrillions of dollars in cuts, and the sooner the better, with little \nconcern as to its adverse impact on jobs. But this is exactly the wrong \napproach. It is the economic equivalent of applying leaches and \ndraining blood from a sick patient, which we used to do, by the way. \nThat is what they did to George Washington as he lay dying. They \napplied leaches to him. What does that do? It just makes us weaker, and \nin the case of President Washington proved fatal.\n  In the same way, trillions in budget cuts would massively drain \ndemand from a still weak economy. It could destroy millions of jobs. \nThis is not just the wrong medicine for our economy; it will slow or \nstop economic growth, and it will make deficits worse in the future.\n  As Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke warned last week:\n\n       A sharp fiscal consolidation focused on the very near term \n     could be self-defeating if it were to undercut the still \n     fragile economy.\n\n  I strongly disagree with the slash-and-burn approach to deficit \nreduction favored by some of our colleagues. We need to recognize one \nof the very big reasons for the budget deficit is the jobs deficit. The \nbest way to bring the budget under control is to help these 25 million \nAmericans who are unemployed get good-paying middle-class jobs. It is \nhard-working Americans who would be delighted to be taxpayers once \nagain.\n  Now, obviously, we are counting on the private sector to help drive \njob creation and make the economic recovery self-sustaining. It should \nbe the case if we put more money into infrastructure. If we were to do \nour job in rebuilding our roads and our bridges, our highways, our \nsewer and water systems, our rail systems--the government doesn't do \nthat; it goes to private contractors, private companies. Some of this \nis already happening but certainly not at the pace we need.\n  Since March of 2010, the private sector has created about 2 million \njobs. However, businesses remain reluctant to invest and hire for the \nsimple reason there is not sufficient demand for their goods and \nservices. All of those people who are unemployed and underemployed are \nspending the bare minimum just trying to get from week to week. \nMeanwhile, the middle class is tapped out with stagnant incomes--\nstagnant incomes. For over 30 years, the middle class has had stagnant \nreal incomes. They have insecure jobs, high levels of mortgage, \ninsufficient pension funds, and other consumer debt.\n  That is why the Federal Government has had to play an aggressive role \nin helping us to recover from this great recession. Over the last 2 \nyears, we have repeatedly cut taxes. We have extended financial aid to \nthe States. That helped prevent massive layoffs of teachers and first \nresponders and other essential employees.\n  We have made major investments in research, education, and \ninfrastructure. All of these have either preserved jobs or created new \njobs. Listen to this. We have gone from when President Obama took \noffice--we were losing 700,000 jobs a month--700,000 jobs a month. That \nis just a couple of years ago. Now we are adding new jobs for the first \ntime--and we have had 16 new consecutive months of adding jobs. Not \nenough. Not enough. But we are at least moving in the right direction.\n  The Economic Policy Institute estimates that as of the fourth quarter \nof 2010, the Recovery Act had created or saved up to 4 million jobs and \nas many as 5 million full-time equivalent jobs. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that through the end of 2010, the \nRecovery Act had raised the real inflation-adjusted gross domestic \nproduct by as much as 3.5 percent.\n  So to those who said the Recovery Act did not do anything, that is \nnonsense. That is absolute nonsense. It did a lot. But here is the \nproblem: The shot in the arm provided by the Recovery Act is now \nwinding down. In the absence of further Federal assistance, many States \nare making deep budget cuts and layoffs of public employees.\n  Listen to this. In Texas, Governor Perry has proposed to cut \neducation funding by a staggering $10 billion. New York City Mayor \nBloomberg has proposed laying off 6,000 teachers. Total State and local \ngovernment layoffs since August of 2008 have been nearly 500,000. If \nthe Federal Government follows suit with massive short-term spending \ncuts, the prospect of a double-dip recession will be all too real.\n  Last week the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published an article \nabout what it called the ``Mistake of 1937,'' referring to premature \nfiscal and monetary pullbacks that cut short the fragile recovery and \nended up prolonging the Great Depression.\n  Princeton economist Paul Krugman says that in important ways, we have \nalready repeated the mistake of 1937. We have taken our eyes off what \nshould be our No. 1 priority, creating jobs. We have pivoted since 6 \nmonths ago, since the last election, to an obsession with deep short-\nterm budget cuts, which by their very nature will destroy jobs and \nweaken the economy.\n  Everyone agrees we must take aggressive action to reduce the deficit. \nBut we have to do it right. We need to reduce long-term deficits but in \na way that absolutely minimizes immediate job losses. We need to reduce \nthe deficit in a balanced way.\n  Unfortunately, the extreme budget offered by Congressman Paul Ryan, \nsupported by almost every Republican in the House, and I would say also \nin the Senate, would make our fiscal and jobs problems far worse. That \nRepublican budget lavishes yet more tax cuts on corporations and the \nwealthy, as it slashes investments that undergird the middle class in \nthis country, everything from education funding to Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  Let me state what I think is obvious. If working people and the \nmiddle class are going to take a hit in tough times, it should not be \nto pay for tax breaks for the wealthy. If the middle class is going to \ntake a hit, let's use those taxes to put money into rebuilding the \ninfrastructure of this country, put it into better education, better \nschools, better teachers.\n  I have often said the key to renewing America and restoring our \neconomy is to revitalize the middle class. That means investing in \neducation, innovation, infrastructure, boosting American \ncompetitiveness in a highly competitive global marketplace. It means \nrestoring a level playing field with fair taxation--fair taxation.\n  It also means an empowered workforce, a strong ladder of opportunity \nto give every American access to the middle class. I believe that \ncorporations and the wealthy can return to the levels of taxation they \nhad in the 1990s when the economy boomed and incomes also skyrocketed.\n  It is absurd to take the position that any dollar in tax increases \nthat results from having the wealthy pay their fair share or ending tax \nloopholes is bad and unacceptable. I think it is absurd to take that \nposition, while at the same time you take the position that it is okay \nto slash funding for education, for infrastructure, for research.\n  In both the 1980s, under Ronald Reagan, and in the 1990s under \nClinton,\n\n[[Page S3764]]\n\nwe achieved a sensible balance of revenue increases plus domestic and \nPentagon spending cuts in order to dramatically reduce deficits while \nwe protected the middle class and we maintained safety net programs.\n  I agree with the economists who believe that given the fragile \neconomic recovery, we should not reduce fiscal support for job creation \nat this time. Deficit reduction efforts can start, but we should \nsequence the lion's share of spending cuts so that they take place in \nthe midterm and the long term when the economy is recovered. But now we \nhave to keep our priorities straight.\n  Deficit reduction, yes, is important, but it is not our most \nimportant economic challenge right now. Our most urgent economic \nchallenge is the fragile economy and the jobs crisis and the fact that \nthe middle class in America is under siege. The middle class, in fact, \nis being dismantled as fast as big corporations can ship our \nmanufacturing jobs overseas. People are losing their savings, their \nhealth care, their pensions, in many cases even their homes.\n  With good reason, people feel that they are losing the American dream \nfor themselves and their kids. That is why we cannot look at the \ndeficit reduction challenge in isolation. We cannot just take a \nDraconian slash-and-burn approach to the budget. Smart countries in \ntough economic times do not turn a chainsaw on themselves.\n  The extreme Republican budget is far more focused on shrinking the \nsize and role of government than it is on cutting the deficit. Instead \nof that budget, the Republican budget, which is being sold through fear \nand fatalism, we need a budget that reflects the hopes and the \naspirations of the American people. We need a budget that allows us to \ncontinue investments, that boosts competitiveness, creates jobs, and \nstrengthens the middle class. There can be no real economic recovery, \nthere can be no return to fiscal balance, without the recovery of the \nmiddle class in America. That is why our immediate No. 1 priority must \nbe helping to create jobs, putting people back to work. That is how we \nwill start to restore more demand for goods and services, the key to \nhealthy economic growth. Economic growth, in turn, will help generate \nthe revenues that will help bring deficits back into balance, into \nrough balance. So this is our most important job in front of us.\n  Yet all we hear is the constant drumbeat: Cut the size of government; \ncut spending; slash and burn and cut everything that supports the \nmiddle class in America; ship our jobs overseas; more tax breaks for \nthe wealthy and big corporations.\n  We need to be focused on rebuilding the infrastructure of America, \nbecause that is most necessary now. That is one of the fastest ways we \ncan put people back to work and start stimulating the economy. We need \nto put more money into education: rebuilding our schools across \nAmerica, hiring better teachers. We need a longer school day, and we \nneed a longer school year. I know some of the young people probably do \nnot want to hear that.\n  Most young people in Europe, Asia, Japan, do not go to school 9 \nmonths out of the year, they go to school 11 months out of the year. \nThey do not go to school for 5\\1/2\\ or 6 hours a day, they go for 8 \nhours a day. We wonder why they are getting ahead of us. But that costs \nmoney. If you are going to have a longer school year, that costs money. \nIf you are going to have longer schooldays, if you are going to have \nbetter technology in our schools, schools that have the latest in \ntechnology so our young people can learn on the latest innovations, so \nthey can be competitive in that global marketplace, that does cost \nmoney.\n  Yet to hear it around here, we cannot do anything. No, of course, now \nthere is one place we can spend money. We can continue our operations \nin Iraq for God knows how many more centuries. We have already spent \nover $1 trillion in Iraq. We have already spent close to $100 billion \nin Afghanistan. But we can continue to do that with no end in sight. We \ncan continue to buy more weapons that do not do anything to protect us \nin the new global fight against terrorism. They might have been good \nback in the Vietnam war, maybe in the Cold War. But that is over with. \nBut, no, we have got to keep pouring money into weapons systems that do \nnothing to protect the country.\n  Two decades ago, President Clinton's team defined our Nation's \ncentral challenge with a slogan--I remember it well--they said: ``It's \nthe economy, stupid.''\n  Well, today America's central challenge can be defined with more \nprecision. ``It's the middle class, stupid.'' It is what we do to \nencourage, promote, protect, invigorate the middle class in America, to \nmake sure the middle class has good jobs, good pensions, good health \ncare systems, the ability to make sure their kids are well educated, \nand that they do not go to college and get out with a mountain of debt \non their heads so that they too can have a good start in life. This is \nall part of the middle-class structure of America, as to what made \nAmerica the greatest country in the history of the world.\n  I will close. It seems that the Republican budget they have \nproffered, and so much that I hear of those who keep saying, we have \ngot to cut, cut, cut, we have got to cut spending, we have got to cut \neducation, we have got to cut infrastructure, we have got to cut all of \nthat stuff, it almost seems as though it is premised on the belief that \nwe are poor--our country is poor and our country is broke and we cannot \nafford to do all of those things. That is really what it is. They say \nwe are broke. We cannot afford to do all of that stuff, so we have got \nto cut our spending. Yet we are the richest Nation in the history of \nmankind. We are the richest country in the world. We have the highest \nper capita income of any major country. I guess you have to ask the \nquestion: If we are so rich, why are we so broke? If we are the richest \ncountry in the history of the world--we are the richest country in the \nworld today, we have the highest per capita income of any major \neconomy--why are we so broke?\n  Well, my response is, we are not broke and we are not poor. We are \nwealthy beyond all imagination as a nation. We are not broke. But the \nsystem is broken. That is what is broken. The system is broken, the \nsystem of who we tax and how we tax, how we raise revenues, the system \nof allowing corporations to tax benefits and ship jobs overseas, the \nsystem that allows companies to almost willy-nilly break up what has \nbeen one of the strengths of the middle class, that is, our labor \nunions. They are breaking up labor unions because they know the middle \nclass working together in organized labor has been able to bargain more \neffectively for better jobs and better wages, better conditions of \nemployment. You break them up and you can reduce their incomes, and \nmore of it can go to profits and to higher CEO salaries. That is the \nsystem that is broken.\n\n  You can cut all the spending you want. You can cut the Federal \nGovernment to the bare bones. It will lead to another great recession, \nmaybe even a depression. If you want to do that, that is a dead-end \nroad.\n  We need more stimulus now. Does that mean we have to borrow more \nmoney and go further into debt? Not necessarily. Why don't we fix this \nunfair tax system we have and generate more revenues to come into the \nFederal Government? Why don't we say to those who made so much money in \nthe last decade or so, maybe you ought to pay a little bit more, and \nfor big corporations, pay a little bit more, and for the Federal \nGovernment to put that money to use rebuilding the infrastructure and \neducating our youth and having a health care system that is affordable \nand comprehensive. That is what we ought to be doing. That will support \nthe middle class. In supporting the middle class, you will then support \neconomic recovery.\n  I will close. There will be no economic recovery in America of any \nsubstance or lasting any length of time without a recovery of the \nmiddle class, which is the backbone of our country. It is time our \npolitical leaders showed some backbone in supporting the middle class.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S3765]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3765-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              EDA FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, for over a week the Senate has been \ndebating the Economic Development and Revitalization Act of 2011, which \nwould reauthorize funding for existing programs of the Commerce \nDepartment's U.S. Economic Development Administration through 2015. EDA \nhas traditionally been noncontroversial, traditionally been a \nbipartisan job-creation bill supported by Presidents of both parties, \noften supported in this body without dissent. It helps broker deals \nbetween the public and private sectors, which is critical to our \neconomic recovery and growth. It is particularly important to \neconomically distressed communities, particularly in tough economic \ntimes.\n  Every $1 in EDA grant funding leverages nearly $7 worth of private \ninvestment. Every $10,000 in EDA investment in business incubators--or \naccelerators, as some call them--helps entrepreneurs start up companies \nin which nearly 70 jobs are created.\n  In Ohio--and I don't think it is much different in the Presiding \nOfficer's State of Colorado--we have seen since 2006 that some 40 EDA \ngrants worth $36 million have leveraged a total of more than $87 \nmillion since private resources were matched. Colleges and \nuniversities, from Bowling Green in northwest Ohio, to Ohio University \nin southeast Ohio, to Miami University in southwest Ohio, have received \nEDA funds. So, too, have port authorities in Toledo in the west and \nAshtabula in the far northeast and entrepreneurs in Cleveland and \nAppalachia.\n  If we are to strengthen our competitiveness, we will need to equip \nbusinesses with the tools they need to thrive. That is what EDA is \ndesigned to do. It is the front door for communities facing sudden and \nsevere economic distress. When economic disaster hits, communities turn \nto the government, and it is EDA that does the job at low cost, \nleveraging all kinds of private dollars.\n  EDA has helped redevelop the former GM plant in Moraine, OH, near \nDayton, and the DHL plant in Wilmington. Ashtabula's Plant C received \nEDA investments to make vital repairs.\n  The bill the Senate is considering would strengthen a proven job-\ncreating program. It would reduce regulatory burdens to increase \nflexibility for grantees. It would encourage public-private \npartnerships that we have already seen make a difference in my State. \nAnd the bill would better streamline EDA cooperation with other \nFederal, State, and local agencies to better assist communities with \nlocal economic development.\n  I plan to offer two amendments to further strengthen EDA. One would \nassist communities when a plant closure or downsizing causes economic \ndistress, such as Wilmington or Moraine. The amendment gives special \npreference to auto communities. The other amendment would make more \nOhio communities eligible to receive funds for business incubators. \nOhio is home to the National Business Incubator Association in Athens, \nOH, and several model business incubators, from Toledo, to Shaker \nHeights, to Youngstown. This amendment would allow more companies in \nOhio and more communities in Ohio to support homegrown \nentrepreneurship.\n  Two weeks ago, I visited--as I have in several places around the \nState--an incubator in Shaker Heights called the Launch House. It was \nan old car dealership that had been closed down several years ago. It \nwas renovated with relatively little money. It is now home to about 40 \nentrepreneurs, one- and two-person startup operations, with the average \nage of these young entrepreneurs being under 30. The great majority of \nthese 35 or 40 entrepreneurs are themselves under 30. Some of these \nstartups won't exist in 2 years. Some will have grown in 2 years. Many \nwill be hiring lots of people in the years ahead. Some will fail, some \nwill succeed.\n  As I pointed out earlier, only $10,000 of EDA investment in a \nbusiness incubator, on average, creates somewhere in the vicinity of \n50, 60, or 70 jobs. If we want to promote an economy fueled by \ninnovation, we must better equip our entrepreneurs with the resources \nthey need to turn an idea in the lab to a product in the market.\n  Earlier this year, I held an innovation roundtable at Battelle with \nleading Ohio entrepreneurs and business leaders where we discussed the \nneed to strengthen workforce development, promote business \nentrepreneurship, and support city planning. EDA assistance, they told \nme--as do other business leaders around the State and as entrepreneurs \ndo tell--is critical to these goals.\n  This is legislation on which we should move forward. I am sorry my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle who have been so supportive of \nEDA in the past--as it has always been bipartisan--seem to be standing \nin the way of this. It is important to move forward, so I ask for the \nSenate's support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3765-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOB CREATION\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment to \nthe Economic Development Revitalization Act of 2011. In February of \nthis year I introduced a 7-Point Jobs Plan aimed at creating jobs, \ninvesting in education and training, assisting small businesses, \nreinvigorating American manufacturing, and eliminating bureaucratic \nredtape. Among other things, my bill aims to provide EDA assistance for \nareas hit hard by job losses, and specifically those communities harmed \nas a direct consequence of the Base Realignment and Closure, or BRAC, \nprocess. The amendment that I am offering today would build on this \nplan by making it easier for communities affected by the BRAC process \nto access Federal funding to further their economic development goals \nand to recover from the loss of jobs.\n  Currently, most Economic Development Administration, EDA, projects \nare subject to a 50-percent match; however, the EDA is allowed to \nincrease the Federal share--up to 80 percent--based on the relative \nneed of the area in which the project will be located. The bill being \ndebated would expand the list of circumstances under which the Federal \nshare may be increased. My amendment would simply clarify that \ncommunities affected by ``military base closures, realignments, or \nmission growth'' are among those eligible for a reduced local cost \nshare.\n  Maine has lost more than 5,000 military and civilian jobs as a result \nof the unfortunate decision to close Brunswick Naval Air Station. \nSeveral other States face similar or even greater losses. The BRAC \nrecommendations, released by the Pentagon in May of 2005, caused Maine \nand many other States to face a daunting task. All of us across the \nState and region--political leaders, business leaders, and individual \ncitizens from cities and small towns--worked together to build strong \narguments for our bases. While we did have some great success, Maine \nhas suffered a terrible blow with the closing of the Brunswick Naval \nAir Station. Nevertheless, the State and region's leaders have worked \ntogether to ensure that the closure of Brunswick Naval Air Station was \naccompanied by a commitment to the economic redevelopment of the base \nin order to lessen the impact of its closure on the entire midcoast \nregion.\n  The large numbers of workers in Maine, and around the Nation, who \nhave been or will be displaced as a result of a base closure deserve to \nhave access to necessary resources, including job training and job \nplacement services. The EDA, with its mission to promote economic \ndevelopment and stability, should be leveraging taxpayer dollars to \nassist these struggling communities as we work to lead America to a \nrecovery from the worst economic recession since the Great Depression.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my honor to come to the Senate floor \nthis evening to speak on the issue of the DREAM Act and to have among \nthose in attendance on the floor of the Senate a group of Senators from \nMexico who are part of the Mexican-American interparliamentary union. \nThey are here on the floor with the majority leader, Harry Reid, as \nwell as Senator Tom Udall, who is coordinating their visit to the \nUnited States over the next several days. We are honored that they are \nhere and that they are allowed to come on the floor and to witness our \nSenate, at least in this proceeding where I will make a brief \nstatement.\n  The issue I am going to raise in the course of this evening is one \nthat is of importance to many people around the world--certainly in the \nUnited States and certainly in the nation of Mexico.\n  Ten years ago, I introduced a bill known as the DREAM Act. The DREAM \nAct was an effort to put into the law an opportunity for young people \nwho were brought to the United States and are undocumented to have a \nchance to become legal in the United States.\n  The first person brought to my attention was a young woman in \nChicago, IL, who was Korean. She came to the United States at the age \nof 2. She was an accomplished musician. She had been accepted at the \nvery best music schools in America, including Juilliard School of Music \nand the Manhattan School of Music.\n  As she filled out her application form, she asked her mother about \nher nationality and citizenship. Her mother told her: I am sorry, I \ndon't know the answer because we never filed any papers. We brought you \nhere as a baby and you have lived here all your life, but we don't know \nwhat your status is.\n  She said: What should we do?\n  Her mom said: We should call Durbin's office.\n  So they called my office, and we checked on the laws in America, and \nunfortunately the laws did not allow her to be treated as a legal \nperson in the United States. In fact, the American law said she had to \nreturn to the country she came from, which coincidentally was Brazil, \nnot Korea. She had no way of knowing that. Her family had gone from \nKorea to Brazil to the United States. There she was at the age of 18 \nwith a great opportunity ahead of her and no country. She had lived for \n16 years in the United States. She believed she was an American. She \nknew no other country. She got up every day in school and said the \nPledge of Allegiance and sang the national anthem. Yet she was a person \nwithout a country.\n  Well, it was because of her that I introduced the DREAM Act 10 years \nago. What it basically says is that many young people who are brought \nto the United States as children should not be punished because their \nparents didn't file the necessary papers. The DREAM Act would give \nthese students a chance to become legal in America. They would have to \nfirst prove they came here as a child, they are long-term U.S. \nresidents, they have good moral character, graduate from high school, \nand be prepared to do one of two things: either serve in the U.S. \nmilitary or complete at least 2 years of college.\n  So I introduced this bill 10 years ago thinking it was a simple \nmatter of justice that these young people would have their chance. I \nhad no idea how many young people were affected or would be affected. \nAs I went around the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois and \nspoke at gatherings about the DREAM Act, it wasn't unusual for young \npeople to be waiting for me outside afterward, and they would say very \nquietly: I am one of those DREAM Act kids. I was brought here, and I am \nundocumented, and I don't know what I am going to do with my life. They \nwould be very quiet about it. I would say: Well, I will do my best to \npass this law.\n  As time passed and we tried to bring this to the floor many times, \nthings changed some. We picked up support from a lot of different \npeople.\n  The Defense Secretary, Robert Gates, supports the DREAM Act. He \ncalled me one day and said: As the former president of Texas A, I \nknow what it means to have college students who cannot attend an away \ngame for any sports because they are undocumented, and if they were \nstopped and asked to produce identification, they could be deported. As \nSecretary of Defense, I know what it would mean if we could bring these \nyoung people into the American military. There would be more diversity. \nWe would be a stronger nation, so I support it.\n  GEN Colin L. Powell also has endorsed the DREAM Act. He believes, as \nI do, that this is a fair thing to do, a just thing to do, and would be \ngood for our military.\n  Over the years, these young people started coming forward more and \nmore and speaking about their lives, and, perhaps with more bravado \nthan they should have, they were prepared to risk deportation to tell \ntheir stories. Over the years, these Dreamers have become an important \npart of this effort to pass the DREAM Act. We have the support of so \nmany groups across America, including religious groups and many others \nwho believe this is the right and fair thing to do. We invite young \npeople across America, if they want to voluntarily do so, to tell us \ntheir stories.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate tonight to tell two stories about \ntwo young DREAM Act people and their lives.\n  The first one is Juan Rios. This is a photograph of Juan Rios, who \nwas brought to the United States when he was 10 years old. He grew up \nin the State of Arizona. In high school, Juan discovered his calling: \nmilitary service. He became a leader in the Air Force Junior ROTC, as \nwe can see from his uniform. He became group commander and arm drill \nteam captain and rose to the rank of cadet lieutenant colonel. Juan \ndreamed of one day attending the Air Force Academy, but he was unable \nto do so because he is undocumented. Instead, Juan enrolled in Arizona \nState University.\n  This is a more recent photograph of Juan on his commencement day at \nArizona State University. Juan graduated from Arizona State University \nwith a degree in aeronautical engineering. Since graduation, Juan has \nbeen waiting for his chance to either serve in our military or to use \nhis degree. He can't enlist, obviously, because he is undocumented, and \nhe can't work in his field--the aeronautics industry--because of the \nsame legal obstacle.\n  He just sent me a letter, and this is what it said:\n\n       The United States of America is the country I want to live \n     my life in, where I want to flourish as a productive citizen, \n     where I want to grow old among my lifelong friends, where I \n     want to one day fall in love and raise a family.\n\n  What we heard from Juan we could hear from young people all across \nAmerica. It is his American dream--a dream that won't come true unless \nwe pass the DREAM Act.\n  This next young lady I wish to introduce my colleagues to is someone \nI met just a few weeks ago. This is Tolu Olubumni. She was brought to \nthe United States from Nigeria when she was a child. She graduated from \nhigh school here in the United States at the top of her class. She won \na full scholarship to a prestigious university in Virginia and in 2002 \ngraduated with a degree in chemical engineering.\n  It has been 10 years since I first introduced the DREAM Act in 2001 \nand almost 10 years since she graduated from college. The DREAM Act has \nyet to become law, and she has yet to work 1 day as a chemical engineer \nbecause she is undocumented. Instead, Tolu has dedicated her life to \npassing the DREAM Act for her benefit and the benefit of others. For \nyears, she has worked as a full-time volunteer. Recently, she wrote me \na letter, and this is what she said:\n\n       I don't have a powerful organization behind me or a fancy \n     job title or even a paycheck, but I am committed to stand and \n     fight for you for as long as you ask me to.\n\n\n[[Page S3767]]\n\n\n  Tolu is not standing alone. Her commitment and the commitment of many \nother Dreamers is what inspires me to continue this effort for the \nDREAM Act.\n  There are so many others like Tolu who are living a life of \nuncertainty. They have amazing accomplishments in their lives, and yet \nthey can't use the degrees they have earned to make this a better \nnation and to have a whole life of their own. So last month I \nreintroduced the DREAM Act. Tolu joined me on that occasion, with \nSenator Harry Reid, who has been a strong supporter; Bob Menendez, our \nHispanic colleague here in the Senate; and Richard Blumenthal from the \nState of Connecticut.\n  Here is what Tolu said:\n\n       Passing the DREAM Act is critically important to me and so \n     many others. I don't believe I am entitled to anything more \n     than what this great Nation has taught me--that we all have a \n     right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n  She is right. Thousands of immigrant students in the United States \nwere brought here as children. It wasn't their decision to come, but \nthey grew up here, they made it their home, and they are prepared to \nmake this a better Nation.\n  Some of my colleagues have come to the floor of the Senate \ncriticizing the DREAM Act because people under the age of 35 are \neligible. They say the DREAM Act should really only benefit children. \nThey ignore the obvious: In order to qualify for the DREAM Act, an \nindividual must have come to the United States as a child, just like \nTolu. Now she is 30 years old. She has been waiting patiently for 10 \nyears. To say she is now ineligible because we have not acted I think \nwould be fundamentally unfair.\n  Today we had an interesting speech which I listened to on the floor. \nIt was the first speech--so-called maiden speech--of our colleague, \nSenator Marco Rubio from Florida. It was an excellent speech, and I \ncomplimented him afterward. Among the things he talked about was the \ncontribution of immigrants to the United States.\n  I am a first-generation American. My mother was an immigrant to this \ncountry. One hundred years ago, in 1911, her mother brought her at the \nage of 2 into this country. My mother didn't become a citizen until her \nmid-twenties, after she was married and had already had two children. \nShe was a very proud and hard-working woman, raised a good family, I \nthink--I am a little bit partial--and now her son is a U.S. Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  This is not just my story. It is not just my family's story. This is \nthe American story. This is who we are, immigrants who came to this \ncountry and risked everything to be a part of America and only asked \nfor a chance--a chance to make this a better Nation and to create a \nbetter life for them and their families. The DREAM Act will give \nthousands of young people across America that chance to become a part \nof America's future. It is the just and fair thing to do to make us a \nstronger Nation and to keep our promise that we are going to be fair in \nthe way we administer the laws.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at the version of the DREAM Act \nthat has been introduced. I urge them as well to join me as cosponsors. \nWe will work carefully with other countries and other nations to make \nsure we demonstrate to them the sense of fairness that is part of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3767-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the importance \nof the Emergency Medical Service for Children, or EMSC, Program. \nRecently, we celebrated National EMSC Day, an annual event raising \nawareness about the need to improve and expand specialized care for \nchildren in the prehospital and acute care settings.\n  The EMSC Program holds great personal importance to me. More than 30 \nyears ago, Senator Hatch and I, on a bipartisan basis, took note of the \nsystematic problems and deficiencies surrounding emergency care for \nchildren. With these deficiencies in mind, we authored legislation to \naddress the gaps in emergency care for children. Through the support of \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics and the Surgeon General the bill \nbecame law in 1984 authorizing Federal funding for EMSC.\n  For over 25 years now, EMSC, which is administered by the Health \nResources and Services Administration's, HRSA, Maternal and Child \nHealth Bureau, has been doing truly amazing work. With just over $20 \nmillion a year, EMSC works with all 50 States, the District of \nColumbia, and the U.S. territories to educate emergency medical \npersonnel. In addition to educating and training health care \nprofessionals, EMSC supports research at leading governmental and \nacademic institutions so that our children are treated with cutting-\nedge technology and services.\n  The EMSC Program addresses the entire continuum of pediatric \nemergency services, from injury prevention and EMS access through out-\nof-hospital and emergency department care, intensive care, \nrehabilitation, and reintegration into the community, while ensuring \nthe ongoing involvement of the child's primary care physician. It \nserves the unique needs of children in a way no other program can. Over \nthe years, we have also funded various projects for emergency care. I \nthank my colleagues for supporting the inclusion of a 5-year \nreauthorization of the EMSC Program in the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act.\n  In recognition of all that EMSC has done and will continue to do for \nthis Nation's children, several experts gathered on Capitol Hill last \nmonth to hold an educational briefing in conjunction with EMSC Day. \nSponsored by the American Academy of Pediatrics, staff heard from Dr. \nElizabeth Edgerton, the new branch chief for EMSC and injury prevention \nat the Maternal and Child Health Bureau at HRSA, who described the EMSC \nProgram and what it has accomplished. Katherine Dixon Hert, EMSC \nprogram manager, Office of EMS and Trauma at the Alabama Department of \nPublic Health, recounted the devastation of the recent tornadoes that \nswept through the State of Alabama; the challenges in caring for \nchildren often separated from their parents; and the pediatric deaths \nthat occurred. Lastly, Joseph Wright, M.D., M.P.H., F.A.A.P., principal \ninvestigator and medical director of the EMSC National Resource Center, \nshared his experience of ``growing up'' with the EMSC Program as part \nof the original cohort of board-certified pediatric emergency \nphysicians in the United States.\n  I do not know a parent or grandparent who would advocate for anything \nbut the best care of our children during an emergency. The EMSC Program \nhas filled a void that existed within the EMS system prior to its \ninception. Many experts have identified the need for a lead agency for \nEMS in the U.S. While such a lead agency could improve optimal \nemergency care and response, any reorganization of Federal EMS Programs \nmust maintain the EMSC Program as a freestanding program. Without the \nEMSC Program, children's medical and treatment needs will not be met. I \nwould like to honor and thank the many hard-working Americans that work \ndaily to serve and save our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3767-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3767-S3768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO J. DAVID HOOD\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a faithful public \nservant on the occasion of his retirement. J. David Hood, the regional \ncommissioner of the Public Buildings Service for General Services \nAdministration's Great Lakes Region, is retiring on July 1, 2011, after \n40 years of dedicated service to the Federal Government. David heads an \norganization that is responsible for more than 35 million square feet \nof Federal offices and workplaces in nearly 1,000 buildings owned or \nleased by GSA. He also manages over $1.2 billion in construction and \nrenovation projects throughout the region.\n  David joined GSA's Great Lakes Regional Office in 1971 as an intern \nbefore becoming a real estate appraiser, a project manager, director of \nplanning, and eventually serving as deputy assistant regional \nadministrator, Public Buildings Service. In 1993, David moved to the \nagency's former Federal Supply Service, FSS, where he served as \nassistant regional administrator for 9 years before taking the same \nposition, now regional commissioner, with Public Buildings Service. He \nis a member of the Federal Government's Senior\n\n[[Page S3768]]\n\nExecutive Service and is a recipient of GSA's Meritorious Service \nAward. David also served as acting regional administrator for GSA's \nGreat Lakes Region from January 2009 until January 2011.\n  In a sense, David is the landlord for my State offices in Chicago and \nCarbondale. In that capacity, I saw firsthand David's commitment to the \nFederal Government and wise use of taxpayer money. Last year, my \nChicago office in the Kluczynski Federal Building was in need of repair \nand reconfiguration. David and his team completed what would normally \nbe a year-long project in just 4 months, and stayed within budget. In \naddition to meeting the operational needs of my Chicago staff so that \nthey can best serve the people of Illinois, the renovation also \nproduced considerable cost- and energy-savings.\n  As David's storied career in public service comes to a close, I rise \nto thank him for his hard work on behalf of the American people, and in \nparticular the people of Illinois. David is an exemplary civil servant, \nand while his retirement is well-deserved, his service to the Federal \nGovernment will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3768-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n             Lance Corporal Sean Michael Nicholas O'Connor\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and express our \nNation's deepest thanks to a brave young man and his family. On Monday, \nI received word that LCpl Sean M.N. O'Connor of Douglas, WY, had fallen \non June 12, 2011, in the line of duty in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom. Lance Corporal O'Connor was killed while supporting combat \noperations in Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan.\n  Lance Corporal O'Connor was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine \nRegiment, Regimental Combat Team 8, II Marine Expeditionary Force FWD, \n1st Marine Division, out of Camp Pendleton, CA. Sean's roots in the \nMarine Corps run deep. He was born at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. \nLike his father, Lance Corporal O'Connor joined the U.S. Marine Corps \nin 2007 soon after graduating from Douglas High School. Sean was an \navid reader, swimmer and shooter. He will be remembered as a fun loving \nson and friend who could always be counted on to lend a hand to those \nin need.\n  It is because of individuals like Sean O'Connor that all Americans \nare able to live our daily lives as free people. They put their very \nlives on the line every day, and because of their bravery and their \nfamilies, our Nation remains free and strong. Freedom is not free. It \ncarries a very high price. And that price has been paid over and over \nby many generations of men and women who answered the call to arms and \nwillingly bear the burdens of defending our Nation. They deserve our \ndeepest respect and gratitude.\n  The motto of the U.S. Marine Corps is ``Semper Fidelis.'' It means \n``Always Faithful.'' LCpl Sean O'Connor lived up to these words with \ngreat honor. He made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom for \nyou and I to enjoy. He gave his life, that last full measure of \ndevotion, for you, me, and every single American. Today we thank Lance \nCorporal O'Connor for serving and defending our country. He was always \nfaithful to our country and its citizens, and to his fellow marines.\n  Lance Corporal O'Connor is survived by his parents Daniel and Dee \nO'Connor and his Aunt Sarah O'Connor. He is also survived by his \nbrothers and sisters in arms of the U.S. Marine Corps. We say goodbye \nto a son, friend, neighbor, and a marine. The United States of America \npays its deepest respect to LCpl Sean O'Connor for his sacrifice, so \nthat we may remain free. Sean was the embodiment of honor, courage and \ncommitment. All of Wyoming, and indeed the entire Nation, is proud of \nhim. May God bless him and his family.

Mr. President, I was pleased that the Chamber of Commerce \ntoday wrote to Members of the House of Representatives in support of \nthe America Invents Act. The Senate-passed companion legislation was \napproved in March in a 95-5 vote. This bill will create jobs and grow \nthe economy without adding a penny to the deficit. Today's announcement \nby the Chamber of Commerce is a strong indication of a growing \nconsensus that this legislation is what America needs to win the future \nthrough innovation. I applaud the work that Chairman Smith, Mr. Watt, \nand others have done to move the legislation forward in the House, and \nI encourage the full House to act swiftly.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a full copy of \nthe Chamber's letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 2011.\n     To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives:\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing the interests of more than three \n     million businesses and organizations of every size, sector, \n     and region, supports H.R. 1249, the ``America Invents Act,'' \n     which would encourage innovation and bolster the U.S. \n     economy. The Chamber believes this legislation is crucial for \n     American economic growth, jobs, and the future of U.S. \n     competitiveness.\n       A key component of H.R. 1249 is section 22, which would \n     ensure that fees collected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark \n     Office (PTO) fund the office and its administration of the \n     patent system. PTO faces significant challenges, including a \n     massive backlog of pending applications, and this backlog is \n     stifling domestic innovators. The fees that PTO collects to \n     review and approve patent application are supposed to be \n     dedicated to PTO operation. However, fee diversion by \n     Congress has hampered PTO's efforts to hire and retain a \n     sufficient number of qualified examiners and implement \n     technological improvements necessary to ensure expeditious \n     issuance of high quality patents. Providing PTO with full \n     access to the user fees it collects is an important first \n     step toward reducing the current backlog of 1.2 million \n     applications waiting for a final determination and pendency \n     time of 3 years, as well as to improve patent quality.\n       In addition, the legislation would help ensure that the \n     U.S. remains at the forefront of innovation by enhancing the \n     PTO process and ensuring that all inventors secure the \n     exclusive right to their inventions and discoveries. The bill \n     shifts the U.S. to a first-inventor-to-file system that we \n     believe is both constitutional and wise, ending expensive \n     interference proceedings. H.R. 1249 also contains important \n     legal reforms that would help reduce unnecessary litigation \n     against American businesses and innovators. Among the bill's \n     provisions, Section 16 would put an end to frivolous false \n     patent marking cases, while still preserving the right of \n     those who suffered actual harm to bring actions. Section 5 \n     would create a prior user right for those who first \n     commercially use inventions, protecting the rights of early \n     inventors and giving manufacturers a powerful incentive to \n     build new factories in the United States, while at the same \n     time fully protecting universities. Section 19 also restricts \n     joinder of defendants who have tenuous connections to the \n     underlying disputes in patent infringement suits. Section 18 \n     of H.R. 1249 provides for a tailored pilot program which \n     would allow patent office experts to help the court review \n     the validity of certain business method patents using the \n     best available prior art as an alternative to costly \n     litigation.\n       The Chamber strongly opposes any amendments to H.R. 1249 \n     that would strike or weaken any of the important legal reform \n     measures in this legislation, including those found in \n     Sections 16, 5, 19 and 18. The Chamber supports H.R. 1249 and \n     urges the House to expeditiously approve this necessary \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R.

MARR\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, on this day in 1777, the \nSecond Continental Congress adopted the flag of the United States. At \nthat time, American colonists were just 2 years into their long and \nbloody struggle for independence and only a year earlier had declared \nindependence from the British throne. Since that time, our flag has \nbeen carried into countless battles and has been proudly worn on the \nuniforms of millions of American servicemen and women.\n  I rise today to tell the story of one such American, US Army PFC John \nT. Marr of Dorchester, MA. Private Marr was mortally wounded in combat \non a hill on the other side of the globe. The hill happened to be in \nKorea in 1953. It could have been so many other places where Americans \nfought and died: Bunker Hill in Boston, Cemetery Ridge at Gettysburg, \nthe cliffs of Normandy, Kakazu Ridge on Okinawa, Hamburger\n\n[[Page S3769]]\n\nHill in Vietnam or the Tora Bora region of Afghanistan.\n  Private First Class Marr could have been so many other people's \nhusband, son or brother throughout our nation's history.\n  John Marr, ``Jack'' to his family and friends, was among thousands of \nMassachusetts residents to serve our Nation in Korea and among the \nhundreds to die there. Korea has been referred to as the ``forgotten \nwar.'' By the early 1950s, our Nation had grown war weary, having so \nrecently endured a global war in which more than 400,000 American \nservicemen died and far more than a half million were wounded. Yet \nwhile the Greatest Generation returned from Europe, Africa, and the \nSouth Pacific to build modern America, hundreds of thousands of their \nyounger brothers were fighting and dying on the Korean Peninsula. The \nKorean war was never forgotten by people like the Marr family of \nDorchester who on a hot summer day in 1953 received word that their \nmiddle child had died in the service of his Nation.\n  By all accounts, Jack Marr was a young man with a promising life \nahead of him. He was an outstanding athlete, well-liked by all, newly \nmarried, and worked for his family's successful South Boston \ncontracting business. Yet like millions before and after, Jack answered \nhis Nation's call to serve.\n  In Korea, Jack was communications chief of Company D, 179th Infantry \nRegiment of the 45th Infantry Division. On July 19, 1953, his unit came \nunder heavy mortar attack, wounding several members who were caught in \nthe open. With no thought for his own safety, Jack Marr left the cover \nof his bunker to pull wounded comrades to safety and was mortally \nwounded by an exploding mortar round. Private First Class Marr was \namong the last Americans to die in the Korean war, and succumbed to his \ninjuries just 2 days before the Armistice went into effect. Jack left \nbehind his wife Mary, loving parents, brothers Daniel, Jr. and Robert, \nand a sister Judith Marie.\n  The Marr family will honor Jack this Flag Day by dedicating a \nflagpole on the grounds of their family business on D Street in South \nBoston. I join the Marr family in honoring the service and sacrifice of \nPFC John T. Marr and will close with words engraved on the plaque they \nwill unveil today. ``This flagpole is dedicated to the courageous \nmilitary service of John T. Marr. Jack answered the call to defend the \npeople of South Korea. His sacrifice will forever be an example of \nhope, conviction and the unconquerable American spirit in the pursuit \nof freedom.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3769-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL JAMES C. McCONVILLE\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize \nMG James C. McConville for his professional dedication and service as \nthe Army's Chief of Legislative Liaison, from January 6, 2010, to July \n5, 2011. In this capacity, Major General McConville was responsible for \nadvising the Secretary of the Army, the Chief of Staff of the Army and \nother Army senior leadership on all legislative and congressional \nmatters. During this period of extraordinary change and challenge for \nthe Army, he masterfully led the Army's outreach to Congress.\n  It is an honor and a pleasure to recognize my good friend Jim \nMcConville who is a native of Quincy, MA. He received his nomination to \nthe U.S. Military Academy from the late senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Upon graduation from West \nPoint, he was commissioned as an infantry officer. He was also a 2002 \nnational security fellow at Harvard University. He has had an exemplary \nmilitary career culminating in his recent selection as the commanding \ngeneral of the 101st Airborne Division, Air Assault, at Fort Campbell, \nKY.\n  Major General McConville clearly understood the importance of \nfostering a strong relationship with the Congress. He worked tirelessly \non behalf of the Army to earn the trust and confidence of Members of \nCongress and their staffs and his candor and availability ensured \ncontinuous support for the Army.\n  Major General McConville handled some of the most complex and \nsensitive issues our Army has ever faced through two legislative cycles \nwith unparalleled results. His service assisted the Army in its efforts \nto restore balance to a force stretched and stressed by the demands of \nthe longest war our Nation has fought. His efforts greatly contributed \nto the Army's transformation by building versatile, modular units and \nimproving the capabilities of individual soldiers.\n  Major General McConville's career includes key command and staff \nassignments. He was deployed as the Commander of 4th Brigade, 1st \nCavalry Division during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Based on the heroism \nof his aviators and courageous efforts of his soldiers, his brigade was \nselected as the 2004 Aviation Unit of the Year. Major General \nMcConville also served as Deputy Commanding General for the 101st \nAirborne Division, Air Assault, in Afghanistan during Operation \nEnduring Freedom. His key staff assignments include executive officer \nto the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and deputy chief of the Office \nof Congressional Liaison.\n  I thank Jim for his tremendous service to our Nation. I know that his \nwife Maria, their children Michael, Jessica, and Ryan, and the people \nof Massachusetts are extremely proud of his service. I wish him the \nutmost success as he continues to serve our great Nation at the 101st \nAirborne Division, Air Assault.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3769-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3769-S3770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WOLF KAHN AND EMILY MASON GALLERY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is a delight to call the attention of \nthe Senate to the generosity and vision of Wolf Kahn and Emily Mason, \nwhose longstanding commitment to the communities of southern Vermont is \nbeing commemorated with the dedication of the Wolf Kahn and Emily Mason \nGallery at the Brattleboro Museum and Art Center. While nationally and \ninternationally recognized as accomplished artists, it is Wolf's and \nEmily's selfless contributions to their neighbors and their community \nthat makes me the most proud to call them Vermonters.\n  The works of local painters, sculptors, musicians, photographers, and \nauthors enrich Vermont's culture throughout the beautiful Green \nMountain State. Displaying their creations in community venues, from \nlibraries to coffee shops, artists working in all mediums enrich our \nlives, deepen our pride in our communities and strengthen our bond with \nVermont, its landscape, its beauty and its cultural heritage. Anyone \nwho has contemplated a painting in a museum or examined an original \nmanuscript or composition, and has gained a greater understanding of \nboth the artist and the subject as a result, knows the power and \nimportance of these works in our lives.\n  Since 1968, Wolf and Emily have spent the summers and autumns in West \nBrattleboro, VT, where the landscape provides them inspiration for \ncountless paintings and drawings. Wolf and Emily's love of Vermont, \nhowever, does not end with the environment our State offers to create \ntheir work. They carry their passion into the community, to create \nequally rich experiences for other artists and the general public. \nForty years ago, Wolf and Emily were instrumental in the formation of \nthe Brattleboro Museum and Art Center. Over the ensuing decades, they \nhave offered invaluable guidance and advice, and helped the Museum and \nArt Center establish important connections with the broader art world. \nThey have also played a crucial role and offered the same unwavering \nsupport in the creation of the Vermont Studio Center--a working studio \nspace where artists and writers from across the country and the world \ndescend upon Johnson, VT, to immerse themselves in their work. Today \nthese two organizations are not only flourishing, but they are also \nfirmly embedded in Vermont's rich participation in the arts. The \nsuccess of these programs is a true credit to Wolf and Emily's \ncontinued support throughout the years. They truly are energy givers, \ninfusing all around them with their enthusiasm and sense of \npossibility.\n  Wolf and Emily have lived in Vermont, but they also have enriched the \nquality of life for all Vermonters by generously lending their hands \nand their talent to a number of institutions in Vermont--from cultural \nexperiences, to supporting the basic needs of our most vulnerable \ncommunity members. Their positive impact will be felt in Vermont for \ngenerations to come.\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3770-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO NORA THOMBS\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in the 1930s, the forces of \ntyranny and oppression seemed to be taking over the world. The American \nLegion and the American Legion Auxiliary were especially concerned that \ntyrannical regimes were indoctrinating their young people in hateful \nideology, and so they countered with an initiative to better educate \nyoung Americans in democracy and leadership. Since then, some 2 million \nhigh school students have been delegates to Boys and Girls State \nprograms throughout our Nation. Forty-one years ago, I served as a \nDirigo Girls State delegate in my State of Maine, and I will never \nforget that inspiring week.\n  Today I wish to recognize Nora Thombs of New Sharon, ME, for her \nremarkable commitment to this program. When Dirigo Girls State convenes \non June 19, Nora will mark her 50th year of involvement. The first year \nwas as a delegate during her high school years. The other 49 have been \nhelping to bring this great experience to other young Maine women. From \nher early service as a staff volunteer to her current position as \ndirector, she has helped forge new generations of involved citizens.\n  Nora exemplifies the principles that Boys and Girls State instills. \nAlthough she never sought elective office, her appreciation of the \nimportance of every person's vote and her knowledge about the process \nof government made her an effective and respected town meeting \nmoderator, one of the most challenging roles in local government \nthroughout New England. The leadership skills she learned helped her \nbecome an outstanding teacher and principal.\n  But the best evidence of those principles is Nora's dedication to \nspreading them. As soon as one year's Girls State week concludes, she \nis hard at work planning the next--working with high schools, \nrecruiting delegates, and arranging for speakers, presentations, and \nexperiences that will inform and inspire.\n  It is an honor to congratulate Nora Thombs for her 50 years of \ncontributions to Dirigo Girls State. She is proof that the delegates of \nyesterday are the leaders of today. Thanks to her, the delegates of \ntoday will be the leaders of tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3770-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING RICHARD W. CARR\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the \nremarkable life and legacy of Richard W. Carr. One year after Dick \nCarr's passing, I feel deprived of the ongoing, often surprising \nrevelations of his depth and diversity. But also, of course, I feel \ndeeply grateful to have been his friend.\n  Dick Carr was like a great book in which you find new meanings, \ninsights, and strengths every time you return to it.\n  When I first met Dick, he seemed like another good guy with a kind \nand vivacious wife and wonderful daughters who lived a block away from \nmy family in Hillandale. He was surely all that but over time, as I \ncame to know him better, it was clear that Dick Carr was much, much \nmore.\n  He was a man of property but also a man of poetry. He was a man who \nknew history, but also understood what it meant to be holy. He learned \na lot and taught a lot. He laughed a lot and loved a lot.\n  Little things sometimes tell us big things about people. For \ninstance, in Hillandale, Dick was one of the few residents who took \ncare of his own yard, with Marie's help of course. Not, I presume, \nbecause he couldn't afford gardening help, but because he just enjoyed \ndoing it himself and wanted his grounds to be as perfect as he and \nMarie would make them. And it tells you a lot about Dick that he didn't \nstop with his own yard. He took care of the yards of neighbors who were \naway or whose husbands were ailing or gone. That was Dick Carr.\n  Dick had many loves in his life none of course greater than Marie, \nKate, Annie, Beth, his parents, and his siblings. But he also had a \nspecial love for this city--its history and its people--and he helped, \nalong with his family, to rebuild, enrich, and beautify Washington in \nmany lasting ways. Dick's work to restore the Willard Hotel to its \nprevious grandeur was a great gift to our country and its Capital City. \nHis charitable work changed the lives of many who had much less than he \ndid. And he did it all in a quiet way that showed he had the self-\nconfidence not to need the public credit.\n  In the last 3 years since he was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, I \nlearned some other new things from Dick Carr. In the face of repeated \nbleak diagnoses and painful treatments, Dick taught me and all of us \nnew meaning of words like strength, courage, and grace under pressure. \nHe didn't just fight the good fight; he fought a great fight until he \nhad given to life all that he could and God was ready to take his soul \nfrom this Earth. And Marie, his love and life's partner, fought \ntirelessly for him and alongside him every step of the way in the most \nsustained, selfless, and devoted acts of caring I have ever seen. Marie \nCarr is simply saintly.\n  Thank you, Marie, for what you showed and taught all of us about love \nand faith over the years. I pray that you will be strengthened now and \nin the years ahead by your faith and comforted by wonderful memories of \nDick.\n  I pray also, with total confidence, that Dick's soul has soared to \nheaven where he is living in eternal peace, which in his case will \nprobably mean reading, writing, gardening, dreaming, and building. In \nfact, I would not be surprised if right now Dick was devising plans to \nrestore some heavenly structure to its previous grandeur.\n  Today, in Sister's Garden of the Dahlgren Chapel of the Sacred Heart \nhere in Washington, DC, Dick's great life and legacy will be honored \nand memorialized forever in that lush, green, and holy space.\n  May God bless you and keep you, Dick, as you blessed and inspired \neach of us who knew you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3770-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TURTON, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to require the purchase of domestically made flags of \nthe United States of America for use by the Federal Government; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the All-\nAmerican Made Flag Act, on this 234th celebration of Flag Day in our \nNation, On June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress first adopted \na flag for our new country, bestowing a meaning to the stars and \nstripes of our founding commitment to freedom and democracy.\n  Our flag inspires servicemembers in times of war; it looks over state \ncapitals and schools, stadiums and veterans halls as a reminder of the \nprice of our peace and security. It stood through the smoke in Pearl \nHarbor on December 7, 1941, and the rubble in New York City and \nWashington D.C. on September 11, 2001. The flag instills hope of a \nbetter life for generations of immigrants, embodying an aspiration of \nfree people around the world. Americans pledge allegiance to the flag, \nreminding us about our Nation's history, and the system of checks and \nbalances and separation of powers that tenders the balance of our laws \nand freedoms.\n  The flag that inspired our national anthem rests in the Smithsonian's \nNational Museum of American History. Smaller, hand-held flags are \nwaived during Fourth of July Parades and on Memorial Day are placed \nalongside headstones. But whether in museums or in parades or upon \nmemorials, the American flag reaffirms the power and meaning first \nascribed to it by our founders.\n  And what better way to celebrate its meaning, our Nation's history \nand virtue, than to ensure it is stamped with the Made-in-America \nlabel. On this day, I introduce the All-American Made Flag Act, which \nwould require that American flags purchased by the Federal Government \nare entirely made in America.\n  Across the nation, and especially in Ohio, manufacturers and \nbusinesses have been making and selling American flags for generations. \nIn Coschocton, Ohio, the nation's oldest and largest producer of \nAmerican flags has been doing so since 1851. From the first World's \nFair in New York City, through the Civil War and World War II, and into \nthe universe and onto the moon these flags, made in Coschocton, have \nplayed a role in our nation's history. Today, on Flag Day, it joins \nother businesses that sell All-American made American flags, from \nCincinnati to Dayton to Columbus to Cleveland.\n  Few things can give better meaning to the Made-in-America label than \nour own flag. The All-American Made Flag Act would provide that \nmeaning, and in doing so, would invest in America's workers and \nmanufacturers who embody the ingenuity and patriotism embodied in the \nvery flag itself.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BEGICH:\n  S. 1192. A bill to supplement State jurisdiction in Alaska Native \nvillages with Federal and tribal resources to improve the quality of \nlife in rural Alaska while reducing domestic violence against Native \nwomen and children and to reduce alcohol and drug abuse and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to address \nissues of great concern to me and to all who care about public safety \nin Alaska Native villages.\n  Last year President Obama signed the Tribal Law and Order bill into \nlaw. That legislation passed because Congress recognized the great need \nto provide more support for the criminal justice system and communities \nin Indian Country. While this law has some important provisions that \nwill benefit Alaska Native communities, I believe the remoteness and \nother unique conditions in many Native villages in my State compel us \nto do more. That is why I am introducing the Alaska Safe Families and \nVillages Act of 2011.\n  My bill will establish a demonstration project allowing Alaska Native \ntribes to set up tribal courts, establish tribal ordinances, and impose \nsanctions on those people who violate the ordinances. It would enhance \ncurrent tribal\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\nauthority, while maintaining the State's primary role and \nresponsibility in criminal matters. Additionally, those communities \nselected to be part of the demonstration project would be eligible for \nan Alaska Village Peace Officer grant, enabling a Peace Officer to \nserve participating communities in a holistic manner.\n  Due to the vastness of Alaska, too many of our small remote villages \nlack any law enforcement. Too often, minor cases involving alcohol and \ndomestic abuse go unreported because the nearest State Trooper resides \nin a distant hub community, located a long and expensive airplane ride \naway. Frequently, harsh weather prevents the Troopers from flying into \na community even when the most heinous acts have occurred. \nApproximately 71 villages have a sole, unarmed Village Patrol Safety \nOfficer, VPSO, who must be on duty 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. \nCompounding the challenges of a small number of local law enforcement, \nthese few hard-working VPSOs are often underpaid. While communities try \nto provide some housing and heating assistance, in places where fuel \noil can cost as much as $10 a gallon, it can be difficult to retain \nqualified VPSOs and also sustain the funding for these public servants.\n  As one who believes whole-heartedly in community involvement, I \nstrongly believe tribes in Alaska should benefit from true self-\ndetermination and have a role in their law enforcement needs. This \nlocal control not only provides security for communities, but also \nencourages local acceptance of the established or existing judicial \nsystem as a whole. With the changes in place that my bill would \nrequire, residents of Alaska Native villages will see a culturally-\nrelevant system replacing a crisis-management system that is set in \nplace after a tragedy has occurred.\n  Unfortunately, Alaska Native communities have grown all too familiar \nwith alarming suicide rates. In the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, over a two-\nmonth period during the summer of 2010, there were at least nine self-\ninflicted deaths in several of the region's villages. Nick Tucker, an \nelder in the village of Emmonak, wrote a letter to the State of \nAlaska's rural affairs advisor to try to bring attention to the issue. \nPart of Mr. Tucker's letter begged for the Governor to call the \nLegislature into session to address the issue. He also said it is no \nlonger acceptable for village residents to wait for State Troopers \nbecause ``in the villages, they take forever.''\n  Part of the disturbing cycle of suicide in rural Alaska can be \nattributed to the presence of drugs and alcohol. Despite the knowledge \nthat an individual can speak with an elder and learn who is bootlegging \nalcohol or selling drugs, predators do not fear law enforcement \nintervention because there is no consistent police or State Trooper \npresence.\n  Further, despite many Alaska Native communities' wealth of cultural \nheritage and tradition, many suffer from economic, cultural, and \neducational depression. Villages often experience high unemployment \nrates, above 20 percent, due to their remoteness and lack of economic \nopportunity. Most economic development in Alaska is centered in either \nthe metropolitan areas, or in very remote areas where local residents \nare able to develop local resources. This economic depression, coupled \nwith the 10,000-year practice of subsistence, means Alaska Natives' \nphysical and spiritual survival remains highly dependent on the land. \nThey subsist on game, berries, and fish. However, as hunting and \nfishing stocks dwindle, many of these Alaskans are feeling disconnected \nfrom their heritage and, at times, have turned to drugs and alcohol. \nThough educational attainment in the last 40 years has increased \ndramatically, the dropout rate in Alaska still hovers at 40 percent. \nToo many of our young men and women have lost hope and are losing a \nsense of community.\n  We must give our Nation's communities the tools necessary to protect \nthemselves. Too often, we pour resources into urban areas, but decry \nlack of resources when we try to work toward innovative solutions for \nour most remote communities. We should no longer allow the answer from \nanyone to be ``we don't have the resources.'' Alaska Native villages \nare vibrant, strong communities and we should do everything in our \npower to answer their calls for help. I am hoping the Alaska Safe \nFamilies and Villages Act of 2011 will be just one piece of the puzzle.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me on this legislation, and ask for \nthe full Senate to consider and pass it--providing much-needed help and \nresources to some of our country's neediest places.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1192\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Alaska Safe Families and \n     Villages Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) while the State of Alaska and numerous Alaska \n     organizations have struggled for years to address crime and \n     substance abuse problems in Alaska, Native Villages continue \n     to suffer from disproportionally high rates of illicit drug \n     use, alcohol abuse, suicide, and domestic violence;\n       (2) the suicide rate in Alaska Native villages is 6 times \n     the national average, and the alcohol-related mortality rate \n     is 3.5 times that of the general national population;\n       (3) Alaska Native women suffer the highest rate of forcible \n     sexual assault in the United States, and an Alaska Native \n     woman is sexually assaulted every 18 hours;\n       (4) according to the 2006 Initial Report and \n     Recommendations of the Alaska Rural Justice and Law \n     Enforcement Commission more than 95 percent of all crimes \n     committed in rural Alaska can be attributed to alcohol;\n       (5) the cost of drug and alcohol abuse in Alaska is \n     estimated at $525,000,000 per year;\n       (6) the State of Alaska's public safety system does not \n     effectively serve vast areas of the State in which many \n     remote Alaska Native villages are located, except in response \n     to serious crimes involving severe injury or death, which are \n     handled by Alaska State Troopers who are located in only a \n     small number of hub communities around the State;\n       (7) extreme weather conditions often prevent or delay \n     travel into remote Alaska Native villages, forcing residents \n     to wait for several days for an Alaska State Trooper to \n     arrive and respond to these crimes, compared to a law \n     enforcement response time normally within minutes for \n     residents of urban communities;\n       (8) in many rural Alaska Native villages, there is no local \n     law enforcement presence whatsoever;\n       (9) to the extent there are resident law enforcement \n     officers in rural villages, they consist of Village Public \n     Safety Officers (VPSOs) through the State VPSO Program, and a \n     very limited number of other peace officers such as Village \n     Police Officers (VPOs), Tribal Police Officers (TPOs) and \n     Community Peace Officers (CPOs) who tend to have only minimal \n     training and experience;\n       (10) the VPSO Program is not able to adequately serve all \n     remote Alaska Native villages because there is insufficient \n     funding or officers to address the urgent need for additional \n     law enforcement in these communities;\n       (11) the number of VPSOs currently serving in Alaska is \n     approximately 71, yet there are about 200 remote villages in \n     Alaska, all of which could benefit from a law enforcement \n     presence;\n       (12) studies have concluded that the lack of effective law \n     enforcement in Alaska Native villages contributes \n     significantly to increased crime, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, \n     domestic violence, and rates of suicide, poor educational \n     achievement, and a lack of economic development in those \n     communities;\n       (13) law enforcement that is created and administered by \n     Indian tribes in Alaska will be more responsive to the need \n     for greater local control, local responsibility, and local \n     accountability in the administration of justice; and\n       (14) it is necessary to invoke the plenary authority of \n     Congress over Indian affairs under section 8 of clause 3 of \n     Article I of the Constitution, in order to improve law \n     enforcement conditions in Alaska Native villages.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish a demonstration project under which a \n     limited number of Indian tribes in Alaska Native villages \n     will exercise local law enforcement responsibilities to \n     combat alcohol and drug abuse and to enhance existing tribal \n     authority over domestic violence and child abuse and neglect;\n       (2) to enhance coordination and communication among \n     Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement agencies; \n     and\n       (3) to increase funding for, and therefore availability of, \n     local law enforcement.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to preserve \nand renew Federal-aid highways to reduce long-term costs, improve \nsafety, and improve the condition of Federal-aid highways; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help \nimprove and extend the value of our Nation's highways and bridges. This \nbill will help ensure that the Federal Government makes better \ninvestments of the taxpayer dollars spent on transportation \ninfrastructure. Helping build the roads and bridges of this Nation has \nbeen one the best Federal investments our government has made and it is \nan investment that is worth taking care of to ensure the lasting value, \nefficiency and safety of our Nation's highways and bridges.\n  It was during the Thomas Jefferson Administration that the Federal \nGovernment developed the concept of a ``Federal-Aid'' Highway. In 1806, \nCongress authorized federal funding to build the ``National Road.'' \nMuch like the National Highway System of today, the purpose of the \nNational Road was to facilitate interstate commerce between the large \ncommercial centers of the Eastern United States to points west. \nConstruction on the National Road began in 1811 in Cumberland, MD, 200 \nyears, and trillions of dollars, later the United States has one of the \nworld's most expansive highway networks.\n  The age and expanse of this system underscores the importance of \nensuring adequate and consistent investments in our existing \ntransportation infrastructure. The need for performance measures and \nnational state-of-good repair standards are long overdue. Implementing \nsuch policies are essential ensuring the quality of the road condition, \nthe economic value of our Nation's transportation infrastructure, and \nthe wise investment of taxpayer dollars on transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers, ASCE, gave our Nation's \nhighways and bridges a grade of ``D-'' in its 2009 ``Report Card for \nAmerica's Infrastructure.'' These poor road conditions are costing \nmotorists time, money, and in the worst and most unfortunate \nsituations, costing motorists their lives.\n  A 2011 transportation infrastructure study produced by TRIP, a non-\npartisan non-profit transportation research organization sponsored by \nvarious transportation stakeholder industries, found that 32 percent of \nAmerica's major roads are in poor or mediocre condition. Poor road \nconditions take a major toll on the repair and operating costs of \nmotorist's vehicles to the tune of $67 billion a year, or approximately \n$333 per driver. Poor road conditions contribute to 42 percent of \nAmerica's urban highways being congested. Traffic congestion costs \nAmerican motorists more than $78 billion in wasted fuel and lost \nproductivity, and more than 4 billion hours of wasted time that drivers \ncould have otherwise spent with family, earning income or engaged in \npersonal activities. Poor road conditions are a ``significant factor'' \nin approximately one-third of fatal traffic accidents.\n  It is Congress's responsibility to ensure that Federal transportation \ndollars are spent wisely to improve the safety and efficiency of our \nroads. Making repair and maintenance of our existing infrastructure a \npriority, during these times of fiscal restraint, is a wise approach to \nFederal transportation infrastructure. Ignoring maintenance and repair \nneeds on Federal-Aid highways, while advancing capacity expansion \nprojects at the expense of neglected existing infrastructure, \nexacerbates the decline in the state-of-good repair of our country's \nroads and bridges and exemplifies irresponsible spending of Federal \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  ASCE put the cost of the maintenance and repair backlog for roads and \nbridges at $930 billion. Therefore it is important to understand that \nthis is an infrastructure issue will not be achieved of the course of \none surface transportation authorization cycle. However, we can change \nour Federal policies in such a way that improves how Federal dollars \nare spent on highway and bridge maintenance so that the taxpayer gets a \nbetter return on their transportation taxes.\n  Breaking the cycle of neglected road and bridge maintenance that \nstems from allowing a highway facility to decline to into poor or very \npoor condition in the first place is critical to improving the quality \nof investment of Federal transportation dollars.\n  Highway investment figures from the American Association of State \nHighway and Transportation Officials: ``Rough Roads Ahead: Fix It Now \nor Pay for It Later'' demonstrate that neglecting maintenance and \ninstead waiting for the road surface to reach a condition rating of \n``very poor'', on average 16 years, before repairing the road cost \nnearly twice as much, on average, as compared with making biannual \ninvestments to maintain a ``very good'' road condition over that same \n16-year period. Not to mention the costs in\n\n[[Page S3777]]\n\ndamage to vehicles that is caused by the years that a road spends in \nfair, poor, or very poor condition.\n  My Preservation and Renewal of Federal-Aid Highways Act aims to \ncreate a culture of sound transportation investment while providing the \nStates improved resources and flexibility to keep their highway \nfacilities in a state of good repair.\n  The Preservation and Renewal of Federal-Aid Highways Act will \nestablish policies that require the Secretary of Transportation to \nestablish ``state of good repair standards'' for the various classes of \nFederal-Aid highways to serve as benchmarks of achievement for States \nto reach.\n  The act will require States to use an ``Asset Management Process'' to \ndevelop ``State System Preservation and Renewal Plans'' and ``State \nSystem Preservation and Renewal Performance Targets'' to ensure that \ntheir Federal-Aid roads are being kept in a state of good repair.\n  The act will consolidate the Interstate Maintenance program, Highway \nBridge program and half of the National Highway System Federal-Aid \nhighway programs funds together to create a flexible System \nPreservation and Renewal Program Fund for the States to use as they see \nfit to meet the goals of their System Preservation and Renewal Plans \nand Performance Targets.\n  Both the Federal Government and the States are facing enormous \nchallenges to deliver essential services, like well-maintained, safe \nand efficient roads, for the country. As with any proposal that calls \nfor a change in the way business is done there needs to be adequate \ntime for transition. My bill, while establishing new standards for \nmaintaining the quality of highways and bridges, also takes special \ncare to grant leeway during emergency circumstances, when essential \ndefense infrastructure investments are needed, and gives consideration \nto States that have planned to use these newly consolidated funds prior \nto how these funds would be repurposed under this legislation.\n  The backlog of maintenance and repair on our existing transportation \ninfrastructure can no longer be ignored. In recent years, our country \nhas experienced a number of tragic incidents that resulted in the loss \nof life as a direct result of the poor condition of transportation \ninfrastructure. These are preventable incidents that are costly in so \nmany ways. We must make transportation system preservation and renewal \na priority because it makes good fiscal sense, good safety sense, and \ngood business sense for our country.

A bill to facilitate compliance with Article 36 of the \nVienna Convention on Consular Relations, done at Vienna April 24, 1963, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Consular \nNotification Compliance Act. This legislation will help bring the \nUnited States into compliance with its obligations under the Vienna \nConvention on Consular Relations, VCCR, and is critical to ensuring the \nprotection of Americans traveling overseas.\n  Each year, thousands of Americans are arrested and imprisoned when \nthey are in foreign countries studying, working, serving the military, \nor traveling. From the moment they are detained, their safety and well-\nbeing depends, often entirely, on the ability of United States consular \nofficials to meet with them, monitor their treatment, help them obtain \nlegal assistance, and connect them to family back home. That access is \nprotected by the consular notification provisions of the VCCR, but it \nonly functions effectively if every country meets its obligations under \nthe treaty--including the United States.\n  Unfortunately, in some instances, the United States has not been \nmeeting those obligations. There are currently more than 100 foreign \nnationals on death row in the United States, most of whom were never \ntold of their right to contact their consulate and their consulate was \nnever notified of their arrest, trial, conviction, or sentence. There \nare many other foreigners in U.S. prisons awaiting trial for non-\ncapital crimes, some facing life sentences, who were similarly denied \nconsular access. This failure to comply with our treaty obligations \nundercuts our ability to protect Americans abroad and deeply damages \nour image as a country that abides by its promises and the rule of law. \nIt would also be completely unacceptable to us if our citizens were \ntreated in this manner.\n  The Consular Notification Compliance Act seeks to bring the United \nStates one step closer to compliance with the convention. It is not \nperfect. It focuses only on the most serious cases--those involving the \ndeath penalty--but it is a significant step in the right direction and \nwe need to work together to pass it quickly. Texas is poised to execute \nthe next foreign national affected by this failure to comply with the \ntreaty on July 7, 2011. He was not notified of his right to consular \nassistance, and the Government of Mexico has expressed grave concerns \nabout the case. We do not want this execution to be interpreted as a \nsign that the United States does not take its treaty obligations \nseriously. That message puts American lives at risk. The Government of \nGreat Britain has expressed similar concerns about a case involving a \nBritish citizen facing the death penalty here, who was denied consular \naccess.\n  The bill I am introducing would allow foreign nationals who have been \nconvicted and sentenced to death to ask a court to review their cases \nand determine if the failure to provide consular notification led to an \nunfair conviction or sentence.\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\n  The bill also recognizes that law enforcement and the courts must do \na better job in the future to promptly notify individuals of their \nright to consular assistance so the United States does not find itself \nin this precarious position again. To that end, the bill reaffirms that \nthe obligations under the treaty are Federal law and apply to all \nforeign nationals arrested or detained in the United States. For \nindividuals arrested on charges that carry a possible punishment of \ndeath, the bill ensures adequate opportunity for consular assistance \nbefore a trial begins.\n  This bill offers very limited remedies to a very limited number of \npeople. I am troubled that it has to be so narrow, as we demand far \nbroader protection for American citizens abroad every day. However, \ncarrying out a death sentence is an irreversible action, and I believe \nthat we must act quickly. I understand that a limited bill has the best \nchance of achieving the bipartisan support needed to move forward on \nsuch an important issue at this time.\n  Compliance with our consular notification obligations is not a \nquestion of partisan interest. There should be unanimous support for \nthis bill. The VCCR was negotiated under President Kennedy, ratified \nduring the Nixon administration, and it has been fully supported by \nevery President since. President George W. Bush understood the critical \nneed to honor our obligations under this treaty. Although he was \nultimately unsuccessful, he vigorously worked to bring the United \nStates into compliance, and he supported action along the lines of what \nI propose today. He understood the implications of non-compliance for \nour citizens, our businesses, and our military. I have no doubt \nPresident Obama shares the same commitment to resolving this issue.\n  I saw the need to resolve this issue first-hand this spring when a \nyoung, innocent Vermont college student was detained by Syrian police \nsimply for taking photos of a demonstration. I worked hard with the \nU.S. consulate in Syria to obtain access to him. His safety depended on \nthe ability of our consular officers to see him, provide assistance, \nand monitor his condition.\n  Similarly, the United States invoked the VCCR to seek access to the \nthree American hikers detained in Iran after accidently crossing an \nunmarked border in 2009. In 2001, when a U.S. Navy surveillance plane \nmade an emergency landing in Chinese territory, the State Department \ncited the VCCR in demanding immediate access to the plane's crew.\n  I doubt there are many Members of Congress who have not sought \nsimilar help from our consulates when their constituents have been \narrested overseas. We know how critically important this access is, and \nwe expect other governments to provide it. Those governments expect no \nless of us.\n  This bill has the support of the Obama administration, including the \nDepartment of Justice, the Department of Defense, the Department of \nHomeland Security, and the Department of State. I have heard from \nretired members of the military urging passage of the bill to protect \nservice men and women and their families overseas, and from former \ndiplomats of both political parties who know that compliance with our \ntreaty obligations is critical for America's national security and \ncommercial interests.\n  Given the long history of bipartisan support for the VCCR, there \nshould be unanimous support for this legislation to uphold our treaty \nobligations. A failure to act places Americans at risk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1194\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write \n     to urge you to support prompt passage of the Consular \n     Notification Compliance Act, legislation that would give \n     domestic legal effect to U.S. obligations under the Vienna \n     Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention) to \n     provide consular access to foreign nationals in U.S. law \n     enforcement custody by providing for judicial review of \n     certain claims that this obligation has not been satisfied. \n     International consular notification and access obligations \n     are essential to ensuring humane, non-discriminatory \n     treatment for both non-citizens in U.S. custody and U.S. \n     citizens in the custody of foreign governments. As retired \n     military leaders, we understand that the preservation of \n     consular access protections is especially important for U.S. \n     military personnel, who when serving our country overseas are \n     at greater risk of being arrested by a foreign government.\n       U.S. military personnel are at risk for being taken into \n     foreign custody after accidental incursions into foreign \n     territories, while on leave or furlough, or while stationed \n     abroad pursuant to, or in absence of a Status of Forces \n     Agreement (SOFA). When American military personnel or their \n     family members find themselves in foreign custody, consular \n     access is indispensable in allowing the U.S. government to \n     fulfill its duty to ensure fair and humane treatment for such \n     individuals.\n       For example, in 2001 when a U.S. Navy surveillance plane \n     made an emergency landing in Chinese territory after \n     colliding with a Chinese jet, the State Department cited the \n     Vienna Convention and other consular treaties in demanding \n     immediate access to the plane's crew. Chinese authorities \n     responded by granting consular visits to the crew members, \n     who were detained in China for 11 days. Moreover, military \n     regulations implementing SOFA requirements anticipate that \n     consular officers will assist the designated commanding \n     officer in key areas such as protesting inhumane treatment \n     and ensuring that the individual has access to an adequate \n     defense.\n       The strength of consular access protections for U.S. \n     military personnel abroad is dependent on the United States' \n     reciprocal commitment to fulfill its obligations at home. But \n     given the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in Medellin v. Texas, \n     the executive branch is unable, without further action by \n     Congress, to enforce certain consular protections under the \n     Vienna Convention with regards to U.S. state law enforcement \n     personnel. In light of the Medellin decision, additional \n     legislation is needed to ensure the integrity of the consular \n     notification and access rights upon which U.S. service \n     members rely.\n       Legislation to ensure review and appropriate relief if \n     needed when a foreign national faces or is sentenced to \n     death, while relatively limited in scope, would improve \n     foreign governments' confidence in the United States' ability \n     to uphold its consular access obligations, making it more \n     likely that such governments will giant this access to \n     Americans in their custody.\n       Improving U.S. enforcement of its consular notification and \n     access legal obligations will help protect American citizens \n     detained abroad, including U.S. military personnel and their \n     families stationed overseas. We urge you to support those who \n     are serving our country overseas by ensuring swift passage of \n     the Consular Notification Compliance Act to meet our \n     international responsibilities.\n           Sincerely,\n       Rear Admiral Don Guter, USN (Ret.).\n       Rear Admiral John D. Hutson, USN (Ret.).\n       Brigadier General James P. Cullen, USA (Ret.).\n       Brigadier General David R. Irvine, USA (Ret.).\n       Brigadier General Murray G. Sagsveen, USA (Ret.).\n       Colonel Lawrence B. Wilkerson, USA (Ret.).\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 14, 2011.\n     Re The Consular Notification Compliance Act.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: As former \n     U.S. diplomats and State Department officials, we write to \n     urge your support for the Consular Notification Compliance \n     Act, legislation that we believe is vitally important to \n     meeting the United States' foreign policy objectives and to \n     protecting the interests of its citizens abroad. We urge you \n     to act promptly to enact this legislation that would secure \n     compliance with the United States' binding treaty obligations \n     by providing a review mechanism for the cases of foreign \n     nationals who--without the benefit of timely consular \n     notification and access--were convicted and received death \n     sentences.\n       Each year, thousands of Americans are detained abroad. \n     Prompt knowledge of and access to our fellow-citizens held in \n     foreign jails ensures that U.S. consular officers can help \n     them obtain legal assistance, monitor their treatment, and \n     connect them to family and friends back home. This crucial \n     lifeline of consular support can only function effectively if \n     the detaining authorities comply with their obligations under \n     Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, \n     which grants all foreigners in custody the right to consular \n     notification, communication and access ``without delay.'' \n     Insisting on compliance with and protesting violations of \n     Article 36 provisions has thus long been an integral element \n     of the U.S. policy of providing protective consular services \n     to detained Americans overseas.\n       For instance, when three Americans were detained after \n     accidentally crossing an unmarked border into Iran in 2009, a \n     State Department spokesperson insisted that ``Iran has \n     obligations under the Vienna Convention, and we demand \n     consular access at the first opportunity.'' The Secretary of \n     State later called on the Iranian government ``to live up to \n     its obligations under the Vienna Convention by granting \n     consular access and releasing these three young Americans \n     without further delay.'' Once consular access was finally \n     granted, the State Department ``welcome[d] the fact that Iran \n     is meeting up to its obligations under the Vienna \n     Convention''.\n       Unfortunately, the United States has sometimes violated \n     Article 36 requirements even as we call on foreign \n     governments to comply with its terms. In 2004, the \n     International Court of Justice (ICJ) determined that some \n     fifty Mexican nationals were entitled to judicial hearings to \n     determine if Article 36 breaches, which were proven to have \n     occurred, affected the fairness of their capital murder \n     convictions and/or sentences.\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\n     The United States is required by the U.N. Charter to comply \n     with decisions of the ICJ. President George W. Bush attempted \n     to enforce this decision at the state court level, but the \n     U.S. Supreme Court later ruled in Medellin v. Texas that only \n     Congress could ensure compliance by adopting legislation \n     providing for the compulsory review and reconsideration \n     mandated by the ICJ. The Supreme Court also observed that the \n     ICJ decision undeniably bound the United States under \n     international law and that ``plainly compelling'' reasons \n     existed for its domestic implementation. ``In this case,'' \n     the Medellin Court noted, ``the President seeks to vindicate \n     United States interests in ensuring the reciprocal observance \n     of the Vienna Convention, protecting relations with foreign \n     governments, and demonstrating commitment to the role of \n     international law.''\n       Clearly, the safety and well-being of Americans abroad is \n     endangered by the United States maintaining the double \n     standard of protesting denials of consular notification and \n     access to its own citizens while simultaneously failing to \n     comply with its obligation to remedy identical violations. We \n     cannot realistically expect other nations to continue to \n     comply with consular treaty commitments that we refuse to \n     uphold. For that reason alone, it is essential that Congress \n     act swiftly to provide the limited procedural remedy that \n     both our Executive and Judicial Branches have so clearly \n     indicated is in the national interest.\n       As the Supreme Court pointed out, however, the United \n     States' interest in implementing these international \n     obligations goes beyond protecting the reciprocal rights and \n     safety of its overseas citizens. Our national security, \n     effective commercial and trade relations relating to our \n     prosperity and almost every matter of national interest, \n     large and small, is covered by reciprocal treaty obligations. \n     We risk jeopardizing these interests if we practice an \n     indifference to these obligations in this or other arenas. We \n     believe that continued non-compliance will surely alienate \n     this nation from its allies. We also believe that any further \n     failure to provide the modest remedy of ``review and \n     reconsideration'' required in these cases will undermine \n     America's credibility as a global champion of the rule of \n     law, thereby seriously hindering our foreign policy \n     objectives. It is worth noting the United States agreed to be \n     bound by the ICJ's decision both before and after the case \n     was heard and has consistently advised multiple international \n     and domestic courts that it is doing everything within its \n     power to comply with this decision. Passing legislation to \n     ensure our nation's compliance needs to be accomplished in \n     order to make good on this representation.\n       The ability of the United States to secure future \n     international agreements vital to our commercial interests \n     and national security depends largely on whether this nation \n     is perceived as honoring its international obligations. It is \n     vitally important for Congress to mandate judicial \n     enforcement of America's treaty obligations. Anything less \n     jeopardizes our global reputation as a dependable treaty \n     partner. We therefore urge you to support the rapid passage \n     of the Consular Notification Compliance Act to accomplish \n     this end, and thank you for your attention to this important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n       Harry Barnes, Jr., U.S. Ambassador to Chile, 1985-1988; \n     U.S. Ambassador to India, 1981-1985; Director General of the \n     Foreign Service 1977-1981; U.S. Ambassador to Romania, 1974-\n     1977.\n       John B.

We are well aware that international consular \n     notification and access, as required under the Vienna \n     Convention on Consular Relations (Vienna Convention), is \n     essential to such a system, and to ensuring non-\n     discriminatory treatment for both non-citizens in U.S. \n     custody and U.S. citizens in the custody of foreign \n     governments; and is also critical to the efficient, \n     effective, and fair operations of criminal justice systems \n     throughout the United States. In light of these important \n     considerations and out of concern for the domestic and \n     international implications of an execution without proper \n     compliance with U.S. international obligations, we are \n     writing to urge you to grant a reprieve in the case of \n     Humberto Leal Garcia. We take no position on the merits of \n     his petition, but believe that a reprieve should take place \n     pending congressional enactment of legislation that would \n     allow foreign nationals who were denied consular access while \n     in law enforcement custody and face the death penalty to \n     receive appropriate review of that failure.\n       It is appropriate to ensure that our country complies with \n     the laws to which it has obligated itself, and to ensure that \n     those laws apply to our own citizens as well. At all stages \n     of the proceedings, foreign nationals--whether our own \n     citizens in other countries or those from other countries in \n     the United States--face unique disadvantages and challenges \n     when confronted with prosecution and imprisonment under the \n     legal system of another nation. Prompt consular access \n     ensures that they have the means necessary to be advised of \n     their rights and to prepare an adequate defense.\n       Ensuring prompt consular access to foreigners arrested in \n     the United States also enhances the truth-seeking function \n     that lies at the heart of American justice. Much in the same \n     way as the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment, \n     consular notification is essential to enabling fair access \n     for those who are unfamiliar with our legal system. As Chief \n     Judge Juan Torruella of the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the First Circuit observed, ``Without [consular access], \n     I think that we presume too much to think that an alien can \n     present his defense with even a minimum of effectiveness. The \n     result is injury not only to the individual alien, but also \n     to the equity and efficacy of our criminal justice system.'' \n     U.S. v. Li, 206 F.3d 56, 78 (1st Cir. 2000) (Torruella, C.J., \n     concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n       Consular assistance provides a unique and indispensable \n     protection for foreign nationals who are unfamiliar with the \n     U.S. criminal justice system. This is true with regard to our \n     own citizens abroad as well. As many domestic courts have \n     recognized, consulates can provide essential resources that \n     are simply not available through other means, particularly in \n     identifying and explaining the ways in which the U.S. \n     criminal justice system differs from their native systems. \n     Early consular access can prevent misunderstandings and \n     missteps by a foreign national that might otherwise prejudice \n     their ability to obtain a fair trial. Consulates can assist \n     defense counsel in locating crucial documents, witnesses, and \n     exonerating evidence available only in their native country \n     and can assist in translations that in too many cases have \n     been demonstrated to be erroneous, thus jeopardizing the \n     accuracy of the proceedings. This can mean the difference \n     between conviction and acquittal, or between life and death.\n       We want to emphasize that demonstrating our nation's \n     commitment to complying with Vienna Convention obligations is \n     also critical to ensuring the safety of Americans traveling, \n     living and working abroad. The United States expects \n     countries to grant consular notification and access to \n     Americans in law enforcement custody. In return, we pledge to \n     accord the same right to foreign nationals within our \n     borders. In addition, particularly in states bordering Mexico \n     and Canada, cooperation between law enforcement agencies is \n     critical to ensuring the safety of citizens on all sides of \n     the border. These accords are threatened when the United \n     States erects procedural hurdles that prevent foreign \n     nationals from obtaining meaningful judicial review when \n     denied consular notification and access and may well mean \n     that our own citizens' rights will be jeopardized in \n     countries whose citizens' rights have not been respected by \n     the United States.\n       Providing meaningful enforcement of the Vienna Convention's \n     consular notification and access requirements will increase \n     the efficient, effective, and fair operations of our criminal \n     justice system and protect U.S. citizens abroad. Delaying the \n     execution of Humberto Leal Garcia to ensure full opportunity \n     for congressional action and appropriate review of the case \n     will demonstrate to foreign governments the United States' \n     good faith in upholding its consular access obligations, \n     increasing the likelihood that foreign governments will grant \n     access to Americans in their custody. For these reasons, we \n     strongly urge you to support a reprieve in this case pending \n     congressional action on these matters.\n           Sincerely,\n       Hon. Charles F.

A bill to expand the use of E-Verify, to hold employers \naccountable, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \nexpand the E-Verify program and enhance our ability to hold employers \naccountable for their hiring practices. I am pleased that several of my \ncolleagues have joined me in cosponsoring this commonsense bill titled \nAccountability Through Electronic Verification Act.\n  Known as the Basic Pilot Program, E-Verify currently provides \nemployers with a simple, web-based tool to verify the work eligibility \nof new hires. In 1986, Congress made it unlawful for employers to \nknowingly hire or employ aliens not eligible to work in the United \nStates. Under current law, if the documents provided by an employee \nreasonably appear on their face to be genuine, the employer has met its \nobligation to review the worker's documents.\n  Unfortunately, since then, identity theft has soared and counterfeit \ndocuments have become a thriving industry. Because of this, Congress \ncreated the Basic Pilot Program in 1996. Employers in this program can \nelectronically verify a new hires employment authorization with more \nthan 455 million Social Security Administration records, more than 122 \nmillion Department of State passport records, and more than 80 million \nDepartment of Homeland Security immigration records.\n  This program is voluntary and free for all employers to use. In fact, \nit is currently used by 269,913 employers representing 903,358 hiring \nsites. More than 11.3 million queries have been made this year. During \nfiscal year 2010, more than 98.3 percent of those were verified almost \ninstantly.\n  Less than 1.7 percent of employees receive a tentative non-\nconfirmation, and must sort out their records with the Social Security \nAdministration. Many times, it is a simple misunderstanding relating \nfrom a typo to neglecting to update records after a name change.\n  With the program set to expire in a little over a year, I see the \nneed to continue its use, without an expiration date. E-Verify is a \nproven tool in combatting illegal immigration. With the unemployment \nrate hovering around 9.1 percent, can we afford not to use every \ninstrument available to ensure Americans and legal workers are the ones \nobtaining employment?\n  My legislation would make E-Verify a staple in the workplace so that \nAmerican workers are on a level playing field with cheaper labor. \nShould an employer refuse to participate, my bill increases the \npenalties currently used under the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nEmployers would be required to check the status of current employees \nwithin 3 years, and would allow employers to run a check prior to \noffering a job, saving that employer valuable time and resources. \nEmployers will also be required to re-check those workers whose \nauthorization is about to expire, such as those who come to the United \nStates on visas. These visas have expiration dates, and it is \nimperative we do not allow employers to aide in the overstaying of any \nalien.\n  A commonsense fix that is also included would require the Social \nSecurity Administration to develop algorithm technology that would flag \nsocial security numbers that are being used more than once. You would \nthink the Social Security Administration would already have this in \nplace, but sadly they do not. This provision alone will save many from \nfalling victim to identity theft.\n  For those who do find themselves victim of identity theft, this bill \nwould amend the criminal code to clarify identity fraud is punishable \nregardless if the defendant did not have knowledge of the victim. This \nprovision stems from the 2009 Supreme Court decision holding that \nidentity theft requires proof that an individual knew the number being \nused belonged to an actual person. This is a commonsense and long \noverdue provision. Anyone who has had their identity stolen by an \nillegal alien would agree. We need to strengthen our laws to deter the \nrobust black market for fraudulent documents.\n  Another provision in the bill, which I know will benefit many rural \nareas such as small towns in Iowa, would help those businesses without \ninternet capabilities to participate in E-Verify. Requiring the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services to establish a demonstration \nproject in these rural areas will greatly measure the needs of our \nrural employers and involve the small business community.\n  Some may want to criticize the database used to check employees, but \nwith continued enhancements, we are making great strides. For instance, \njust this past March, the Department of Homeland Security initiated the \n``Self Check'' program to allow workers in five States and the District \nof Columbia to self-check employment eligibility. One of my staffers \nused Self Check and received confirmation of work authorization almost \ninstantly. The entire process took her less than 90 seconds.\n  Another development is the recent launch to include U.S. passport \nphoto matching capabilities. This further enhances the integrity of the \nprogram by enabling E-Verify to automatically check the validity and \nauthenticity of all U.S. passports and passport cards presented for \nemployment verification checks. E-Verify is supported by many. Most \nnotably by DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano who has said, ``E-Verify is a \nsmart, simple, and effective tool that allows us to work with employers \nto help them maintain a legal workforce.'' According to DHS, the ``E-\nVerify program infrastructure is capable of handling the volume of \nqueries that would be necessary for a nationwide mandatory employment \nverification system.'' DHS has been preparing for such an occasion, and \nI'm pleased to put forward my proposal today.\n  For those who were here during the 2007 immigration debate, you may \nremember that I, Senator Baucus and then-Senator Obama worked very \nclosely on the issue of employment verification. I have kept many of \nthe principles agreed upon in 2007 and included them in this bill. With \nthat said, I look forward to hearing from my colleagues with any ideas \nthey may have to strengthen this system.\n  While everyone may not agree with every aspect of this bill, it \nserves as a starting point for a much-needed conversation about illegal \nimmigration and our struggling job market. People\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\nback home want employers to be held accountable. They want to see our \ngovernment do more to make sure we are reducing the magnet for people \nto cross our borders illegally. I hope more colleagues will join me in \nmy effort to achieve accountability through electronic verification.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Inhofe, \n        Mr. Vitter, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S.J. Res. 19. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States authorizing Congress to prohibit the \nphysical desecration of the flag of the United States; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today is Flag Day and it is the perfect day \nto re-introduce a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress to \nprotect the American flag from physical desecration. I am joined in \ndoing so today by my friend, the distinguished Senator from Montana, \nSenator Baucus. He was an original cosponsor of this amendment on 6 \nprevious occasions when I have introduced it, including in the 109th \nCongress when this body came within one vote of approving it.\n  The American flag is a unique symbol of our country, of its history, \nand of our shared values. There is, in fact, no more powerful unifying \ngeneral symbol. At the same time, the flag no doubt means different \nspecific things to different individuals; Congress cannot, and should \nnot attempt to, dictate what Americans believe, think, or say about the \nflag and whatever it represents to individuals.\n  That said, Congress should have authority to protect this unique \nsymbol from at least physical desecration. The Supreme Court stripped \neven that authority from Congress in 1990 when it held that physical \ndesecration is ``speech'' protected by the First Amendment. I believe \nthe Court was wrong in that conclusion, but because the Court claimed \nto speak for the Constitution, the only way for Congress once again to \nhave authority to protect the flag is by amending the Constitution.\n  In his farewell address in 1796, President George Washington said \nthat the very basis of our political system is the right of the people \nto make and to alter the Constitution. The Constitution belongs to the \npeople, not to the Supreme Court. As a result, the American people must \nhave the opportunity to decide whether their Constitution should allow \nCongress to protect the flag.\n  The amendment we introduce today is as simple as it can be. It \nstates: ``The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of the flag of the United States.'' Unfortunately, \nsimplicity does not prevent distortion, either by negligence or \nintention. Critics and some in the media have led many to believe that \nthis amendment by itself bans flag desecration. It does not. In fact, \nshould Congress propose and the states ratify this amendment, it might \nnot result in any change in the law at all. That would be up to \nCongress and the people we represent to decide.\n  The issue is that today Congress is today prohibited by the Supreme \nCourt from passing laws that protect the flag even if 100 percent of \nthe American people wanted those laws and the Congress was ready to \nenact them.\n  The American people should be given the opportunity to decide whether \nthey want their Constitution to allow their Congress to pass laws \nprotecting the American flag. That is the way a representative \ndemocracy like ours should function. The Supreme Court distorted that \nprocess and this amendment will correct the Court's error. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, as many of you have done in the \npast, to support this amendment and to give this decision back to the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/14/senate-section/article/S3784-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 466.
