Madam President, I move that the Senate resume \nconsideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2343, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time until 2 p.m. be equally divided and controlled \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, with the Republicans \ncontrolling the first 30 minutes and the majority controlling the \nsecond 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 2343, a bill to amend the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 to extend the reduced interest rate for \n     Federal Direct Stafford Loans, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the clerk just read the matter before the \nSenate, which is to prevent the interest rate on loans students receive \nto go to school--the money they borrow--from doubling from 3.4 percent \nto 6.8 percent. That is the pending matter before the Senate.\n  Yesterday the Republicans continued to filibuster our plan to prevent \nthat from happening. We do not want the rates to double. We don't want \nthem to go up at all. There are 30,000 people in Nevada who are \ndepending on our doing something to freeze those rates. But what is \nworse, in my estimation--and I think that of the American people--is \nthat Republicans seem proud of blocking this legislation. Not a single \nRepublican voted to allow the debate to go forward.\n  This isn't an issue of saying: OK, if I vote for this, this will be \nthe legislation. They would not even let us go forward to debate it. \nThey have said they like the bill, except they do not like the way it \nis paid for. Fine. Let's get on the bill and offer amendments to pay \nfor it. But no--every single Republican voted no. Every single \nRepublican said: We are not going to allow a debate.\n  The American people certainly shouldn't be surprised because this has \nbeen going on for 3 years, almost 4 years. Everything is a fight. They \nare blocking legislation that would allow us to stop the increase of \nthe rate on student loans. That is wrong. And the person who signed \nthis legislation into law, making this interest rate such as it is, was \nPresident Bush. So I hope Republicans will come to their senses and \nwork with us to accomplish this, but I am not holding my breath \nbecause, as I indicated, they seem proud they have stopped another \npiece of legislation altogether.\n  Now, what does this mean, that they are hanging together to stop \nlegislation, to stop progress? Well, as we work to create jobs and make \ncollege affordable, our colleagues--my Republican friends on the other \nside of the aisle--operate under a different set of priorities.\n  In the House, for example, there are efforts now underway to undo a \nhard-fought agreement of last August to cut more than $2 trillion from \nthe deficit over the next decade. That agreement came after threats by \nthe tea party-\n\n[[Page S2990]]\n\ndriven House--and now 40 percent of the people over here are tea party \nadvocates--to shut down the government. And they wanted to do that in a \ncouple of different ways: not allowing us to continue funding for \ngovernment programs, and then, for the first time ever, there was a \nknockdown, drag-out fight over weeks and weeks as to whether we should \nincrease the debt ceiling in this country. During President Reagan's \ntime in running the country, this had been done dozens of times. But, \nno, these folks will do nothing without a big fight. As a result of \nthat, we came to an agreement that was bipartisan. Now, some say the \nagreement was forced upon the Republicans, but they voted for it, an \nagreement to reduce the deficit, and the deficit we couldn't reduce \nbefore August of last year. We said: OK, fine, if we don't do something \nabout it this year, then there will be automatic cuts called \nsequestration.\n\n  Now the House is doing everything they can to walk away from the \nagreement we made and the bipartisan vote we took. They are doing \neverything they can. They have a Republican budget, the so-called Ryan \nbudget. And I say ``so-called'' because they are trying to make a \nreconciliation bill, but they can't do it because they are not \nfollowing the law to do that. So they not only have reneged on this \nbicameral, bipartisan agreement to reduce spending, but they have \nfundamentally skewed priorities because they hand out even more tax \nbreaks to multimillionaires and shield corporate defense contractors, \nall at the expense of hard-working, middle-class families, the elderly, \nand those who can least afford it. That is what they are doing in the \nHouse. They are going to have a so-called rule today and vote on it \nshortly thereafter. They would slash investments to strengthen our \neconomy and just shred our social safety nets.\n  I want to quote from President Dwight Eisenhower. And let me remind \neverybody that he was a Republican. He was a tremendous President, and \neach day that goes by, people are looking at him more favorably. Here \nis what he said:\n\n       Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every \n     rocket fired, signifies in the final sense a theft from those \n     who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and not \n     clothed.\n\n  This isn't some leftwing, socialistic-leaning liberal. That was \nDwight Eisenhower--a five-star general who led the invasion of Normandy \nand did many other things, such as starting the National Highway \nSystem. Let me repeat what he said:\n\n       Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every \n     rocket fired, signifies in the final sense a theft from those \n     who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and not \n     clothed.\n\n  I didn't make that up. That is what he said. In a balanced world--one \nwhere a strong national defense and a strong social safety net are both \nvaluable pillars of a successful society--that need not necessarily be \ntrue, is what President Eisenhower said. But the Republican plan would \nenshrine into law a set of unbalanced priorities and ensure the kind of \nterrible math General Eisenhower envisioned.\n  Unlike defense contractors and billionaires, ordinary Americans don't \nhave high-priced lobbyists to protect them. That is our job. That is \nour job. There is not a person on this side of the aisle who doesn't \nbelieve it is good that we have wealthy people in America. We have \nSenators here, Democrats, who are wealthy--certainly not all Democrats, \nbut there are some. We don't look down on people who are rich, but we \ndo have to look out for people who are in need of our help. Most of \nthese rich people have all kinds of lobbyists here to help them, but \nthe people in Henderson, Ely, and Winnemucca, NV, don't have people \nhere to help them. They have us. So Republicans are going after those \nwho can't fight back--hard-working Americans and struggling families.\n  Let's review a little bit of history again. The sequester isn't the \nfirst bipartisan agreement to reduce the deficit. When I became the \nDemocratic leader, I thought--having served on the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs in the House of Representatives and being very interested in \nAmerica's involvement in foreign affairs, I took a trip to Central and \nSouth America. That was so necessary. And I took Democratic and \nRepublican Senators with me. I was very careful in picking two Senators \nwhom I wanted on that trip. One was Judd Gregg, a very fine Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, who has retired, I am sorry to say. I recommended \nthat Senator Gregg be a part of President Obama's initial Cabinet. He \nagreed to take the job, but something came up, and he didn't do it. But \nhe is a wonderful man. I also wanted Kent Conrad on that trip. And I \ndon't know which one knows more about the inner workings of the \nfinances of this country, Gregg or Conrad, but they are both good, and \nI wanted them to go together, and they did.\n  Senators Gregg and Conrad spent hours and hours seated in that \nairplane working on doing something about the deficit. They both \nbelieved it needed some really difficult, hard work, and they decided \nto do what the base-closing commission did; that is, prepare \nlegislation and give it to a commission that would send it back to us. \nThere would be no amendments, no filibuster, just an up-or-down vote. \nThat was their legislation. They wrote that and brought it to the \nfloor.\n  As the leader, I decided I would move to proceed to it, and so I did \nmove to proceed to it, thinking it should be a slam dunk. But seven \nRepublicans, who had cosponsored the legislation, voted against it. I \ncouldn't bring it to the floor. That was where Bowles-Simpson came \nfrom, as a result of the Republicans walking away from their own \nefforts to reduce the deficit.\n  Now, Bowles-Simpson was very difficult. There were 18 members, and \nthey had to get 14 of the 18 to approve it. That didn't work. They \ncouldn't get that many people to vote for it.\n  In the meantime, President Obama was working as hard as he could with \nthe lead spokesman of the Republicans, the Speaker of the House, John \nBoehner. John Boehner said: I didn't get elected to do small things, I \nwant to do big things. And President Obama, to his detriment with his \nbase, said: I will do something to change Social Security and Medicare. \nAnd all these things he agreed to do publicly. But the Republicans--\nJohn Boehner--could never go against Grover Norquist. The Republicans \nshake in their boots. They will not do anything, even though the \nAmerican people by a more than 70 percent majority say people making \nmore than $1 million a year should contribute to what the problems are \nin this country. So that fell apart.\n  Then we had the Gang of 6 Senators--three Republicans, three \nDemocrats--who had been on the Bowles-Simpson Commission, who said we \nshould do something about this. They were in the press, they had press \nconferences, and this was going down the road and doing all kinds of \ngreat things. While that was going on, there was a decision made, and a \nlaw was passed to create a supercommittee, to which I appointed Senator \nPatty Murray of Washington to run. No one in the Senate, Democrat or \nRepublican, has more respect than Patty Murray. She worked so hard with \nthe other 11 Members of Congress to come up with something.\n  A few days before they were to arrive at a decision--and the Gang of \n6 members are out here doing all this stuff all the time--I get a \nletter signed by virtually every Republican Senator saying: We are not \ngoing to raise revenue for anything. The supercommittee didn't work \nthere. The Gang of 6 is gone. So we passed this last August to fund \ngovernment for 2 years and to say if we don't arrive at another $1.2 \ntrillion in deficit reduction during this year, it automatically kicks \nin at the end of this year or the beginning of next year.\n  So that is where we are, and the Republicans in the House are trying \nto change that. So that is what this little history lesson has been all \nabout.\n  I don't like to sequester. I wish we didn't have to do it. It was a \nhard pill to swallow, but it was the right thing to do. If we are ever \ngoing to reduce the staggering deficit, we are going to have to make \nsome hard decisions. So that is what this is all about. But that is the \npoint: It is hard to do; therefore, we have to do it, to sequester--\nwhich, in effect, would take almost $500 billion from domestic programs \nand almost $500 billion from defense programs. They were designed to be \ntough enough to force two sides to reach a balanced deal. It hasn't \nhappened yet.\n  As I said earlier with General Eisenhower's statement, I didn't make \nthat\n\n[[Page S2991]]\n\nup. That is what he said. My complaint about the Republicans being so \nunreasonable about everything is something where I am not a lone wolf \ncrying in the wilderness. We have two long-time nonpartisan watchers of \nCongress, one from the American Enterprise Institute, which is a \nconservative think tank, another from Brookings Institute that wrote an \narticle saying: It is the Republicans. Can't you see what they are \ndoing? Here is one thing they said:\n\n       We have been studying Washington politics in Congress for \n     more than 40 years, and never have we seen them this \n     dysfunctional. In our past writings, we have criticized both \n     parties when we believed it was warranted. Today, however, we \n     have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the \n     problem lies with the Republican party.\n\n  They further said:\n\n       The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American \n     politics. It is ideologically extreme; of scornful \n     compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, \n     evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its \n     political opposition.\n\n  What brave men to do that, to write these comments--which are true. I \nhave been saying that I don't want to fight about everything. \nRepublicans insist on balancing the budget on the backs of the middle \nclass, seniors, students, single mothers, and those who could least \nafford it. That is what they are doing over there today. It is their \nrefusal to compromise that leaves us facing the threat of sequester, \nand it is difficult but it is balanced.\n  Going back to the August budget agreement now in order to protect \nwealthy special interests is no solution. Neither is refighting the \nbattles of last year. Democrats agree we must reduce our deficits and \nmake hard choices, but we believe in a balanced approach that shares \nthe pain as well as the responsibility.\n  Is the sequester the best way to achieve that balance? No. But \nRepublicans refuse to consider a more reasonable approach--one, for \nexample, that asks every American to pay his fair share while making \ndifficult choices to reduce spending. Democrats will not agree to a \none-sided solution that lets the superwealthy off the hook while \nforcing the middle class and those in greatest need to bear all the \nhardship.\n  Democrats believe we can protect Americans' access to health care, \ncreate jobs while investing in the future, and protect the poor and \nelderly. But we can't do it alone. It will take work and compromise, \nand so far Republicans have been unwilling to make a serious effort to \nachieve that result.\n  Republicans have rejected our balanced approach. Their one-sided \nsolution to across-the-board cuts would take away from the many to give \nto the few.\n  Here is what the plan would do--not all of it, but here is what their \nplan would do. Remember, they are taking it up over there in the House \ntoday.\n  It would cut Medicaid benefits, increasing the number of uninsured \nchildren, parents, seniors--and that is in addition to people with \ndisabilities--by hundreds of thousands, just eliminate them. It would \nalso put seniors in nursing homes at risk. Some of them would have to \nmove out of the nursing home, I guess.\n  It would punish Americans who receive tax credits to purchase health \ninsurance when their financial circumstances change, causing 350,000 \nAmericans to have no coverage. This would add to the tens of millions \nwho already exist that way.\n  It would weaken Wall Street reforms, protecting big banks at the \nexpense of consumers. Their legislation would once again target middle-\nclass workers, food inspectors, air traffic controllers, Border Patrol \nagents, drug enforcement, and FBI agents. They would have to be laid \noff.\n  It would cut funding for preventive health care programs that fight \nchronic illnesses--such as heart disease, cancer, strokes, and \ndiabetes--that cause 70 percent of the deaths in America. Preventive \ncare would be reined in.\n  It would slash block grant funding in the United States to help 23 \nmillion children, seniors, and disabled Americans live independently \nand out of poverty.\n  No segment of the population is immune from this painful, absurd \nRepublican plan--except maybe millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy \ncorporations. The Republican proposal cuts Meals on Wheels and reduces \nfood assistance for almost 2 million needy people. One of the \nRepublican candidates running for President said President Obama is the \nFood Stamp President.\n  There are more poor people. Our economy has been in bad shape. People \nare struggling. The millionaires are doing fine. And in addition to \nwhat I have already mentioned, this thing that they are taking up in \nthe House today cuts off almost 300,000 children from free school \nlunches at a time when one in five children lives in poverty.\n  The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said the Republican plan \nfails ``a basic moral test.'' This budget sets very clear priorities. \nThe problem is what they are taking up in the House sets up the wrong \npriorities.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt said:\n\n       Human kindness has never weakened the stamina or softened \n     the fiber of a free people. A nation does not have to be \n     cruel to be tough.\n\n  So Republicans would do well to remember our Nation is judged not \nonly by the strength of its military, but also by the strength of its \nvalues, so says General Eisenhower and President Roosevelt.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                          Skeptical Americans\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, with President Obama officially on \nthe campaign trail now, it is hard not to be reminded of the kind of \ncandidate he was the last time around and to marvel at the difference.\n  At some point the postpartisan healer who pledged to unite Red and \nBlue America became the ``divider in chief,'' a deeply divisive \nPresident who never seems to miss an opportunity to pit one group \nagainst another and who is now determined to win reelection not by \nappealing to America's best instincts but all too often to its worst.\n  Even the New York Times editorial page, this very morning, says the \ncountry is more divided than it was 4 years ago under this President. \nSome have argued that the transformation we have witnessed proves that \nthe President was a liberal ideologue all along, that the task of \ngoverning revealed his true instincts. That may be true. But there is \nan even simpler explanation than that, and one that in some ways is \neven more disappointing. It is the idea that the President said what he \nneeded to say to get elected then and that he will say whatever he \nneeds to say to get reelected now.\n  It encapsulates why the American people are so very skeptical of \npoliticians. The President's policies may have disappointed. A health \ncare bill that was supposed to lower costs is causing them to rise. A \nstimulus bill that was supposed to create jobs was better at generating \npunch lines. But one of the greatest disappointments of this Presidency \nis the difference between the kind of leader this President said he was \nand the kind he has turned out to be.\n  How did that happen? Well, I think the President just put too much \nfaith in government. Let's face it; there isn't a problem we face that \nthis President didn't think the government could solve. Despite all the \nevidence to the contrary, he still can't seem to shake the idea that \nmore government is the answer for what ails us.\n  When the stimulus failed, it wasn't the government's fault; it was \nthe Republicans. When the health care bill caused health care costs to \nrise, the same thing. When trillions are spent and jobs don't come, it \nis ATM machines, it is the weather, it is bankers, it is the rich, it \nis Fox News--it is anything other than the government.\n  This is why the sickening waste of taxpayer dollars we have seen so \nmany times over the last 3 years--whether it was at a solar company \nsuch as Solyndra or at a lavish party that Federal bureaucrats threw \nfor themselves in Vegas--is viewed not as a symptom of a larger problem \nin Washington but as a problem to be managed, something to acknowledge \nand then move beyond because they just don't seem to see it. The \nPresident seems to view government the way some parents view their \nchildren: It can do no wrong.\n\n[[Page S2992]]\n\n  So if there is a problem to solve, a challenge to tackle, the \nsolution is always the same: more government, more government. And the \nresults are always the same: a disappointment to be blamed on \nsomebody--anybody--else.\n  I think the President summed it up pretty well during a speech he \ngave in New York just yesterday. This is what he said:\n\n       The only way we can accelerate job creation that takes \n     place on a scale that is needed is bold action from Congress.\n\n  Really? The only way to accelerate job creation is through Congress? \nNot the private sector? Hasn't the experience of the last 3\\1/2\\ years \ntaught this President anything at all about the limitations of \ngovernment action?\n  Madam President, 3\\1/2\\ years and $5 trillion later, there are nearly \na half million fewer jobs in the country than the day the President \ntook office. That is not what most people would describe as a good \nreturn on investment. Yet that is all we get--the same government-\ndriven solutions he has been pushing for 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  Nearly 13 million Americans who are actively looking for jobs can't \nfind one. Millions more have given up looking for a job altogether as \nthe worker participation rate is the lowest it has been in 30 years.\n  More than half of all college graduates--the best prepared to enter \nthe workforce--can't find a good job. More than half of college \ngraduates can't find a job. And this President is proposing the same \nold ideas that have failed before. Some government action failed? Then \njust do it again on a larger scale. That is the approach this President \nhas taken. It is his approach still. It is the clearest sign he is \nliterally out of ideas.\n  But he is unwilling to try something different. He is unwilling to \nconfront the fact that a government that might have worked well a half \ncentury ago is outdated and in desperate need of reform. So he is \nresorting to the same old political gimmicks and games that he \ncriticizes others for using.\n  Earlier this year the President mocked those who, every time gas \nprices go up, dust off their three-point plans to lower them, \nespecially in an election year. That was the President. Yet yesterday \nhe was proposing a five-point plan of his own to revive the economy, a \nto-do list in effect for Congress.\n  The cynicism is literally breathtaking. Here is a President who, in \nthe morning, worked hand-in-hand with Senate Democrats to ensure that \nlegislation to freeze interest rates on student loans wouldn't pass, \nand in the afternoon gave a recycled speech in which he pleaded for an \nend to the very gridlock he was orchestrating. There is perhaps no \nbetter illustration of how far this President has come from the heady \ndays of his last campaign.\n  Look: Americans voted this President into office on a promise of \nbipartisan action.\n  Orchestrating political show votes on student loans and giving \nCongress a post-it note checklist of legislative items to pass before \nthe election is not what the American people expected.\n  They expected us to work together and they still do.\n  The President knows as well as I do that the solution to our economic \nproblems lies not in a Post-It-Note congressional agenda dictated from \na lectern in New York, but through a sound limited-government pro-\ngrowth plan, which includes comprehensive tax reform, a true all-of-\nthe-above energy policy and the elimination of burdensome regulations \nthat are hurting business and hindering job creation.\n  Republicans have been calling for these policies for years and the \nPresident at one time or another has claimed to support them. These are \nproposals where Republicans and Democrats can find common ground. In \nother words, a plan designed not to control free enterprise from \nWashington but to liberate it. We just need the President to show some \ncourage and leadership.\n  We will get this economy going not by handing out more special favors \nand credits to favored industries and groups, but by simplifying the \ncode, clearing out the loopholes, and lowering rates for everybody.\n  In less than 8 months, Americans will be hit with the biggest tax \nincrease in history--unless we act.\n  The President knows as well as I do how devastating this would be for \nthe American people--for everyone.\n  People who are already struggling will have to do with even less. \nBusinesses that are already struggling just to keep afloat will see \nWashington getting an even bigger take than it already is.\n  This looming tax hike will be absolutely devastating. Yet here we are \nless than 8 months away from it, and the President is busy \norchestrating failure in the Senate and waving around some 5-point plan \ncooked up by some high-paid political consultant in Chicago.\n  Now, I am not in the business of giving the President campaign \nadvice. But I am in the business of trying to get the best possible \noutcome for the American people. And here is an issue--tax reform--\nwhere I know the two parties have a shot at working together to help \nthis economy, and restore the American Dream for all those who've \nstarted to doubt whether it will even be there in a few years.\n  So I would respectfully ask the President to ignore his campaign \nconsultants for once and do what's right for the nation as a whole. \nRepublicans in Congress are ready to work with you, Mr. President, on \nthe kind of comprehensive reforms that you yourself have called for in \nthe past.\n  Working together might not help your campaign, but it would help the \ncountry. So my message to you is this: We are ready when you are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. I ask consent to address the Senate as in morning hour.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Startup Act\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, once again, it is that time of year when \nmany proud parents will watch their children walk across the graduation \nstage to receive their diplomas. Two years ago, I watched my oldest \ndaughter saunter across her college graduation stage and it was one of \nthose moments for me in which I realized our country faces tremendous, \nenormous challenges, and if we fail to act our children's future will \nbe at significant risk.\n  I believe all Members of Congress, in fact every American, has the \nresponsibility to be a good steward of what has been passed on to us. \nAt that graduation event, I renewed my commitment to do my part to turn \nour country around.\n  My fear is we are not doing enough, that we as Americans and \nespecially we as Members of this Congress are not doing enough to offer \nour children a bright future. In the last 2 weeks, I have read \nheadlines that caught my attention. They would catch every American's \nattention.\n  First, the amount of student loan debt has surpassed $1 trillion for \nthe first time in American history. Americans now have more combined \nstudent loan debt than combined credit card debt.\n  Second, the AP recently reported that one out of every two college \ngraduates this year will be unemployed or underemployed. Unfortunately, \nit is not just college graduates who are having trouble finding a job \nand paying their bills. The Department of Labor reported just last week \nthat more than 12 million Americans are still looking for work and our \neconomy only added 115,000 jobs in April, the lowest number of jobs \nadded in 5 months. This makes 39 straight months of unemployment rate \nover 8 percent.\n  Our first priority in Congress must be to strengthen our economy so \nmore jobs can be created, more Americans can get back to work, and more \ngraduates can pursue their dreams. Data tells us that for close to \nthree decades, companies less than 5 years old created almost all the \nnew net jobs in America, averaging 3 million jobs each year. While \nstartups provide the gasoline to fuel America's economic engine, new \nbusinesses are hiring fewer employees than in the past and make up a \nsmaller share of all companies than in previous years.\n  Troubling data out last week from the Census Bureau shows that the \nstartup rate fell to the lowest point on record for new firm births in \n2010. While startup companies are so important to job creation, their \nnumbers are now falling too. Given the disproportionate impact new \nbusinesses have on\n\n[[Page S2993]]\n\nthe economy, it makes sense to craft targeted policies that help \nentrepreneurs start businesses and that make it easier for these young \nbusinesses to grow.\n  A former NASA engineer now in the technology field gave me a useful \nanalogy. He described the process of designing a rocket or an airplane, \nin which there are two forces at play that determine whether the rocket \nwill launch or plane will fly: thrust and drag. So much of what we want \nto do around here tends to focus on the thrust, spending money and \ncreating programs, when what we ought to be doing is focusing on \nreducing the drag.\n  Rather than spend money on government programs, Congress must and \nshould enact policies that create an environment in which many \nentrepreneurs and their young companies have a better shot at success, \nand in the process of pursuing success they put people to work--reduce \nthe drag so the private sector can create jobs.\n  To create this environment where these startup companies can be \nsuccessful, I have introduced the Startup Act with Senator Warner. The \nStartup Act reforms the Federal regulatory process to ensure that the \ncost of compliance does not outweigh the benefits of regulations. The \nStartup Act alters the Tax Code to create incentives that will \nfacilitate the financing and growth of new businesses. The Startup Act \naccelerates the commercialization of university research so more good \nideas move out of the laboratory and into the marketplace, where they \ncan create jobs for Americans.\n  Perhaps most important, the Startup Act helps America win the global \nbattle for talent.\n  On a recent trip to Silicon Valley, I met with startups, \nentrepreneurs, and some of the leading technology companies in the \nworld--and they were just startup companies a few years ago. While I \nheard many encouraging stories of success, their No. 1 concern was \nattracting and retaining highly skilled employees. One business I met \nsaid they had plans to hire dozens--I think the number was 68--foreign-\nborn but U.S.-educated individuals and to hire them here in the United \nStates, but they were unable to get the visas necessary to have these \nworkers work in the United States. Rather than lose that talent, this \ncompany hired the employees but placed them at various international \noffices in countries with immigration policies that encouraged the \nretention and attraction of highly skilled foreign-born workers.\n  Another company told me that with the talent increasing overseas, it \nwill soon be easier for them to open offices and plants in other \ncountries rather than have the work done in the United States.\n  The last thing we want is for American businesses to have a better \nbusiness climate in places outside the United States. It is not just \nthe loss of those dozens of jobs to some other country; many of those \npeople in those businesses will become entrepreneurs themselves and \ncreate their own businesses, hiring even more people down the road. So \nwe lose this talent, this skill on two occasions--first, the direct \njobs today and ultimately the jobs these entrepreneurs will create in \nthe future.\n  The future of our economic competitiveness depends upon America \nwinning the global battle for talent. Foreign-born Americans have a \nstrong record of creating businesses and employing Americans. Data \nshows us that 53 percent of immigrant founders of U.S.-based technology \nand engineering companies completed their highest degree at an American \nuniversity, and rather than send these talented, highly educated \nindividuals who have been educated in the United States back home once \nthey graduate, we should do much more to allow them to remain in the \nUnited States, where their skills, their talents, and their intellect, \nas well as their new ideas, can fuel U.S. economic growth.\n  We are not talking about illegal immigration; we are talking about \nlegal immigration. It makes no sense to educate these talented, \nforeign-born students in America and then send them to their home \ncountries to compete against Americans for jobs.\n  The Startup Act will help America win this global battle for talent. \nThe Startup Act creates entrepreneur visas for foreign entrepreneurs \nwho register a business and employ Americans in the United States. By \nencouraging more entrepreneurs to stay in America, they will not only \nstart more businesses but they will employ more Americans and \nstrengthen our economy. The Startup Act also creates a new STEM visa \nfor foreign students who graduate from an accredited U.S. university \nwith a master's or Ph.D. in science, technology, engineering or \nmathematics. Our own Department of Commerce projects that STEM jobs \nwill grow by 17 percent in the years ahead. We have to retain more \nhighly skilled and highly talented and educated individuals, the ones \nwe educate in America, for us to remain competitive in a global \neconomy. We are going to make sure our own U.S.-born and educated \ncitizens have those job opportunities as well. We do not want to risk \nthe loss of the next Mark Zuckerberg to Brazil or India. Doing so will \nfuel America's economic growth and result in the creation of jobs here \nin America by retaining these folks.\n\n  Despite the overwhelming evidence, Congress should address this \nissue. Congress's conventional wisdom says not much will get done. My \nguess is 80 percent of my colleagues in Congress would agree with the \nproposals contained in this legislation. Particularly, 80 percent I \nthink would agree with the aspect of the legislation dealing with STEM \nvisas. But we are told that because we cannot do everything, we cannot \ndo anything. That excuse is no longer a good one and should not be \naccepted. We cannot continue to operate under the sentence that always \nsays we can't do anything in an election year. Our country desperately \nneeds us to act now, not later. In fact, in the short time I have been \na Member of the Senate--about 14, 15 months--six other countries have \nchanged their laws to encourage these types of individuals to work in \ntheir countries, to create jobs, to support entrepreneurship, \ninnovation, and job creation in those countries. In just the little \nover 1 year I have been a Member of the Senate, six other countries \nhave advanced further than we have while we have waited because we \ncannot do anything because it is an election year.\n  America cannot turn a blind eye to those developments or to use the \nupcoming elections as an excuse to do nothing, yet again, on an issue \nthat is so critical to our future. Congress should work to make it \neasier for companies to grow because in a free market, when people have \na good idea and work hard, they not only enhance their own with success \nbut the lives of so many others through the products and jobs they \ncreate.\n  If we do not take the steps now to win the global battle for talent, \nour country's future economic growth will be limited. That means \ncollege grads and young people will have fewer opportunities, and \nhigher rates of unemployment may become the norm instead of the \nexception. Allowing talented, foreign-born U.S. students and \nentrepreneurs to remain in the United States will create jobs for more \nAmericans.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to implement \npolicies such as those contained in the Startup Act so more \nentrepreneurs can turn their ideas into reality, that they will have \nthe chance for success. We owe the next generation of Americans the \nopportunity to pursue their dreams--that those who this month walk \nacross the graduation stages in high schools and colleges and \nuniversities, technical colleges and community colleges across our \ncountry, will have the opportunity to pursue what we all know as the \nAmerican dream.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    National Flood Insurance Program\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I come to the floor again to urge all of \nus to join together on a bipartisan basis and to reauthorize the \nnational flood insurance program, to do it now, to do it quickly \nbecause time is running out. On May 31 the entire National Flood \nInsurance Program will expire. When the clock strikes midnight that \nday, it will be gone unless\n\n[[Page S2994]]\n\nwe act, and act we must. This is an important program for the country.\n\n  In my neck of the woods, in south Louisiana in particular, almost \nevery real estate closing is dependent on this program because those \nproperties need flood insurance for there to be a closing, which is \nvery typical in many other parts of the country. So here we are trying \nto get out of a real estate-led recession, trying to bolster the \neconomy, and we are on the verge of letting the entire National Flood \nInsurance Program expire yet again.\n  What is so frustrating about this is there are not big disagreements \nabout how to get this done. This is not an overly partisan issue; we \nare not bitterly divided. This is merely an issue of getting floor time \nin the Senate.\n  The House acted last year in a bipartisan way, and the Senate \ncommittee on which I serve has acted. I have worked very closely with \nmy subcommittee chair Jon Tester, and we have acted in a bipartisan \nway. We have put together a good 5-year reauthorization bill, but we \nneed to move this on and off the Senate floor to get this done before \nthe end of the month.\n  Again, I urge the distinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, to \ngive this important matter floor time. We all come here and talk about \nneeding to improve the economy. We all come to the floor and talk about \njobs. Well, it is absolutely necessary in all of those categories, with \nall of those issues in mind, to extend the National Flood Insurance \nProgram. And let's not just put a bandaid on it again and let it limp \nalong with a very short-term extension. Let's do the full 5-year \nreauthorization, which we can do, which is well in sight.\n  Groups around the country, particularly those working in the real \nestate industry and in this part of the economy, strongly support this \neffort.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord several items, including a letter to Senator Reid and Senator \nMcConnell signed by dozens of associations all along the political \nspectrum, urging this action.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 7, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: On \n     behalf of the undersigned associations, we respectfully urge \n     the Senate to move quickly to reauthorize the National Flood \n     Insurance Program (NFIP) and avoid a costly lapse in the \n     program on May 31, 2012.\n       As you know, more than 5.6 million policyholders in 21,000 \n     communities nationwide depend on the NFIP as their main \n     source of protection against property losses that result from \n     flooding. Without flood insurance, many residential and \n     commercial real estate transactions across the country will \n     come to a stop, as federally backed mortgage loans cannot \n     legally be secured without this critical protection. Failing \n     to reauthorize the NFIP could jeopardize nearly 40,000 \n     mortgage closings per month, according to the National \n     Association of REALTORS.\n       In 2011, Hurricanes Irene and Lee caused significant \n     flooding from North Carolina to Maine. Those storms followed \n     more than one hundred natural catastrophe events and \n     significant spring 2011 flooding in several states across the \n     country. We are about to enter hurricane season again, and \n     America cannot afford a lapse of the program. Failure to \n     reauthorize the NFIP would further stress already struggling \n     real estate markets, potentially cost the government billions \n     of dollars in uncompensated relief efforts, and put millions \n     of consumers at risk.\n       In July 2011, the House of Representatives passed a bi-\n     partisan measure, H.R. 1309, by a vote of 406-22. On \n     September 9, 2011, the Senate Banking Committee unanimously \n     approved its version of the 5-year bill. Both proposals \n     include a long-term reauthorization and important reforms \n     that will optimize the current program, make needed \n     improvements to the floodplain mapping and appeals processes, \n     and other key reforms that will encourage program \n     participation and put the NFIP back on the path to sound \n     financial footing.\n       We urge the full Senate to act now to reauthorize this \n     program and avoid the costly consequences that would result \n     in a lapse from failure to act.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Bankers Association; American Bankers Insurance \n     Association; American Insurance Association; American Land \n     Title Association; American Resort Development Association; \n     Chamber Southwest LA; Consumer Bankers Association; Council \n     of Insurance Agents and Brokers; Credit Union National \n     Association; The Financial Services Roundtable; Houma-\n     Terrebonne Chamber of Commerce; Independent Community Bankers \n     of America; International Council of Shopping Centers; \n     Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America; Mortgage \n     Bankers Association; NAIOP, Commercial Real Estate \n     Development Association; National Association of Federal \n     Credit Unions; National Association of Home Builders; \n     National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies; National \n     Association of REALTORS'; National Apartment \n     Association; National Multi-Housing Council; National Ready \n     Mixed Concrete Association; Property Casualty Insurers \n     Association of America; Reinsurance Association of America; \n     Risk and Insurance Management Society, Inc. (RIMS).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record another letter along the same vein addressed to Senator \nTester, the subcommittee chair, and myself, the ranking member on the \nsubcommittee, again strongly supporting this effort. Let's do it. Let's \ndo it now. This is the SmarterSafer coalition, and this letter is dated \nMay 9.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Americans for Smart Natural\n\n\n                                           Catastrophe Policy,\n\n                                                      May 9, 2012.\n     Hon. Jon Tester,\n     Chair, Economic Policy Subcommittee, Senate Banking \n         Committee, Washington DC.\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     Ranking Member, Economic Policy Subcommittee, Senate Banking \n         Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Tester and Vitter: As a diverse coalition of \n     taxpayer advocates, environmental organizations, insurance \n     industry interests, housing groups and others, we thank you \n     for your efforts to reauthorize and reform the National Flood \n     Insurance Program (NFIP). The hearing you are holding today \n     is a positive step to getting the full Senate to consider and \n     pass the Banking Committee-passed bill to reform NFIP, which \n     as you know is in need of serious reform. The program is \n     currently almost $18 billion in debt to federal taxpayers and \n     that amount is likely to increase if reforms to the program \n     are not implemented. Without significant reform, the NFIP \n     will not be sustainable and American taxpayers will continue \n     to be asked to bailout the program time and time again.\n       The Senate Banking Committee has already unanimously \n     reported out a bill that makes a number of needed reforms to \n     put the flood insurance program on sound financial footing \n     and the House passed NFIP reform with over 400 votes. The \n     bill will phase out risky, unwarranted subsidies that have \n     undermined the financial stability of the program; will allow \n     NFIP to purchase reinsurance to help NFIP pay future claims \n     while protecting taxpayers from these otherwise inevitable \n     costs; will require FEMA to ensure maps are updated and \n     accurate so that people understand and can better prepare for \n     their risks; and will streamline and strengthen mitigation \n     programs to help decrease flood risks and strengthen flood-\n     exposed communities, homes, and businesses.\n       The Banking Committee has taken a needed step to reforming \n     the nation's flood insurance program and Smarter Safer joins \n     a range of stakeholder groups in applauding this legislation. \n     We urge the full Senate to quickly pass this needed reform to \n     NFIP so that the House and Senate can begin to resolve the \n     differences and quickly get a bill to the President's desk.\n       We look forward to working with you on this issue and thank \n     you for all of your efforts to pass this critical \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     SmarterSafer.\n       Environmental Organizations: American Rivers, Ceres, Clean \n     Air-Cool Planet, Defenders of Wildlife, Environmental Defense \n     Fund, National Wildlife Federation, Republicans for \n     Environmental Protection, Sierra Club.\n       Consumer and Taxpayer Advocates: American Conservative \n     Union, American Consumer Institute, Competitive Enterprise \n     Institute, Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n       Insurer Interests: Allianz of America, Association of \n     Bermuda Insurers and Reinsurers, Chubb, Liberty Mutual Group, \n     National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, \n     Reinsurance Association of America, Swiss Re, USAA.\n       Housing: National Low Income Housing Coalition, National \n     Leased Housing Association.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to also have \nprinted in the Record an op-ed in Roll Call written by two \nrepresentatives of this broad coalition again explaining the absolute \nimportance and the critical nature of doing this full, longer term \nreauthorization.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Roll Call, May 8, 2012]\n\n       Sampson & Veissi: End Flood Insurance Program Uncertainty\n\n                   (By David Sampson and Moe Veissi)\n\n       When Gerald Ford took the Presidential Oath of Office after \n     Richard Nixon's resignation, he reminded Congress and the \n     American people that ``even though this is late in\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\n     an election year, there is no way we can go forward except \n     together and no way anybody can win except by serving the \n     people's urgent needs.''\n       Congress would do well to heed his words as we approach a \n     watershed election this November.\n       Despite widespread partisan gridlock on Capitol Hill, at \n     least one opportunity for bicameral, bipartisan consensus \n     exists: reauthorizing the National Flood Insurance Program \n     (NFIP).\n       The flood program sits in limbo, set to expire on May 31. \n     Extending the NFIP must be a top congressional priority. The \n     NFIP provides vital flood protection for more than 5.6 \n     million home and business owners in 21,000 communities across \n     the country. Furthermore, the housing market relies on a \n     strong and stable flood insurance program.\n       A lack of flood insurance coverage creates uncertainty in \n     the housing market and leaves homeowners dangerously \n     vulnerable to devastating floods, which are not just a \n     coastal issue. Flood disasters have been declared in every \n     state and over the past century have claimed more lives and \n     property than any other natural disaster.\n       In 2010, the NFIP was allowed to lapse for 53 days, halting \n     tens of thousands of real estate transactions in areas where \n     homebuyers are required to purchase flood insurance to obtain \n     a mortgage. Long-term reauthorization of the insurance \n     program would help provide the housing market with the \n     certainty it needs for a recovery.\n       The National Association of Realtors estimates that another \n     lapse in coverage could stall more than 1,300 home sales per \n     day. And disruptions in flood insurance availability leave \n     all taxpayers exposed to widespread, costly relief efforts.\n       We have witnessed encouraging signs from elected officials \n     in recent months.\n       The Senate Banking Committee passed a five-year \n     reauthorization bill at the end of 2011 and the bill now \n     awaits floor time.\n       Last summer, the House passed its five-year reauthorization \n     on a resounding, bipartisan vote of 406 22. Additionally, the \n     Obama Administration has heralded the House legislation and \n     urged Congress to adopt fundamental NFIP reforms.\n       This is progress, but it will be of little comfort to \n     homeowners if Congress does not act soon to pass a long-term \n     reauthorization for the NFIP.\n       As politics gets more polarized, Americans are looking for \n     signs that our elected officials can work together to address \n     real problems. Realtors and insurers stand together in \n     calling for Congress to put aside partisan differences and \n     bring much-needed certainty to a program on which so many \n     Americans rely.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I keep coming to the floor urging this \nbecause it is so important and because it is so achievable. Again, \nthere are not big issues dividing us. This is not a partisan issue. We \njust need Senate floor time to get it done. In that vein, I will be \ndoing two things today and in the near future.\n  First, I will be passing around to all Members of the Senate a new \nletter addressed to Senator Reid to urge that this matter be put on the \nfloor as soon as possible. In a letter dated February 14, we urged this \non a bipartisan basis, and 41 Senators, of both parties, signed that. \nThis new letter restates that case, and, of course, now it is more \nurgent than ever as the clock ticks to May 31--just 3 weeks and 1 day \naway.\n  I will also be proposing an amendment to the next matter that comes \non the Senate floor to incorporate the Senate bill with perfecting \namendments that have been worked out toward the floor to incorporate \nthat amendment on the next bill on the Senate floor. My understanding \nis that will either be the FDA user fee reauthorization or a small \nbusiness tax bill. Neither of those bills is bitterly partisan or \nhighly divisive. So I will be proposing as an amendment to either of \nthose bills--whichever comes to the floor next--the full \nreauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program along the lines \nthe Senate committee has proposed.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support \nthat effort. I urge Senator Reid to use that as a mechanism to get that \ndone now, this month, before the expiration of the program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Emissions Trading\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, in 2005 the European Union began their \nemissions trading scheme, which attempts to cap emissions of carbon \ndioxide from stationary sources within the EU.\n  Starting in 2012, civil aviation operators departing from or landing \nin Europe began to be included in this emissions scheme. Under this \nprogram, any airline, including non-European airlines flying into and \nout of Europe, will be required to pay for EU emissions allowances. \nThis change comes at a time when EU allowance prices continue to \ndecline to a little over 6 euros, and the commission is considering \nproposals to drive up the prices.\n  Allowances will be collected for the entirety of the flight, \nincluding portions in U.S. and international airspace. For example, \nthis means a flight leaving from Los Angeles, CA, and flying to London \nwould be taxed on the entirety of the flight, not just the fractional \npart of the flight that is over EU airspace. To put it another way, you \nwould be taxed as if 100 percent of your flight was in EU airspace even \nthough approximately only 7 percent of the flight actually was; that \nis, a flight originating in California here in the United States and \nflying to London.\n  Very simply, the unilateral imposition of such a scheme on the United \nStates and other countries is arbitrary, unfair, and a violation of \ninternational law. Plus, it is being done without any guarantees for \nenvironmental improvements and at a huge cost to the aviation industry \nand constituents we serve here in this country.\n  According to the International Air Transport Association, the \neconomic cost of this program for airlines is expected to be $1.3 \nbillion in 2012. Let me repeat that: $1.3 billion in 2012. It is \nexpected to reach as high as $3.5 billion by the year 2020. Those are \nrevenues coming out of the airlines in this country that would be used \nto pay for this fee--this tax, if you will--imposed by the EU on U.S. \nairspace. By requiring commercial aviation to comply, the EU ETS also \nlimits airline capital that could be available for other meaningful \npurposes, including their ability to invest in more fuel-efficient \nengines, alternative sources of fuel, and research and development.\n  No one in Congress is against the EU implementing ETS within their \nboundaries. However, I believe that any system that includes \ninternational and other non-EU airspace must be addressed through the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization, the ICAO policies, of which \nthe United States and 190 countries are members. In fact, under current \nICAO standards, the aviation industry is targeted to achieve a 1.5-\npercent average annual improvement in carbon and fuel efficiency \nthrough 2020 and carbon-neutral growth from 2020 forward.\n  That is why the U.S. airline industry and those advocates in the \nindustry also agree that a single global approach to greenhouse gas \nemissions set at the ICAO is preferred to the unilateral EU ETS system. \nEven the Obama administration testified before the House Committee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure in July of 2011 that an EU ETS is \ninconsistent with international aviation law. The State Department and \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation are also pressing this issue with \ntheir counterparts in Europe and are considering all legal and policy \noptions to prevent further application of EU ETS to U.S. air carriers.\n  In addition, other nations have voiced opposition. Those nations \ninclude Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, \nMexico, the Russian Federation, and South Africa. In fact, China's \nAmbassador to the EU recently suggested that they will begin canceling \nAirbus orders if the EU ETS remains in place. Also, countries such as \nItaly, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, and Spain--all EU member \nstates--are calling for the postponement of EU ETS out of concerns \nraised by the international community. Even European manufacturers and \nairlines such as Airbus, Air France, and British Airways have urged \ntheir respective governments to stop the escalating trade conflict \nbetween the EU and the rest of the world.\n  The EU has no right to play policeman and undermine the ongoing work \nat the ICAO. As a result of this action by the EU, on December 7, 2011, \nI introduced the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition \nAct, S. 1956, which now has seven cosponsors, both Democrats and \nRepublicans. The bill gives the Secretary of Transportation the \nauthority to take the necessary steps to ensure that America's aviation \noperators are not penalized by\n\n[[Page S2996]]\n\nany system unilaterally imposed by the EU. The bill also requires the \nSecretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the FAA, and other \nsenior U.S. officials to use their authority to conduct international \nnegotiations and take other actions necessary to ensure that U.S. \noperators are held harmless from the action of the European Union. The \nHouse of Representatives passed a similar bill by a voice vote on \nOctober 24, 2011. The U.S. commercial aviation community, including \nairlines and manufacturers, are all supportive of my bipartisan bill.\n  Next month, I am looking forward to the Commerce Committee hearing \nthat is scheduled to take a closer look at this important issue and at \nmy legislation.\n  Doing nothing is not an option. The unilateral imposition of the EU \nemissions trading scheme is a violation of international law and is \nhurting U.S. airlines, manufacturers, and consumers. Keep in mind that \nwith near record oil prices, the EU ETS will add to the already high \namount airlines and passengers pay for fuel.\n  We need to act now. We need to send a clear and unequivocal message \nand pass my bipartisan bill that addresses this scheme and protects the \nU.S. aviation industry and American sovereignty. I hope we will act on \nthis legislation and make sure that this issue, once and for all, is \nput to rest and that the European Union is not able to assess a tax or \na fee on American airlines operating in American airspace.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, here we are again in the Senate on yet \nanother day when families and students across this country are \nwondering if we are going to do our duty. Are we actually going to move \nlegislation that will keep the interest rate at 3.4 percent on \nsubsidized student loans or are we going to let it go to 6.8 percent--\ndouble--on July 1?\n  We have legislation and we brought it to the floor. Yet yesterday my \nRepublican colleagues voted to not even proceed to it. I think the \npeople of America are saying that this shouldn't happen. We should be \nable to work these things out. We should move legislation, not obstruct \nit.\n  Everyone now agrees we should keep the interest rate at 3.4 percent. \nThe Republicans say they want to keep it at 3.4 percent and we say we \ndo. The Republicans were initially opposed to this, but they have \ngotten onboard. That is fine. I have been here on the floor listening \nto my colleagues talk about this since Monday. Everyone agrees we have \nto keep it at 3.4 percent and not let it go up, so it ought to be a \nbipartisan issue. We ought to be able to move this rapidly and move on \nto other matters. There are other issues confronting us in the Senate. \nYet here we are on the floor again today discussing the student loan \ninterest rate.\n  As I said, we had the vote yesterday to move it forward, but my \nRepublican colleagues blocked us from doing that. They agree we should \nkeep the interest rate at 3.4 percent, but not on how to pay for it. \nWell, OK, fine; that is a legitimate point of debate and discussion and \nvotes. So why don't we move the bill forward, bring it to the floor, \nand let's have a debate and discussion on how we pay for it. If they \nwant to offer an amendment, they can offer an amendment and we will \nvote on it. It seems to me--at least I think--that one of the \nresponsibilities, and maybe privileges but responsibilities, of the \nmajority party in the Senate, whichever party it might be, is to \ninitiate legislation and bring it to the floor. The privilege and \nresponsibility of the minority party is to be able to amend it, to try \nto make it better as they may see fit. I don't think it should be a \nprivilege and responsibility of the minority party to block everything, \nbut we have seen that happen more and more over the last few years. \nRepublicans won't let us bring a bill to the floor because under the \nrules it requires 60 votes rather than 51 votes to bring a bill \nforward. So, again, we are stuck because we can't bring the bill \nforward.\n  I hope we have another cloture vote. Let's keep having these cloture \nvotes and maybe Republicans then will say, OK, let's move it forward \nand let's debate it and move on. So I hope that is what we are going to \nbe doing rather than stopping the process in its tracks.\n  It is interesting to note that House and Senate Republicans were \nsilent on this issue until students from around the country became \naware of the impending increase and made their voices heard. Democrats \nwere already hard at work on the solution. I would remind my colleagues \nthat earlier this year, in the budget debate in the House, an amendment \nwas offered by Democrats during the House budget process to extend the \ncurrent rate of 3.4 percent. That amendment lost by a straight party \nvote. Instead, the Republicans proposed to pay for this by taking money \nfrom the Prevention and Public Health Fund. That is not an appropriate \nsolution, killing the fund that is preventing cancer and preventing \nunnecessary diseases in the United States.\n  My friends on the other side would have us believe that nothing bad \nwill happen if we eliminate the Prevention and Public Health Fund. They \ncall it a slush fund. There is no truth to that at all. The truth is \nthat the elimination of this fund would have disastrous effects on the \nhealth of our kids and our families. To eliminate the Prevention and \nPublic Health Fund will cost us billions in the future for taking care \nof people who have chronic illnesses and chronic diseases and obesity. \nWe know that an investment in immunizing our kids--for example, for \nevery dollar, it saves us $16 in saved health care costs. To eliminate \nthis fund would lead to a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases in \nevery State due to the expected loss of more than 1.5 million doses of \nlifesaving vaccines and nearly 1,100 skilled public health workers.\n  Again, eliminating the Prevention and Public Health Fund would mean \neliminating vaccines for our kids, eliminating public health workers \nwho know how to deliver these vaccines and respond to outbreaks. We \nwould be losing public health staff at the State and local levels.\n  Eliminating this fund would end support for increased calls to the \ntobacco quitline, meaning smokers encouraged to quit by the fund's \nstrategic and evidence-based investments thus far would not have the \nsupport to keep that quitline going. If current smoking rates persist, \n6 million kids living in the United States today will ultimately die \nfrom smoking. If we eliminate the Prevention and Public Health Fund, we \nwill be forced to reduce the availability of mental health and \nsubstance abuse services to very vulnerable Americans.\n  Eliminating the fund, as the Republicans want to do, would reduce \ninvestment in public health laboratory capacity at the State and local \nlevels, thereby reducing the speed with which we can detect and respond \nto outbreaks and, yes, maybe even terrorist events. It would cut the \nnumber of disease detectives that the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention can train and deploy. These disease detectives are our first \nline of defense against infectious diseases.\n  Eliminating this fund would result in layoffs, as I said, of public \nhealth officials in every State and community who are working on \nchronic disease prevention, immunization, health-care-associated \ninfections, and other health problems.\n  An elimination of the prevention fund--again, I use the word \n``elimination.'' The Republican proposal wouldn't just take some money \nfrom the prevention fund, it would kill the prevention fund. It would \ntake every single penny out of it.\n  My friends on the Republican side say: Well, President Obama in his \nbudget took money out of the prevention fund. In fact, Democrats joined \nwith Republicans earlier this year in taking $5 billion out of the life \nof this fund to help pay for extending the unemployment insurance \nprogram for the remainder of this year, as well as extending the \npayroll tax cut. They use that example to say, Well, we can kill the \nwhole thing. I must be very frank.\n\n[[Page S2997]]\n\nI was not in favor of that $5 billion cut, but be that as it may, as I \nused the analogy yesterday, it is one thing to take a couple of pints \nof blood and another to take all the blood. A person can live if a \ncouple of pints of blood are taken; they can live and get healthy. That \nis what is happening to the prevention fund. The Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund is alive and well and doing its job even though some money \nis taken out of it. What the Republicans want to do is take all the \nblood out and kill the whole program.\n  President Obama has said he will veto this bill if there are any cuts \nin the Prevention and Public Health Fund. So there has been a line \ndrawn. We took some money out of it before, but no more. That is it; no \nmore money is coming out of this prevention fund because of the good it \nis doing in this country.\n  An elimination of this fund, which the Republicans want to do, would \nstop in midstream across our country efforts to address the risk \nfactors for heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer--the leading \ncauses of death and health care costs. Yesterday in this Chamber I read \nfrom a new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that finds \nthat if we could prevent the obesity rate from increasing past its \ncurrent 34-percent rate right now, we could save nearly $550 billion in \nthe next 20 years.\n  In 1980, the obesity rate was right at about 15 percent in this \ncountry. Today, as I said, it is 34 percent. If it increases at the \nrate they expect, looking at all indicators now, 42 percent of all \nAmericans will be obese by 2030 and one out of every four of them will \nbe severely obese. That means a huge increase in adult onset diabetes \nand all the accompanying health care risks and costs, including heart \ndisease and stroke, that accompany obesity.\n  We know how to address it. We have evidence-based programs that we \nknow work in keeping the obesity rate down. That is what the prevention \nfund does. The Republicans want to kill it. They say no, get rid of it.\n  Cuts to our chronic disease prevention programs would mean 120 \nmillion Americans--1 in every 3 citizens--would lose access to \npreventive services. It would mean $103 million no longer available to \nStates and counties and local jurisdictions to provide these services. \nOver 20 million Americans in rural areas in New York and in Iowa and \nall across this country would no longer have access to preventive \nservices and programs.\n  The American people get it. Our citizens, whom we represent, get it. \nThey understand. A poll was taken which said that voters overwhelmingly \nsupport more investment in prevention. This is from a 2009 public \nopinion poll: 71 percent of Americans polled said yes, do more, invest \nmore in prevention. Our fellow citizens are crying out to us for help. \nThey want help. They want to know what to do. How do they change? What \ncan we do in our communities, our schools, our workplaces, our clinics, \nour community health centers? What can we do so that we don't get sick, \nso we don't get obese or diabetes, so we don't have heart disease? Most \npeople don't know what to do. They need some help. They need \ninformation. They need support.\n  That is what this prevention fund does. We know it works. We know. We \nhave evidence-based programs out there that work. The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention is doing an outstanding job across this \ncountry in these programs: from community programs, to public health \ninfrastructure, to clinical preventive services, research, tobacco \nprevention programs, detection and prevention of infectious diseases, \nand training and preparing the public health workforce--all of this.\n\n  That is why prevention is not just something people go into a \ndoctor's office to get a shot for or get a prescription for and people \nget a pill for. Prevention encompasses a lot of different things--\neverything from newborn screening, immunizations for children, school-\nbased programs, and better food and nutrition in our school meals for \nkids.\n  Communities change the way they operate and do things--more walking \npaths, more bike paths. The other day there was something said about \nIllinois had used some of this for signage and walking paths for kids. \nI pointed out, yes, they did. What happened is the number of kids \nwalking to school increased, and that cut down on the number of buses \nthey had to use. It saved the school some money, and the kids got \nhealthier.\n  I have often used the example that when I first moved to Washington \nin 1979, when I was in the House, my wife and I purchased a home in \nVirginia. We still live there. One of the reasons we bought it was \nbecause we were about a mile away from a school, a high school. We \nthought: That is great. The kids can just walk to school. Little did I \nknow there were no walking paths to the school. It was a busy street. \nThere was a sidewalk for a little ways, and then there was not one. The \nkids could not walk. So they had to take a bus just to go 1 mile.\n  So, again, communities putting in sidewalks, safe passages for kids \nto do that, that is healthy living. I have seen instances in my own \nState where communities have put in walking paths for the elderly, for \nsenior citizens, so they do not have a lot of steps and things to go up \nand down. You would be amazed how many people use that and stay \nhealthy.\n  Supporting systems in our workplaces, making our workplaces more \nhealthy, helping businesses understand what they can do to provide a \nhealthier workplace for people--examples abound all over this country.\n  I say to the Acting President pro tempore, I am sure I do not know \nall the instances in New York State, but I will bet you communities \nthere have gotten together and thought about how to make life a little \nbit more healthy, how to support a more healthy infrastructure for \ntheir people.\n  Some communities are coming up with very ingenious ideas. I say more \npower to them. That is what the Prevention Fund is for--to help them, \nto encourage them, to give them the kind of support they need to \nprovide that healthy living.\n  I have said many times, it is interesting that in America it is easy \nto be unhealthy and hard to be healthy. One would think it should be \nthe other way around. It should be easy to be healthy and harder to be \nunhealthy. It is just the other way around.\n  So what we are trying to do with some part of the prevention fund--\nnot all of it; part of it--is to make it easier to be healthy, to make \nthat an easier option for people.\n  So if we both agree--Republicans and Democrats--on the fact that we \nneed to keep the interest rate on student loans at 3.4 percent, then \nthe debate is just on the offset. As I have said, Republicans want to \nkill the prevention fund. The American people have said loudly: No, we \ndo not want to do that. We want more investment in prevention. We do \nnot want to get sick. We do not want to get obese. We want to quit \nsmoking. We want our kids to be healthy. We want them to have healthier \nfood, better exercise. Republicans are saying: Well, we are just not \ngoing to do that. I guess we will pay more for it in chronic illnesses \nand diseases down the line.\n  Well, our offset is one that I think is legitimate and sound, closing \na loophole in the Tax Code. That means more money would go into the \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds, and it would help us keep the \ninterest rate at 3.4 percent.\n  Education has always, and I hope will always, remain a bipartisan \nissue here. I urge my Republican colleagues to come to the table with a \nserious offset--a serious offset. If they do not like what we have \nproposed, please come with something that is serious. Eliminating the \nprevention fund is a no-starter. As the President said, he would veto \nit. So why push it?\n  I think this is an opportunity for all of us to come together and \nshow the American people this body is not broken; we can work with each \nother and get things done for the good of our people. Again, I \nencourage my Republican colleagues to allow us to move forward on the \nbill. Do not keep blocking it. If they want to offer a different \noffset, fine. Not this one, not the elimination of the prevention fund \nbecause that is not serious. That is not going anywhere. If they have \nsome other ideas, bring them forward. As of yet we have seen nothing \nfrom my Republican colleagues other than stopping the bill--stopping \nit, stopping it, stopping it.\n\n[[Page S2998]]\n\n  So I hope they will come to the table, and I hope we can move this \nbill forward.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first, I commend my friend from Iowa for \nbeing such a phenomenal champion of preventive health care. He has been \nfighting for this as long as he has been in the Senate, and he has had \nsome great victories. He has had some setbacks but mainly victories. It \nis because of his energy and effort that we are where we are today in \nterms of getting this money for preventive health care, and his \ncontinued effort to fight for it and to preserve this fund is notable. \nIt is going to succeed. If it does, and when it does, it will be mainly \nbecause of our friend from Iowa.\n  Our Republican colleagues could have allowed us yesterday to begin \ndebate on legislation to fix the looming increase in student loan \ninterest rates. They could have helped us avoid adding to the already \ncrushing weight of student debt that families in our country face. They \ncould have joined us in taking a step toward letting parents do what \nparents desperately want to do, which is to help their kids to a better \nfuture.\n  American families are waiting for us to act. On July 1 the interest \nrate on student loans is going to increase from 3.4 percent to 6.8 \npercent. It is going to double unless we act. For every year we fail to \nact, it will cost the typical college student and their family $1,000. \nThat is $1,000 that most families do not have to spare. More than 7 \nmillion students and their families nationwide would be affected. So \nthe need to act is urgent.\n  Instead, in what has come to be a damaging ritual in the Senate, \nRepublicans have filibustered a motion to proceed to important \nlegislation. Republicans have voted against even allowing the Senate to \nbegin to debate a bill. Why not debate it? Why not offer relevant \namendments? Why not address this important issue?\n\n  No. By their filibuster, our Republican colleagues have refused to \nlet the Senate even start this process. Republicans say they too want \nto prevent this increase in student loan interest rates. They differ \nwith us, they say, on how to pay for it. Republicans say the only way \nthey are going to support this legislation to prevent the rate increase \nis with cuts from a fund that helps to prevent infectious and chronic \ndiseases.\n  The program Republicans seek to eliminate has provided more than $8 \nmillion to my State to help fight major health problems, such as \ninfluenza, diabetes, HIV, heart disease, and cervical cancer. These \nfunds even helped to provide funding for childhood immunizations \nprograms. So what the Republicans propose is this: choose between \nhelping college students and their families and helping to prevent \nexpensive and debilitating health problems, choose between education \nand health care. Choosing to allow more health problems in order to \nhelp students and their families is not a choice at all.\n  Democrats are offering a different alternative. We recognize the Tax \nCode is full of loopholes and special breaks that allow some \nindividuals and some corporations to avoid paying taxes. In this case, \nwhat is identified is a tax break that allows some professional service \nproviders such as lawyers to avoid paying their payroll taxes by \norganizing their businesses as so-called S corporations and then paying \nthemselves in the form of dividends instead of salaries. The Government \nAccountability Office recently examined this issue and found widespread \nproblems, costing taxpayers and the Treasury billions of dollars each \nyear in uncollected revenues.\n  What our bill would do is require the professional service providers \nwith incomes above $250,000 a year to pay payroll taxes on the income \nthey derive from these S corporations. We would use the revenues from \nclosing that loophole for those with incomes above $250,000 to prevent \nthe interest rate hike that is going to hit middle-income families. At \nthe same time we are going to be able to do that, we are also going to \navoid increasing the deficit or slashing important programs.\n  Our Republican colleagues have accused us--to quote one of them--of \nraising taxes on ``the people that are doing some of the very serious \njob creation in this country.''\n  Well, not long ago Republicans were saying something different about \nthis loophole. For starters, they actually called it a loophole. That \nis what former Vice President Cheney called it during his 2004 Vice \nPresidential debate.\n  He called it a ``special loophole.'' He accused his debate opponent \nof dodging $600,000 in payroll taxes using this loophole. Likewise, a \nRepublican candidate for the Senate not long ago called this ``a \ndeceptive tax scheme to get around the IRS.'' There were no Republican \ncries then about raising taxes on job creators.\n  The fact is this loophole ought to be closed, no matter who is taking \nadvantage of it, Democrats or Republicans. Closing it, at least for \nthose with incomes above $250,000, in order to avoid another blow in a \nlong series of blows to middle-income Americans just makes sense and is \nfundamentally fair.\n  Hundreds of thousands of students in my State of Michigan depend on \nstudent loans to help afford college. They and their families know \ncollege is not going to get any cheaper. They do not need a doubled \ninterest rate on top of tuition increases. For many an affordable loan \nis the difference between staying in school or giving up the dream of a \ncollege education. We should not let this loophole stand in the way of \nthose dreams.\n  I urge our Republican colleagues to end their filibuster of this \nvital bill. If Republicans think they have a better way, let's debate \ntheir alternative and let's vote. Let's end this filibuster. Let's end \nit today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               War Powers\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I rise today to address perhaps the most \nimportant constitutional challenge facing the balance of power between \nthe Presidency and the Congress in modern times, and also to offer a \nlegislative solution that might finally address this paralysis. It is \nan issue that has for far too long remained unresolved. And for the \npast 10 years, the failure of this body to address it has diminished \nthe respect, the stature, and the seriousness with which the American \npeople have viewed the Congress--to the detriment of our country and to \nour national security.\n  The question is simple: When should the President have the unilateral \nauthority to decide to use military force, and what is the place of the \nCongress in that process? What has happened to reduce the role of the \nCongress from the body which once clearly decided whether the Nation \nwould go to war, to the point that we are viewed as little more than a \nrather mindless conduit that collects taxpayer dollars and dispenses \nthem to the President for whatever military functions he decides to \nundertake?\n  We know what the Constitution says. Most of us also know the \ndifficulties that have attended this situation in the years that \nfollowed World War II.\n  We are aware of the debates that resulted in the war powers \nresolution of nearly 40 years ago in the wake of the Vietnam war, where \nthe Congress attempted to define a proper balance between the President \nand this legislative body. I have strong memories of the policy \nconflicts of that era, first as a marine infantry officer who fought on \nthe unforgiving battlefields of Vietnam, on which more than 100,000 \nU.S. marines were killed or wounded, and later as an ardent student of \nconstitutional law during my time at the Georgetown University Law \nCenter.\n  But it was in the decades following Vietnam that our constitutional \nprocess seems to have broken apart. Year by year, skirmish by skirmish, \nthe role of the Congress in determining where the U.S. military would \noperate and when the awesome power of our weapons systems would be \nunleashed has diminished. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, \nespecially with the advent of special operations forces and remote \nbombing capabilities, the Congress seems to have faded into operational \nirrelevance.\n  Congressional consent is rarely discussed. The strongest debates \nsurround\n\n[[Page S2999]]\n\nthe rather irrelevant issue of whether the Congress has even been \nconsulted. We have now reached the point that the unprecedented--and, \nquite frankly, contorted--constitutional logic used by this \nadministration to intervene in Libya on the basis of what can most \nkindly be called a U.N. standard of humanitarian intervention was not \neven subject to a full debate or a vote on the Senate floor. Such an \nomission, and the precedent it has set, now requires us to accept one \nof two uncomfortable alternatives. Either we as a legislative body must \nreject this passivity and live up to the standards and expectations \nregarding Presidential power that were laid down so carefully by our \nFounding Fathers or we must accept a redefinition of the very precepts \nupon which this government was founded.\n  This is not a political issue. We would be facing the exact same \nconstitutional challenges no matter the party of the President. In \nfact, unless we resolve this matter, there is no doubt we someday will.\n  The conflict in the balance of power between the President and the \nCongress has always been an intrinsic part of our constitutional \nmakeup. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution provides that the \nCongress alone has the power to declare war. Article II, section 2 of \nthe Constitution provides that the President shall serve as Commander \nin Chief. In the early days of our Republic, these distinctions were \nclear, particularly since we retained no large standing army during \npeacetime, and since article I, section 8 also provides that the \nCongress has the power to ``raise and support armies,'' a phrase that \nexpressed the clear intent of the Framers that large ground forces were \nnot to be kept during peacetime but, instead, were to be raised at the \ndirection of Congress during the time of war.\n  Our history confirms this, as our armies demobilized again and again \nonce wars were completed. Only after World War II did this change, when \nour rather reluctant position as the world's greatest guarantor of \ninternational stability required that we maintain a large standing \nmilitary force, much of it stationed in Europe and Asia, ready to \nrespond to crises whose immediacy could not otherwise allow us to go \nthrough the lengthy process of mobilization in order to raise an army \nand because of that reality made the time-honored process of asking the \nCongress for a formal declaration of war in most cases obsolescent.\n  But any logical proposition can be carried to a ridiculous extreme. \nThe fact that some military situations have required our Presidents to \nact immediately before then reporting to the Congress does not, in and \nof itself, give the President a blanket authority to use military force \nwhenever and wherever he decides to do so, even where Americans are not \npersonally at risk and even where the vital interests of our country \nhave not been debated and clearly defined. This is the ridiculous \nextreme we have now reached. The world is filled with tyrants. \nDemocratic systems are far and few between. I don't know exactly what \nobjective standard should be used before the U.S. Government would \ndecide to conduct a so-called humanitarian intervention by using our \nmilitary power to address domestic tensions inside another country, and \nI don't believe anyone else knows either. But I will say this: No \nPresident should have the unilateral authority to make that decision \neither.\n  I make this point from the perspective of somebody who grew up in the \nmilitary and whose family has participated as citizen soldiers in most \nof our country's wars, beginning with the American Revolution. I was \nproud to serve as a marine in Vietnam, and I am equally proud of my \nson's service as a marine infantryman in Iraq. I am also deeply \ngrateful for having had the opportunity to serve 5 years in the \nPentagon, first as a marine, then later as Assistant Secretary of \nDefense and as a Secretary of the Navy. I have also benefited over the \nyears from having served in many places around the world as a \njournalist, including in Beirut during our military engagement there in \n1983 and in Afghanistan as an embedded journalist in 2004. As most \npeople in this body know, I am one of the strongest proponents of the \nrefocusing of our national involvement in East Asia. I was the original \nsponsor of a Senate resolution condemning China's use of force with \nrespect to sovereignty issues in the South China Sea.\n  The point is I am not advocating a retreat from anywhere. But this \nadministration's argument that it has the authority to decide when and \nwhere to use military force without the consent of the Congress, using \nthe fragile logic of humanitarian intervention to ostensibly redress \ndomestic tensions inside countries where American interests are not \nbeing directly threatened is gravely dangerous. It is a bridge too far. \nIt does not fit our history. To give one individual such discretion \nridicules our Constitution. It belittles the role of the Congress. For \nanyone in this body to accept this rationale is also for them to accept \nthat the Congress no longer has any direct role in the development, and \nparticularly in the execution, of foreign policy.\n  There are clear and important boundaries that have always existed \nwhen considering a President's authority to order our military into \naction without the immediate consent of the Congress. To exceed these \nboundaries--as the President has already done with the precedent set in \nLibya--is to deliberately destroy the balance of powers that were built \nso carefully into the Constitution itself.\n  These historically acceptable conditions under which a President can \nunilaterally order the military into action are clear: If our country \nor our military forces are attacked; if an attack, including one by \ninternational terrorists, is imminent and must be preempted; if treaty \ncommitments specifically compel us to respond to attacks on our allies; \nif American citizens are detained or threatened; if our sea lanes are \ninterrupted, then, and only then, should the President order the use of \nmilitary force without first gaining the approval of the Congress.\n  At least until recent months, the Congress has never accepted that \nthe President owns the unilateral discretion to initiate combat \nactivities without direct provocation, without Americans at risk, \nwithout the obligations of treaty commitments, and without the consent \nof the Congress. The recent actions by this administration, beginning \nwith the months-long intervention in Libya, should give us all grounds \nfor concern and alarm about the potential harm to our constitutional \nsystem itself. We are in no sense compelled--or justified--in taking \naction based on a vote of the United Nations or as a result of a \ndecision made by a collective security arrangement, such as NATO, when \nnone of its members have been attacked. It is not the prerogative of \nthe President to decide to commit our military and our prestige into \nsituations that cannot clearly be determined to flow from vital \nnational interests.\n\n  Who should decide that? I can't personally and conclusively define \nthe boundaries of what is being called a humanitarian intervention and, \nmost importantly, neither can anybody else. Where should it apply? \nWhere should it not? Rwanda? Libya? Syria? Venezuela? Bangladesh? In \nthe absence of a clear determination by our time-honored constitutional \nprocess, who should decide where our young men and women or our \nnational treasure should be risked? Some of these endeavors may be \njustified, some may not. But the most important point to be made is \nthat in our system no one person should have the power to inject the \nU.S. military and the prestige of our Nation into such circumstances.\n  Our Constitution was founded upon this hesitation. We inherited our \nsystem from Great Britain, but we adapted and changed it for a reason. \nOne of our strongest adjustments from the British system was to ensure \nthat no one person would have the power to commit the Nation to \nmilitary schemes that could not be justified by the interests and the \nsecurity of the average citizen. President after President, beginning \nwith George Washington, has emphasized the importance of this \nfundamental principle to the stability of our political system and to \nthe integrity of our country in the international community. The fact \nthat the leadership of our Congress has failed to raise this historic \nstandard in the past few years, and most specifically in Libya, is a \nwarning sign to this body that it must reaffirm one of its most solemn \nresponsibilities.\n  I have been working for several months to construct a legislative \nsolution to this paralysis. This legislation\n\n[[Page S3000]]\n\nwould recognize that modern circumstances require an adroit approach to \nthe manner in which our foreign policy is being implemented. But it \nwould also put necessary and proper boundaries around a President's \ndiscretion when it comes to so-called humanitarian intervention, where \nwe and our people are not being directly threatened. My legislation \nrequires that in any situation where American interests are not \ndirectly threatened, the President must obtain formal approval by the \nCongress before introducing American military force. This legislation \nwill also provide that debate on such a request must begin within days \nof the request and that a vote must proceed in a timely manner.\n  I remind the leadership on both sides of this body that despite \nrepeated calls from myself and other Senators, when this administration \nconducted month after month of combat operations in Libya, with no \nAmerican interests directly threatened and no clear treaty provisions \nin play, the Congress of the United States, both Democratic and \nRepublican, could not even bring itself to have a formal debate on \nwhether the use of military force was appropriate, and this use of \nmilitary force that went on for months was never approved. The \nadministration, which spent well over $1 billion of taxpayer funds, \ndropped thousands of bombs on the country and operated our military \noffshore for months, claimed that combat was not occurring and rejected \nthe notion that the War Powers Act applied to the situation. I am not \nhere to debate the War Powers Act; I am suggesting that other statutory \nlanguage that covers these kinds of situations must be enacted. The \nlegislation I will be introducing will address this loophole in the \ninterpretation of our Constitution. It will serve as a necessary safety \nnet to protect the integrity and the intent of the Constitution itself. \nIt will ensure that the Congress lives up not only to its prerogatives, \nwhich were so carefully laid out by our Founding Fathers, but also to \nits responsibilities.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I come down to talk about the issue of \nstudent loans, as someone who has two ends of this equation--one as the \nformer chairman of the Student Loan Corporation for the State of Alaska \nfor 7 years. I took that corporation from the brink of bankruptcy, junk \nbond rating, you name it--it was in dismal condition. We turned it \naround, and 7 years later the corporation ended up paying a hefty \nannual dividend to Alaska for higher education and had one of the \nlowest interest rates in the country and increased the capacity for \nstudents to borrow money not only for 2- and 4-year degrees and \nmaster's degrees but also for career education, something most people \ntold me, when I became chair of that corporation, would never be able \nto be done. Good luck. We wish you the best. And off they went and most \nof them got off the board very quickly. We were able to bring it \ntogether. In the process, in my experience around the issue of \neducation, in making sure young people had the capacity to borrow money \nat reasonable rates, it went down about 2 percent, which is a pretty \nincredible rate for a student or parent to borrow money at.\n  I was also chair of the Postsecondary Education Commission for 7 \nyears, a copartner with the Student Loan Corporation, making sure we \nhad strong educational institutions to provide career, college, and \nother types of education for young people. I come with that experience, \nand also I come from experience as a small businessperson, which I will \nget to in a minute, with regard to how we are trying to pay for this \ninterest rate, controlling the interest rates and making sure they \ndon't rise. The rate for subsidized interest loans will rise from 3.4 \npercent to 6.8 percent in July. That will increase the average cost for \nstudents by $1,000 over the course of a loan. Students are truly \nwaiting and families are waiting, as kids are graduating right now \nacross this country from high school, getting ready to move on to \nhigher education and making their plans--be they scholarships or grants \nor loans or whatever they need to cobble together the amount of money \nneeded to move on to a higher education and to ensure they can afford \nit. And the interest rate is part of that equation. Doubling the \ninterest rate would be damaging to our young families who are making \nsure their kids can get on and have an opportunity to be educated.\n\n  As you know, many of us have gone onto our Facebook page and Twitter \naccounts and asked constituents from our districts to tell us their \nstories--tell us what is happening: If this interest rate doubles, what \nwill happen to you. One Anchorage resident says her granddaughter \ngraduated from Charter College. I know this college well. This is a \nprivately run college which has an incredible placement rate--almost \n90-percent placement rate once they graduate with their degree. It is \nan intensive program. It is like a job. Students are there 8 to 5 every \nday, all day, for several months, and they consolidate the time. She \nhas been working on her accounting degree, and now, 6 years later--\nbecause she had to work two jobs while going to school, trying to pay \nfor this and borrowing money--her total debt is $72,000. She is 31 \nyears old. Her family is truly wondering how she will ever get out of \ndebt if this bill doesn't pass, because if the interest rates adjust, \nit is truly money that comes out of her pocket to literally pay off \ninterest, and the net result is she gets deeper and deeper in debt.\n  We know the cost of college is more and more expensive every year, \nand one way we are going to make sure students can afford this is by \nmaking sure we do not double the interest rate. We had a vote earlier \nthis week that did not succeed. We tried on this side to move it \nforward. It is important for us to make sure every kid has access to \neducation--whether it is higher education, career education, voc \neducation or whatever the new title is they like to use to describe \nit--because we are in a globally competitive economy, and we need to \nmake sure our kids are well educated and have access to education, \nwhich means affordability.\n  Yesterday I was listening to the debate, and this is where my small \nbusiness part comes in. I have been in the small business arena since \nthe age of 14. I have operated and owned a variety of businesses--some \nsuccessful, some not so successful. Hopefully, you learn from those \nthat are not so successful, and I think I have. The Democrats' pay-\nfor--the majority's pay-for--was to close a tax loophole used by high-\nincome earners--basically lawyers, lobbyists, and consultants. No \ndisrespect to their fields, but they basically use the system to avoid \npaying the Medicare taxes, for example, that all of us pay. All of us \nwho sit in this Chamber, the people who work at the restaurants outside \nhere, the people who drive the buses, and everyone else, pays that tax. \nBut some use this to organize under an S corporation. It is a technical \nterm under the IRS Code that allows those profits to go right to the \nindividual. So they decided instead of paying it as a wage, they would \ntake it as profit or a dividend, thus avoiding the Medicare taxes all \nof us pay. They are getting a free ride.\n  I heard the phrase used yesterday on the floor, ``a bunch of new \ntaxes.'' These aren't new taxes. These are taxes that are owed. They \njust found a loophole--again, consultants, lobbyists and lawyers--\nthrough the writing of the laws. And they probably wrote them. \nActually, they did, if you look at the history of it. They wrote the \nlaw so they could avoid the Medicare taxes everyone else has to pay. So \nwhen I hear people saying it is the restaurant owner, it is the \nretailer, the plumber, I think, that is a bunch of baloney. That is \nmisinforming the public. It is unbelievable. I know this, because as a \nformer retailer who had an S corporation, we paid our taxes. We paid \nwith a wage. We paid it all.\n  This loophole is clear. All you have to do is look at it. They have \nto meet three standards: modified gross income above $250,000 for joint \nfilers, $200,000 for individuals and shareholders, and an S corporation \nthat derives 75 percent or more of gross revenues from services of \nthree or fewer shareholders. Service is defined as lobbying, law, \nengineering, architect, accounting, actuarial science--which is a \nscience--performing arts, athletes, and brokerage services. I am \nlooking here, and I don't see where it says retailers. It doesn't say \nthe mom-and-pop folks who work every day and pay their taxes.\n  So for Members to come to the floor and try to trick the public--\nbecause\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\nthat is what they tried to do by using convoluted words, knowing people \nare getting the 10-second sound bites--saying, oh, it is going to raise \nnew taxes and cause all these small businesses not to hire, that is \nbaloney. This is about lawyers, lobbyists, and consultants who wrote \nthe law making sure they didn't have to pay a dime. That is what that \nis about. For people to come to the floor and say we are going to raise \nthe interest rate on hard-working families who are trying to get their \nkids through college is unbelievable.\n  I hope we take this up again. I hope we vote on it and get this thing \nresolved, and make sure working families can afford to get their kids \ninto college and can afford the high cost so they can become productive \nparts of this country, perhaps opening their own small business and \npaying their taxes, as every other small business does.\n  I was appalled when I heard some of the Members speaking on this, and \nthey sounded so logical. But to be frank with you, there are not many \nin this body--no disrespect to my colleagues--who have owned and \noperated a true small business. I am talking about starting with a few \nnickels and dimes because you got turned down by the bank; where the \nbanker told you your idea was a dumb idea. I can say this from personal \nexperience. Three years later, I sold that business for three times \nwhat I had invested. I thought it was a good idea, but the banker \ndidn't. But I had to scratch together two nickels to make that business \nsuccessful. I had to work 12 to 15 hours every day to make sure it was \nsuccessful. That is a small businessperson. There are not many in this \nbody.\n  So when a Member comes to the floor and sounds so professional in \ntheir description of how it is going to affect certain people, it is \nincorrect. And one thing I wouldn't mind in this body is to have \nfactual debates. That is what the public deserves, not this kind of 10-\nsecond media bite, where they can get away with anything and then say \nback home, we didn't raise taxes, we didn't do this. What they are \ndoing is jacking up rates on students. That is what is going to happen \nat the end of the day here, by July 1, if we don't take action.\n\n  And we have taken action on this side. But the end result will be \nthat families, hard-working families, middle-class families, will pay \nmore for their students' education, and students will pay more for \ntheir education because of a simple law that we can correct. All we \nhave to do is close the loophole that lobbyists, lawyers, and \nconsultants are taking advantage of and wrote to their advantage to \nstick it to the middle class. I think it is time to reverse the trend, \nfor once, around this place--just once--and give the middle class a \nbreak here. This is a break they deserve and it will help to build our \neconomy in the future because we will have a highly educated workforce \nmeeting this global economy.\n  I know there is another alternative out there. There is a new pay-\nfor, and here is what that does: It takes away prevention funds for \nhealth--$226 million used to reduce diabetes and heart disease. I don't \nknow about my colleagues, but if we don't prevent it, then we may have \na higher cost later. Those are preventable diseases. This money is well \ninvested. They also want to take away the $93 million used for anti-\ntobacco education and $190 million used for immunizations.\n  Our Republican friends do not like the plan that closes the loophole \non lobbyists, lawyers, and consultants, but they do like the one that \ntakes away prevention programs that help the middle class, that helps \nour young families who might be experiencing signs of a preventable \ndisease--heart disease. And a little prevention might save their lives, \nbut it will also save on health care costs in the future.\n  I see this proposal as crazy talk. I don't know how else to describe \nit. I am trying to keep it simple. Let's get on with closing the \nloopholes people took advantage of by lobbying and wheeling and dealing \nin the halls of Congress. Let's fix that and protect our working \nfamilies, our middle-class families, and make sure we are doing the \nright thing. That is what they sent us here to do, and I think we have \nan obligation.\n  Again, I hope we move forward and make sure we are not going to allow \nthe rates on these loans to double. I am not for doubling the rates; \n3.4 percent is a good rate. We should ensure students can get that rate \nas they get prepared for the fall session and are borrowing money to \nget on with their higher education.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ncalling for a real solution to the impending student debt crisis. \nYesterday we had a chance to do the right thing and stand with millions \nof young Americans all across our country, to invest in their future by \npreventing these interest rates from doubling on Stafford loans 52 days \nfrom now. Instead, our colleagues across the aisle chose to stand in \nthe way of a commonsense proposal. As a result, 7 million students are \nfacing higher interest rates that will cost them each an extra $1,000 a \nyear in interest, further pushing access to quality higher education \nout of reach for too many and saddling others with additional \nunmanageable debt when they get out of college and join the workforce.\n  But don't take it from me about how tough this is going to be, take \nit from the students and the families themselves. Just as the Presiding \nOfficer has heard from thousands of families all across Alaska, we have \nbeen hearing the same online and through e-mail about what this would \nactually do to their families.\n  I heard from one New York parent who has a child in college and \nanother heading there this fall. His older child spent a year in \nAmeriCorps, and his younger is there serving now. He said:\n\n       These kids are serving America. Both of my kids will leave \n     college with around $25,000 in debt, if we can afford to keep \n     it down that much.\n\n  We should all be able to agree that adding another $1,000 or more per \nyear to the debt of kids who are only looking to serve this country, \nget a good education, and help rebuild this economy is wrong.\n  I heard from a woman in the Bronx. She has a job as a social worker, \nand she is on track to pay off her student loans in the next 10 or 11 \nyears--just in time for her twin daughters to start college. She said:\n\n       Doubling my student loan interest will keep me in debt at a \n     time when I am going to need every single penny to get my \n     kids through college with as little debt of their own as \n     possible. The more interest I pay, the more they'll have to \n     borrow for their own educations, and the cycle will continue \n     indefinitely.\n\n  I heard from a woman in Saratoga with a bachelor's degree in hotel, \nresort and tourism management. Despite making good money, she says that \npaying $800 a month in student loans on top of her everyday bills makes \ngetting by nearly impossible. She said:\n\n       My choice is to instead decide what bill I'm going to pay \n     this month, making me fall behind on other payments, \n     destroying my credit in the future. If my interest rate was \n     any higher, I honestly do not know how I would survive at \n     all. Pretty much all the money I am making is going straight \n     into student loans. We need all the help we can get.\n\n  These are just a few of the stories I heard yesterday. And the \nfamilies expect better from us.\n  When we price young people out of a college education, we all are \ngoing to pay the price. When we limit their opportunity, we rob \nourselves of those future engineers, biologists, and small business \nowners. America's ability to lead the global economy relies on our \nability to outeducate the global competition.\n  Let's open doors to higher education to anyone who is willing to work \nfor it, and let's keep it affordable. Let's reward hard work and \nresponsibility instead of risk taking. There is no excuse for inaction, \nso let's have a real debate, in good faith, to solve this problem we \nall know is within our reach. Students and families all across America \ncan't afford any more delay.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Charter Schools\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, this week is the 13th annual National \nCharter Schools Week. On Tuesday, Senator Landrieu of Louisiana and I \njoined with 10 other Senators in submitting a resolution praising \nteachers, administrators, parents, and students who are part of the \ncharter school movement across our country.\n  Let me begin by explaining exactly what a charter school is because \nsometimes we stand here in the Senate and start talking without \nexplaining the subject. A charter school is the Memphis Academy of \nScience and Engineering. I visited there 4 years ago during spring \nbreak. Most of the students in Memphis were somewhere else, but not the \nstudents at the Memphis Academy of Science and Engineering. These were \nsophomores studying advanced placement biology. These were children who \nhad been in other schools the year before that were deemed to be low-\nperforming schools. In other words, these were among the students in \nMemphis considered least likely to succeed. But they were fortunate. \nThey were allowed to go to this charter school. Their parents had \nchosen this charter school.\n  Here is what was different about the school. The union rules, the \nState rules, and the Federal rules had been relaxed so that the \nteachers had the freedom to do what they thought those children needed \nin that school. In this case, many of these children didn't have as \nmuch at home as other children did, so the teachers decided that the \nschool ought to be open 12 hours a day, that it ought to be open on \nSaturday morning, and that it ought to be open more weeks a year than \nother schools. And the students were there on spring break studying \nadvanced placement biology, which is not what many sophomores do in \nmany schools in this country. And these children were succeeding.\n  The charter school was able to pay some teachers more than others. It \nwas able to have some classes that were smaller than others. It meant \nthat some scheduled classes were longer than others and some children \ngot special attention that needed it.\n  You may say: Well, that makes so much common sense. Why aren't \nteachers able to do that in every public school in America? That is a \nvery good question because, in a way, every one of our 100,000 public \nschools in America should be a charter school in the sense that the \nreal definition of a charter school is one that gives teachers the \nfreedom to use their own good sense and judgment with the children whom \nparents choose to send to that school.\n  I have a personal interest in charter schools. Twenty years ago, I \nwas the U.S. Secretary of Education. I was in my final year. The last \nthing I did in 1992 as Secretary was to write a letter to all the \nschool superintendents in America urging them to try what a small \nnumber of Minnesota public schools were doing in what they were then \ncalling startup schools. These were the first charter schools in \nAmerica. Their origin was primarily from those who were part of the \nDemocratic Farmer Labor Party in Minnesota. But at the same time, on \nthe conservative side of the ideological spectrum, there were many who \nwere calling for getting rid of teacher union rules and State rules and \nregulations that were making it harder for teachers to teach. So there \nwas a happy convergence of support for this idea of startup schools.\n  I remember that Albert Shanker, the late head of the American \nFederation of Teachers, supported the idea from the beginning. But many \nof those in the teachers unions opposed him. Many of those in the \neducation establishment didn't like it. They were afraid of what might \nhappen.\n  Well, here is what has happened over the last 20 years. Instead of a \nhandful of schools in Minnesota, we now have about 5,600 charter \nschools in America today. About 5 percent of all of our public schools \nare charter schools. The way they work is very simple. They are public \nschools, and the money the State and local government would ordinarily \nspend on their district school follows each child to the charter \nschool. So it is just a public school organized in a different way.\n  The first one, as I said, was in 1992--City Academy High School in \nSt. Paul, MN. In 1997, President Clinton called for creating 3,000 \ncharter schools by 2002. This was after the first President Bush had \ncalled for creating ``break the mold'' schools in every school district \nin America--another name for what we call charter schools today. And \nthen in 2002 the second President Bush called for $200 million to \nsupport charter schools. Today, 41 States have charter schools, and the \nschools serve more than 2 million students--about 4 percent of the 50 \nmillion students in our public schools today.\n  I am proud to say that our own State of Tennessee has had a strong \ncharter school movement since 2002, and only recently has the State \ncharter law been amended to remove the cap on the number of schools in \nthe State and limitations on student eligibility. We currently have 40 \ncharter schools operating in Tennessee--25 in Memphis and 11 in \nNashville--with nearly 10,000 students attending these schools. Our \nFirst to the Top plan--Tennessee won the President's Race to the Top \nplan for education--included $14 million to expand high-performing \ncharter schools. The Achievement School District, which Governor Bill \nHaslam created, has approved three charter operators to turn around \npriority schools that are failing, and we can expect more to be \napproved next year.\n  So the question often is asked, well, are charter schools really \nhelping students? And in some ways the jury is still out. Charter \nschools are relatively new, and there are many factors that go into the \nsuccess of a student in a school, the No. 1 factor being what happens \nat home. But there are good and encouraging indications.\n  A recent study by Stanford University found that two-thirds of the \ncharter schools in Tennessee have been improving student performance in \nreading or math at a faster rate than competing traditional district \npublic schools. Sixty-seven percent of charter schools in Tennessee \nhave been improving the overall growth of their students for the last 3 \nyears.\n  But that means that 30 percent of the charter schools weren't \nperforming as well or were performing worse. So the fact is, not every \ncharter school is going to be successful. Not every startup business is \nsuccessful. But we have a model in our country that reminds us of what \ncan happen when we have autonomous institutions where administrators \nand teachers have the privilege of using their own judgment and common \nsense to make things happen, and we call that higher education.\n  In the United States of America, we have around 6,000 institutions of \nhigher education. There are all kinds--Yeshiva University, Nashville \nAuto Diesel College, Vanderbilt University, the University of \nTennessee, Notre Dame, or Stanford. There are many different kinds--\nfor-profit, nonprofit, public, nonpublic. But they are all largely \nautonomous and the students choose the schools they attend. And what \nhas happened? Everyone in the world agrees that we have not only the \nbest colleges in America, but we have almost all of the very best \ncolleges.\n  So our goal should be to gradually increase the number of charter \nschools. At the same time, it is important that there should be some \naccountability. I know that in Tennessee they have a tough review \nboard, and if a charter school is not working, it is closed down. That \nshould be the case in many other places. You might ask: Why would you \ngo through that struggle? Well, we should be doing that with some of \nthe non-charter public schools as well, and we are beginning to that \nwith so-called turnaround schools.\n  Charter schools should be held to the same standards as other public \nschools. And charter schools shouldn't be allowed to pick and choose; \nthey should be required to enroll all eligible students. If more \nstudents want to come than they have room for, there could be some fair \nmethod for choosing the students, such as a lottery. That makes a very \ngood case. If charter schools are so popular that more families want \ntheir children to go to them, then we need even more charter schools.\n  I am happy to come to the floor today to praise the teachers and the\n\n[[Page S3003]]\n\ninnovators, Presidents of both parties, including President Obama and \nhis Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, who have strongly supported \ncharter schools, just as President Bush and President Clinton and the \nfirst President Bush did.\n  This is a movement that has broad bipartisan support. It has grown \nfrom a handful of schools in Minnesota 20 years ago to 5 percent of all \nof our public schools in the country today. What we have found is that \nwhen you give teachers more freedom to use good judgment and when you \ngive parents more choices of schools, good things happen. The charter \nschool movement is proving that. This is a week to salute their hard \nwork and to hope that over the next year, 5 years, 10 years, more and \nmore public schools become charter schools, where teachers are free to \nexercise their judgment and parents are free to choose the schools \ntheir children attend.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, in less than 2 months--53 days--the \ninterest rate on subsidized student loans will double to 6.8 percent \nunless Congress acts. If the rate on subsidized Stafford loans is \nallowed to rise, as many as 7.4 million students across the Nation, \nincluding approximately 43,000 students in Rhode Island, will pay about \n$1,000 more for each year that they borrow, and that is on top of \nalready significant debt.\n  Some have argued, even while claiming to support keeping interest \nrates low, that the increase would not be a significant financial \nburden. Students and families beg to disagree. This would be a \nsignificant impediment to completing their education. For younger \nstudents starting their education, for those seeking educational \nopportunities for job transition in midlife, those opportunities would \nbe frustrated also. Right now students and their families are sitting \naround the kitchen table making tough decisions about next year and \nwhether they can afford to go to school if interest rates double.\n  One Rhode Island mother wrote me:\n\n       Please do not raise the interest rates on student loans. My \n     son will be in his last year . . . I cannot afford to pay any \n     more and fear that he will not be able to graduate and still \n     have all the loans to pay back.\n\n  So in addition to frustrating educational advancement, it could leave \nmany students across the country with lots of debt and no degree.\n  Hundreds of thousands of young people, parents, educators, and \nmembers of the faith community and other community leaders have come to \nus with one simple request: Don't double the rate.\n  Some on the other side have argued that low-cost Federal loans have \ncontributed to rising college costs and increased student debt. This \ndoes not make sense. The maximum amount undergraduate students can \nborrow in subsidized loans has remained unchanged at $23,000 for the \nlast 20 years. There are many causes that are accelerating tuition, but \nthe amount of available, accessible subsidized Federal loans for \nstudents has remained unchanged for 20 years. But increasing the cost \nof these loans by doubling the interest rate will certainly make \ncollege more expensive for families and for students.\n  We need to address college costs, but having the Federal Government \ndouble the interest it charges for students, particularly the low- and \nmoderate-income students, is not the solution. In fact, it complicates \nthe problem dramatically.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they want to stop \nthis from happening. Governor Romney, the presumptive Presidential \nnominee, says he wants to stop this from happening. Yet they are \nblocking us from even moving forward procedurally so we can debate \nthese things, so they could offer their proposals to pay for what we \nagree needs to be done, to stop the interest rate from doubling. They \nare blocking debate because they refuse as much on an ideological as on \na practical basis to change the Tax Code and to close a loophole that \nis egregious and should be closed in order to allow us to help middle-\nincome families. I think they have taken this pledge with respect to no \nnew taxes to a degree that defeats a practical, pragmatic solution to a \nproblem that they know has to be solved. It has to be solved before \nJuly 1.\n  This decision is fairly clear. It is a choice between allowing young \npeople to get a college degree or fealty, to a pledge to never, ever \nraise anything that Grover Norquist says is remotely connected to a \ntax. It is that simple. Unfortunately, that simplicity is undercutting \nthe hopes and dreams of thousands of American students, and that is \nwhat it is coming down to.\n  One of the other ironies in this debate is what we propose to do. \nClosing the subchapter S loophole for high-wage earners in professional \nendeavors is also something that has long been criticized by \nconservatives. In the 2004 Presidential campaign, the late conservative \ncolumnist Robert Novak described the subchapter S loophole as ``one of \nthe last loopholes left in the Internal Revenue Service Code, and it is \na big one.'' I don't think anyone would accuse the late Robert Novak as \nbeing anything but staunchly conservative in all his views.\n  The Wall Street Journal, calling out former Senator John Edwards for \nhis use of this loophole in 2004, called it ``a clever tax dodge.''\n  Again we have a clever tax dodge pitted against helping students go \nto college. I think helping students go to college should win.\n  In fact, the Wall Street Journal editorial points out how in practice \nthis loophole is used. In their words:\n\n       While making his fortune as a trial lawyer [referring to \n     Senator Edwards] in 1995, he formed what is known as a \n     `subchapter S,' corporation with himself as the sole \n     shareholder. Instead of taking his $26.9 million as earnings \n     directly in the following four years, he paid himself a \n     salary of $360,000 a year and took the rest as corporate \n     dividends.\n\n  Obviously at a much lower tax rate but also avoiding payroll taxes.\n  That is what we are trying to close here. I think it ought to be \nclosed in fairness anyway, but the added benefit is that we are able, \nby closing this loophole, to prevent the doubling of the interest rate \non student loans.\n  This is a loophole that should be closed. Again, this money will \nrequire people to pay directly to the Social Security trust fund and \nMedicare trust fund these funds which otherwise were avoided through \nsubchapter S, so it doesn't weaken Social Security but it allows us, \nthrough the scoring mechanism, to prevent doubling of the interest rate \non subsidized loans. It is a win-win proposition.\n  What they propose is going after the preventive care fund that was \npart of health reform. It seems to me it is sort of an unfortunate \npitting of one program that benefits middle-income families versus \nanother program that potentially benefits all, but particularly middle-\nclass families. Frankly, I think there is another concept here which we \nall agree about in theory--if we do not enhance prevention \nopportunities, the cost of health care will be going up and up. What is \nunsustainable now will become more unsustainable. It is not an \nappropriate way to deal with this issue.\n  At a minimum, I hope we can at least get to a serious debate about \nthis. If that is the proposal that Republicans have, let's get it on \nthe table, let's take a vote. Let's take a vote whether you want to \nclose loopholes for very specialized, very wealthy lobbyists and \nlawyers and professionals, or do you want to impact potential savings \non health care through prevention.\n  I think and hope we can come to a bipartisan agreement. The clock is \nticking. The time to act is now. Students and families are counting on \nus to do the right thing and fix this problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I enjoyed listening to the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, as I always do. His passion for education is always \non his sleeve and always front and center and I admire him for that.\n  There are a couple of things I wish to make clear. If you are a \nstudent and you already have a student loan, what we are talking about \nhas nothing to do with your loan. In other words, your rate on that \nloan is not going up. What we are talking about only affects new loans. \nSo before you think about not going to college next year because of all \nthis talk about student loan rates going up, that is not a problem. We \nare only talking about new loans.\n  Second, for 60 percent of the students who get new loans, we are not \ntalking\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\nabout you either. So you don't have to worry about student loan rates \ngoing up.\n  Third, for those of you about whom we are talking, the 40 percent who \nhave these subsidized undergraduate student loans, what we are talking \nabout saving you is $7 a month in interest payments over the next 10 \nyears. Now $7 a month can add up, which is why Governor Romney as well \nas President Obama, Republicans as well as Democrats, wants to keep the \ninterest rate at the rate it is now for new loans, 3.4 percent, for \nanother year. But it is $7 a month in savings. It is important to know \nthat.\n  It is also important to know that there is an easy way to get this \ndone. The House of Representatives has already passed a bill that would \nkeep the interest rate at 3.4 percent for these 40 percent of new loans \nfor one more year. All the majority leader has to do is bring up the \nHouse-passed bill and enact it here in the Senate. In other words, we \nagree on extending the interest rate. We only have a difference of \nopinion about how to pay for it.\n  I have offered an alternative supported by many Republicans, which is \nthe same as the House bill, which simply says we want to keep the \ninterest rate where it is for another year, 3.4 percent, and we want to \ndo the logical thing to pay for it. We want to give back to students \nthe money that the government is taking from them to help pay for the \nnew health care law.\n  You may think: what in the world does the health care bill have to do \nwith student loans? That is what many of us thought when the health \ncare law was being debated. Because, what our friends on the other side \nof the aisle did during the health care law debate was take over the \nwhole student loan program and almost turn the U.S. Secretary of \nEducation into the U.S. banking commissioner. He has the job of making \nmore than $100 billion in new student loans every year. Their idea was \nthe government can make these loans better than the banks. Our friends \non the other side of the aisle said to the students: The banks are \novercharging you. We are going to take it over and we will be doing you \na favor.\n  What did the Democrats do? They took it over, but they didn't do the \nstudents a favor. According to the Congressional Budget Office, there \nwas $61 billion of savings from taking over the loan program, much of \nwhich was money that the students should not have been paying. When the \nfederal government took it over, what did the Democrats do? They spent \nit on other programs, all except for $10 billion, including $8.7 \nbillion helping to pay for the new health care law.\n  The way the Congressional Budget Office looks at it, $61 billion in \nsavings resulted from--and these are my words--the government borrowing \nmoney at 2.8 percent interest and loaning it to students at 6.8 percent \ninterest. We now want to take that profit from overcharging students \nand give it back to students. That is the way to pay for extending the \n3.4 percent interest rate that we are talking about for another year.\n  We are in agreement on this. Republicans as well as Democrats, \nGovernor Romney as well as President Obama, say keep the 3.4 percent \nrate at 3.4 percent for another year. Students should know that it does \nnot affect anybody who has a loan today and that it will save you $7 a \nmonth for a new subsidized loan. We want to do that. But the way we \nwant to pay for it is by giving back the money that the other side of \nthe aisle took from you to help pay for the health care bill. That is \nthe right way to do it, instead of the typical reaction we often hear \nfrom the other side, which is we have something we want to do so we \nwill simply raise taxes on people and businesses creating jobs in the \nmiddle of a recession.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I have the utmost respect for the Senator from Tennessee. \nNo one is as knowledgeable in education programs as he, the former \nSecretary of Education, and someone who has a deep commitment to \neducation, not only with respect to his remarks on charter schools but \non education in all ways. But he refers to what the House has done. The \nHouse, in the Ryan budget, maintains this increase, this doubling of \nthe interest rate. They foresaw, anticipated, and supported the \nincrease to 6.8 percent. Only recently have they apparently had a \nchange of heart and decided that is not appropriate.\n  The other aspect I think is interesting to note about the House is \nthey have proposed significant reductions in tax rates and they have \nsaid they would pay for them by closing loopholes. This is one of the \nmost egregious loopholes that you can find and yet, of course, they \nwill not use this to pay for something which makes a great deal of \nsense--which they now agree there should be no doubling of the student \ninterest rate.\n  The Senator is absolutely right, this doubling will not apply to \nloans that are outstanding. It applies to loans going forward. But if \nwe establish the principle which was embedded in the Ryan House budget, \nwhich I think was supported by most, if not all, of my colleagues on \nthe other side, that this rate is going to be doubled to 6.8 percent \ngoing forward, that is going to have a significant impact on students \nwho have years to go in college and on people who are contemplating \ngoing to college. So the $6 or $7 it may be per month becomes \nsignificant overall.\n  Again, we can get into a discussion about where does this money come \nfrom ultimately in terms of was it part of funds for health care, et \ncetera. But we are facing the choice today of helping students and \nclosing an egregious loophole--one that benefits the wealthiest \nAmericans; it has been criticized by the Wall Street Journal, \ncriticized by Robert Novak, the late columnist--or practically going in \nand targeting prevention programs. I think we conceptually agree if we \ndon't get a handle on prevention of diabetes, of cancer, of diseases \nthat are costing us billions of dollars, then our task to deal with \nhealth care will be immensely more difficult. It is very clear.\n  What is also very clear is, I think, procedurally the answer is quite \nstraightforward. Let's get on to the bill. Let us go ahead and put \nthese two different proposals on the floor and take a vote. I hope the \nproposal to close the loophole would pass. But if it did not, at least \nwe would be in a position of preventing the doubling of interest rates \non student loans.\n  With great respect to the Senator from Tennessee, I hope we can move \nforward, have a vote on the different proposals to pay for it, and then \nmove forward and let people know that their rates will not be doubled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I strongly support this legislation, S. \n2343, the Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act. I appreciate \nthe leadership particularly of Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who has \nbeen so eloquent on this subject. I also would note that Senator \nAlexander and I have worked together on a host of issues. I think he \nbrings great expertise to this discussion as well.\n  The bottom line for me is that millions of young people are hurting \nright now in America. They are up to their eyeballs in debt and they \ncannot find good-paying jobs.\n  For example, we have seen in our home State, according to the Oregon \nEmployment Department, that the overall unemployment rate last year was \n9.4 percent but was 19 percent for workers age 16 to 24. I also note we \nhave seen that the labor participation for young people has declined as \nwell.\n  We have an enormous array of challenges in front of us. The reason \nthat this legislation, the Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike \nAct, is so important is that it allows us to achieve two important \nobjectives. First, it puts us in a position to hold the line on student \ndebt. If you are a sophomore in college, for example, and you have \nalready incurred some debt and you want to finish school, then you want \nto get a degree in a field where you will get a job that pays a good \nwage. Without this legislation you are going to incur still more \ndebt. So this legislation ought to be supported because it holds the \nline on debt, and by doing so it helps us achieve a very important \nobjective: to increase the opportunity for young people to access \nhigher education across the country. And historically whether it has \nbeen through Pell grants or Stafford loans and the like, we've always \nsaid to young people, try\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\nto get to college. Families sitting around kitchen tables and in their \nliving rooms have said this for years. Work hard in high school and try \nto get into college. And I have supported, here in the Senate, policies \nthat increase access to a good education. By holding the line on debt, \nwe can take steps to achieve an important part of higher education \npolicy, and that is expanding access to higher education.\n\n  The second benefit of this legislation, in my view, is that by \nholding the line on debt we increase the opportunity for young people \nto get more value out of their education. The reason I bring this up is \nbecause my sense is that future policy in the higher education field is \ngoing to be about marrying these two objectives. Let's support this \nimportant legislation, S. 2343, to expand access, and use it as a \nfoundation to move on to the next step of education policy, which is to \nget more value out of the education a young person pursues.\n  The reason I feel that way is that all over my State I am going to \nhigh schools and community colleges and talking with students who are \nthinking about both of those principles, access and value.\n  For example, at Blue Mountain Community College in Pendleton I met a \nyoung man who is taking 20 credits at school, working at Arby's full \ntime as a manager, and he is already concerned about the debt he is \nracking up. He said to me: As I get my education, how will I know that \nI have laid the groundwork for being able to get a good-paying job? I \ntold him, just as I am suggesting to the Senate today, that I am going \nto support efforts to expand student aid and make sure we hold down \ndebt for young people. I described what we are dealing with on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I also told him I have introduced a piece of legislation with my \ncolleague on the other side of the aisle, Marco Rubio, called the \nStudent Right To Know Before You Go Act. This bill will make it \npossible for students all across the country to get information about \nthe expected average annual earnings after graduation, the rates of \nremedial enrollment for a particular field at a particular college, the \naverage costs both before and after financial aid, and the prospects of \na student earning a good wage after achieving a particular degree at a \nparticular school. With this legislation we lay the foundation for what \nI think will be the education policy of the future.\n  We will ensure that students have access and ensure that they get \nmore value out of their education and get more value out of the loans \nand other debt that they have to pay back. And the two go hand in hand. \nI ran into students who were juniors, for example, at colleges in my \nState and already owe $60,000. Without this legislation, those juniors \nare probably going to reup for a loan, and they are going to have to \npay more, and that has the effect of reducing access to higher \neducation. Paying more, it seems, is also going to reduce the \nopportunity for students to buy a bit more value out of their education \nas we try to get them better information with respect to the value of \nspecific degree programs at specific schools. This type of information \nis now impossible to find. Suffice it to say, these two judgments, both \nwith respect to the debt and the value of what they have pursued in \nterms of their college degree, are going to color their decisions for \nthe rest of their lives.\n  One of the students I met in Oregon recently as I talked about this \nissue was interested in getting a medical degree. And as we have talked \nabout health care issues--which the President of the Senate and I have \nboth been very interested in over the years--one of the questions he \nasked me was how was he going to be able to get a medical degree \ninitially and what would happen to him when he got out of medical \nschool with all of this debt hanging over his head. I didn't want to \nchill his enthusiasm, but we know that if a young person comes out of \nmedical school with an enormous amount of debt, there is a pretty good \nchance at some point they are going to have to pass some of that debt \non to their patients, which means we are going to see medical costs for \na lot of people in our country escalate still higher.\n  So the fact that we have these debts and the fact that it is hard for \nyoung people to purchase value in their education is going to have \nremarkable ripples all through our country for years and years ahead.\n  I am going to close simply by way of saying this: We have seen young \npeople contribute to our economy. The President of the Senate shares an \ninterest with this Senator in technology. Technology has been a big \nsource of jobs in States such as Minnesota and Oregon. This has been a \nreal economic engine for our country. Think about who brought us \nFacebook and Google and Twitter and YouTube. A disproportionate amount \nof the creative talent has been young people.\n  So we must first take steps to hold the line on debt--and that is to \npass Senator Harkin's and Senator Reid's bill--so we don't say to \ncollege sophomores and juniors, we don't care if they rack up any more \ndebt when we know how much heartache it is going to bring to them. Then \nwe can move on to the next step, which is empowering students and \nfamilies to be able to get the maximum amount of value from their \neducation. If we don't take these steps I think we will have let the \ncountry down in this area at a crucial time.\n  We understand that higher education is one of the principal paths, if \nnot the best path, to success for many students. It is not for every \nstudent, but certainly for millions. And education has enabled many \nyoung people to contribute to technology which has been, as I \ndescribed, a real spark for our economy.\n  So I see other colleagues waiting to speak, and I only urge \ncolleagues to pass this legislation, S. 2343, to ensure that we don't \nheap more debt onto the backs of students in college now and who might \nbe reupping on those loans and wondering if they can afford it. Then as \nwe expand access, let's look at taking additional steps to ensure that \nour young people get more value for their college education.\n  Senator Rubio and I have teamed up on a bill that I think addresses \nthat question, the Student Right To Know Before You Go Act. Going to \nthat next step and adding more value to a young person's education when \nthey are armed with the facts requires that we lay the foundation of \naccess to a good education, which I think should be required when so \nmany young people are hurting.\n  I went through the statistics, and it requires that we pass S. 2343.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to also speak \nabout preventing student loan interest rates from doubling from 3.4 \npercent to 6.8 percent. I am disappointed that partisan gamesmanship is \nthreatening the financial futures of students in North Carolina and \naround the country.\n  In North Carolina we are very proud of our 16 excellent public \nuniversities and 58 outstanding community colleges. In addition, dozens \nof the best private colleges and universities in the Nation also call \nNorth Carolina home. Our excellence in higher education sets North \nCarolina apart.\n  Business owners I talked to routinely told me that our highly \neducated and highly skilled workforce is what attracted their companies \nto North Carolina. There is no doubt that the strength of our economy \ngoing forward depends on the continued strength of our educational \nsystem. However, the cost of college continues to rise in North \nCarolina and across the country. If Congress does not act before July \n1, more than 160,000 North Carolina students will be saddled with an \nadditional $1,000 in student loan debt.\n  According to the project on student debt, more than half of North \nCarolina's 300,000 students at 4-year colleges and universities \nborrowed money to pay for their education. On average these students \ngraduated with more than $21,000 in debt. That debt has real \nconsequences for our graduates and for North Carolina's economy. With \nthis debt to pay off, young entrepreneurs are less likely to take a \nchance starting a small business. They are less likely to buy a new \ncar, and they are less likely to buy a home. This only hurts our \neconomy. Keeping interest rates low will go a long way to ensuring that \nyoung people can afford their student loan payments when they graduate.\n  I recently heard from a freshman at UNC Charlotte about how concerned\n\n[[Page S3006]]\n\nshe already was about the debt she was piling up when she graduates in \n4 years. She cannot imagine what would happen if interest rates double. \nPerhaps she would have to drop out altogether.\n  A student at Western Carolina University recently wrote to me, while \nstudying for finals, asking that we please prevent a doubling of his \nstudent loan interest rates. So in the midst of preparing for final \nexams, this young man was worrying about the final bill that he will \nreceive after graduating. He said doubling the Stafford loan interest \nrate would severely hurt his ability to continue his education. He \nwants to study cell biology.\n  In a global 21st-century economy, the sciences are exactly the types \nof fields that we need our students to excel in so we can compete with \nChina and other foreign countries. We should be helping these young \npeople succeed, not throwing up barriers that get in the way.\n  I am also hearing from parents. A mom with three children e-mailed me \nrecently. Her oldest child will be starting college in 2 years. She is \nalready worried about the debt that her children will incur, and she \ncertainly is requesting that we not double the interest rate on this \ndebt.\n  Our students deserve a fighting chance when they graduate. We \nshouldn't put them thousands of dollars behind before they even reach \nthe starting line. I will do my part to ensure students in North \nCarolina have the chance to thrive after graduating.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation that \nwill prevent student interest rate loans from doubling.\n  I yield the floor and notice the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I understand we are debating the motion \nto proceed to S. 2343, the Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act \nof 2012; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to urge my \ncolleagues to vote to proceed to this important legislation. I was \ndisappointed to see many of my Republican colleagues voted against \nallowing debate and amendment on this legislation. I have heard \nSenators from both sides of the aisle acknowledge the need to prevent \nthe July 1 rate increase on the Stafford loans, the subsidized loans. \nSo it is difficult to understand their unwillingness to even consider \nthe bill and have a thoughtful debate and an opportunity for amendment \nwhich will allow us to keep these interest rates low for college \nstudents in all of our States.\n  Members may disagree about the best way to pay for keeping the rates \nat 3.4 percent, but we need to go ahead and proceed to the legislation \nand pass legislation to accomplish this. If Senators have different \nproposals, they can offer them. But by blocking debate, we, obviously, \ncannot get to a solution of this problem.\n  The Democrats have proposed to pay for the legislation by closing a \ntax loophole that people use to avoid paying Social Security and \nMedicare taxes. That is the so-called S corporation payroll tax \nloophole. This proposal would close the loophole for S corporations for \nwhich 75 percent of the corporation's income is attributable to the \nservices of three or fewer shareholders.\n  This loophole allows, for example, an individual lawyer or a lobbyist \nto set up an S corporation to make millions of dollars in fees and to \nnot pay payroll taxes on nearly all that income. All he has to do is \ngive himself a cash dividend from the corporation instead of paying \nhimself wages. This is not a fair arrangement.\n  To be clear, not all small businesses are gaming the system in this \nway and are not permitted to game the system in this way. This loophole \nis not available to businesses that are organized as sole \nproprietorships or as partnerships. Those small businesses are paying \ntheir fair share of taxes.\n  By contrast to this way of paying for the continuation of the low \ninterest on student loans, my Republican colleagues have opted for a \nvery different approach. They offset the cost by using the Prevention \nand Public Health Fund. In my view, this is a misguided approach. The \nprevention fund is not a slush fund, as it has been called by many. \nInstead, it is a fund used to help reduce chronic disease such as \ndiabetes and heart disease and to fund immunization programs for \nchildren. This is a critical fund that is used to lower long-term \nhealth costs and improve health outcomes. In my view, eliminating this \nfund would simply increase health risks and, ultimately, increase \nhealth care costs in this country.\n  It is very clear Democrats and Republicans have a fundamental \ndifference in our approach to how we should maintain student loan \ninterest rates. However, as I said before, it is important we get to \nthe bill, we proceed to vote for cloture on this bill, so we can \ndiscuss a path forward and consider amendments, if individual Senators \nwish to propose amendments.\n  Preparing students for an education is essential for this country's \nglobal competitiveness. It is imperative we provide students the tools \nthey need to succeed in this very fast changing economy. This includes \naccess to a high-quality education, which will enable us to train the \nnext generation of Americans for jobs in high-technology fields.\n  This past Tuesday I spoke at a luncheon that was put on by a \nfoundation that supports one of our community colleges in New Mexico. \nIt is clear we have many students who are working very hard to make \nends meet and to stay in school so they can obtain the skills they need \nto earn a good wage, to pursue a constructive career. There are many \nareas of our economy where these types of trained workers are needed.\n  One area which is obvious in my State and nationwide is in health \ncare. We need to train more nurses. One statistic used in this talk \nlast Tuesday was that over the next 8 years, between now and 2020, we \nare going to have to add 700,000 more nurses to the health care field \nto meet the needs of the baby boom generation. In addition to those \n700,000, we are going to have to hire an additional 500,000 just to \nreplace those who retire from the nursing profession. So we have 1.2 \nmillion nurses who are going to have to be hired in this country over \nthe next 8 years. We need to train those people.\n  There are many young people in this country who would like to have \nthat training. They need student loans in order to be able to cover the \ncosts of that training. That is why this is such an important debate.\n  Student loan debt has, for the first time in our history, surpassed \ncredit card debt. Today this debt exceeds $1 trillion. The average \ncollege graduate leaves school with more than $25,000 in loans.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, college costs at State \nschools are rising and have been rising at an alarming rate. These \nincreased costs far outpace the increased costs of medical care. We are \noften giving speeches on this Senate floor about the high increase, the \nexcessive increase in medical care costs. In fact, the cost of college \nfor many students is rising even faster. The same thing can be said \nabout gasoline. I see my colleagues rush to the floor whenever the \nprice of gasoline begins moving up--and with good reason. It is a major \nburden on U.S. families and Americans everywhere. But the growth in \nthese costs pale in comparison to the growth we are seeing in the cost \nof education.\n  The cost of tuition and fees has nearly sextupled since 1985. This is \nparticularly troublesome for students from low-income families.\n  If we allow interest rates to double, there are 7.4 million students \nnationwide who will see an increase in the cost of their student loans \nbeginning on the 1st of July. This has a direct impact on students and \non families because subsidized Stafford loans are need based, and they \nare typically designed and focused on helping low- and moderate-income \nstudents.\n\n  In my State of New Mexico, about 40,000--the specific number I have \nbeen given is 39,875 but about 40,000 students will see an increase in \ninterest rates if we do not take action before the 1st of July.\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\n  There are nearly 10,000 undergraduates at New Mexico State University \nwho will feel the effects of doubling rates and there are thousands of \nstudents at the University of New Mexico who will also see these \nincreases.\n  This is true of our smaller schools in New Mexico as well. The school \nI was speaking at last week was Eastern New Mexico University in \nRoswell. There are 222 students there who took out Stafford student \nloans during this current academic year.\n  The Department of Education estimates that the average student would \npay as much as an additional $1,000 per year for their student loans \nunless we can keep this interest rate where it is. Not only would \nincoming students be affected, current students would also feel the \nincrease as they originate a new loan for the new academic year. The \nadditional burden on our students would be substantial.\n  Students and families understand the additional increase in costs. In \nthe last few weeks, I have been hearing from constituents all over my \nState asking us to prevent this rate increase.\n  One student from Gallup, NM, wrote to me saying:\n\n       Give a break to the future of this country and to the \n     millions of students and families who need the relief from \n     the debt of college.\n\n  Another family from Albuquerque wrote to me saying:\n\n       I write to urge you to vote so that student loan interest \n     rates DO NOT go up. In this recession, more than ever, people \n     of all ages are depending on education as a means of gaining \n     employment, and depending at least in part on student loans.\n\n  So our constituents are asking us to take action. By doing so we can \ncontinue to provide students with stability as they enter and complete \ntheir education.\n  A high-quality educational system unleashes the potential of our \nstudents. We need world-class problem solvers and thinkers if we are \ngoing to remain competitive. By investing in American students, we can \ngrow our economy and build the middle class.\n  Let's move ahead with consideration of this bill. If a majority of \nSenators wish to change the way the bill is paid for, then we can \nconsider that amendment. But we should not refuse to allow the bill to \ncome to the Senate floor for debate and amendment.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I have \nweek after week since the health care law has been passed, with a \ndoctor's second opinion about the law that I have great concerns with. \nI do that as a doctor who practiced medicine for 25 years, took care of \nfamilies in Wyoming, was involved with programs aimed at prevention of \ndisease, early detention of disease, and early treatment of disease. I \ncome to the floor to talk specifically about a portion of the health \ncare law that has been discussed quite a bit in the last week or two on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Congress has talked a lot about the so-called Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund included in the President's health care law. When I looked \nat this health care law initially--and I continue to do so--I asked the \nquestion, is this health care law the best way to give patients the \ncare they need, from a doctor they want, at a cost they can afford? I \nbelieve it has failed in so many ways to do that, which is why I \ncontinue to work to try to repeal and replace this health care law.\n  When we get to the specifics of this Prevention and Public Health \nFund, the President and Democrats have claimed that the purpose of the \nfund was to promote wellness, prevent disease, and protect against \npublic health emergencies. All of us want to promote wellness, prevent \ndisease, and protect against public health emergencies. I know how \nimportant those things are as a doctor. I know how important it is to \nthe point that for over two decades in Wyoming, I was medical director \nof a program called Wyoming Health Fairs, where we provided low-cost \nhealth care screenings to people all across the Cowboy State. It is a \nvery important program. People have continued to write letters to me \nover the decades about the fact that going to a health fair and \nlearning about how to prevent diseases, about early detection of \nproblems, and how they feel either they or members of their families \nhave had their lives saved as a result of the services provided all \nthroughout those communities aimed at prevention and early detention of \nproblems--tests such as blood pressure, PSA tests, people learning \nabout how to examine themselves, how to get a mammogram--a lost-cost or \nfree mammogram--all of these things that are aimed at prevention. These \ngave people the tools they needed to make decisions about their health \nand their health care--not just for the patient but also to help their \nmedical providers.\n  Instead of helping Americans prevent health problems, the President's \nnew law actually uses this so-called prevention fund as a Washington \nslush fund. In fact, the new health law provided about $15 billion for \nthis fund from 2010 to 2019, and then beyond that about $2 billion \nevery year in annual appropriation of funds to go toward this same \nslush fund--$2 billion a year forever.\n  Who will control the fund? The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. Even though this law has only been in place for 2 years, we \nhave already witnessed how the Obama administration officials have \nallowed this money to be wasted. Among other things, we hear of a \nhealth clinic using the funding to spay and neuter pets. That is right, \nto spay and neuter pets.\n  The Minnesota Department of Health used $3.6 million to create at \nleast four regional food policy councils. And taxpayers will be happy \nto learn--or will not be so happy to learn, of course--that their hard-\nearned money helped a county in California secure a ban on new fast \nfood restaurants.\n  I have nothing against food policy councils or spaying and neutering \npets, but when the U.S. Government is borrowing approximately 40 cents \nout of every dollar that we spend, and when we have a national debt in \nthe area of $15 trillion, Washington should not waste Americans' hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars. But we continue to do it, and this fund is a \nkey example.\n  According to the nonpartisan CBO, eliminating the prevention fund \nwould save about $13.6 billion over the next 10 years. The fact is \nCongress already funds many prevention programs--prevention programs \nwith a proven track record of success. Examples include cancer \nprevention, tobacco prevention, and a host of other programs.\n  Republicans have supported, and will continue to support, these \ncritical prevention programs--cancer prevention, tobacco prevention, \nand working on heart disease. However, the record is clear that the so-\ncalled prevention fund in the health care law is wasteful and \nduplicative. It doesn't help people stay well or become well.\n  Senator Alexander from Tennessee introduced legislation that would \neliminate this slush fund and use the savings to maintain student loan \ninterest rates at 3.4 percent.\n  Under current law, students who receive subsidized Stafford student \nloans will see rates increase shortly to 6.8 percent, unless, of \ncourse, Congress acts. I am ready to act. Whether you are Republican or \nDemocrat, liberal or conservative, people generally agree that \npreventing this rate increase is an important priority. The difference \nis how do we pay for it.\n  The majority leader wants to raise taxes on small business owners. He \nsays that is the better way forward. But there is a better way forward \nthan raising taxes on the people who create jobs, at a time when we \nhave over 8-percent unemployment and last month's job numbers are \nabysmal. Only 125,000 new jobs were created, but 3 times that amount of \npeople quit looking for jobs completely. For every one new job, three \npeople quit looking for jobs at all. To raise taxes on the people who \nare creating jobs in this country is the wrong way to go.\n  Senator Alexander's proposal stops the rate increase by eliminating \nthis prevention slush fund. His bill uses the rest of the funding for \ndeficit reduction. I have cosponsored that legislation.\n  I think it is also important to know that the President has already \nagreed\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\nto use his slush fund to offset other spending. In September of 2011, \nthe President proposed reducing the slush fund by $3.5 billion. In \nFebruary, part of the payroll tax cut signed by the President contained \na $4.5 billion cut from his slush fund. Finally, in March, the \nPresident's 2013 budget proposed cutting the fund by another $5 \nbillion.\n\n  It is ironic that the President of the United States and Washington \nDemocrats now oppose using money from their so-called prevention slush \nfund. If the White House and Democrats in Congress want to ensure that \nstudent loan rates stay low, they will cut this wasteful program and \nuse the money to help the next generation of Americans.\n  We do know that young people coming out of college today are, on \naverage, having a debt of about $25,000; and whether the interest rate \nis zero or 3.4 percent or 6.8 percent, they are still coming out with a \nhuge debt, at a time when we know 53 percent of the people coming out \nof school can't find a job or cannot find a job consistent with their \nlevel of education. We also read that 40 percent are going back home to \nlive; some are returning home instead of going out into the workplace.\n  It is time to focus on the economy, on getting people back to work, \nand it is time to agree that we need to keep the interest rates low; \nthat we ought to pay for it with money that is there, which can easily \nbe used. We should not raise taxes on job creators at a time when the \ncountry is in this sort of economic condition.\n  I continue to come to the floor week after week to talk about \nfindings in the health care law. Some things are unintended \nconsequences, and some things are money tucked away for other purposes. \nIt is hard for Americans to ever forget Nancy Pelosi saying that first \nyou have to pass the health care law before you get to find out what is \nin it. The more the American people find out what is in it, the less \nthey like it--to the point that 67 percent of Americans feel that the \nhealth care law should be totally or at least partially found \nunconstitutional, as the Supreme Court looks to make their ruling in \nthe next months ahead.\n  This is a health care law that, in my opinion, is bad for patients, \nbad for providers--the nurses and doctors who take care of the \npatients--and it is terrible for the American taxpayers. This is a time \nwhen we need to repeal and replace this health care law. Now there is a \nway to use one of the provisions within it to fund and make sure that \nwe do not raise interest rates for the students in this country, so \nthey can get the education they need and, hopefully, find a job and not \npunish those who have tried to provide jobs to these graduates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on a motion to proceed to S. 2343.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to \nproceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, later I want to speak for a few minutes \nabout our colleague Senator Lugar.\n  First, I want to comment about what the Senator from Wyoming was \nsaying on the health bill.\n  Very quickly, I could not disagree more with the Senator from Wyoming \nin his comments with respect to the health care bill. This morning we \nhad a meeting with Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who was outlining to us \nall of the gains we are making with respect to health care in America \nas a result of the legislation.\n  What is interesting is that our colleagues who keep coming to the \nfloor and saying repeal the health care bill never offer alternatives \nto Americans. I hope Americans who are buying into this notion that \nsomehow the health care bill doesn't serve them because they are angry \nabout one thing or another will look at what the health care bill does \nbecause, in point of fact, if you were to repeal the health care bill, \nand they have no alternative to replace it, here are some of the things \nthat happen: One, you immediately add $2 trillion to the deficit of our \nNation. Bang, done deal. That goes right away on that. The health care \nbill is judged by the CBO to reduce the deficit. It has specific \nsavings in it. If you get rid of it, those savings go away and, bang, \nthe deficit goes up.\n  No. 2, 47 million to 50-some million Americans who have no health \ncare or didn't have it before the bill will return to the status of \nhaving no health care.\n  Now, does everybody in America think it is better to have 50-some \nmillion Americans walking around without health care who, when they \nwalk into a hospital--perhaps they get hit by a car or have an accident \nand go to a hospital--receive care that everybody is paying for but \nthey are paying for it in the most inefficient way possible? The burden \nis being paid for by people who have the health care. It goes into \ntheir premiums. It isn't shared by people buying their insurance and \nsharing the risk of getting sick. So all of a sudden, if you get rid of \nthe health care bill, we return America to the days when millions of \nAmericans had no care. And guess what happens when they have no care. \nThey jam the emergency rooms because that is the only place to get the \ncare. The emergency room becomes the place of primary care. But my \ncolleagues do not answer that question. They never deal with reality. \nThey deal with politics and ideology and they throw a lot of baloney at \npeople.\n  The fact is, if we were to get rid of the health care bill, all those \npeople who used to get sick and would get a letter from their insurance \ncompany saying: Gee, sorry to hear you have terminal cancer, but you \nare not covered--and that is what happened all the time in America--\nthat would start happening again. People were thrown off their policies \nthat they had been paying for for years, and all of a sudden they had \nno coverage. But they do not address that.\n  There is another issue: preexisting conditions. Again and again and \nagain, people would be denied the ability to buy health care coverage \nbecause they had a preexisting condition of some kind. So if 10 years \nago someone had a cancer, even if they were cured of their cancer, the \ninsurance company could either refuse them or charge them a higher set \nof premiums. People were denied coverage--they just didn't get it. \nWomen who were pregnant and were applying for insurance heard: Oh, \nsorry, that is a preexisting condition. You are pregnant. We are not \ngoing to cover that.\n  So in America we drove people into poverty for a long period of time. \nThey had to sell their homes or sell down everything they had to become \nimpoverished in order to get to a point where they could get some help.\n  What about kids in school today? Under the health care bill, up until \nthe age of 26, a child can now be covered by their parents' program. It \nis not free, it has to be paid for, but they can be covered by it. That \nwould be eliminated.\n  So all of a sudden we would have a whole bunch of people who would be \nautomatically eliminated and going out fighting to get insurance in the \nmarketplace.\n  Let me tell you what else happens. There are a whole bunch of reforms \nto the health care system that our friends never talk about. Today \nKathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, laid out \nfor us the enormous gains we are making in Medicare fraud. We are \nbeginning to make huge savings for people. The average senior is now \nsaving over $4,000 on their health care bills because of what has been \nput in place by the health care bill. There are a whole series of \nthings. I don't have them all here at my disposal now because I wasn't \nplanning to talk about this when I came to the floor, but there are a \nseries of reforms about how we pay hospitals, bundling the payments to \na hospital, requiring greater accountability from hospitals. I mean, \ndon't we want greater accountability from hospitals? That will vanish. \nThat will be gone if we do away with the health care bill.\n  We also have greater coordination of care for patients from the \nbeginning of their private care through their admissions and into their \ndischarges. What happens today is there is no coordination of that \ncare, and so a lot of people are discharged, and the readmission rate \nis staggering because there isn't the coordination between their \npostoperative, postsurgery care and their\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\nprimary physicians and the hospitals. Now there are a number of \ndifferent pilot projects in place to help coordinate that.\n  Similarly, we are coordinating the care of what are called dual \neligibles--the people who are eligible for Medicare but also eligible \nfor Medicaid. That care has not been well coordinated, so we have huge \nduplication, enormous costs we don't need, and the result is a waste of \nmoney. All of that is being eliminated and/or reduced to a significant \nlevel.\n  There are so many other examples. Let me cite another one. The \nSenator talked about wanting to take money out of preventive medicine. \nPreventive medicine? We are told by the doctors, who are the experts \nand who deal with diabetes, that if we had early screening, which comes \nby having health care coverage, we could eliminate an enormous amount--\nmaybe as much as $100 billion--of surgery costs and dialysis costs as a \nresult of people not discovering they have this ailment until it is too \nlate for treatment by the more accessible and easier means. There are \nsome oral medications and other things people can take to deal with \nthis disease, but they have to get there at the early stage. If they \nget there too late, they wind up having to do amputations of limbs or \nthe patient winds up on dialysis, all of which is far more expensive.\n  There are also pilot projects in the health care bill for helping \npeople receive care at home and not be forced into a higher priced care \nenvironment, such as a nursing home or a longer term care kind of \nenvironment. This allows them to receive care at home and be in the \ndignity of their own home and independent and, obviously, with much \nless cost. All of those things would be wiped out by this notion that \nwe are just going to get rid of this bill.\n  What this whole notion is built on is the early negative branding--\nvery effective negative branding--that took place and was wrapped \naround the so-called death panels and the other things, none of which \nare in this legislation. It is not in it. So this is political. That is \nwhy they call it ObamaCare, not health care. They call it ObamaCare to \nmake it a pejorative and to do their best to try to wrap it up in the \nnegativity of politics in our country today. And it is a tragedy \nbecause it doesn't do justice to the kind of thinking that ought to go \ninto and did go into this bill in terms of how we do things that really \ncreate competition in the marketplace and allow people to get better \nhealth care.\n  What is astonishing is that we spend something like, I think, $15,000 \nper patient in America. I think that is the average cost. There are \ncountries spending half of that and a lot of countries spending around \n$11,000 a patient that, I am sad to say, are getting better health \noutcomes than we get in the United States of America. The United States \nof America is not No. 1 in health outcomes for the money we are \nspending in the system, and there are a whole lot of reasons for that, \nbut that is part of why this reform is so critical to our country.\n\n  I could say a lot more about this, but I am not going to say it now. \nEvery time we hear from people who are just talking now about how we \nhave to get rid of the health care bill, we have to stand and make it \nclear to people why this bill is good. A lot of Americans have not \nheard enough about how this legislation works for them, works for the \ncountry, and will improve our system. Is it the cure-all--no pun \nintended--of the health care system? No. I don't pretend it is. We will \nhave to do more. We will have to tweak it. But it is a beginning step, \nwith critical components that take 4 and 5 and 6 years to put into \nplace so that we can get the full measure of their impact.\n  I will say this. We have it in Massachusetts. We have it now, and \nbusinesses are not complaining. In fact, we have one of the best \neconomies of any State in the country. I think our unemployment rate is \nnow down around 4.9, 5 percent, somewhere in that vicinity. So we have \nthis program. We have had it for a few years now, and 98.6 percent of \nthe people in our State are covered. It has been mandatory since the \nbeginning, and it is working. It is beginning to bring down costs in \nthe individual marketplace. The premiums have gone down by something \nlike 45, 50 percent.\n  So I think we have to look at facts, as we do on a whole lot of \nissues here facing this country today, rather than continuing this \nsilly talking past each other, completely contrived, political, \nideological debate that is calculated to win power and not calculated \nnecessarily to serve the best interests of our Nation. I hope we are \ngoing to engage on this over these next months, and I look forward to \ndefending this health care bill because I think the bill is good for \nAmerica. I think this bill, while it obviously needs some refinement, \nsome changes, and some tweaking here and there, has accomplished an \nenormous amount already and is on track to accomplish an enormous \namount going forward.\n  I think the administration has a much better story to tell about it \nthan has been told, and I am glad the President has said he looks \nforward to going out and talking to the country about it because I \nbelieve that as the country learns more about it, in fact, they will \nsay: Wow, that makes sense; that seems like a pretty sensible thing to \ndo.\n  For our opponents who want to just get rid of the legislation, they \nhave an absolute obligation to put the full deal on the table about \nwhat they are going to do in return, and not just Medicare, with the \nRyan proposal--which makes it more expensive for seniors and undoes \nMedicare as we know it, not just that part of it--but the whole of it. \nHow are they going to cover the uninsured? What will they do to take \ncare of all those medical institutions that are struggling to teach \ndoctors for the future? How are they going to hold those folks in a way \nthat continues medical education in our country and so forth? They owe \nit to the Nation to answer those questions.\n  Mr. President, that concludes the portion of my remarks I wanted to \nmake in response to the Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                    Tribute to Senator Richard Lugar\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to share a few thoughts, \nnot about the results of the election last night in Indiana per se, but \nI do wish to talk about the consequences for the Senate of the loss of \nSenator Lugar as of next year and particularly for the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  It is no secret that Dick Lugar's loss last night is going to be \nparticularly felt by all of us who have had the privilege of working \nwith him on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whether he was the \nchairman of the committee--and I served under him when he was \nchairman--or whether as a member of the committee and the ranking \nmember, as he is now and as I am now privileged to serve with him.\n  Whether we agreed with him or not, whether he had the gavel or he \ndidn't have the gavel, Dick Lugar had an approach to the Senate and to \ngoverning that was always the same: He was serious, he was thoughtful, \nand he refused to allow this march to an orthodoxy about ideology and \npartisan politics to get in the way of what he thought was the \nresponsibility of a Senator and, indeed, the need of the country to \nhave people come together and find the common ground. He dug deeply \ninto some of foreign policy's most vexing issues, and his expertise on \ncomplicated issues that were honed over 36 years really can't be \nreplicated. That is something we are going to lose--the institutional \nexperience, the judgment, and the wisdom of the approach on some of \nthose issues, such as the constitutional questions he would call into \naccount when no one else would, the question of not being stampeded by \npopular opinion with respect to the use of force in one instance or \nanother. All of those are essential to making this institution live up \nto its full capacity.\n  Already since last night's news, we have been hearing again and again \non some of the news shows and elsewhere about the work of the Senator \nfrom Indiana on nuclear nonproliferation. It is no secret his Nunn-\nLugar efforts have become almost shorthand for bipartisanship in \nforeign policy, and they should be recognized. But I want to emphasize \nhere and now that is not all Senator Lugar contributed to this field of \nforeign policy. He is a leading expert on some of the urgent issues \nthat are off the beaten path, from food security and the eradication of \nhunger worldwide, to his work with Joe Biden and then with me, I am \nprivileged to say, to change our relationship with\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\nPakistan, helping prevent their economy from unraveling and encouraging \nthem to cooperate with interests vital to America--indeed, to the \nstability of that region--and to establishing what he called a \n``deeper, broader, long-term strategic engagement'' with Pakistan.\n  I am privileged to say, for me, the personal journey with Dick Lugar \nbegan before that, and I think it epitomizes who he is and why he will \nbe missed. It has nothing to do with ideology.\n  Back in 1980, shortly after I came here--I was elected in 1984, and I \nstarted on the Foreign Relations Committee in 1985. Right away, we \nbegan to work together on the issue of the Philippines, free and fair \nelections in the Philippines. I had traveled over there a number of \ntimes as a freshman Senator. I had met with Ferdinand Marcos. I was \nconcerned about the torture taking place and the political prisoners \nand other violations of rights. Yet we were sort of aiding them \nnotwithstanding our values and our standards.\n  Well, Dick Lugar joined with me in that effort. He didn't have any \nreason to join with a freshly minted Senator, wet behind the ears, but \nhe did. Together we sort of became a team that started to focus on the \nPhilippines to figure out how we could hold Marcos accountable. He was \nserious and he was fair-minded, and I saw firsthand during our trip to \nthe Philippines which we made at the time of the election--after we had \ndone a whole lot of groundwork to set up an accountability system for \nthat election--that he had a very personal and special understanding of \nwhat the United States meant to the rest of the world with respect to \nour values. That cause animated this man whom we all know is dignified \nand reserved and humble but who proudly came back and recounted with \nsome animation to President Reagan the difference that the United \nStates of America makes when it gives voice to people's aspirations for \nfreedom--and, in this case particularly, the people of the Philippines.\n  The fact is it was that discussion with Ronald Reagan and the results \nthat came out of the accountability in that election that forced \nFerdinand Marcos to leave and we saw Cory Aquino come to power and the \nPhilippines move back into genuine democracy.\n  I saw the same commitment with Senator Lugar a number of times over \nthe years, but never more so than 2 years ago when we worked together \non the New START treaty. His wisdom and his patience was invaluable in \nlaying out the case, particularly in building support across the aisle \nso we could find the path to 71 votes.\n  I said then, and I say it again today, given the bitter, divisive, \npartisan, continual political squabbling that seems to dominate life in \nthe city today, 71 votes is probably the equivalent of the 98 votes we \nused to get on those kinds of efforts. So I am grateful to him for his \nwillingness to work to do that. He worked to give Members more time to \nwork through problems, to find a way to solve individual objections. It \nreminded me of the way you actually work in what is now sometimes, \nunfortunately, sarcastically referred to as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. He deliberated and he helped us deliberate.\n  I thought it was one of the finer and prouder moments of the Senate \nin recent years.\n  I am confident Dick Lugar's record in our committee is going to be \none of those which is remembered for a long time. Sadly, last night it \nwas remembered in the context of Senator Fulbright, who also came to \nlose a primary in the end and paid a high price for his concern about \nglobal affairs and his involvement with those issues. But I think he is \nalso remembered significantly for the enormous legacy he built about \nAmerican foreign policy and how to make our country stronger.\n  Dick Lugar does that, and I think he has made it clear--there is no \ndoubt in the mind of anybody on our side of the aisle--that Dick Lugar \nis a conservative and his votes through the years have shown that. He \nis a proud Republican.\n  But I think probably because he served as a mayor before he came \nhere, he applied what we call the LaGuardia rule to foreign policy--\nwhich is the rule that Theodore LaGuardia applied to doing things in \nNew York. It didn't matter whether you were a Republican or Democrat as \nlong as the streets got cleaned and the potholes got filled, and they \ndidn't have any labels on them. That is pretty much the way foreign \npolicies ought to be.\n  It used to be under Arthur Vandenberg that we said that politics ends \nat the water's edge, and we do what is in the best interests of our \ncountry. Only in the last years in the Senate have I seen a complete \ndiversion from that where, unfortunately--as has been true on both \nsides--politics has entered into choices people have made with respect \nto major issues of conflict, potential war and peace, and interests of \nthe security of our country.\n  So about 4 years ago this time, Dick Lugar received the Paul Douglas \nAward just off the Senate floor over in the Mansfield Room, and he \nsummed up his approach to the Senate. I think after last night it is \nimportant for all of our colleagues to be mindful of his words and to \nthink about them as we go forward in these next 6, 7, 8 months.\n  Dick argued that bipartisanship isn't an end to itself, and it is \nsometimes mistaken for centrism and compromise when, in fact, it is the \nway he called being a constructive public servant. It is the way a \nconstructive public servant approaches his or her job--with self-\nreflection, discipline, and faith in the goodwill of others.\n  He said:\n\n       Particularly destructive is the misperception in some \n     quarters that governing with one vote more than 50 percent is \n     just as good or better than government with 60 or 70 percent \n     support. The problem with this thinking is that whatever is \n     won today through division is usually lost tomorrow. The \n     relationships that are destroyed and the ill will that is \n     created make subsequent achievements that much more \n     difficult. A 51 percent mentality deepens cynicisms, sharpens \n     political vendettas, and depletes the national reserve of \n     good will that is critical to our survival in hard times.\n\n  That is actually about as fundamentally, philosophically, as \nconservative as one could ask for. I think every one of us who have \nseen the difficulty of the last few years of our politics, who have \nbeen frustrated by the sheer inability of the institution to work, \nwould agree there is nothing liberal or conservative or moderate about \nwhat Dick said. It is just common sense about how human nature works, \nabout how people work. It seems to me we would do well to get back in \ntouch.\n  I often hear people talk about how we need to change the rules here \nin order to get something done. Actually, we don't. These are the same \nrules we operated with when Everett Dirksen was here, when Bob Dole was \nleader, George Mitchell was leader. But we got things done.\n  In the 1990s, we balanced the budget of our Nation four times in a \nrow without a constitutional amendment. It didn't take a piece of paper \nto tell us to do it or new words written in the Constitution. It took \nthe common sense and courage of people on the floor of the Senate to do \nwhat was right. We don't have to change the rules. We have to change \nthe thinking--or change the people who don't want to do it.\n\n  But every great moment in this great institution, when people look \nback at the history with pride and point to the Missouri Compromise or \npoint to Henry Clay or Daniel Webster or all these great Senators--or \nTed Kennedy more recently and others on the other side of the aisle--\nwhen they do that, they are talking about people who operated by the \nsame rules but found the common ground because they had the \nintelligence and willpower to put the country and its interests ahead \nof everything else.\n  So that is what Dick Lugar's loss last night means to us. I don't \nknow who will replace him. We certainly know the cross-currents of some \nof the campaign, and we certainly know what Senator Lugar himself chose \nto say last night about his opponent's quest for more partisanship, not \nless.\n  So the alarm bells have been sounded. My prayer is that this election \nyear is going to help purge this country of this incredible waste of \nopportunity that we are living through.\n  This Congress isn't over. For those of us who were here and remember \n1996, it bears repeating that even in Presidential years the Congress \ncan actually defy conventional wisdom and get some things done. That is \nwhy I know that Dick Lugar is going to finish out his\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\nsixth term in the Senate with the same determination and effectiveness \nthat has marked every year of his service. He is going to have a lot \nmore contributions to this institution that he reveres and that \nrespects him so enormously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague and friend, \nSenator Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for \ncoming to the Senate floor and speaking about our mutual friend and \ncolleague, Senator Dick Lugar, who serves as the ranking Republican on \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I am a newcomer to that committee, but I am not a newcomer to my \nknowledge of Dick Lugar--who preceded my arrival in the Senate 16 years \nago when he was well known throughout the Midwest for his extraordinary \nservice as mayor of Indianapolis, where he did something that was \nmiraculous--he combined and made more efficient local units of \ngovernment, and I think the rebirth of Indianapolis is attributed to \nthose early steps by Dick Lugar.\n  My wife Loretta and I came to know Dick and Char personally through \nthe Aspen Institute, which is an effort that I think we need to \nencourage where members of both political parties, House and Senate, \ncome together to discuss foreign policy issues--no lobbyists, no \nspecial interests. Dick Lugar was there and always a major contributor \nwhen it came to issues of importance.\n  Before I arrived in the Senate--while Senator Kerry was still here--\nhe teamed up with Senator Sam Nunn to deal with an issue which related \nliterally to the peace and security of the world.\n  What would happen, as the Soviet Union crumbled, to all of those \nnuclear weapons? Would they fall into the wrong hands? Would they fall \ninto disrepair? And what could we do about it? Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar \nstepped up and said: We are going to work together on a bipartisan \nbasis to deal with them.\n  Time and time again throughout his career Dick Lugar has focused on \nissues of strategic importance to the United States and our security. I \ncan't agree with Senator Kerry more. He looked for a bipartisan \napproach to so many things. We always knew he was a Hoosier \nconservative. You weren't going to push over anything when it came to \nDick Lugar. He was strong in his values, but he always listened and he \nwas always a gentleman.\n  What a disappointment last night. I know Senator Kerry feels, as I \ndo, that once you have been in this Chamber for a few years, you kind \nof reflect on those lions of the Senate who have come and gone, some \nbecause of the decision of the electorate and some because of passage \nof time and then fateful decisions that ended up with their departure. \nWe think back on some of these great people.\n  John Chafee. John Chafee and Dick Lugar were soulmates in terms of \ntheir view on the Republican side of the aisle about how to work across \nthe aisle to get things done.\n  A mutual friend--and I know Senator Kerry's close personal friend--\nSenator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy's success has always reached across \nthe aisle. I noticed that. Sometimes to the frustration of those on the \nDemocratic side who said: We have enough votes, Ted. We don't have to \ndo this. He would reach across.\n  Of Bob Byrd, who used to sit right next to where Senator Kerry is \nsitting now, we think: What will the Senate be like without these great \nlions? Well, the Senate will go on. But the question is, Will we have \nlearned from their example? Will we take their lives and their careers \nto build on to make this a better place or, as some have said, are we \ngoing to succumb to the temptation of just making this place more \npartisan, more hidebound, more dedicated to obstruction than moving \nforward?\n  I know that Dick Lugar in the remaining months is going to be an \nextraordinary servant to the people of Indiana and the Nation as he has \nbeen throughout his career, and I look forward to seeing him back on \nthe Senate floor working, as he will, for the remainder of his term. \nBut it is a loss. It is a loss to the Senate that he is leaving, and it \nis a sad day on both sides of the aisle when Dick Lugar won't be part \nof the Senate in person.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Senator Mark Kirk\n\n  I would like to speak about another Republican Senator while I have \nthe floor: my colleague, Mark Kirk. Some of you have seen the video.\n  Mark had a stroke in January. He wrote about it in this morning's \nChicago Tribune. He is 52 years of age, the picture of health, a Navy \nReserve officer and a U.S. Senator from Illinois, actively engaged in \nour State, going back and forth, county to county, city to city. We \nwork together on so many things. Then on that fateful day he was \nstricken, and with this stroke he suffered some very serious damage.\n  I was a little bit disturbed when his physician/surgeon came out and \nsaid, ``Well, here is what we can expect.'' And I am not going to go \nthrough the graphic details, but they were all sobering to think that \nhe would be limited in any way by the stroke. I was upset because I \nthought: He doesn't know Mark Kirk. That isn't going to happen. Mark is \ngoing to fight back. He is going to be back, and he is going to defy \nthe odds in terms of stroke victims.\n  Yesterday he released a video. It is inspiring. I hope everyone gets \na chance to see it--I am sure it is readily available--showing him \ngoing through rehab, showing the efforts he is making to come back to \nthe Senate. Mark called me earlier this week. We talked on the phone a \ncouple of times since the stroke. He has been actively engaged mentally \nin everything we have done since the stroke occurred. But every day he \ntells me that he spends time on a treadmill, miles and miles walking on \na treadmill so he will be able to come back. I told him we are on a \ndifferent treadmill here and I am sure he wants to get back on it with \nus in the Senate.\n  He will be back. He said something I think we all ought to remember. \nHe said he asked the staff to count the steps from where he would park \noutside the Senate Chamber up to the Senate Chamber. They counted the \nsteps and they told him 45 steps and he would be back in the Senate. He \nsaid the day is going to come, and I am sure it will be soon, when he \nwill walk those steps, and there will be many, myself included, from \nboth sides of the aisle, cheering his return to the Senate. For Mark, \nhis family, his doctors, his medical staff, and all: Thank you for this \nbattle. Thank you for your efforts on behalf of our State. We look \nforward to your early return.\n  Mark and I have a joint town meeting, Republican and Democratic, \nevery Thursday morning. The people sit there politely as we discuss \nissues and love it when we disagree because we do it without getting \nangry with one another. He will be back soon, not only at those \nmeetings but also covering the State of Illinois as an effective, \nengaged Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time from 2 p.m. \nuntil 5 p.m. be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders \nor their designees, and that all quorum calls in that period also be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to urge my colleagues to \nallow us to move forward in the consideration of the Stop the Student \nLoan Interest Rate Hike Act so we can allow the interest rate on \nstudent loans to remain at its current level rather than doubling, \nwhich will happen on July 1, unless we take action. I come to the floor \nto express the views of many Marylanders with whom I have talked about \nthe cost of higher education. We cannot allow the interest costs to go \nup. It will affect 7 million students and their families.\n  We already have too much college debt that families have to incur as \na result of the cost of a college education. We are not competitive \nwith the rest of the world. We look at countries with whom we compete \nand we look at the cost of higher education in their country compared \nwith what our students have to endure, and we start off behind because \nof the enormous cost to a family to afford a college education for \ntheir children.\n  We know how important it is. You need to have a college degree in \norder\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\nto be competitive in many fields today. That number of fields is \nincreasing every day. Let me tell you, we have crossed the $1 trillion \nmark in debt held by families in order to afford a college education. \nTwo-thirds of that debt is held by people who are under 30 years of \nage. Here they are, trying to start out in life, trying to have a \nfamily, trying to buy a home, and they have this large amount of debt.\n  College debt now exceeds credit card debt in America. It is not \nunusual for a person graduating from a college to have $20,000, \n$30,000, $40,000, $50,000, $100,000 in debt, and even higher. If we do \nnot act by July 1, the interest costs will add thousands of dollars to \nthat already burdensome amount.\n  The cost of a college education in America is too expensive. If we \nwant to be competitive, we have to get the cost of a college education \ndown. The President in his State of the Union Address talked about ways \nin which we can encourage colleges and universities to be more \naffordable for the American public. But one thing we can do is to make \nsure that the cost of borrowing is not increased. That is why it is \nparticularly important that we pass this legislation.\n  It is affecting family decisions as to what schools children will \nattend because of the high cost. We are just turning our economy \naround, starting to make our recovery, and now families are struggling \nto figure out how they are going to be able to afford a college \neducation. We need to reduce the costs, not increase the costs, to \nfamilies. We need a trained workforce. We need to be competitive \ninternationally.\n  Let me tell you what else it is affecting. We have some very talented \npeople who are graduating from college and they want to go into the \nfield where they are gifted, where they can make a real contribution to \nour communities, to our society, to make a difference, to answer that \ncall of community service. That is what they want to do. But when they \nare saddled with this much debt and if it becomes more expensive to pay \noff that debt, they have to make a pragmatic decision about their \ncareer path rather than following where they can make the greatest \ncontribution to society. That is how these large debts and the cost of \npaying off that debt are affecting our country.\n  You might have a great researcher who can find the answer to one of \nour diseases, how we can keep a healthier society, a person who may \nwant to go into research, but they know what the return of research \nwill be when trying to pay off their college loans. If we do not act by \nJuly 1, that will be even larger. That is what we are confronted with. \nThat is why it is so urgent, that is why we need to be considering this \nlegislation rather than be stuck in this filibuster.\n  I urge my colleague to move forward. Let's do what the Senate should \ndo--consider amendments and get this process going. It is absolutely \ncritical to our entire country.\n  Let me talk a little bit about my experiences with Marylanders. I \nhave traveled the State of Maryland. I have talked to a lot of our \ncollege students. I will generally talk about a lot of different \nsubjects and then ask what is on their mind. They will talk about the \ncost of college education. They will talk about the fact that we need \nmore grants. They talk about the fact that we need more affordable \nloans. They certainly will tell me if you are going to increase the \ninterest costs on their loans, it is going to have a major impact on \ntheir ability to stay in college, on their ability to follow the career \nchoices that they want to in life.\n  Let me share with my colleagues the stories of two Marylanders who \nhave contacted my office, who have contacted me in the last few days to \ntell me that this bill we are hopefully going to be able to consider \nwill have a direct impact on their decisions.\n  Katherine Eames is a 22-year-old single mother, with a 4-year-old son \nJayden. Katherine has decided to go back to college to pursue her \nnursing degree and currently attends Hagerstown Community College in \nHagerstown, MD. She is attempting to make a better future for herself \nand for her son. She is attempting--she is going to be a full-time \nstudent. Katherine also works part time at a minimum wage job, all \nwhile juggling her responsibilities as a single mother. Student loans \nare necessary. She needs to take out student loans. That is the only \nway she is able to afford her college. She has student loans in order \nto be able to stay afloat and realize her dream of making a better \nfuture for herself and her son. If student loan interest rates were to \ndouble, Katherine would be in a financial turmoil and her future \naspirations in jeopardy. Let me quote from Katherine. This is what she \nsays. I think it is so telling.\n\n       I want to be able to close my eyes and see a bright future \n     for my family and my son. However, if these interest rates \n     increase, all I see from this point forward is a hole I don't \n     think I'll ever be able to climb out of.\n\n  I know some of my colleagues say we are talking about another 3-\npercent interest charge, people will be able to afford it. But let me \ntell you about the real world, the world of Katherine Eames. That is \nthe real world. That is people making career decisions now as to \nwhether they are going to follow their dream; whether she will become a \nnurse, be able to help her community, help her family, help herself. If \nwe do not make college affordable or if we add additional costs to it, \nwe are going to add more people to this process. As a society, \nAmerica's competitiveness will suffer as a result. We need to do \nbetter. We need to pass this legislation to help the Katherine Eameses \nwho are out there.\n  Let me talk about another Marylander, Ariana Fisher. She wanted to be \na doctor since she was 5 years of age. Through hard work and \ndetermination, she has been accepted to Georgetown University's medical \nschool. Attending will require her to take out a significant amount in \nstudent loans. That is the fact for most American families, their \nchildren will have to take out loans if they are going to be able to \nreach their dreams. She knows how much these are going to cost, but she \nsays compounding this with increased interest rates hinders her ability \nto pursue her dream. She has the will and the passion to become an \nexcellent physician and her aspirations should not rest on what we do \nhere in making it more economically difficult for her to be able to \nafford that education. That will not only benefit her but will benefit \nour community.\n  We are talking about our children. We are talking about whether our \nchildren are going to be able to pursue the American dream, whether \nthey are going to have the education they need to help themselves and \nhelp our country. We are talking about America's future. This is about \nwhether this Nation is going to be able to continue to lead the world \nin economic growth. We need to take up the Stop The Student Loan Rate \nHike Act.\n  Let me explain. It is subject to a filibuster. Yes, it is a \nfilibuster. We tried to say let's at least get on the bill, which \nrequired 60 votes in order to be able to break this filibuster. We came \nup short. I hope the majority leader will schedule another vote shortly \nand I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will remember what \nthis means for the future of this country.\n  The stories I related with regard to Katherine Eames or Ariana Fisher \nare not unique. I am certain you would find similar examples in New \nMexico or any other State in this country. You are going to find \nsimilar examples of people who desperately need us to act so college \ncosts do not increase. Then let's work together to bring down the costs \nof college education. College and postsecondary education are a vital \ngateway to helping American students around the country to achieve the \nAmerican dream.\n  We need to stand for our Nation's future. We cannot allow higher \neducation to become unaffordable for millions of Americans who have the \ndesire and ability to learn and succeed. Let's end the filibuster. \nLet's work together as Democrats and Republicans. Let's keep America's \nfuture in mind, let's keep the American dream in mind, let's allow \nAmericans to reach that dream by making college education affordable. \nLet's pass the legislation that is currently pending that would stop \nthe increase in the interest rates on college loans.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we arrive here at a moment when we \nonce again have a chance to view the differences in thought and \nperspective which are exhibited at this moment in this institution. \nToday, we are talking about college education. We are talking about \nprograms for young people to get an education and go to college.\n  For generations, affordable college education has been an essential \ntool for providing opportunity and building a strong society.\n  I know from personal experience that government plays a critical role \nin making higher education possible. I served in World War II, and when \nI joined the Army there was no prospect for me to go to college. I was \n18 when I enlisted. When I finished my Army service--having been in \nEurope during the war--things looked bleak, but there was an \nopportunity that loomed in front of me, and that was an ability to \nattend college.\n  My family was faced with poverty and there wasn't much money in the \nfamily, but there was something called the GI bill. The GI bill gave me \na chance to achieve a dream.\n  I joined with a couple friends to form a company. The company was \ncalled ADP. The company that produces the labor statistics every month \nthat this country and the whole world sees. When I was able to start \nthis company with two other fellows, none of us had any money. The two \nof them were brothers, and we didn't have any resources at all. We had \nto start from nothing. In the days that we had a chance to get going, \nthe future was brightened a little bit by the fact that an education \nwas possible to have. That company we started with nothing today \nemploys more than 50,000 people around the world.\n  The country invested in my generation by helping us pay for college, \nand that investment helped create decades of prosperity. As a matter of \nfact, that generation--post-World War II--was called the greatest \ngeneration ever seen in American history. Out of 16 million people who \nserved in the Army, 8 million people got a college education through \nthe GI bill, and thus this generation that came out started us on a \ntrack for prosperity this country had never seen. The investment the GI \nbill made in people says that when we have a chance to educate people \nand get them to go to college or to attend a university, that is the \nway we create the next great generation.\n  Attending college has never before been this expensive. The cost of \ntuition at public universities is 37 percent more expensive now than \njust 10 years ago. Think about that. If the average cost for a college \n10 years ago was $40,000, it now costs well over $50,000. As a result, \nmore and more students are taking on massive loans that will plague \nthem for years. I use the word ``plague'' because it is very difficult \nto get started in life, in business or start a family and be facing \nheavy debt at the same time.\n  Sixty-six percent of New Jersey students graduate with loan \nindebtedness. The average loan burden for New Jersey graduates is more \nthan $23,000. No wonder we hear that technology companies are hungry to \nhire but can't always find people with the education and skills they \nneed. The pricetag alone puts college out of reach for too many people\n  And the clock is ticking on even higher college costs. Unless \nCongress acts, interest rates on many student loans are going to double \non July 1--less than 2 months from today. For many students, doubling \nrates will cost them $1,000 more for each year of college.\n  But instead of standing with students, our friends on the Republican \nside are playing politics. They made it clear that keeping student loan \nrates low is not a priority. They don't see it as something being \nworthwhile. Two Republican Senators have introduced budget proposals \nthat would allow student loan interest rates to double.\n  Yesterday, we saw 44 Senate Republicans vote to prevent the Senate \nfrom even considering our bill to keep student loan rates low. How \nheartless. How thoughtless it is to punish our country this way. \nCollege is already too expensive. Why would we put up obstacles to \ngetting an education?\n  Republicans should listen to people who are suffering from the high \ncost of college. There have been 1,400 people who have written to me \nthrough mail or Facebook to say: Don't let them do it. Don't let them \ndouble my rates.\n  A single mother from New Jersey who is helping her daughter pay for \ncollege wrote to say that any increase would create enormous hardship \nand an inability to continue to provide for the family. Another New \nJerseyan says America will not be able to compete with the rest of the \nworld if college is accessible only to those who have the ability to \npay for it up front, and I agree. We will not be able to compete if we \ndon't have the educated people necessary to fill the jobs that are \navailable.\n  Our Republican friends say they want to prevent the doubling of \ninterest rates. So why don't they step up to the plate? I don't \nunderstand that. They say one thing on one hand: Oh, yes; we don't want \nto increase the rates. On the other hand, they say we are not going to \nhelp keep them at the lower rate they are now. They say in order to pay \nfor keeping rates low for students, we have to cut vital funding for \nprograms that keep people healthy. Their bill would slash funding for \nprevention and public health funds, programs dedicated to stop \ndevastating diseases before they occur. Chronic diseases, such as \ncancer, heart disease, and diabetes, take more than 1 million lives \nevery year and account for 75 percent of our Nation's health spending. \nThat is why the Prevention and Public Health Fund has invested $226 \nmillion to reduce chronic illnesses.\n\n  The President's budget also calls for using this program to protect \nwomen's health by providing breast and cervical cancer screenings to \nlow-income women, but it won't happen if Republicans get their way.\n  The Republican bill would also cripple programs that keep kids from \nsmoking and help smokers to quit. We have all seen the ads--real people \ntelling real stories about how tobacco has affected their lives. This \nchart tells the story: ``Don't be shy about telling people not to smoke \naround your kids.'' We see a picture here of a mother and a child. \nRepublicans don't care about educating people on the dangers of \nsmoking? Who are they protecting here? Certainly not our children and \ncertainly not our students.\n  It is unconscionable. Republicans profess they want to keep loan \nrates low but only if we sacrifice programs that protect children from \nsmoking addiction and help women avoid breast cancer and other deadly \ndiseases.\n  The Democrats have a better solution. The bill Majority Leader Reid \nhas introduced pays for keeping student loan rates low by eliminating a \ntax convenience that millionaires and billionaires use to avoid payroll \ntaxes. Rather than choose to close this loophole, the Republicans \nchoose to take this opportunity to talk our bill to death. They would \nrather see interest rates double for students than force the wealthy to \npay their fair share of the country's obligation.\n  Student loans open the door to opportunities. Interest rates have to \nbe kept low to protect graduates from a mountain of debt.\n  I call on my professional experience again, if I might. I finished \ncollege. My father passed away while he was in the Army. He was only 43 \nyears old. He left my mother a 37-year-old widow to care for herself \nand my sister. As luck had it, I got an education at Columbia \nUniversity, at the business school there. I started a company I \nmentioned before called ADP. It provides services across the world for \nthose companies that need help in doing their payroll, accounting, and \nother recordkeeping that companies must do. It only happened because we \nwere able to get our education through the GI bill. There was zero cost \nto those of us who served in World War II and even some money to pay \nfor books and for other necessities.\n  So I call on my Republican colleagues to stop the obstructionism, \nstop the politicking, and stop throwing obstacles in the way of young \npeople who want to get an education and make a contribution to this \nsociety as well as to themselves and elevate America's ability to deal \nwith the competition we see in the world. It is time to do that.\n\n[[Page S3014]]\n\n  I am not suggesting that our Republican colleagues don't want \nprogress. They do. But when we try to move a bill that says: Keep \ninterest rates low on college loans, keep the rate low so that when \npeople get out of college they are not so burdened by debt that they \ncan't get started in life, I say keep them low so that America competes \nas it should--right at the top of the ladder with educated people, \npeople who want to succeed but don't have the tools necessarily until \nthey finish their college education. Why put obstacles in the way? It \nis incomprehensible because there are a lot of good people on the other \nside. But why do they persist in obstructing the opportunity to even \ndiscuss it? They want to filibuster it to death. Filibuster, for those \nwho don't know the term, means talk, talk, talk, talk, talk--do \nanything but make progress.\n  So I hope we will say to those who have been successful: Do your fair \nshare. Let your contribution to the well-being of our country educate \nthose who can learn and not make it so expensive, so out of reach that \nfew will be able to take advantage of it.\n  I ask to please move this bill along. Let's let the American people \nat least know what we think about this legislation to keep interest \nrates low.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that \nimmediately following my remarks, Senator Udall of New Mexico be \nrecognized to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have been listening to these speeches for \nthe last couple of days--3 days, actually. If one listens to the other \nside of the aisle, one would think Republicans are against college \neducation. I don't think there is a person in America who believes \nthat. One would also believe we want to raise the interest rates from \n3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. There shouldn't be anybody in America who \nbelieves that either. We really think that for 1 year the rates on \nsubsidized Stafford loans ought to stay at the 3.4 percent, and maybe \nbeyond that.\n  The real issue isn't the interest rate, and we can tell that from the \nspeeches that have been given. The real issue is the cost of college. \nAre we doing anything about the cost of college? No. Does Congress have \nanything to do besides debate this particular issue? Evidently not. We \nare being called a do-nothing Congress, but evidently we don't have \nanything else to do. It could be possible to go to something else, but \ninstead we have had one vote on this, and we still weren't given an \noption for this side of the aisle to have a vote on our idea. So now we \nare going to get to vote on that same issue from Tuesday once again--\nmaybe sometime this week or maybe not until next week. Instead, we are \ngoing to stay right on this issue so that if we stay at exactly this \npoint in this issue, it will fail again and then that side can say: Oh, \nthose Republicans just want to raise interest rates. Not true.\n  I hope the American people have noticed that any bill that goes \ndirectly from the President to Harry Reid to the floor doesn't pass. A \nbill that goes to committee, regardless of where the source is, has a \nchance of a bipartisan solution.\n  I am the ranking member on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, and we have a user fee bill that passed nearly unanimously \nout of committee. We have the support of the stakeholders. We have the \nsupport of the companies. We have the support of Senate Republicans and \nDemocrats. We have even talked to the House people about it. It is a \nbill that ought to make it through here pretty quickly, and I suspect \nit will. When it does, I bet we don't hear any comment about it because \nthat would make us look like a do-something Congress, which is what we \nought to be.\n\n  My colleagues can't tell me this is the only issue that needs \nattention. Yet we are going to spend a whole week on this issue when \nboth sides agree it ought to be at 3.4 percent. What we are disagreeing \non is how we will pay for it. I have to tell my colleagues that the \nreal answer isn't either side's answer, but it could be worked out if \nit went to committee.\n  I was told this was going to be a bipartisan, jointly discussed issue \njust before we left for the recess. Then this bill was put forward, and \nno further conversation was allowed on it. Our committee was left out \nof it. And we bring it to the floor, and they said we will have a fair \nand open debate. Yes, look at this--there are two of us on the floor, \nand he is waiting to speak and he is not listening to what I am saying, \nand there isn't anybody else listening to what I am saying. Well, they \nmight be back watching the television and picking it up there, and I \ncertainly hope they are.\n  Where we get the real discussion is in the committees. Small groups \nof people who are intensely interested in the issues come to those \ncommittees and we work it out. Senator Harkin and I will get amendments \na couple of days before the bill is to be marked up in committee to \nfind out what everybody's ideas are for how it ought to be changed, and \nwe sit down and we look through those and we say: Well, look at this \npile here. They are all pretty much the same amendment, but there are \npeople from both sides of the aisle who are interested in it, so why \ndon't we just get those four people or those two people or those five \npeople together and see if they can't work something out. It is really \nsurprising because they usually can come up with a few changed words \nthat solve the problem in which they are interested. That is the way we \nget things done. That is not the way we are operating on the floor.\n  I am on the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee is supposed to \nbe handling taxes. Let's see. How many markups have we had this year? I \ndon't think we have had a single markup. We have not looked at a \nspecific bill and tried to come up with a solution in committee. \nNothing has been assigned to that committee to finish.\n  Do we think we have any tax problems in this country? I think so. We \nkeep talking about tax reform, but we are not doing anything on tax \nreform. Instead, we are talking about the interest rate on college \nstudent loans. It is extremely important to the 40 percent of the \nstudents who have a subsidized loan who are going to be protected by \nthis. It is extremely important to them. We keep talking about college \nand the cost of college, but are we doing anything about the cost of \ncollege? No, we are not. That should be disappointing to America. We \nought to be covering the big issues.\n  Our committee did a bunch of hearings, and I asked for those hearings \nto be on the cost of all college education. Instead, what we did was \nbeat up on private for-profit colleges. We did hearing after hearing \nafter hearing, and some of those were a little suspect because I know \nat least one of the witnesses called in to testify fell short in the \nmarket and was able to run down the colleges and thus make a lot of \nmoney off of his testimony. That is not how it is supposed to work. We \ncould have looked at all college costs and found some ways to drive \ndown the price of college, but we didn't do that. So now we are \nstanding here and saying: Those darned Republicans aren't interested in \nthe cost of college. How wrong can you be?\n  We started this debate on Monday, we voted on it on Tuesday, and then \nwe decided we would reconsider the vote. That means the pollsters said \nthat this is a pretty good issue for that side of the aisle, and if \nthey can drag it out longer, they can do better. That is not what \nCongress is about. Congress is about solving problems.\n  There are two sides to this, and in the debate earlier, I said that \nif we would just allow a side-by-side so that you get a vote and we get \na vote, we could get something done and move on. The Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Harkin, said: I would let us do a side-by-side.\n\n  The next thing I know, the media is saying: You were offered a side-\nby-side but you did not take it. Not true. We were offered an \nopportunity maybe to put a substitute amendment in at a future time--\nmaybe. That is not the same. That is not the same as getting the same \nkind of a vote on the same kind of an issue. And that is always what \nhas been done. We have always allowed side-by-sides. But not on this \none. We would rather have the debate going on and try and convince \nAmerica that both sides of the aisle are doing the wrong thing.\n  Not only are we giving the impression that we are a do-nothing \nCongress,\n\n[[Page S3015]]\n\nwe are giving them the impression there is nothing for us to do. Let's \nsee. We did not do a budget and we have not done any appropriations \nbills yet, and there are 12 appropriations bills that have to pass this \nbody, and it takes at least a week for each appropriations bill. We \nhave the authorization bill for defense which we debate each and every \nyear, and about 100 other issues that need to come up here. But \ninstead, we are not voting this week, except the earlier vote on this \nparticular bill and another reconsideration vote. If you keep doing the \nsame thing, you ought to expect the same kind of results.\n  One of the reasons we are voting against the bill that is on the \nfloor is it has not been to committee so it has a lot of flaws in it. \nThis is a poorly drafted bill. Here is kind of how it works: We have \nsaid that dentists and doctors and other professionals who are in small \ncorporations--we are picking on small business here--are cheating on \ntheir taxes. They are not paying a payroll tax on their dividends.\n  There is a law against that, and the IRS can enforce that law, and \ndoes enforce that law. The examples that have been given are times that \nthey actually caught people doing that and enforced it and won. But to \ndo an audit on this, it would probably take a maximum of 30 minutes of \ncomputer time to find every small business corporation that might be \ncheating on their payroll taxes. But instead of doing that, we are \ngoing to use it as a pay-for, and we are saying it is only doctors and \ndentists and lawyers and accountants and other professionals who are \ndoing this.\n  Well, there are a whole bunch of people who have small business \ncorporations. Small business corporations are an important way to \nfinance small businesses, and it is a little less complicated than the \nbig corporations. But we usually do not pick on them specifically, and \nwe usually do not separate them into separate groups. This one is just \nthe professionals. It does not cover the rest of them.\n  I asked the question earlier. I said: Does that mean you are saving \nthe others for a pay-for for something else? If there is a problem, we \nought to solve the problem. But the problem can easily be solved by the \nIRS by doing the proper job of auditing, if that is the case. But these \nsmall business corporations are declaring that a lot of their profit is \na dividend.\n  Here is an interesting part: We are not talking about the income tax \nthey pay on that. They are having to pay the income tax. Unlike a big \ncorporation, they are paying the income tax on their personal tax form \nthe minute it is earned, not when it gets actually distributed.\n  Most of the small businesspeople have to pay the tax on it but leave \nit in the business so they can grow their business. I have been there. \nI have had a small business corporation. I know, while you would like \nto take the money out, if you want your business to succeed, you have \nto keep reinvesting and reinventing. That means you do not get to take \nthe money out.\n  If we were being fair, we would say anybody who makes over $250,000 \nin dividends a year would include that as payroll tax. In other words, \nthis is another Warren Buffett thing. How many millions do you think he \nmakes in a year that come into him as dividends? If those did not count \nas dividends, he would have to pay a Medicare percentage tax on every \ndime of that. That is what we are talking about here with the \nprofessionals whom we are going to discriminate against in a bit. We \nare saying that anything that counts as a dividend for them, they are \ngoing to have to pay the Medicare tax on. Why just pick on the \nprofessionals? Why not pick on all small businesses?\n  Of course, small business is the job creator for the country, so we \nshould not be picking on any of them. We should be making sure they are \npaying the taxes they owe, but that is not what we are doing. And we \nare saying Warren Buffett is a special case out there, even though we \nlike to talk about a Warren Buffett tax every once in a while, but we \nare not going to in this case.\n  What we are talking about is the tax that would be for Social \nSecurity and Medicare. If they are not paying that, they ought to be \npaying it. But we are saying that is a good pay-for.\n  How many times do you think we can take the money that is supposed to \ngo to Social Security and Medicare and spend it on something else and \nhope Social Security and Medicare continue to exist? That is what we \nare doing here. We are saying we are going to take the money from the \ndoctors and the dentists and other professionals and we are going to \nmake them pay a Social Security and Medicare tax, but we are not going \nto put that into Medicare, we are not going to put that into Social \nSecurity. Instead, we are going to give it to college students so they \nhave a reduction in their loan.\n  It is kind of interesting. The Department of Education borrows their \nmoney at 2.8 percent, maximum, and they are loaning it out to college \nstudents at 3.4 percent for subsidized student loans and 6.8 percent \nfor unsubsidized student loans. The law says that on July 1 it is \nsupposed to go to 6.8 percent for both subsidized and unsubsidized \nstudent loans. Where do you think that profit goes? Well, we already \nspend that on other projects. That is why it needs to go to 6.8 \npercent, so we can pay for what we promised we would pay for. But if we \nfreeze the interest rate on subsidized loans at 3.4 percent for one-\nyear, we still have to pay for the other things. So what we are going \nto do is, we are going to take money that ought to go to Medicare, and \nwe are going to give it to college students. So it is a dilemma.\n  We want to make sure the rate stays at 3.4 percent. But this body, \ndebating back and forth, without getting any votes, is not going to \nresolve it. Even if we got to do an amendment or two--that is a big \ndeal around here: to get to do an amendment or two on the floor--we \nstill would not be able to resolve it because we would not have gotten \nthe people from here and the people from there together in a small \ngroup to work out a solution. That is what the leader ought to be \ndoing. That is why you send things to committee. But we are not doing \nthat.\n\n  The other side has assured me that even though we are not putting \nthis money into the Medicare trust fund, that the Medicare trust fund \nwill still have all of its money. Let me tell you how that works. As an \naccountant in the Senate--and there are only two of us now. For 15 \nyears, I was the only one. But there are two of us now. Here is how it \nworks: When the money comes in, a bond is put in the Medicare drawer \nthat says the Federal Government owes Medicare that amount of money. \nBut we go ahead and spend the money.\n  They say: Well, this trust fund is still intact. No. It only has debt \nin it. It does not have money in it. I discovered that trying to get \nsome money out of a trust fund once. They said: Well, you cannot get it \nout unless you put money in. What kind of bank account is that? What \nkind of a trust fund is that? That is what Social Security and Medicare \nare. They are a bunch of bonds in a drawer that the Federal Government \nsays we are good for. The way we are spending, we may not be able to be \ngood for that. People ought to be concerned about that.\n  So that is where we are. We are talking about taking the Medicare \nmoney and the Social Security money, putting bonds in a drawer, using \nthe money, and saying all is well in the world and everything is paid \nfor.\n  Our side has said, there is a health care slush fund and there are \nnot any criteria set up on it. There are some broad categories it can \nbe spent on, but there are no real criteria on it, and it has more than \nenough money to pay for this. The only person who gets to decide how \nthat money is given out is the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nand she has a lot of flexibility on that. There is a lot of money \ncoming in--maybe at least $2 billion every year allocated to that, and \nthere is already money in that fund, as it started with more. I think \nthe estimate was actually $80 billion over the life of the health care \nbill. The President himself has helped himself to that when we did the \npayroll tax holiday extension. That is where the money came from for \nthat.\n  So our side has said: Why don't we use that again? That is supposedly \nreal money. But one thing that both sides are doing--they are saying: \nOK, we are going to freeze the interest rate for 1 year, but we are \ncounting revenue that is supposed to come in for 10 years.\n  How many people in America can say: I am going to have this salary, \nand I might have it for 10 years, but I need\n\n[[Page S3016]]\n\nto spend it all this year. If I spend it all this year, how do I live \nthe other 9 years of the time? That is what we are faced with every \ntime we do a 10-year receipt of money in exchange for a 1-year spending \nproject. And we are doing that more and more and more.\n  But, again, under our accounting system, that does not go down as the \nsame kind of liability and debt situation that increases the debt \nceiling or increases the debt for the country. So it is a very clever \ntactic to use, but it is not honest with the American people.\n  Yes, I am upset we are spending all this time on this reconsideration \nof a vote that we had. When you do not make any changes, you can expect \nthe vote to come out exactly the same. But it allows us days to \nharangue each other, and that is the wrong way to do it.\n  I have asked the leader to pull this bill down, send it to committee, \ngive them a limited amount of time to work on it, and see if they can \ncome up with a solution that both sides would like and one that does \nnot have a lot of loopholes in it.\n  Loopholes? Well, when we are talking about these small business \ncorporations for doctors and dentists, et cetera, we said: If they make \nmore than $250,000 a year and if the small business corporation has \nthree stockholders or less. I do not think they are cheating to the \ndegree that they say this money would come in. But if they are, I can \nsee the wheels turning out there and people saying: Let's see, I have \nthree people in my corporation. Oh, my son is not in the corporation \nyet, so we will make that a fourth one. When we get the fourth person \nin the corporation, we are exempted from this.\n  How much money do you think is going to come in through that \nproposal? That is what can be worked out if it goes to committee. So, I \nagain ask the leader to send it to a committee, give them a limited \namount of time to work on it, and see if they can come up with a \nsolution that both sides will like because both sides said the interest \nrate ought to be 3.4 percent for the next year.\n  Then we ought to take a look at the cost of all college education. As \nall the people have said, college is important. Education after high \nschool is important. We had one hearing on that in the HELP Committee \ntoo. When we were scheduled to have that hearing--I make a weekly trip \nout to Wyoming and travel around the State so I get to talk to a lot of \npeople--I happened to be talking to some sixth graders, and I said: We \nare going to have this hearing, and the title of it is: Is education \nafter high school important? Do you know what. Those kids all said yes. \nWe did not have to bring in some people from Harvard and Stanford to \nconvince us of that. We could have been talking about the cost of \ncollege, which would get more people going to college, and not just \ncollege but some of the tech schools too because we are going to need a \nlot of different professions in future years.\n  Let's get this thing to committee and get it resolved and get on with \nsome of the issues we need to be working on--some of the ones that are \nbig money that affect all of America, not just 40 percent of the \nstudents at about a cost of $7 a month.\n  So with that plea, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank you for the recognition, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Let me say, I have been sitting here listening to my colleague, the \nSenator from Wyoming, and I think he makes some good points. I think we \ndo need a more open process. I think we need to try as much as possible \nto work with each other in the committee process. I do not think there \nis any doubt about that. I think we need to allow germane amendments \nand have a good, robust debate on the bills that are on the floor.\n  But what I want to talk about today is the fact that we are in a \nfilibuster. Fifty-two of us wanted to move forward on this bill and 45 \nof us did not. That is why we are locked in this situation.\n  I rise with regret today, and there is much to regret about \nyesterday's vote on the student loan bill. First, I regret the false \nchoice between helping students or funding preventive health care. Most \nAmericans support student loans. Most Americans see the value of \npreventive health care. Yet my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle would ask that we sacrifice one for the other.\n  An affordable education should not be held hostage to cuts in \npreventive health care. That is not a choice; it is an ultimatum.\n  Have we come to this? We teach our children to set goals, to set \npriorities. It should surprise no one that they seriously question our \ngoals, our priorities. It is like a bus heading toward a cliff. We can \nturn it around, and we ought to be able to do so without throwing \nstudents underneath it.\n  The other side says they care about our Nation's students too. \nPerhaps, but there is caring, and then there is devotion. Once again, \ntheir devotion is for the wealthiest among us and not for the 7 million \nstudents who are worried about how they will pay for their education.\n  Back to choices. As any bright college student can tell us, it always \ncomes down to choices. How do we protect the Stafford Student Loan \nProgram? By further cuts to preventive health care? By weakening \nresearch to prevent disease? By cutting our response to public health \nemergencies? No, of course not. We do it by closing a tax loophole, by \nrequiring the wealthy to pay their fair share of payroll taxes.\n  I submit that this is not, and should not be, a tough choice, but \napparently it is. In fact, it is so tough that the other side doesn't \nwant to talk about it any further. The result? Yet another filibuster.\n  That brings me to my other regret. Once again, this Senate is broken, \nin limbo, stuck. Once again, the American people look on in dismay.\n  The Senate was once called the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld. Now it reminds me of that song, ``The Sound of Silence,'' ``and \nno one dared disturb the sound of silence.''\n  That is what we hear more and more--silence. No debate, no \ndiscussion. Yesterday's vote was the 21st filibuster by Republicans of \na Democratic bill this Congress--the 21st--and the year is young.\n  This ugly parade of filibusters--and for what? Let's see. To block \nthe President's job bill, to stop the repeal of tax breaks for big oil \ncompanies, to not help local governments pay for teachers and first \nresponders, to prevent a minimum tax on households earning more than $1 \nmillion a year, and now it is student loans--another filibuster, more \nsounds of silence.\n  I have previously joined my colleagues and friends, Senator Merkley \nof Oregon and Senator Harkin of Iowa, to push for fundamental reforms \nin how the Senate operates. The reason then and even more abundantly \nclear now is that the Senate was broken.\n  This is tragic. At a time when our country needs us to act, we do \nalmost nothing. It is no wonder that Congress's approval ratings are at \nan all-time low. Instead of working to solve the major problems our \ncountry faces, we retreat to the shadows.\n  In order to have real change in the process, the Senate has to change \nthe way we go about business. I have advocated, and will continue to do \nso, that the Senate, at the beginning of each Congress, should adopt \nits own rules by a simple majority vote. The Constitution clearly gives \nus this authority, and it is time to exercise it. Yet at the beginning \nof each Congress, the Senate, unlike the House of Representatives, \ndoesn't vote to adopt its rules. The Senate simply accepts the rules of \nthe previous Congress--rules that lead to the unfettered abuse of \nfilibusters, rules that have made the Senate a graveyard of good ideas.\n  When we fail to reform our rules, their abuse becomes an entrenched \npart of the Senate's culture. That is where we are today--after years \nof filibuster abuse, we have turned the Senate into a supermajoritarian \nbody. To do anything in today's Senate requires 60 votes.\n  Yesterday's vote on the student loan bill was a prime example. We \ncan't even get onto the bill. Fifty-two Senators voted to move forward, \nbut 45 Senators chose to filibuster. Once again, minority obstruction \nprevents majority rule. That is not democratic, and it is not how our \nFounders intended the Senate to operate.\n  This has to change. A new Congress will begin next January. Right \nnow, we\n\n[[Page S3017]]\n\ndon't know which party will control the House, the Senate, or the White \nHouse, but it should not matter. The Senate must reform itself \nregardless of which party has control, not for the good of the \nDemocrats or the Republicans but for the good of the country.\n  The Senate will have many new Members next January, and I think most \nof them will want to become part of a functioning legislative body, one \nwhere they can bring their best ideas and have them debated, a body \nwhere all views are heard and considered but majority rule is once \nagain the norm. That institution cannot exist under the existing rules, \nand we continue to prove that on a daily basis.\n  The reforms Senators Harkin, Merkley, and I proposed at the beginning \nof this Congress had strong support, but it did not pass. So here we \nare, 21 filibusters later, and the line of Americans who wait for a \nCongress that works, that actually gets things done, and that comes \ntogether to find solutions--that line just got longer by about 7 \nmillion students.\n  Several of my constituents have watched and have seen this filibuster \nproceed, and they have written me on my Facebook page. I thought I \nwould share a couple of those comments because they really go to the \nheart of what is happening on student loans.\n  Tracy Edwards writes me, saying that student loans are vital. She \nsays:\n\n       My daughter graduates this Saturday from UNM. Without \n     student loans, this day would not have come.\n\n  Her daughter would not have graduated.\n\n       In 6 months, we will start repayment of those loans. I am \n     not asking anyone else to pay my daughter's loan, but why \n     should we be punished with an increase for trying to ensure \n     our children get a solid education? If a bankruptcy is filed, \n     you could lose your home, your car, and your credit, but \n     student loans are mandated for repayment, no matter what. Is \n     it too much to ask for a fair interest rate? I think the 1 \n     percent will not be happy until it is a world of the haves \n     and have nots.\n\n  Thank you, Tracy.\n  Donna Kubiak writes this:\n\n       I agree . . . my daughter is a single mom of 3 kids and \n     working on her degree to teach elementary school . . . \n     without financial aid, she will have to work for a minimum \n     wage job and get welfare indefinitely.\n\n  Thank you, Donna, for that comment.\n  Mr. President, as we know, this issue is absolutely crucial to 7 \nmillion American students who don't want to see those interest rates \nskyrocket a couple months from now. I believe the estimate is about \n$1,000 per student. They can't afford that, and we need to get this \nbill on the Senate floor. We need to cut out the filibusters and settle \ndown and do the amendment process, the debate, and produce a bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about where we are \nright now procedurally in the Senate on the issue of student loan debt \nand the interest rates that we charge those who take out Stafford \nloans, but also the larger question of student loan debt and how we \nmake the highway, the pathway, to higher education for America's \nstudents clearer, fairer, and more predictable.\n  Yates once said that education is not the filling of an empty bucket \nbut the lighting of a fire. Educating our young people is one of the \nmost important things we do as a society. In lighting the fire of \ncuriosity, imagination, enthusiasm, entrepreneurship, and creativity, \nparticularly higher education is one of the things that distinguishes \nthe United States from many other countries around the world. We have \nlong had an enormous advantage in having one of the world's greatest \neducational systems.\n  As the occupant of the chair knows, in Vermont and in Delaware today \nthere are so many working families who deeply question whether the \npathway toward higher education for their children will be as \npredictable, fair, and straight as it has been for past generations. \nWhen I meet with business owners, innovators, job creators, they \ndeliver the same message: They have jobs. They are ready to hire people \nwho have the education and the skills they need to compete and \nparticipate in the modern economy.\n  Today, with more than 12.5 million Americans out of work, including \nmore than 30,000 Delawareans who are out of work, the question is, How \ndo we make higher education, skills training, vocational schools, and \ncommunity college more affordable and accessible? One thing we can do, \nand have to do, is address the staggering debt that lingers with \ngraduates sometimes decades after completing school.\n  We are faced with two problems. One is a short-term problem and one \nis longer term. The short-term problem is that without immediate \ncongressional action, student loan interest rates for millions of \nAmericans will double on July 1.\n  If we allow rates on federally subsidized Stafford loans to increase \nfrom 3.4 to 6.8 percent, we will saddle student borrowers with an \nadditional $6.3 billion in interest payments. In Delaware, this could \nimpact more than 18,000 student borrowers, burdening families who are \nstill struggling to recover from the recession with unexpected \nadditional bills. Lots of people have contacted my office--called or \nwritten or sent me postings on Facebook, and they have tweeted to \ncontact my office and many others here about their concerns.\n  Alexandra, a recent graduate from Wilmington, DE, reached out to me \nand wrote:\n\n       I can confidently say that going to a four-year college has \n     prepared me more than I thought it ever could for success in \n     my job search. Because of this education, however, I am \n     facing about $20,000 of debt with a low-paying job.\n\n  Alexandra is deeply concerned about the significant debt she faces, \nand she urged me to work hard to freeze the interest rate on her \nstudent loan rather than letting it double.\n  I agree with Alexandra and fully support efforts on this floor to fix \nthis short-term problem by freezing interest rates on Stafford loans.\n  I am disappointed that yesterday's vote--the failure to invoke \ncloture--to get past a filibuster by the other party has prevented the \nSenate from moving forward and discussing a possible realistic \nsolution.\n  It is important for the Congress to confront this rise in interest \nrates, and I hope we can come to a bipartisan consensus. But let's be \nclear. Even doing that will not solve the larger long-term problem. \nAddressing this rise in interest rates would not change how much \nstudents borrow, numbers that are only steadily growing.\n  Just this week our Nation's cumulative student loan debt total \ncrossed the $1 trillion threshold. That is an enormous burden on young \npeople just getting started in life and in their careers. If we are to \nreally address this challenge, we have to help students make smart \ndecisions about financing their education.\n  We can empower students to make more informed choices by fully \nunderstanding the relationship between their debt, their choice of \nmajor or studies, and their future career path by providing more and \nearlier and better information about this.\n  Financial literacy, and a clear understanding of how or whether \nborrowing will help raise their earning potential later is a key part \nof the real solution to our country's ongoing and exploding student \nloan debt.\n  We can also seek creative solutions that look beyond the obvious and \nreally work to make higher education more affordable for more students. \nThat is why I am so glad to work with my friend, Congressman Chaka \nFattah of Philadelphia, PA, on new legislation to encourage private \ninvestment in college scholarships. Congressman Fattah showed \ntremendous leadership in crafting this bill. We introduce a new tax \ncredit that will help more kids afford a college education, entitled \nCommunities Committed to College Tax Credit Act of 2012.\n  The bill provides tax incentives to encourage private donors to \nsupport and sustain educational trusts that make higher education \npossible for all the young people of a chosen community. These private \ndonors, encouraged by a 50-percent tax credit, will help fund need-\nbased college scholarships,\n\n[[Page S3018]]\n\nfueling a new generation of achievement by making higher education more \naffordable and reducing the need for student loans. But equally \nimportant, in places such as Syracuse where these programs are already \nin place, it changes expectations. When young people, in the very \nbeginning of schooling--from the first, second, and third grade--know \nthere is some possibility, some savings account, some community program \nthat will fund their higher education, the likelihood they will finish \nhigh school and go on to college increases by four to seven times.\n  I support Congressman Fattah's innovative effort to support community \ntrusts that support higher education. That is one idea for looking \nbeyond the box and working to make higher education more accessible.\n  Here is another. The American Dream Accounts Act is a bipartisan, \nbicameral bill to encourage real partnerships between schools, \ncolleges, nonprofits, and businesses to develop secure, Web-based, \nindividual, portable student accounts that contain information about \neach student's academic preparedness and skills. It also directly \ntackles the issue of student loan debt by working with students on \nfinancial literacy from a very young age. Instead of having each of \nthese different resources available, as they are now, separately \nsiloed, it connects them across existing education programs at the \nState and Federal level.\n  I am grateful to Senator Bingaman of New Mexico and Senator Rubio of \nFlorida for joining me as original cosponsors here in the Senate. This \nbill is a potentially powerful step toward helping more students of all \nincome levels and backgrounds access, afford, and complete a college \neducation. It is rooted in my own experience with the I Have a Dream \nFoundation, which has helped more than 15,000 young people all over the \ncountry to achieve the dream of higher education.\n  If we want American companies, American workers, and American \nfamilies to compete and win in the global economy, we have to help our \nstudents afford higher education. It really is that simple. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to find solutions that promote \naffordable, accessible higher education because early action and early \nengagement can help change the future and the outcomes for our kids and \nmake it possible for them to achieve the American dream.\n  It is my hope that we can overcome this needless filibuster, \nyesterday's setback, and that all of us can come together and achieve \nwhat we say we want to do together--a responsible path forward that \navoids needless additional burdens on working families trying to \nfinance their children's education--and that we can look seriously at \nthese two proposals I have touched on briefly today that will help our \nstudents of the future understand and afford higher education to make \ntheir American dream possible.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Delaware for \nspeaking to some critical issues. It is a shame we are not in a \nposition where we can offer the Senator's amendments, but, as he knows \nand as he spoke to in his speech, the decision yesterday by the \nRepublicans to go into a filibuster--which is what we are having on the \nfloor and which is why there are so few people and nothing really \nhappening aside from some really outstanding speeches--is a decision \nthey have made time and again.\n  This was rarely used in the history of the Senate--the filibuster. \nOh, ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington''--some people will remember that \nmovie, and in the 1960s during the civil rights debate, they may \nremember that too. Sometimes it was used during the Vietnam war, maybe. \nBut it has rarely been used. Now it has become so routine, so \ncommonplace, that day after weary day people who subscribe to C SPAN on \ntheir cable channels are calling in to the cable providers and asking \nfor their money back because nothing is happening on the floor of the \nSenate. And whose fault is that? It is our fault. It is our fault. When \nan issue such as this--the one that brought on this filibuster--is \nexplained to the American people, they shake their heads and ask: What \nare you doing in Washington?\n  Well, here is what this is all about. On July 1, the interest rate on \nstudent loans through the Federal Government doubles. It goes from 3.4 \npercent to 6.8 percent unless we do something. So we have a bill we \nbrought to the floor yesterday. We said: Let's bring this bill in, \ndebate it, vote on it, and let's change the law so that we can protect \nthese students and families. Let's freeze that increase and keep it at \nthe original 3.4 percent. Now, what is that worth? For someone \nborrowing $20,000 over the course of their college education, it is \nworth $4,000. If that is your son or daughter and you happened to \ncosign with them, $4,000 is nothing to sneeze at.\n  The Pew Foundation did a survey of working families across America, I \nsay to the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Vermont, and they asked \na very basic question of the working-family population. The question \nwas how many of them could come up with $2,000 in 30 days--2,000 bucks. \nMaybe there was an emergency in their home--a water pipe just broke or \nthe furnace broke down. My daughter just went to the hospital. But how \nmany could come up with $2,000 was the question, and only half \nresponded that they could. Half of the working families in America have \naccess to $2,000. So what does $4,000 or more in interest being paid \nmean? For a Senator, not much. For an average working person, a lot.\n  Now, what happened yesterday? We called this bill and said: Let's \nmove it, let's start debating it, and let's get it done before July 1. \nWe all agree we should. President Obama and even Governor Romney said \nwe should get this done. But not a single Republican Senator would vote \nwith us--not one. Not one Senator would join us to bring the bill to \nthe floor. That is why we sit here literally wasting our time and the \ntime of taxpayers over an issue we should not even have to debate.\n  I don't know about the Presiding Officer, but I had to borrow some \nmoney to go to school, and I borrowed it from the Federal Government. \nIt was called the National Defense Education Act. They created it back \nin the late 1950s, early 1960s, because we were scared to death of the \nRussians and sputnik. We thought, they can take over the world. They \nhave the bomb, and now they are the first in space with that little \nbasketball-sized satellite. So we thought it was time for America to \nget up and get moving, and we created, for the first time in our \nhistory, student loans available to nonveterans. We gave help to \nveterans in the GI bill after World War II, but these were for \nnonveterans. I got one. I signed up for it.\n\n  When I graduated from law school in the late 1960s, they added up all \nthe money I had borrowed--college and law school--from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I remember the day I brought the letter home to my wife, baby in arms \nand another one on the way, and said: My student loans have all been \nadded up.\n  She said: How much?\n  I said: It is $8,500.\n  She said: We will never be able to pay that back.\n  And I said: I know, but we have to try. We have a year before the \nfirst payment is due.\n  My first job out of law school paid $15,000 a year, to put things in \nperspective.\n  Now look what students are faced with today. They are lucky to get \nout with an average indebtedness of $24,000--very lucky. For a lot of \nstudents, that isn't even possible. They get more deeply in debt as \nthey go through school. They say: Well, you told me to finish my \neducation so I would have a better life and realize my dream. I can't \nquit now. I have to borrow some more money and finish next year and the \nfollowing year or I have wasted it all. If I am a college dropout, what \ndo I have to show for it--no diploma, just the debt.\n  So we asked families across Illinois to get in touch with us and tell \nus about student debt as they see it in their lives. We know nationally \nthat student debt in October of 2010, for the first time in history, \nsurpassed credit card debt. People owe more money on student loans than \non their credit cards, and it is growing--dramatically growing. When \nyou meet these families, it is sometimes a sobering moment.\n  I was at a college in Chicago last week and met a student, a lovely \nyoung lady majoring in art, which my daughter majored in, so I have no \nproblems with that because she is a great\n\n[[Page S3019]]\n\nartist and doing well, thank goodness. This young lady said: I am about \nto get my bachelor's degree with a major in art, and my student \nindebtedness at this moment is $80,000. But I am going on for a \nmaster's. I think it will be about another $60,000 of debt.\n  I think she was 25 years old. Think about that. Think about what she \nhas just done to herself. First, she did what she was told to do--to \nget a college degree. Then she got so deeply into debt that she is \ngoing to come to realize--sadly come to realize--it is going to \ninfluence so many decisions in her life. Will she ever be able to buy a \ncar, get married, buy a home, have children? Each one of those \ndecisions along the way is going to be based on her student loan \nindebtedness.\n  So is it right for us to keep the interest rate low on student loans? \nOf course. Why do we want to make it any worse for her or anyone else \nwho borrows money after July 1? We should be doing this, and we \nshouldn't be squabbling over it. We were sent here to solve these \nproblems, not to go into filibusters--one more Republican filibuster. I \ndon't want to get partisan about it, but they didn't provide a single \nvote--not one--to help us move to this issue.\n  So on our Web site we asked families to tell us their stories. I just \nspoke about a young student, but many of these students have parents \nand grandparents who sign up to help them. They say: Yes, we will \ncosign the note because we want our granddaughter or our daughter to \nfinish school; let me help.\n  About 6 weeks ago, the New York Times reported a story in which a \nwoman had her Social Security check garnished for student loans. It \nwasn't a loan she took out, it was a loan she guaranteed for her \ngranddaughter. Her granddaughter defaulted, and they went after \ngrandma. She now receives a smaller Social Security check because of \nthe student loan and her goodness in helping her granddaughter. That is \nthe reality of this debt. It trickles through entire families--families \nwith guaranteed loans that, when they go into default, mom and dad keep \nworking well past what they thought was their retirement age.\n  I have to say, the more I watch this, the more I am concerned about \nthis student debt bomb that could go off, if it hasn't already. I worry \nabout what it will do to these families and to the reputation of a \ncollege degree. There are people who are skeptical today about \nmortgages. They wonder, why would I take out a mortgage on a home if \nthe value of the home is going to plummet? That skepticism doesn't help \nus build hope in communities and neighborhoods. What if we reach that \nlevel of skepticism when it comes to higher education? So this is part \nof the conversation.\n\n  Let me tell my colleagues about some of the stories I have heard.\n  Dewaine Nelson from Rockford contacted our office. Dewaine's daughter \nwent to a private college costing about $30,000 a year. She has been a \nfile clerk for 11 years since graduating. He wanted to help her, but he \nlost his job in 2001. He says:\n\n       Once you fall on hard times you can never get a good job in \n     the finance or insurance industry. Your credit is no good. \n     Bad credit means no good job.\n\n  Then he decided to go back to school to pursue his MBA in marketing. \nStill, with no decent pay, he couldn't repay his student loan. So he \nwent back to school so he could defer the student loan again. He still \ndoesn't have a job that pays enough for him to pay off his loan balance \nand help his daughter pay her balance.\n  So here we have mom and dad still with student debt and struggling to \nfind a decent job.\n  Sharon Sikes from Chicago wrote about her son. She lost her job \nshortly before her son started college. Each semester his tuition kept \ngoing up. This is something we hear about very often. Her son's degree \nis in journalism and mass communication--not a field where you can find \na lot of jobs these days. His loan payments are about to kick in, and \nhe works as a cook in an Irish pub. He makes enough for his basic \nexpenses--food and keeping his bicycle running so he can go back and \nforth to work. She said she honestly doesn't know what he is going to \ndo when the student loan payments kick in. His debt from the State \nuniversity tuition has left the family with more than $60,000 in loans, \nand he is cooking in an Irish pub.\n  Sharon says she is in her sixties and nobody is lining up to give her \na job. She had hoped to be able to help her son pay his loans off \nsooner. She says:\n\n       He deserves a chance to follow his passion without being \n     saddled with years of debt.\n\n  Jill Shakely from Rockford started out at Rock Valley Community \nCollege, which I think is a smart decision--to go to a community \ncollege if you are not sure or at least you want an affordable first \nyear or two of college. She started out at Rock Valley, and when she \ngraduated in 2002, she decided she wanted to continue her education and \npursue a 4-year degree. She didn't have any support from her family. \nThey couldn't help her pay for it. So she took out students loans. The \ntuition was $26,000 a year, and it added up quickly. She doesn't own a \nhome and makes a salary some would say is pretty small. She spends a \nlarge percentage of her salary on her loans. She would like to go back \nto school but can't take on any more debt. She is worried about how it \nwill affect her future. She said that keeping interest rates low will \nhelp students like her.\n  Who wants to argue against this situation? Who believes we ought to \nraise the cost of student loans? Who thinks that is in the best \ninterest of this country in terms of encouraging young people to go to \nschool and getting them out of school without a mountain of debt which \ncrushes them?\n  That is what this debate is all about. The fact that we couldn't get \none single vote from the other side of the aisle--not one--to move to \nthis bill to even debate it is a sad commentary.\n  This Senate Chamber is supposed to be about deliberation, amendment, \nand debate. At the end of the day we put our fate in the hands of those \ngathered here and have a vote, up or down, win or lose. I know the \nPresiding Officer has had some that have won and some that have lost \nand so have I. But that is what it is supposed to be all about. \nInstead, my voice echoes through an empty Chamber. The people who \nforced the filibuster and stopped us from taking up the student loans \nare gone. Not a one of them is here.\n  Last night, I was one of the last speakers, and I looked over there \nto an empty side of the aisle and I said: Of all the people who \nobjected to our going to the bill, not a single one of them is here. \nThey are all out to dinner. That isn't right.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has been pushing for changes in the \nSenate rules. It would strike me that if someone wants to stop the \nconsideration of a bill before the Senate, they ought to park their \nposterior in one of these chairs and be prepared to take on all comers \nto explain why. If they don't have the time or inclination to do it, \nthen for goodness' sake don't start a filibuster. One of the rule \nchanges we have talked about says that if it is that important to stop \nthe business of the Senate--as we are doing now--they ought to at least \nhave to stay on the floor of the Senate to defend their position. Is \nthat too much to ask, that they don't go out to dinner and check in the \nnext day to make certain that lunch is going to be served on time?\n  I think this issue gets to the heart of what our economy is facing, \nwhat families are facing, and what the Senate refuses to face. This \nRepublican filibuster has stopped us from taking up a measure that \nwould reduce the interest rate on student loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 \npercent. In my State of Illinois, 365,000 students will be affected if \nthat interest rate goes up. It isn't fair to them. It isn't fair at \nall. It isn't fair to be stuck in the middle of a filibuster when we \nought to be rolling up our sleeves and tackling this issue.\n  The House passed a bill on student loans. Just to give an idea of how \nthere is a different approach to things, the House Republicans--with \nvery little, if any, Democratic support--said: OK. We will lower the \ninterest rate on student loans, and here is how we will pay for it. We \nwill take money out of a preventive health care program. In other \nwords, we will reduce childhood immunizations, and the money we save by \nnot vaccinating children, we will use that to bring student loan \ninterest rates down.\n  How about that for a Faustian choice? How about that for a deal with \nthe devil? We will run the risk that children will get childhood \ndiseases,\n\n[[Page S3020]]\n\nand we will take the savings from that and help the kids who are in \ncollege. Is that what it has come to now, your money or your life? That \nis the choice we have? That is all? I don't think so.\n  Why is it that the Tax Code in this country has become a sacred \ndocument? One would think that some people, instead of putting their \nhand on the Bible and swearing to uphold the Constitution, put their \nhand on the Bible and swore to uphold the Tax Code as it stands, \nwithout a word being changed. I didn't. That Tax Code is a law written \nby men and women, some of great intellect and some bowing to special \ninterests. Our job every year is to look at it and see if it makes \nsense.\n  The way we pay for the student loan interest rate to stay affordable \nis closing a loophole in the Tax Code used by accountants and lawyers \nto avoid paying taxes. They have made out pretty well under that \nprovision for a while. But why should they have that for life? Are they \nnow entitled to that? Is that an entitlement they get for life? I don't \nthink so. I think it is a loophole we can close, save the money, and \nreduce student loans--not at the expense of children being immunized \nagainst whooping cough and measles. That is what it comes down to.\n  House Republicans seem to think that is a pretty good tradeoff. I \ndon't. Let's at least debate it on the floor of the Senate instead of \ngetting locked into a worthless filibuster again and again and again. \nThat is where we are.\n  Many of us have gone to our official Web sites and invited people \nliving in our States to send us their stories about student loans. I \nhave read three of them here. I can tell you many more from those I \nwitnessed just this last week going through my State, going from \nChicago to Peoria to Decatur and all points in between. The stories \njust come crushing in one after the other, and they are reminders that \nwhat we do on the floor of the Senate makes a real difference in the \nlives of families across America.\n  I have said it before: I wouldn't be standing here today without \nstudent loans. The government loaned me the money, and somehow or \nanother I paid it back. I didn't think I could, but I did, hoping the \nnext generation could use that money to get their own student loans. It \nis part of the kind of trust we have, one generation helping another. \nSo are we going to let these students down? Are we going to let this \nfilibuster be the end of the conversation?\n  I have listened to the Republican leader come to the floor day after \nday and say: Oh, this is just a political stunt. Where is the stunt? \nWhat it comes down to is we want to bring the bill to the floor and \nopen it to an amendment process.\n  To my friends on the Republican side, give us your best ideas. Put \nthem in amendment form. Bring them to the floor. Let's debate them. \nLet's vote. We will do the same. Who knows, we may find some common \nbipartisan agreement and get this problem solved. We will not get it \nsolved stuck in another filibuster, which is where we are right now, \nwasting the time of the Senate and the time of the taxpayers and \nendangering a lot of families across America who desperately need our \nhelp.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke on the floor about the \nDemocratic bill to reduce interest rates on student loans, and I was \nlamenting the fact that our Republican colleagues would not even permit \nus to turn to the bill. They were filibustering a motion to proceed to \nthe bill which meant we could no longer work on it. That is why this \nfloor today is so empty. We should have been here working on a student \nloan bill which is so critical to so many college students and their \nfamilies across the country. The interest rates on these student loans, \nwhich are the Stafford loans, the Federal subsidized loans, is going to \ngo from 3 percent to 6 percent. We want to get it back down. This is \nimportant to 7.5 million students and their families.\n  When I concluded my remarks, Senator Brown from Massachusetts took to \nthe floor. He expressed shock that I was concerned about Republican \nfilibusters and started to talk about how cooperative the Republicans \nhave been, pointing to a few issues where we have worked together. \nLook, I am here to say that working together in a bipartisan manner on \na few issues is fine, but we need to work together in a bipartisan \nmanner on almost all the issues we work on because the American people \nare counting on us. Because there are a handful of issues on which the \nRepublicans cooperated, let's not come down to the floor and say \neverything is perfect and Republicans are not blocking us, when, in \nfact, they are blocking us.\n  The Democrats essentially retook the Senate in 2007. Since then, \nthese Republican filibusters have been off the charts. Don't take my \nword for it, listen to congressional scholars Thomas Mann and Norman \nOrnstein. They recently wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post. \nIt was based on a study. I ask unanimous consent to have that printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From The Washington Post, Apr. 27]\n\n           Let's Just Say It: The Republicans Are the Problem\n\n               (By Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein)\n\n       Rep. Allen West, a Florida Republican, was recently \n     captured on video asserting that there are ``78 to 81'' \n     Democrats in Congress who are members of the Communist Party. \n     Of course, it's not unusual for some renegade lawmaker from \n     either side of the aisle to say something outrageous. What \n     made West's comment--right out of the McCarthyite playbook of \n     the 1950s--so striking was the almost complete lack of \n     condemnation from Republican congressional leaders or other \n     major party figures, including the remaining presidential \n     candidates.\n       It's not that the GOP leadership agrees with West; it is \n     that such extreme remarks and views are now taken for \n     granted.\n       We have been studying Washington politics and Congress for \n     more than 40 years, and never have we seen them this \n     dysfunctional. In our past writings, we have criticized both \n     parties when we believed it was warranted. Today, however, we \n     have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the \n     problem lies with the Republican Party.\n       The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American \n     politics. It is ideologically extreme; scornful of \n     compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, \n     evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its \n     political opposition.\n       When one party moves this far from the mainstream, it makes \n     it nearly impossible for the political system to deal \n     constructively with the country's challenges.\n       ``Both sides do it'' or ``There is plenty of blame to go \n     around'' are the traditional refuges for an American news \n     media intent on proving its lack of bias, while political \n     scientists prefer generality and neutrality when discussing \n     partisan polarization. Many self-styled bipartisan groups, in \n     their search for common ground, propose solutions that move \n     both sides to the center, a strategy that is simply untenable \n     when one side is so far out of reach.\n       It is clear that the center of gravity in the Republican \n     Party has shifted sharply to the right. Its once-legendary \n     moderate and center-right legislators in the House and the \n     Senate--think Bob Michel, Mickey Edwards, John Danforth, \n     Chuck Hagel--are virtually extinct.\n       The post-McGovern Democratic Party, by contrast, while \n     losing the bulk of its conservative Dixiecrat contingent in \n     the decades after the civil rights revolution, has retained a \n     more diverse base. Since the Clinton presidency, it has hewed \n     to the center-left on issues from welfare reform to fiscal \n     policy. While the Democrats may have moved from their 40-yard \n     line to their 25, the Republicans have gone from their 40 to \n     somewhere behind their goal post.\n       What happened? Of course, there were larger forces at work \n     beyond the realignment of the South. They included the \n     mobilization of social conservatives after the 1973 Roe v. \n     Wade decision, the anti-tax movement launched in 1978 by \n     California's Proposition 13, the rise of conservative talk \n     radio after a congressional pay raise in 1989, and the \n     emergence of Fox News and right-wing blogs. But the real move \n     to the bedrock right starts with two names: Newt Gingrich and \n     Grover Norquist.\n       From the day he entered Congress in 1979, Gingrich had a \n     strategy to create a Republican majority in the House: \n     convincing voters that the institution was so corrupt that \n     anyone would be better than the incumbents, especially those \n     in the Democratic majority. It took him 16 years, but by \n     bringing ethics\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\n     charges against Democratic leaders; provoking them into \n     overreactions that enraged Republicans and united them to \n     vote against Democratic initiatives; exploiting scandals to \n     create even more public disgust with politicians; and then \n     recruiting GOP candidates around the country to run against \n     Washington, Democrats and Congress, Gingrich accomplished his \n     goal.\n       Ironically, after becoming speaker, Gingrich wanted to \n     enhance Congress's reputation and was content to compromise \n     with President Bill Clinton when it served his interests. But \n     the forces Gingrich unleashed destroyed whatever comity \n     existed across party lines, activated an extreme and \n     virulently anti-Washington base--most recently represented by \n     tea party activists--and helped drive moderate Republicans \n     out of Congress. (Some of his progeny, elected in the early \n     1990s, moved to the Senate and polarized its culture in the \n     same way.)\n       Norquist, meanwhile, founded Americans for Tax Reform in \n     1985 and rolled out his Taxpayer Protection Pledge the \n     following year. The pledge, which binds its signers to never \n     support a tax increase (that includes closing tax loopholes), \n     had been signed as of last year by 238 of the 242 House \n     Republicans and 41 of the 47 GOP senators, according to ATR. \n     The Norquist tax pledge has led to other pledges, on issues \n     such as climate change, that create additional litmus tests \n     that box in moderates and make cross-party coalitions nearly \n     impossible. For Republicans concerned about a primary \n     challenge from the right, the failure to sign such pledges is \n     simply too risky.\n       Today, thanks to the GOP, compromise has gone out the \n     window in Washington. In the first two years of the Obama \n     administration, nearly every presidential initiative met with \n     vehement, rancorous and unanimous Republican opposition in \n     the House and the Senate, followed by efforts to delegitimize \n     the results and repeal the policies. The filibuster, once \n     relegated to a handful of major national issues in a given \n     Congress, became a routine weapon of obstruction, applied \n     even to widely supported bills or presidential nominations. \n     And Republicans in the Senate have abused the confirmation \n     process to block any and every nominee to posts such as the \n     head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, solely to \n     keep laws that were legitimately enacted from being \n     implemented.\n       In the third and now fourth years of the Obama presidency, \n     divided government has produced something closer to complete \n     gridlock than we have ever seen in our time in Washington, \n     with partisan divides even leading last year to America's \n     first credit downgrade.\n       On financial stabilization and economic recovery, on \n     deficits and debt, on climate change and health-care reform, \n     Republicans have been the force behind the widening \n     ideological gaps and the strategic use of partisanship. In \n     the presidential campaign and in Congress, GOP leaders have \n     embraced fanciful policies on taxes and spending, kowtowing \n     to their party's most strident voices.\n       Republicans often dismiss nonpartisan analyses of the \n     nature of problems and the impact of policies when those \n     assessments don't fit their ideology. In the face of the \n     deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression, the \n     party's leaders and their outside acolytes insisted on \n     obeisance to a supply-side view of economic growth--thus \n     fulfilling Norquist's pledge--while ignoring contrary \n     considerations.\n       The results can border on the absurd: In early 2009, \n     several of the eight Republican co-sponsors of a bipartisan \n     health-care reform plan dropped their support; by early 2010, \n     the others had turned on their own proposal so that there \n     would be zero GOP backing for any bill that came within a \n     mile of Obama's reform initiative. As one co-sponsor, Sen. \n     Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), told The Washington Post's Ezra \n     Klein: ``I liked it because it was bipartisan. I wouldn't \n     have voted for it.''\n       And seven Republican co-sponsors of a Senate resolution to \n     create a debt-reduction panel voted in January 2010 against \n     their own resolution, solely to keep it from getting to the \n     60-vote threshold Republicans demanded and thus denying the \n     president a seeming victory.\n       This attitude filters down far deeper than the party \n     leadership. Rank-and-file GOP voters endorse the strategy \n     that the party's elites have adopted, eschewing compromise to \n     solve problems and insisting on principle, even if it leads \n     to gridlock. Democratic voters, by contrast, along with self-\n     identified independents, are more likely to favor deal-making \n     over deadlock.\n       Democrats are hardly blameless, and they have their own \n     extreme wing and their own predilection for hardball \n     politics. But these tendencies do not routinely veer outside \n     the normal bounds of robust politics. If anything, under the \n     presidencies of Clinton and Obama, the Democrats have become \n     more of a status-quo party. They are centrist protectors of \n     government, reluctantly willing to revamp programs and trim \n     retirement and health benefits to maintain its central \n     commitments in the face of fiscal pressures.\n       No doubt, Democrats were not exactly warm and fuzzy toward \n     George W. Bush during his presidency. But recall that they \n     worked hand in glove with the Republican president on the No \n     Child Left Behind Act, provided crucial votes in the Senate \n     for his tax cuts, joined with Republicans for all the steps \n     taken after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and supplied the key \n     votes for the Bush administration's financial bailout at the \n     height of the economic crisis in 2008. The difference is \n     striking.\n       The GOP's evolution has become too much for some longtime \n     Republicans. Former senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska called \n     his party ``irresponsible'' in an interview with the \n     Financial Times in August, at the height of the debt-ceiling \n     battle. ``I think the Republican Party is captive to \n     political movements that are very ideological, that are very \n     narrow,'' he said. ``I've never seen so much intolerance as I \n     see today in American politics.''\n       And Mike Lofgren, a veteran Republican congressional \n     staffer, wrote an anguished diatribe last year about why he \n     was ending his career on the Hill after nearly three decades. \n     ``The Republican Party is becoming less and less like a \n     traditional political party in a representative democracy and \n     becoming more like an apocalyptic cult, or one of the \n     intensely ideological authoritarian parties of 20th century \n     Europe,'' he wrote on the Truthout Web site.\n       Shortly before Rep. West went off the rails with his \n     accusations of communism in the Democratic Party, political \n     scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal, who have long \n     tracked historical trends in political polarization, said \n     their studies of congressional votes found that Republicans \n     are now more conservative than they have been in more than a \n     century. Their data show a dramatic uptick in polarization, \n     mostly caused by the sharp rightward move of the GOP.\n       If our democracy is to regain its health and vitality, the \n     culture and ideological center of the Republican Party must \n     change. In the short run, without a massive (and unlikely) \n     across-the-board rejection of the GOP at the polls, that will \n     not happen. If anything, Washington's ideological divide will \n     probably grow after the 2012 elections.\n       In the House, some of the remaining centrist and \n     conservative ``Blue Dog'' Democrats have been targeted for \n     extinction by redistricting, while even ardent tea party \n     Republicans, such as freshman Rep. Alan Nunnelee (Miss.), \n     have faced primary challenges from the right for being too \n     accommodationist. And Mitt Romney's rhetoric and positions \n     offer no indication that he would govern differently if his \n     party captures the White House and both chambers of Congress.\n       We understand the values of mainstream journalists, \n     including the effort to report both sides of a story. But a \n     balanced treatment of an unbalanced phenomenon distorts \n     reality. If the political dynamics of Washington are unlikely \n     to change anytime soon, at least we should change the way \n     that reality is portrayed to the public.\n       Our advice to the press: Don't seek professional safety \n     through the even-handed, unfiltered presentation of opposing \n     views. Which politician is telling the truth? Who is taking \n     hostages, at what risks and to what ends?\n       Also, stop lending legitimacy to Senate filibusters by \n     treating a 60-vote hurdle as routine. The framers certainly \n     didn't intend it to be. Report individual senators' abusive \n     use of holds and identify every time the minority party uses \n     a filibuster to kill a bill or nomination with majority \n     support.\n       Look ahead to the likely consequences of voters' choices in \n     the November elections. How would the candidates govern? What \n     could they accomplish? What differences can people expect \n     from a unified Republican or Democratic government, or one \n     divided between the parties?\n       In the end, while the press can make certain political \n     choices understandable, it is up to voters to decide. If they \n     can punish ideological extremism at the polls and look \n     skeptically upon candidates who profess to reject all \n     dialogue and bargaining with opponents, then an insurgent \n     outlier party will have some impetus to return to the center. \n     Otherwise, our politics will get worse before it gets better.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Here is the title of their piece, ``Let's Just Say It, \nThe Republicans Are The Problem.''\n  They explain that in the past they looked at Congress and thought \nboth parties were to blame. But on reflection, as they studied the \nfacts--not the rhetoric but the facts--it was Republicans who are \ncausing all the problems. Here is what they write:\n\n       The filibuster, once relegated to a handful of major \n     national issues in a given Congress, became a routine weapon \n     of obstruction applied even to widely supported bills or \n     Presidential nominations.\n\n  All we have to do is watch the Senate or certainly when one is in the \nSenate we realize these scholars, Mann and Ornstein, are absolutely \nright. In this Congress, the 112th Congress, we have already seen 48 \nRepublican filibusters; 48 times the Republicans stopped us from doing \nour work. But don't get the impression this was new behavior because it \ndid not just start in the 112th Congress, it started way before. In the \n111th Congress, which covered 2009 and 2010, Republicans conducted 91 \nfilibusters. In the 110th Congress, 2007 and 2008, they conducted 112 \nfilibusters. So far this year we have had 48 Republican filibusters. In \nthe Congress before that we had 91, and the one before that we had 112.\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\n  What does this mean? It means that in all those times we were unable \nto do the work of the American people because one party stopped it. \nThere have been more filibusters by the Republicans in the 6 years \nsince Democrats took over the Senate than there were in the prior 10 \nyears. I want to remember one of those times because I was sitting down \nthere in the manager's chair, coming out of my committee, Environment \nand Public Works, with a near unanimous vote on a little program called \nthe Economic Development Administration. This EDA has been in place \nfor--I want to say 50 years. It has been in place for 50 years--5 0; \nnot 15--50 years through Presidents Republican and Democratic. It is a \nbeautiful program because what it does is it takes some modest Federal \nfunds and leverages States' money, local money and private money and it \ncomes into areas that are having difficulty with job creation and \ninvests that money there. As a magnet it creates all of these \ncontributions, and we have seen hundreds of thousands of jobs created \nas a result.\n\n  So I come to the floor to get this little bill reauthorized. After \ncoming out of my committee with a strong bipartisan vote, it is \nfilibustered. I stood down there for 5 days, and I could not believe \nit. They are filibustering a bill that would create and save hundreds \nof thousands of jobs.\n  We also saw these Republican filibusters when we tried to say \nmillionaires should pay their fair share, which would have reduced the \ndeficit by billions. Oh, no, they could not stand to have us debate \nthat so they filibustered. They filibustered a bill to eliminate tax \nsubsidies to big oil and gas companies that are making record profits \nand getting subsidies that they have gotten for 30 to 40 years. No, we \nwere not allowed to go to that.\n  And then, of course, the most recent filibuster by Senate Republicans \nis on this critically important legislation to cut interest rates on \nstudent loans. They are going to double on July 1. Oh, no. They \nwouldn't even let us go to the bill. I say that despite the \nprotestations of Senator Brown of Massachusetts, this has got to stop. \nHe cited three or four times that we worked together. I say good for \nthat; I am happy for that. That does not in any way change the fact \nthat we face filibuster after filibuster, 48 times in this Congress so \nfar now.\n  I hope every college student in this country who has an opportunity \nis watching this Chamber. This Chamber should have been bustling today \nwith people talking and working together, offering amendments so we \ncould cut these interest rates on student loans. College students and \nhigh school students who want to go to college, and their parents, \ngrandparents, aunts, and uncles ought to understand that this floor is \nnot filled today passing this legislation because of a Republican \nfilibuster.\n  What we do here matters. We could save students thousands of dollars \non the life of their loans. These are student loans for the middle \nclass. More than 75 percent of the borrowers in the program come from \nfamilies with incomes below $60,000 a year. This is not some fun and \ngames, but my Republican friends and their presumptive Presidential \nnominee want to cut taxes for people who earn millions of dollars. They \nwant to give back an average tax cut of $250,000 a year, and they don't \nhave it in their hearts to lower student loans for families who earn \nless than $60,000 a year. They call for permanent tax cuts for the \npeople who don't need them and again they block the way for us to help \nthe middle-class students to get a break.\n  Yes, I hope college students are paying close attention to this \ndebate. I know some of them from the great State of California whom I \nrepresent are paying attention. I have heard from some of them, and I \nwill have some of their comments for the Record.\n  Delmita Turner of Rancho Cordova, CA writes:\n\n       I am the single mother of three children ages 7, 14, and \n     20. My daughter Khendel is in college and we have had to get \n     student loans to pay for her tuition. I am also in college \n     and have student loans as well. An increase would put a \n     tremendous strain on an already stretched budget.\n       After our family suffered nearly every type of loss one \n     could, including death, foreclosure, divorce, and \n     unemployment all within a year, I decided to go back to \n     school with the hopes of making life better for my family. I \n     began working a year ago last December after being unemployed \n     for 2 years.\n\n  Now I ask: How American is that? We always strive to be better. Here \nis a woman who went through death, foreclosure, divorce, and \nunemployment within 1 year. She decided to make life better for her \nfamily. She began working a year ago last December after being \nunemployed for 2 years.\n  She continues: ``So please consider how this will impact so many of \nus.''\n  I am asking my Republican friends--as we have another vote on this I \nthink tomorrow morning--to think of Delmita Turner of California and \nwhat this means to her.\n  Then there is Joseph Briones of San Fernando, CA. He writes:\n\n       I am a senior in high school who will be attending college \n     this fall. My dad is unemployed and a cancer survivor and my \n     mom is working part-time. These conditions put a large stress \n     on my myself as well as on my parents to attend my top choice \n     of college, Westmount College.\n       We did not receive financial aid from the state and we have \n     an immense amount remaining to pay for my upcoming \n     educational years. We are going to be taking out student \n     loans to pay for college. Please do not allow the passage of \n     the bill that will increase the interest on student loans. We \n     rely on these loans and it is difficult to pay them back for \n     some students as it is. Please do not make it a larger burden \n     for students to go to college.\n\n  So tomorrow when we take up this bill again, I hope my Republican \nfriends will stand down and think of Joseph Briones of San Fernando, \nCA, who is making a very pointed plea that he relies on these loans, \nand it is going to be very difficult if the interest rates are doubled.\n  Then there is Rachel Zavarella of San Jose, CA. She says:\n\n       Increasing Stafford loan interest rates only kicks students \n     and borrowers when we are down . . . Increasing student loan \n     interest is another dirty trick to redistribute wealth to the \n     top, and it's disgusting and unacceptable. I want you to vote \n     for students and borrowers by voting yes on the bill.\n\n  Mr. President, that is just three stories from my State. I know in \nyour beautiful State of Oregon, which has so many wonderful \nuniversities, you could have dozens of stories like this. Clearly this \nis not a time to increase loan rates for students. This should not be a \npartisan matter. Why would every single Republican vote no? I guess it \nis their ideology. Tax breaks for the rich, rich, rich, rich, and \nnothing for the middle class.\n  If anyone wants to know the difference between the two parties, this \nis the moment. It used to be a little harder to describe the \ndifferences between the parties. When I was young, both parties stood \nhere and fought for the middle class, for students, for the \nenvironment, and for women. It isn't that way anymore. It just is not.\n  If we say we are here for the next generation, which all of us say \nall the time one way or the other, then you don't allow student loan \ninterest rates to double. You don't allow it. We know how to fix it. We \nfound a very simple way to pay for this that makes sense. Closing a tax \nloophole doesn't hurt anybody. Look at yesterday's vote. It was not \ngood; it was not pretty.\n\n  I am glad Senator Harry Reid is going to give us another chance to \nchange that, and I hope my Republican friends are now hearing from \ntheir constituents back home. I hope when they come here tomorrow they \nwill cast a ``yes'' vote and let us proceed to this bill and let us do \nour work. Let us stand for the people who need us to stand for them, \nthe middle class of this great country. We know why the country is \ngreat; it is because of the middle class. We need to make sure they \nhave the opportunity to go to college and not have this burden on them \nthat is so heavy it becomes too heavy for them to bear. Pretty soon \nthey will stop going to college because they don't want to have that \nburden on their back.\n  We have a chance to do the right thing. I hope we will. Let the \nrecord show these filibusters are outrageous and they are historic in \nnature. We have never had them before. We have never had such a lack of \ncooperation from Republicans before, and it has been a sad several \nyears where we have seen filibuster after filibuster, even stopping us \nfrom going to a bill. Tomorrow maybe we can come together and get on \nthis bill and do our work.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I have followed with great interest this \nweek the conversation in the Senate about student loans, the issue we \nare currently on, to proceed to a bill on student loan interest. I have \nfollowed it with great interest for a couple of reasons.\n  First of all, in the State of Florida, obviously, and across the \ncountry, there are thousands--maybe hundreds of thousands--of people \nwho either have student loans and are paying them back or are relying \non them to go to school in the future. So it is totally an issue that \naffects the State of Florida, where I come from.\n  I have a personal interest in the student loan issue as well. I think \nI have said on the floor before that my parents worked very hard, but \nthey were never able to save enough money to pay for my college \neducation. So I relied on grants and on loans for undergraduate \neducation, but especially for my law school education. I came back to \nMiami to go to law school. I am glad I went to the University of Miami. \nI am proud to have gone there, and I think the education I got there, \nmy legal education, was very good. It also happened to be very \nexpensive. I relied on student loans to be able to pay that, so much so \nthat when I graduated from law school in 1996 I graduated with a law \ndegree and a significant amount of student debt that I had accumulated \nthroughout 7 years of study.\n  In fact, I am still paying one of those loans today. I think--I may \nbe wrong, but I know of one--I know of only one other Senator who is \npaying student loans right now. I pay, as I have joked in the past, \nabout $723 a month to somebody named Sallie Mae, which is, all joking \naside, a servicer that collects on these loans. So it is an issue I \nunderstand and care about on a personal level, as well as because of \nthe people I represent.\n  This issue we are discussing this week has allowed me to use it as a \npoint of illustration to the people back home who are watching this \ndebate. After having spent my first year here, one of the questions I \nget the most is, What is it like in the Senate?\n  Let me begin by saying I am honored and privileged to serve here. \nThere isn't a day that I don't walk into this building, even into this \nvery room, and not be taken aback by the history that has been made on \nthis floor, by the great men and women who have served our country from \nit, and by the wonderful Americans with whom I serve even now. I have \nbragged to people who are watching or to whom I have spoken that I have \nnever had a bad experience with anyone in the Senate in the year and a \nhalf I have been here, and I am very proud to be a part of this \ninstitution.\n  However, there are things about it that trouble me. Particularly, at \nthis moment in American history, and maybe as a result of what is \nhappening this week, circumstances allow me to illustrate that better \nthan any other week since I have been here.\n  Everyone agrees that interest rates on student loans cannot go up. \nEveryone agrees. There hasn't been a debate on that. I haven't run into \nanybody in either party who has come to me and said: Let the interest \nrate go up. Let students pay more. There isn't any argument about that. \nThe argument is simply this: How do we pay for it? We have to pay for \nit because if we are going to keep the interest rates down on these \nfederally subsidized loans, we have to pay for it. We have to find the \nmoney from somewhere to pay for it. So the debate and the disagreement, \nto the extent it is a complicated disagreement--and I don't believe it \nis--the disagreement is not about the student loan interest rate; the \ndisagreement is about how we pay for the cost of keeping the rate low \nfor another year. There is a difference of opinion.\n  I am new to the Senate. I am not new to legislation. I spent 9 years \nin the Florida Legislature and 2 years as the Speaker. We dealt with \ncomplicated issues there as well. What we would do in those instances \nwhere there was a disagreement, not on what we wanted to accomplish but \non how to get there, is we worked on it. We would sit people down and \nsay it is not that much money in terms of Federal standards--it sounds \ncrazy to say that because we are talking about billions of dollars--but \nfrom a Federal standpoint, it is not that complicated an issue. Let's \nsit down. Let's get some like-minded people together and let's figure \nout a bipartisan way to pay for what we all agree we need to do. That \nis the normal, regular way to deal with an issue such as this.\n  That is not what has happened. Why hasn't that happened? Why have \nsmart, well-educated, intelligent people who serve in this Chamber not \nmet and discussed a way to pay for this? It is really not that \ncomplicated. It wouldn't take that long to come up with a way to pay \nfor it that both sides agree on. Why hasn't that happened?\n  The answer to that question is something people back home are not \ngoing to like, and people who are here today visiting are not going to \nlike to hear, and whoever is watching on television right now isn't \ngoing to like. The reason is because that is the way things have been \nsince I have gotten here. It is about politics.\n  Shocking as that may be, there is politics in this process. That is \nwhat is influencing us today.\n  A few weeks ago, the President made a decision that this was an issue \nhe wanted to use. His campaign folks made a decision that student loan \ndebt and the interest rate was a perfect opportunity to use as, yet \nagain, another wedge issue. The latest wedge issue, and we have seen a \nseries of them, is let's campaign on the idea that Republicans are not \nin favor of students, and let's use the student loan issue as an \nexample of that. Of course, those plans kind of got messed up when \nRepublicans said: We agree with you. We can't let student interest \nrates go up either. So they were off balance for a couple of days.\n  By the way, the President continued to travel the country and \ncampaign on keeping student loan rates down even though no one was \nagainst them. He was campaigning against his opponents on this issue \neven though there were no opponents on this issue.\n  But, nevertheless, after a couple of days of figuring out they were \ngoing to lose this wedge issue, they came up with a second way to deal \nwith it; that is, let's bring this issue to a vote on the Senate floor, \nbut let's build it in such a way--let's put a bill on the floor of the \nSenate that we know will fail, that we know Republicans can't vote for. \nIt wasn't: let's meet and see where we can agree on how to pay for this \nso we can get something done. It was: let's put a bill on the floor \nthat we know Republicans will never support, designed specifically to \nfail, so we can then spend the week talking about this on the Sunday \ntalk shows and speeches on the floor and missives from the campaign. It \nis about messaging.\n\n  In a country where our national debt now equals the size of our \neconomy; in a country where we are 5, 6 months away from catastrophic \nincreases in taxes; in a country where just last Friday we learned that \njob creation and job growth is stagnant, where millions of Americans \nhave been out of work for 2 years or longer; in a country where \nmillions of Americans have stopped looking for work because they have \nbecome so depressed, the Senate has wasted yet another week on a show \nwhen, in fact, this is an easy issue for us to have come together and \nsolved.\n  This is not new, by the way. This has been the mode of operation here \nfor most of the weeks I have been in the Senate. It is a pretty \nfamiliar pattern. The campaign of the President decides on an issue \nthey want to use to divide Americans for electoral purposes, the Senate \noffers up a bill they know Republicans will vote against, and then they \nspend a week giving speeches on it. The only difference is they are \ndoubling down: We are going to vote on the exact same thing a second \ntime, just to drive the point home.\n  Here is why this bothers me. No. 1, there are real issues this \ncountry faces, issues that deserve a sense of urgency, issues that \ndeserve every single person who serves here to solve. This is one of \nthem, by the way. We don't have time to waste on shows. It bothers me.\n  The second reason it bothers me is these are real people who are \nbeing impacted by this issue. There are real people out there who, \nbecause they can't find a job when they graduate, have to get a \nforbearance. Forbearance\n\n[[Page S3024]]\n\nmeans they have to call their lender and say they can't pay their \nloans. Do my colleagues know what happens when we get a forbearance on \nour loans? It compounds. It sits there. It is delayed. It is not \ndelinquent, but it compounds. The interest rate is added to the \nprincipal. So by the time a person starts paying it, their loan is even \nbigger than the loan they took out to go to college.\n  There are other people who can only afford to make X amount of \npayments because they are not making as much money. Maybe they didn't \nfind the job they thought they were going to get, so all they can do is \npay interest. So that means by the time they finish paying off these \nloans, their kids will be in college.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what it means in the real life of someone \nwho has these loans because I still have them. What it means in the \nlife of a person who has a loan such as this is the following: They \ncan't save for their own kids' college, which means not only will they \nhave their student loan debt, but their children will be stuck with it \nas well.\n  What bothers me about this issue is that instead of solving it, we \nhave spent the week playing a game with it while real people are out \nthere scared to death--real students, real parents, real families who \nare facing the threat of not just an increase in the interest rate but \nof an economy that doesn't have a job for them.\n  Do we think the interest rate is the biggest risk these people are \nfacing? It is not. The interest rate is a problem. Not having a job is \na catastrophe. The interest rate could be zero. If a person doesn't \nhave a job, how are they going to pay it? That is the No. 1 issue \nfacing these graduates. No one is doing anything about it.\n  Here is what I suggest. If this was a place that was really working \nto solve problems, what we would have done and what we would do right \nnow is stop this process, go back there somewhere, get a few people \ntogether who know how to solve this, and come back here. I guarantee \nthat if we decided we wanted to solve it, it would not take long.\n  Here is what else I guarantee. This is going to get solved. My \ncolleagues can mark my words. A few weeks from now they will come up \nwith a deal or a bill that will have enough votes to pass the House and \nSenate, and this will get solved. But not before we score political \npoints, right? This will get solved, but not before the people who care \nmore about politics than policy score their political points on this \nissue.\n  Now, look, I have been around politics. I understand this is an \nelection year and election year stuff is going to happen. But why are \nwe playing with the lives of real people? These are real people who are \nhurting, and their lives and their experiences and their worries are \nbeing used as a pawn in a political game. And it is wrong.\n  I will make another prediction to my colleagues. Next week it will be \nanother wedge issue of the week. Next week we will be right back here \nwith another bill that was designed to fail on purpose so we can get \nanother week's worth of talking points on yet another issue.\n  The good news is--people in this city, unfortunately, think they are \nsmarter than they really are. People back home know all of this. They \ncan see it for what it is. People aren't dumb. The American people \ncertainly aren't dumb. They can see right through this stuff, and they \nunderstand exactly what is happening.\n  So my suggestion would be that on this issue, let's come together. \nLet's say this is one of the issues that is so important, that impacts \nso many people in such a significant way, that it should be above \npolitics. Let's get together over the next 48 hours. It doesn't seem as \nthough this place is overworked when we look around the room.\n  What are we doing all week? What is going on all week? We voted on a \nfew judges, and we have given a bunch of speeches. Why don't we go \nsomewhere and get a group of people to work on this issue and come back \nwith a solution? This can be solved.\n  What is going on now is a disservice to the people who sent us here. \nThey deserve better. They really do. The American people deserve \nbetter. The people we represent, the people who hired us to do the job \nwe have now, deserve better than this sort of theater. The Senate has \nbecome a theater. It has become a show. That is why people get grossed \nout by politics. That is why people watch the news at night and just \ndon't understand this whole thing. They have a right to be frustrated. \nThey have a right to be upset. They have a right to be impatient with \nus because nothing is happening on the issues that matter to their real \nlives.\n  I hope this pattern will stop. I get it. There are still going to be \nplenty of other issues we are going to have arguments about during this \nelection year, and that is good for our country that we have a good \ndebate on the issues of the day. But on the ones we can solve, on the \nones we agree on that impact the real lives of real people, let's stop \nthe games.\n  Let's get something done.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I cannot believe we have come to the \nfloor of the Senate at a time of economic hardship and recovery for \nmillions of families, a time where jobs are scarce, the need for a \nskilled workforce is critical, and student loans are about to double, \nonly to have those on the other side turn this into yet another \nfilibuster, another capitulation to those on the far right of their \nparty--those who are so far right that when they look back along the \npolitical spectrum they can only see the small image of their hero, \nRonald Reagan, fading in the distance.\n  They have gone so far to the right that they can no longer see any \nheroes, not even their own. So here we are with our side once again \ndebating the obvious and the other side defending the indefensible \nposition of the far right.\n  We are looking for common sense, reason, and fairness. We are, that \nis, looking to govern fairly for all. They are looking to play politics \nthat benefit a few.\n  We are asking to stop interest rates on student loans from doubling \nfor 7 million Americans by closing a gaping tax loophole that those who \nhave benefited most from this economy can drive an S corporation \nthrough. My Republican friends are once again saying no. They are once \nagain attempting to govern from the extreme, once again demanding that \neven closing an obvious tax loophole that benefits the wealthiest is an \nunacceptable government intrusion but that ending preventive care for \nthose who are struggling with rising health care costs is the best \noption.\n  Can they be serious? Can we be standing in this Chamber saying that \nthe most reasonable option to prevent student loans from doubling is \nnot commonsense tax reform but ending breast cancer screening for \nmillions of women? Is that the view from the far right of the political \nspectrum? I ask my colleagues on the other side do they truly believe \nthat is a fair option? Have we run through all other possible options \nto have reached a point where we can now say: The only arrow left in \nthe quiver is to end preventive care as we know it. Have we already \nended all outrageous tax loopholes for the wealthy? Have we already \nended subsidies to Big Oil that will make $1 trillion over the next 10 \nyears and yet we give them $24 billion of tax cuts? Have we ended the \nBush tax cuts for the top 1 percent and now have no other option than \nto end preventive health care for women, for millions of Americans \nwhose health depends on it?\n  Unfortunately, it seems our Republican friends have once again put \npartisanship and politics first. Their budget prioritized tax breaks \nfor the wealthy over keeping college costs down for middle-class \nfamilies. Only when they realized this would not play well politically \ndid they reverse course and drop their objections to keeping student \nloan rates lower because, they said, no, that is not the government's \nrole. But then they said: OK. We will climb on board with that idea but \nonly under certain conditions.\n  Rather than close a special-interest loophole that only a small \nminority of\n\n[[Page S3025]]\n\nwealthy businesses can exploit, they would rather cut funding for \nchildren's vaccines, mammograms, and other critical services. This is \nthe classic case of giving with one hand and taking with the other and \nall without asking the wealthiest Americans--those who have reaped the \nmost rewards and benefited the most, particularly in tax breaks they \nhave received over the last almost decade--to help the country, simply \nto help the country at this critical time.\n  If that does not tell us about the priorities of each party, I do not \nknow what will.\n  These preventive health services not only improve people's health and \ntheir lives, they also reduce the cost of health care. That is because \nit is a lot easier and less costly to treat illnesses when they are \nfirst detected.\n  When women have access to affordable mammograms, their doctors will \nbe far more likely to catch breast cancer in its early stages, when it \nis most treatable and least expensive to cure.\n  When we give a child a simple inexpensive measles vaccine, we do not \nhave to worry about expensive treatment for measles later on.\n  When we help people quit smoking, we dramatically reduce the cost of \ntreating that individual for a whole host of illnesses.\n  The saying, ``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,'' \ncould not be more appropriate to this debate.\n  For a party that loves to preach about fiscal responsibility, it \nboggles my mind that they would fight to cut preventive care that will \nreduce health care costs but allow tax loopholes to stay open.\n  Republicans decided to make a target of these programs, not because \nof substantive issues--I would respect that--but just because, plain \nand simple, they were included in the President's health care bill. As \nwe know, as the distinguished minority leader said, it is all about \ndefeating the President. The problem with that is, it is not about the \nPresident failing, it is about the Nation failing at one of the most \ncritical times in its history. They lost the health care debate in \n2010, and they have spent every day since trying to refight that \nbattle.\n  Now Republicans will try to scare people into thinking that closing \nthis corporate tax loophole will kill small businesses. That is the \nmantra we hear every time. But, actually, according to Citizens for Tax \nJustice:\n\n       [C]losing this loophole will actually help most small \n     businesses, which are currently subsidizing the minority who \n     abuse it to avoid [paying] payroll taxes.\n\n  Isn't that interesting? So most small businesses are out there \nmeeting the economic challenge every day. They pay payroll taxes, but \nthose who are taking advantage of this loophole do not. It seems to me \nwe would be giving small businesses a far better competitive advantage.\n  Let's be clear: The vast majority of small businesses pay their fair \nshare into Medicare. But this loophole--affectionately dubbed the \nEdwards/Gingrich loophole--has allowed certain professionals such as \nformer Senator John Edwards and former Speaker Newt Gingrich to avoid \npaying millions of dollars into the Medicare Program. Technically, they \nwere not wrong to take advantage of this loophole. We were wrong to \nallow it to even be available.\n  But enough about the details on how we pay for it. This debate is all \nabout people, all about families struggling to pay for college. As the \nfirst person in my family to go to college, who had to rely on Federal \ngrants and loans to pay tuition, I have a firsthand appreciation of the \nimportance of giving all students the opportunity to pursue their \ndreams.\n\n  For students struggling to pay for college and racking up debt, this \nis not an academic argument. The extra $1,000 they would have to pay \neach year is not theoretical money. It is the difference between being \nable to repay their loans and entering the workforce with good credit \nversus being overwhelmed by debt and going into default.\n  Recently, I had the pleasure of having a roundtable and speaking to \nstudents from Montclair State University in my home State of New Jersey \nabout how the interest rate would affect them.\n  I heard from Emily Delgado, a first-generation American and the first \nperson from her family also to go to college. She just completed her \nfreshman year at Montclair. Despite working for the college as a \nstudent mentor, Emily will still be saddled with approximately $20,000 \nin debt by the time she graduates. If she decides to go on to graduate \nschool after that, then, of course, that will rise significantly.\n  She told me she cannot even bring herself to calculate how much the \ninterest rate hike will cost her because, in her words, ``it will just \ncrush my dreams.''\n  Nick Weber, works three--not one, not two, but three--part-time jobs \nto help pay for college. Despite these three jobs, Nick only makes \naround $175 per week, which is about how much extra he would have to \npay in interest every month if we do not act now. He does not think \nthat is fair, and neither do I.\n  A student by the name of Jamie Sommer--who dreams of one day becoming \na professor--works part time for the school, but her income hardly puts \na dent in her debt, and she fears she will not be able to afford \ngraduate school, she will never realize her dream.\n  Emily and Nick and Jamie and all the other students who are \nstruggling to pay for college deserve to be able to realize their hopes \nand dreams and aspirations. It falls to us--all of us in this Chamber--\nto do all we can to keep those dreams alive.\n  These students deserve our support. They deserve the common sense of \na community that understands we have to reduce the deficit but we \ncannot balance the budget on the backs of the next generation. We \ncannot cash in their dreams and let those with the most cash out. We \nneed a fair solution, not political dogma.\n  These students have worked hard. They deserve better. They are not \nasking for a handout. They studied hard in high school, got good \ngrades, took out loans, and got jobs to pay for college. They are \nworking toward a better life, doing what every parent dreams of for \ntheir children: to do well, build a decent life for themselves and \ntheir family, and give something back to their community and to the \neconomy.\n  They epitomize everything we want our young people to be. All they \nare asking in return is fairness--not a political sleight of hand that \nhelps them with their student loans, but in the process takes away \ntheir health care. All they are asking is for us not to make it harder \nfor them, for us not to add yet another stress to their lives. \nCertainly, it is our obligation to not shut down their dreams of a \nhigher education. For it is in their dreams for a better life that the \neconomic future of this Nation will be built.\n  We are globally challenged--globally challenged--for the creation of \na product or the delivery of a service in terms of human capital. The \nboundaries of mankind have largely been erased in the pursuit of human \ncapital. So an engineer's report is done in India and sent back for a \nfraction of the cost in the United States. A radiologist's report is \ndone in Northern Island and read by your doctor at your local hospital \nor if you have a problem with your credit card, as I recently did, you \nend up with a call center in South Africa.\n  In the pursuit of human capital for a product or service, we are \nglobally challenged. For the Nation to continue to be a global economic \nleader, it needs to be at the apex of the curve of intellect--the most \nhighly educated generation of Americans the Nation has ever had. We \ncannot achieve that if we have students who have to forgo not only \ntheir dreams but the ability to help the Nation compete globally by \ngetting a world-class education.\n  We owe them every chance to achieve their dreams and to help us make \nthis another American century. Isn't that the least we can do? Isn't \nthe choice clear? Let's choose closing a tax loophole that is actually \ncreating challenges to small businesses that are paying their payroll \ntaxes, and let's preserve the preventive health care that will improve \nthe quality of the lives of our fellow citizens and, at the same time, \nsave our health care system hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  I think that choice is pretty clear--the choice the Senate should \ntake clearly on behalf of our students of the future and our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n[[Page S3026]]\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, earlier today, just a few minutes ago \nas I was presiding where the Senator from Minnesota is now sitting, I \nlistened to my colleagues speak on this issue of interest rates on \nstudent loans. I was particularly interested in the speech of a \ncolleague who came to the floor and said this bill that is designed to \nprevent interest rates from doubling is all political show. The concept \nof it being a political show is difficult for me to get my hands \naround. Quite frankly, the President didn't set July as the date \nstudent loans would double in cost. That date was set by legislation \nthat was passed in the Senate and in the House and sent to the \nPresident. It is that date, just 2 months from now, that brings forth \nthe urgency on this issue--Presidential campaign or no Presidential \ncampaign.\n  It is also important to recognize that this is not a debate at this \nmoment about final adoption of a bill. It is about beginning the \nprocess of debating the bill. It is a motion to proceed. For those \nunfamiliar with Senate process, well, this is a motion that says this \nis an issue that, because of its urgency, should be on the floor now \nfor us to work on, and everybody in this Chamber knows it cannot pass \nwithout 60 votes. As the debate unfolds, amendments are debated and \nhopefully a path is found that will produce the 60 votes necessary to \nsend it on to the House and to the President's desk.\n  So I differ with my colleague, with whom I actually have collaborated \non a number of projects. My colleague sees this differently. He sees \nthis issue as one of politics. I see it as one of an urgent need in \nAmerica for our students to have a chance to go to college with \naffordable financing, and that affordable financing will expire a few \nweeks from now. It is incumbent upon this body to take up this issue \nand provide a pathway to prevent that from happening.\n  I am struck by the voices I am hearing from Oregon. I was doing \ntownhalls in Oregon, and people expressed concern about this to me. I \nam receiving letters from students about this issue and from other \nOregonians. This is really a kitchen-table issue. This is the family \nsitting around the kitchen table and saying: How are we going to make \nthings work? Is our child going to be able to go to college? Are we \ngoing to be able to afford it? We can contribute a little, and \nhopefully our son or daughter will get some grants, but they will also \nhave to borrow some money. If they have a huge debt load and a high \ninterest rate, will that be feasible for them or will they have to take \na year or two off and try to find a job or two in the service economy \nto save money and then go back, and then what?\n  That is why student loan rates are so important. It is about the \nopportunity for our sons and daughters to have the course in life in \nwhich they are able to pursue their dreams and realize their potential. \nThat is what this debate is about. That is a pretty big deal--certainly \na big deal for students in my State of Oregon, for their parents, and \nfor our future economy, which needs to have our children in America \nwell-trained in order to drive the success of our economy.\n  We are facing a Republican filibuster saying: We don't want to talk \nabout this issue. That is what a motion to proceed is. My colleagues \nhave said: No, we don't want to debate it. I disagree with them.\n  Let's hear it through the voices of some of those folks on the front \nline.\n  Sermin from Multnomah writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Merkley:\n       Today I am writing about student loan interest rates. I do \n     not want to see these rise, even double, when the legislation \n     expires in July.\n       Please fight to keep these loans at a low interest rate so \n     average Americans can have a chance at an education, a better \n     life, without crippling debt.\n\n  She continues:\n\n       I was just accepted in the University of Oregon's graduate \n     program in architecture. I have applied for loans as I do not \n     have the money to pay for this education. My husband and I \n     will have to scrape by when I quit my job to go to school.\n       Once I graduate and find employment, I am confident in my \n     ability to pay back the loans. But raising interest rates \n     would make it difficult to do so quickly, adding $5,000 in \n     interest to my 5-year payback plan.\n       Please stand with middle America, average Americans, and \n     support legislation to extend the low interest rates on \n     student loans.\n\n  Kalie from Polk County writes:\n\n       Senator Merkley,\n       I am currently a freshman in college and have taken out a \n     substantial amount of student loans in my own name to make my \n     goal of attaining a college degree attainable.\n       Being 18 and having more than $20,000 in debt is scary, \n     especially with the insecurity of today's economy, but I \n     strongly believe that I am making the necessary investment to \n     not only better my own future, but that of the U.S. society \n     as a whole, as well as generations to come.\n       As it stands right now, a college education is something \n     that, realistically, not everyone can achieve purely from an \n     economic standpoint, and the legislation to raise interest \n     rates on Federal student loans would only make attending \n     college all the more difficult for some.\n       Please do myself, my peers, my future children, and their \n     grandchildren a favor and help keep student loan rates where \n     they are.\n       Help to make college more affordable for all people so more \n     of our citizens can realize their dreams of higher education \n     while simultaneously building a better country for future \n     generations.\n\n  Doesn't that sum it up? ``Help to make college more affordable for \nall people so more citizens can realize their dreams while \nsimultaneously building a better country.'' I think she got right to \nthe heart of it.\n  Caroline in Benton County writes:\n\n       I am an oncology nurse, presently working on my Master's \n     degree in nursing. Like many others, I have student debt. If \n     we are to have an educated workforce, we must ensure that the \n     high cost of education doesn't leave students in financial \n     ruin.\n\n  Indeed, the fear of financial ruin from heavy debt burdens and high \ninterest rates is a significant factor that is dissuading people from \npursuing higher education.\n\n  Cynthia from Columbia County writes:\n\n       If we expect to compete in a global marketplace, our \n     children must have affordable access to education.\n       I have two kids in college, and the debts we are incurring \n     are already topping $50,000; is it right that only rich \n     people can send their children to college?\n       What kind of a country is it where we can spend billions on \n     ``independent security contractors'' in Iraq or Afghanistan, \n     but not on our own children's education?\n\n  She concludes:\n\n       Please support a plan to keep student loan interest rates \n     from doubling this July.\n\n  I want to dwell on the point she made for a moment. We spent $120 \nbillion in Afghanistan last year on misguided nation building while we \nlet nation building at home suffer, both in terms of investment in our \ninfrastructure and investment in education. So Cynthia wonders what is \nwrong that we are failing our children when we have billions to spend \non a misguided war overseas.\n  Alana writes:\n\n       I am working to pay off student loans now, which is hard \n     enough. Now my family's trying to send my youngest sister to \n     college and is finding it hard to afford, and we are upper \n     middle class. If we can barely afford an education now, how \n     will anybody be able to do so if the interest rates go up? \n     Please support the plan to stop this. This is a critical \n     investment in the success of our middle class.\n\n  I think these folks from Oregon--Sermin, Kalie, Caroline, Cynthia, \nand Alana--have hit the critical points here. They may not know the \nfiner points of Senate procedure, but the fact that a good portion of \nthis Chamber is voting to block having a debate and consideration of \nthis bill because the bill doesn't start in exactly the form they want \nit passed at the end is pretty difficult to explain.\n  I say to my colleagues, if they don't like the bill as it is, why not \nbring your amendment? The bill still cannot pass in the end without a \nsupermajority, so why not bring forth your amendment--collaborate with \nothers and bring an amendment forward.\n  There is a fundamental disagreement in the beginning on how we pay \nfor this extension. It would not surprise anyone that I would say let's \nend this war in Afghanistan. Let's pay a third cutting down our \ndeficit, a third on infrastructure, and a third on education, including \nkeeping student loans affordable. But that is not the plan we are \ndebating today. I would be glad to propose that plan if colleagues \nwould like to join me to create a supermajority. I would do so after we \nare on the bill. You introduce a bill, you debate and amend it, and you \nhave a final vote. You cannot get it done without a supermajority in \nthe end.\n  The bill as introduced says we are going to close a loophole that is \na tax entitlement for the very well off. I have heard many colleagues \nacross the aisle talk about entitlements for the\n\n[[Page S3027]]\n\npoor. I point out they should be equally concerned about wasteful \nentitlements for the best off--in fact, more concerned. One is a \nfundamental safety net for those who are struggling in an economy where \nthere are few jobs. The other is a big bonus for the best off at the \nvery top of society. Doesn't it strike my colleagues that the safety \nnet is better than the big bonus for the best off? Well, my colleagues \nacross the aisle have said: No, no, no, we want the bill to start with \nour payment plan, which is to strip health care prevention from \nchildren and parents. I guess they weren't raised with the same story I \nwas raised with, which is that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound \nof cure. It is simply better to inoculate children than to hospitalize \nchildren with whooping cough. It is better to prevent measles than to \nhave children suffer with measles and be damaged by measles. It is \nbetter to manage diabetes than it is to amputate feet and provide guide \ndogs because folks have gone blind from diabetes. Prevention is better \nthan cure. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n  I disagree with the plan to strip prevention as a strategy when we \nhave options. Let's take that money from nation building in \nAfghanistan, let's take the money from bonus breaks for the best off in \nsociety, those tax loophole entitlements--let's do that because those \ndo not rip a big hole in the safety net for Americans.\n  I come from a working family. My father was a millwright and a \nmechanic. They weren't sure how I would be able to go to college. They \nwere determined that I would go. They raised me to believe in gaining \nthe education necessary to have opportunities in life. But they didn't \nhave the money. Despite the fact that I worked a job in college, that \nwasn't enough money. I got substantial grants, and that wasn't enough \nmoney. I had to take out loans, and I had to pay back those loans. The \ninterest rates matter.\n  I say to my colleagues: End your filibuster. Come here as Senators, \npresent your amendments, debate this bill, and if you don't like the \nbill in the end, vote against it. But do not block this debate on an \nissue of fundamental importance to the success of our children.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, yesterday our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle stopped the Senate from reducing the enormous burden \nof debt that students take on. At a time when college is more expensive \nthan ever, this body's inaction will increase each student's borrowing \ncosts by about $1,000 for each year of college. And that is no small \namount for most American families. That is because on July 1 the \ninterest rate on new subsidized Stafford loans is expected to double \nfrom 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. We have been talking about this all \nday. The students who qualify for these loans are from middle-class and \nlow-income families. If the Senate does not act soon, we will make it \neven harder for them to receive the education and training they need \nfor jobs in this 21st century economy.\n  High school students and adults looking for new career opportunities \nrealize how economically necessary it is to attend college. In my \ngeneration, if you had a high school degree, you could get a good \nmanufacturing job that paid a decent wage and gave you health care and \na pension. Today we need postsecondary training and strong computer \nmath skills to operate the equipment in most manufacturing facilities. \nBut it is not just manufacturing, it is many of the fastest growing \njobs in the United States--it is computer jobs and health care jobs. A \nhigh school diploma is simply no longer a ticket to a job that pays \nfamily-supporting wages.\n  With an increasing number of jobs requiring some level of \npostsecondary training, we have a significant skills gap. In \nMinnesota--a State the Presiding Officer and I are proud to represent--\n70 percent of the jobs in the next several years will require \npostsecondary training. Yet only 40 percent of working-age Minnesotans \ncurrently have a postsecondary degree. Most of our States have similar \nskill gaps.\n  The United States used to lead the world in the percentage of adults \nwith a college degree. Today we are No. 16. If our Nation is going to \nprosper in a global economy and continue to grow economically, we need \nto provide pathways for students to attend and pay for college so we \ncan close those skill gaps.\n  A number of students are lucky enough their parents can provide these \npathways for them and help pay for college, but most other students \nhave to work--part time, maybe even full time. The Presiding Officer \nwill appreciate this. I had students from the MNSCU board--their top \nstudents--who came to visit me. I am sure they visited my colleague \ntoo. There were about 15 or 20 of them. They represented Minnesota's \ncolleges and universities. I asked them: How many of you work at least \n10 hours a week while going to college? All of them raised their hands. \nI asked how many work 20 hours a week. Most of them. I asked how many \nwork 30 hours a week while going to school. A lot of them. And how many \nof you work full-time, 40 hours a week, while going to college? A \nnumber of them.\n  That is no way to go to college. When you work 40 hours a week, can \nyou take the full course of credits? Maybe not. So then maybe it takes \nyou 6 years to graduate. But they are also taking out loans, and often \nhuge loans.\n  We take for granted these days that students can get a loan, but 50 \nyears ago that was not true. Students could get scholarships, but that \nwas about it. My wife's family did it on Pell grants and scholarships. \nAt least until 1957, when the Russians--or the Soviets at the time--\nlaunched Sputnik. Suddenly, the Soviets had nuclear weapons and were \nahead of us in space and, as a Nation, we were terrified. It woke our \nNation up to the importance of better educating Americans and getting \nthem the skills they needed to compete with the Soviets. That meant \nmore Americans would have to go to college.\n  I was 6 when Sputnik was launched. My brother was 11--younger than \nthe pages. A lot younger. My parents sat us down in our living room, in \nSt. Louis Park, MN, and said to us: You boys are going to study math \nand science so that we can beat the Soviets. I thought that was a lot \nof responsibility to put on a 6-year-old, but my brother and I were \nobedient sons and we studied math and science. And wouldn't you know \nit, my parents were right. We beat the Soviets. You are welcome.\n  But to get there we had to put in place new Federal programs to help \naverage Americans afford college. A year after Sputnik was launched, \nCongress passed the National Defense Education Act, which helped put \nAmerica back on top. This was actually the predecessor to the Perkins \nloan program, and it offered students low-interest loans to go to \nschool, with a preference for low-income students.\n  This was just the beginning. Soon we gave student loans to medical \nstudents, created the Federal work-study program, and in 1965 created \nthe Guaranteed Student Loan Program. This last one was later renamed \nthe Federal Stafford Loan Program--which is what we are talking about \ntoday--and it made more money available to students to offset rising \ntuition. All this, really, because of Sputnik.\n  Today, there are two main types of Federal loans. Subsidized Stafford \nloans are awarded based on need, and unsubsidized Stafford loans are \navailable to all students. The overwhelming majority of subsidized \nloans go to students from middle and lower income families. The Federal \nstudent loan program was created to open the doors of higher education \nto more Americans and provide them with stable, low-cost loans to pay \nfor their education. And it originally did so to help Americans compete \nwith the Soviet Union.\n  Well, we may have beat the Soviet Union, but we now face new economic \nthreats from rising powers such as China and India. In our \ninterconnected world, in which it is easier than ever to outsource, the \nquality of our workforce matters more than ever before. So with college \ncosts increasingly out of the means of many American families, in\n\n[[Page S3028]]\n\n2007 Congress decided to help lower and middle-income students by \ncutting the interest rates on the subsidized Stafford loans.\n  The rates declined incrementally over time to a low of 3.4 percent \nthis past year. But because this program was so expensive, the 2007 \nlegislation would sunset on July 1 of this year and interest rates for \nsubsidized Stafford loans would double, going back up to 6.8 percent.\n\n  Allowing this to happen doesn't make sense. Interest rates on \nmortgages and Treasurys are far lower than they were in 2007, when no \none had any inkling of the turn our economy would take. No one could \nhave predicted we would be experiencing near-record low interest rates \nand that it would make no sense to double them now to 6.8 percent. Of \ncourse, the threat we face from global competition has not waned in the \nlast 5 years. It is greater than ever.\n  So with the July 1 deadline rapidly approaching, the time to act is \nnow. Most high school seniors already have had to decide where they are \ngoing next year, and now they are figuring out how to pay for it. While \nstudents are wrestling with these tough decisions, it is not time for \nus to get into a procedural fight here in Washington. I am hopeful we \nwill vote again this week to move the bill, and this time we will put \nour differences aside and represent all the families in all of our \nStates who can use any bit of help we can offer them.\n  I am glad to hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle agree \nwe should stop the interest rate from going up, and we agree we should \nbe fiscally responsible and pay for it. We just disagree on how to pay \nfor it. I am proud to have joined a number of my colleagues in putting \nforward the legislation before us with a responsible, commonsense \noffset.\n  I think we can all agree that if you are going to collect Social \nSecurity and Medicare, it is only fair you pay in what you owe, and yet \nsome people have found a loophole that allows them to game the system \nusing subchapter S corporations to avoid paying some of their Social \nSecurity and Medicare taxes, some of their FICA.\n  Most small business owners are not only honest but incredibly civic \nminded, and so they pay all the payroll taxes that they owe. \nUnfortunately, a small percentage of individuals have found a loophole.\n  If you have an S corporation, which is basically a passthrough--which \nmeans at the end of the year the profits are passed through to you as \nyour income. If you have that, whatever profits you make at the end are \nconsidered income by the IRS. So if you make $300,000 in 1 year, you \npay income taxes on all of that. Either way, on this you pay income \ntaxes on all your income. Here is the loophole: You decide, I know what \nI am going to do. I am going to pay myself an artificially low amount, \n$40,000, and call that my salary. You pay FICA on that amount so you \ncan qualify for Social Security later on in your life. Then at the end \nof the year, you get the passthrough of the other $260,000. You still \npay income tax on all $300,000 because it is all considered income. It \nis not capital gains; it is still income, so you pay income taxes on \nit. But because of an ambiguity in the way the law is written, you can \navoid paying FICA taxes on the $260,000.\n  Again, this money is indistinguishable from the so-called salary you \ntook earlier. You could have paid yourself $30,000, so it could be \n$270,000 that you harbor from FICA.\n  All of this is active income you are making because of active work \nyou have done--it is not capital gains--so you should pay FICA taxes on \nall of it. There is simply no excuse for not paying FICA taxes on all \nof your income--Medicare taxes on all the income and Social Security \ntaxes on up to $110,000. That is what anyone making $300,000 would do \nexcept for this anomaly that was accidentally written into the Tax \nCode. This is exactly the kind of loophole we should be closing.\n  I hear all the time that we should be closing loopholes so we can \nkeep the marginal rates down. If you can't close this loophole, you \ncan't close any loophole. There is no reason this loophole exists. \nThere is no good reason for it, there is no purpose to it, and there is \nno reason to keep it. It is an accident that results in people avoiding \ntheir rightful obligations. Our legislation would close the loophole \nfor those individuals making over $250,000.\n  Governing is about making choices, and this one seems as clear as day \nto me. Save millions of Americans about $1,000 for each year of \nschooling on their college loans by closing a tax loophole that allows \nthe wealthiest among us to avoid paying taxes they should pay and avoid \ngaming the system. It sounds like a no-brainer to me. Instead, a \nminority of Senators is stopping consideration of the bill because they \nobject to closing this loophole. They want to repeal a section of the \nAffordable Care Act that supports prevention efforts. They want to \neliminate the provision that helps stop diabetes and other diseases \nbefore they occur, the kinds of chronic diseases that are driving our \nhealth care costs through the roof. This is simply shortsighted and, \nfrankly, fiscally irresponsible.\n  But I am ready to have that debate. Let's have it here. Let's debate \nthe different ways to pay for this legislation. Let's stop this \nfilibuster and proceed to consideration of the bill. Let's work \ntogether to keep America on top and rise to our generation's Sputnik \nchallenge.\n  Millions of students are depending on us. This bill will provide some \nrelief to those students. Millions of businesses are depending on us to \ngive them the educated workforce they need. This bill will take a small \nstep toward helping them as well. It is time to act. I call on my \ncolleagues to work with me to pass this important legislation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I come to the floor to share some \nletters I have received about the importance of freezing the 3.4 \npercent Stafford subsidized college loan program.\n  It is important because there are some 380,000 students in my home \nState of Ohio alone who are in the Stafford subsidized loan program. \nMany of them will see as they continue their college education--whether \nit is at Sinclair Community College in Dayton or Youngstown State or \nHiram College--where their costs are continuing to go up. We know the \naverage Ohio 4-year college graduate has about $27,000 in student loan \ndebt. That is much higher than people had a decade ago or 20 years ago \nor 30 years ago or so when my generation was in college.\n  Federally subsidized student loans have been a reliable answer for so \nmany in my State. I wish to encourage people to tell their stories. \nSome of my colleagues in the Senate are doing this also, but I urge \npeople in Ohio to go to brown.senate.gov/collegeloanstories, and tell \nyour story about how important this is.\n  The disappointment is that 5 years ago this was bipartisan. President \nBush signed a bill that many of us here sponsored, in both parties, in \na Democratic House, Democratic Senate, a good bipartisan support, \nsigned by a Republican President to lock in for 5 years this 3.4 \ninterest rate. If we do nothing, if we can't get our Republican \ncolleagues to join us on this and then do the same in the House of \nRepresentatives to continue this 3.4-percent subsidized Stafford loan, \nit is going to mean that come July, the average college student will \npay about $1,000 more for each year of college. That is unconscionable \nwhen college student loans are such a burden.\n  It means people who have these loans at this level, when they get out \nof school they are less likely to buy a house, less likely to start a \nfamily, less likely to start a business.\n  If people will bear with me, I wish to read four or five of these \nletters I have gotten on our Web site.\n  Nick from Beavercreek, OH:\n\n       I am a college student at Xavier University, Cincinnati, \n     Ohio studying chemistry and biology. I hope one day, through \n     my education in the sciences, that I might be able to make us \n     a stronger nation through innovation and technology.\n       The fact of the matter is that I would not be able to \n     pursue an education if it were not for student loans from the \n     Government.\n       On behalf of the future of science in this country, which \n     is in trouble already from what I hear, I urge you to reach a \n     bipartisan agreement that would prevent interest rates from \n     doubling.\n\n[[Page S3029]]\n\n       It seems that student debt is unavoidable for the average \n     college student. College already is an expensive investment \n     that shapes our personal finances for the rest of our lives.\n       I ask that you, on behalf of those who are already burdened \n     by debt, to find a way to reach across the aisle on this one \n     and stop interest rates from rising.\n       I ask that you find a way to lighten our load. We would not \n     forget that if you did that for us. We would greatly \n     appreciate policy that opens up avenues to higher education \n     for ourselves as well as for those future seekers of such an \n     education.\n\n  Justin from Cincinnati, in Southwest Ohio:\n\n       I am the first person in my family to attend college and am \n     on track to completing my BS in experimental psychology. I \n     plan to go straight into a PHD program after I graduate and \n     the prospect of loan rates doubling is absolutely horrifying.\n       I work full time to be able to support myself but still \n     have about $15,000 in student loans. By no means does this \n     compare to others who have much more in loans but allowing \n     the interest rate to double is unacceptable and severely \n     limiting to individuals such as myself.\n       Lower tuition would boost the number of students attending \n     college making life better for everyone.\n\n  I don't suggest that everybody should go to college. I know everybody \ndoesn't want to go to college. But I do know that people often need a \ntechnical education or a 4-year degree, a 2-year degree at a community \ncollege or a technical degree or a 4-year degree at a liberal arts \nschool, a State university or a private school. The choices in my State \nare huge. We have literally dozens and dozens of small liberal arts \nschools and 4-year and 2-year community colleges and institutions of \nhigher learning. Students should be allowed, if they choose, to be able \nto have access to college. Increasingly, it is more difficult for \nstudents to do that.\n  Lorie from West Jefferson, OH:\n\n       I am a full time working mother of three teenage boys as \n     well as a full time college student at Ohio Dominican \n     University.\n       I currently have over $40,000 in student loans. I still \n     have one more year to go before completing my program and \n     earning my Bachelor's degree.\n       By that time my loan amounts will probably be around $50K.\n       About the time I finish college, my oldest son will be \n     beginning college and the student loan process will begin \n     again.\n       He will be the first of three children that we will put \n     through college.\n\n  Listen to the definitive. She has decided she is going to make sure \nher kids get a chance to go to school right away. I don't know her, but \napparently she didn't get a chance to go until she was older and became \nmarried, with children, and has decided to go back to school and is \ncompleting her education as her children reach their teens or mid-teens \nor upper teens.\n\n       Low interest rates would help make this a little less of a \n     financial burden for me and my family.\n       I do not see how raising interest rates on student loans do \n     anything but cripple those trying to better themselves.\n\n  The last couple I will read. Linda from Centerberg, OH:\n\n       We are grandparents of 5 children. We and our children are \n     middle class constituents who live in a rural area close \n     enough to Columbus to commute.\n       Please do not let the interest rate for the Stafford Loan \n     increase in July.\n       Our oldest grandchild is preparing to start college in the \n     fall. She is fourth in her class and shows great promise for \n     a good future in her chosen field, but our children are \n     finding that paying for college is really going to stretch \n     their budget.\n       Please don't put a further burden on our grandchild by \n     increasing the interest rate of a loan she may need to \n     finance her future.\n\n  So those last two are interesting in that this doesn't just affect \ncollege students; this affects the parents; it affects the \ngrandparents. It is important that they don't want welfare. They just \nwant an even shot and a break here. That is so important for this \ngrandmother. People understand that this is going to help everybody if \nthey get to go on to college.\n  The last one I will mention is Carla from Steubenville in eastern \nOhio, near the Ohio River:\n\n       I am very concerned about the raising of interest rates for \n     student loans.\n       I am a mother in a middle class family working to help put \n     my sons through college.\n       I don't expect a handout but I have worked hard to acquire \n     my position as a teacher.\n       My husband and I have exhausted our savings to pay for most \n     of our sons' expenses--even with the support of subsidized \n     and unsubsidized loans.\n       I have put out over $80,000 in my eldest son's college. \n     Please, let's help those that help themselves. If not, then \n     the economy is going to continue to fail.\n       The middle class will go bankrupt just trying to pay for \n     their kids college.\n       I was taught to work and you shall receive but that is not \n     true anymore. Please help the working poor.\n\n  What I take out of this more than anything is back in the 1940s and \n1950s our government, through legislation that President Roosevelt \nsigned in 1944, the GI bill, created a whole generation of prosperity. \nMillions and millions of young men and women coming out of World War II \nwere given the opportunity to go to college and build homes and get \ntheir families started.\n  Because government at one time helped these millions and millions of \nstudents, it lifted the entire country. It lifted the economy. We had a \nmuch more prosperous economy because all these young men and women went \nto college because they chose to--millions and millions of them--\nbecause of the GI bill. It meant colleges were built. It meant more \nhighways were built. It meant more businesses were started after they \ngot out of college.\n  This subsidized Stafford Loan, as the Presiding Officer this \nafternoon knows, as we all know, helping all of the hundreds of \nthousands--in my State 380,000, in Minnesota more than 200,000 \nstudents--helping those hundreds of thousands of students in our two \nStates will help our States become more prosperous.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support our legislation. Lock this in. \nDo it bipartisanly. It was bipartisan 5 years ago, as the highway bill \nused to be bipartisan, as raising the debt limit used to be \nbipartisan. Please return to those days when bipartisanship around here \nwas rewarded and was effective.\n\n  I close by asking people to go to my Web site and tell us your story: \nbrown.senate.gov/collegeloan stories. Tell us your story. I would like \nto share it with my colleagues because I think putting a human face on \nthis for the student, for the parents who are struggling, even for the \ngrandparents who care so much about the future, as most of our \ngrandparents do, can make a real difference.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we are still here. We have not gotten \nmuch of a response from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nabout our legislation that would help students throughout America pay \ntheir tuition costs and pay a reasonable amount of interest on their \nloans. I don't know what my colleagues are waiting for. We all know the \ncrisis in America. College has become more and more important. To many, \nit is a necessity, and it has become more and more expensive. That \nequation is not only hurting the kids who go to college, it is hurting \ntheir families and hurting this country.\n  When the percentage of people who graduate from college declines vis-\na-vis other nations, that is a very bad sign for America. We can talk \nabout the problems of quality in our K 12 schools, and those are \nimportant issues, but our higher education system is still rating just \nabout the best in the world. That is shown by the fact that hundreds of \nthousands from around the world, including places such as China and \nIndia, apply to our schools, come here and attend. It is a shame we \nsend them back even if they want to stay, but that is an immigration \nissue not an education issue.\n  Our schools are great, and the big problem with higher education in \nAmerica is not quality--although, of course, it could be made better--\nit is affordability. It is not the same as K 12.\n  Yet here we are, sitting here, and the other side is in a certain \nsense twiddling their thumbs and making it worse.\n  How is America going to stay the greatest economic power in the world \nwhen fewer and fewer of our bright, capable, hard-working students can \nafford college and when more and more of them decide they are not going \nto go to school or, if they go to school, not to the college of their \nchoice for financial reasons?\n\n[[Page S3030]]\n\n  We put a reasonable offer on the table. The proposal is we pay for \nour college tuition act by closing a loophole that people such as Rush \nLimbaugh said should be closed when John Edwards was found to have used \nit in his law firm, when other leading Republicans in 2004 said this is \none of the greatest abuses of the Tax Code they had ever seen. All of a \nsudden our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they cannot \nvote for it. This was an issue that was talked about as we talked about \ndealing with the budget gap in August or in December--during last year, \nwhenever it was. Again, we did not hear objections from the other side: \nTake that one off the table, we can't live with it.\n  It seems what is going on is very simple. Our colleagues know that it \nis certainly politically unpopular, but probably it is politically \nwrong to allow interest rates to double. But they can't just say they \nare against it. They tried to say they are against it, but when the \nPresident went around the country and talked about it they had to back \noff that.\n  So in the House they came up with a pay-for which was sort of \nlaughable. Everyone knew that would never pass, and no one took their \nposition seriously. But we had always hoped that our colleagues in the \nSenate who, frankly, have been much more reasonable in the last little \nwhile--we passed a highway bill with bipartisan support, we passed a \npostal reform bill with bipartisan support, we passed the Violence \nAgainst Women Act with bipartisan support, and we thought we could get \nthis done with bipartisan support.\n  Our goal is not to draw a difference between the parties--that has \nbeen apparent--but to get this done. We thought when we put our \nproposal on the Senate floor they would accept it. At minimum we \nthought they would at least come back with an offer: Let's debate it. \nLet's try and see if their amendment passes in terms of a different \npay-for. Let's see if our amendment could get support. Instead, what \nhave we found? A filibuster blocking the Senate from even considering \nthis reasonable measure.\n  I am going to yield the floor because I see my colleagues have \narrived, the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from New \nHampshire, who I know have strong beliefs about this issue. We have an \nall-New England cast in the room, with a little help from the Mid-\nAtlantic.\n  I hope they will reconsider. I hope they will reconsider because it \nis better for the politics of this country to come together once again \non reasonable issues, as we have done in the past few months. It is \nbetter, frankly, for their own politics. I am not wishing them ill. But \nmost of all, it is better for the future of our country. Please \nreconsider. Let's move forward and debate this bill and let's not let \nthe high cost of going to college get unnecessarily higher.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored to follow my \ndistinguished colleague from New York and his very powerful and \neloquent words on a subject that concerns all of us, not only in New \nEngland but across the country. I have heard from countless students in \nConnecticut where we have some of the best educational institutions in \nthe country. I know my colleague, Senator Shaheen from New Hampshire, \nhas been very much in touch with the people of her State, and \nparticularly young people there, striving--as they are in Connecticut--\nfor more affordable education.\n  We are talking about the future of our country. There should be \nnothing contentious, certainly nothing partisan about this issue of \nfinancing the future of education and particularly student loans. This \nought to be a common cause, and it ought to be bipartisan. I believe \neventually it will be because we need to come together on this issue \nfor the sake of young people whose lives are very directly and \nimmediately impacted by this issue in Connecticut and across the \ncountry. The impact is not only on their lives but our competitive \neconomy, increasingly a global economy in Connecticut that depends more \nand more on exports and more and more on talented and gifted and \ntrained, educated skilled people. We need them in Connecticut, and we \ncannot permit the interest rate on Stafford loans to rise to 6.8 \npercent from its present rate of 3.4 percent.\n  Even now the debt with the present 3.4 percent is crushing to many of \nour students who are struggling to pay their student loans with that \nlower interest rate.\n  Stanley Knotowicz--who contacted my office, who is seeking solutions \nin good faith, constructively, and positively--reached out to my office \nbecause he experiences the same financial hardships facing millions of \nrecent graduates across the country. He is paying $70 a week for gas. \nHe is providing financial support for his grandmother in her late \neighties who might lose her home. He is trying to save money to get his \nown apartment. He is one of the many students in Connecticut and across \nthe country who have reached out and my office has helped him.\n  I have also heard from Brenda Kasimir, a mother who would be crushed \nif she were forced to pay this higher interest rate. Again, my office \nhas helped her to meet the ever-increasing challenge of today's economy \nwith that student debt that now, overall, is the highest of any debts \nfaced by our people as a whole, more than $1 trillion.\n  Senators Reid and Harkin want to come to a solution that will keep \nthe burden off the backs of students without adding to our national \ndebt. It is not a tax increase that they propose, it is simply a \nsolution that clarifies tax rules that are already in existence by \nclosing a loophole. It is known as the Gingrich-Edwards loophole. I \nwish it were not known by that name. But it lets lawyers, consultants \nand highly paid professionals dodge payroll taxes and push that burden \noff on the middle class.\n  Getting rid of this loophole is another step toward an America where \neverybody pays their fair share and everybody plays by the same rules. \nIt is the America that we grew up believing in. It is the America that \nwe continue to believe in. Some have claimed that it is an America we \nhave lost. I don't believe it. We can prove it by closing this \nloophole.\n  The provision proposed by Senate Democrats to close this loophole is \nnarrowly tailored to affect only wealthy individuals, those making over \n$200,000 for an individual or $250,000 for joint filers. They are \ntrying to shield their salaries from taxes, calling themselves small \nbusinesses. It will not affect the actual small businesses of this \ncountry, and it will not raise taxes for anybody who already pays what \nthey owe in payroll taxes. This loophole should be closed independent \nof the student loan crisis. We ought to close this loophole regardless \nof the challenge we face now in keeping the interest rate at 3.4 \npercent.\n\n  Very simply, we are being asked to make a false choice--the choice \nbetween accessible education and improved public health. It is not a \nchoice we have to make. Our long-term economy and, as a result, the \nFederal budget will both benefit if both of these goals are served and \npreserved.\n  There is an old saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound \nof cure, and that is supremely epitomized by this situation. Last year \nan analysis in Health Affairs found that for each 10 percent increase \nin local public health spending, the rate of infant deaths and death \nfrom diabetes, heart disease, and cancer dropped significantly. \nPreventing these deaths and the costly treatment that precedes them \ncould save the Federal Government large amounts of money and improve \nthe quality of life for countless Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to come together and recognize that preventive \nhealth care is essential not only to the future of this generation that \nwill take advantage of the 3.4-percent interest rate for their Stafford \nloans but other generations as well, generations whose they will be and \ngenerations who are their parents.\n  This program is essential. The 3.4-percent interest rate should not \nbe a partisan issue, and we should be closing this loophole regardless \nof the Stafford loan issue. But one way or the other, we should pay for \nit by closing the loophole and making sure students have an affordable \ninterest rate for these Stafford loans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n[[Page S3031]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator would yield for a unanimous consent?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I will yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks by the Senator from New Hampshire, I be \nrecognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from \nConnecticut and from New York and others who have been on the floor \ntoday to talk about the importance of addressing the--of avoiding, I \nguess I should say, the potential for the student loan interest rates \nto rise at the end of June. The fact is that the U.S. workforce needs \nto have the skills to compete in the global economy, and that means \nmaking sure college is affordable because so many of the new jobs that \nare being created require higher education.\n  The reality is that students today face ever-growing tuition rates, \nand student loans are a critical bridge for them to cover these costs. \nBut unless we act, over 7 million students--38,000 in my State of New \nHampshire alone--who rely on subsidized Stafford student loans will see \nan increase in their student debt when they graduate.\n  This is a particular problem for students in New Hampshire because \nour students have the highest average student debt in the Nation. They \nare graduating with just over $31,000 in debt per student. Not only do \nthey have the highest average debt, but 74 percent of our college \nstudents are in debt, and that is the second largest number in the \ncountry. So we have the highest average debt and the second highest \nnumber of students graduating with debt.\n  Students in New Hampshire and across this country need some relief, \nand doubling the interest rate is exactly the wrong way we should be \ngoing in terms of policies to promote giving every American the \nopportunity to succeed. We need to encourage our students to go on to \nhigher education, to advanced-degree programs, and to professional \nschools. Their future employment and our future economy both depend on \nthis.\n  Last week I had the opportunity to visit with two of our State \ncolleges, Keene State College and Plymouth State University. Everyone I \nspoke with had stories about the escalating cost of college and concern \nfor rising student loan interest rates. Over the past 24 hours I have \nheard from hundreds more constituents who are anxious about this.\n  Now, to be clear, the legislation we are considering would affect \ncurrent and future students who will receive subsidized Stafford loans \nstarting July 1. The last thing anyone needs in this economic climate \nis a reason not to pursue their undergraduate or graduate studies.\n  Meghan Jordan of Amherst is a sophomore at the University of New \nHampshire. She told the Union Leader newspaper that student loan debt \nhas become a constant concern for her. Meghan says that her parents \nwould do just about anything to pay for her college education in full, \nbut with two brothers also in college the finances are simply not \navailable. Meghan views the prospect of interest rates doubling as an \nattack on college students trying to make a better future for \nthemselves. Sadly, she said it feels like it is a punishment for trying \nto obtain a college degree.\n  When I was at Keene State College in Keene last week, I met Keith \nCouch, a parent who has a daughter at Keene and a son at Boston \nCollege. Between his two kids, his annual tuition bill comes to \n$90,000. No wonder he is having trouble figuring out from where the \nmoney is going to come. He spends hours trying to figure out how his \nfamily will make college payments each month. He said loans help bridge \nthat gap.\n  One constituent, Erin, posted on my Facebook wall that her husband \nrecently completed medical assistant courses at Hesser College in \nManchester. He is due to start paying his student loans next month, but \nhe hasn't been able to find a job in his chosen field. Erin said that \nfamily finances are tight and if interest rates were to double on the \nloans they have, there is no way they would be able to pay them back.\n  The stories I have heard in New Hampshire are similar to the stories \nSenator Blumenthal told about Connecticut and what Senator Schumer has \nhad to say about New York and what we are hearing from students and \nfamilies across the country. Higher education is essential for economic \nopportunity and personal growth. It is equally essential to the \nprosperity of our country, and, most importantly, the prospect of \nhigher debt levels affects whether people choose to enter college to \nbegin with.\n  When I was in Plymouth last week at Plymouth State University, a \nstudent stood up and said: I want to teach history. Tell me why I \nshouldn't just drop out of college and be a mechanic. I said: Well, I \nlike teachers myself, and we need more of them. But in this rapidly \nchanging, highly competitive global economy, we should be doing \neverything we can to make sure college is more accessible to Americans \nso we don't have students across this country saying: Why shouldn't I \ndrop out if no one supports my getting a college education?\n  It is critical for all of us, and, unfortunately, high debt burdens \nhave serious consequences for individuals, for families, and for the \neconomy. Student loan debt affects where graduates live, the kinds of \ncareers they can pursue, whether they can start a new business, when \nthey can start a new family, when they can purchase a new home, and \nwhen they can start to save for retirement.\n  Our students deserve better. We need to get rid of any obstacles that \nare keeping our students from getting the education they need to \nsucceed. We should not put more obstacles in their way. We need to come \ntogether, Democrats and Republicans, to stop this increase in student \nloan interest rates and to do what is in the best interest of our \nfamilies and our young people who need that college education.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to rise today to support the \nStop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike of 2012. I cosponsored this \nbill because it extends the current interest rate of 3.4% for \nsubsidized Stafford Loans for the next school year. This interest rate \nreflects a record low for interest rates on Federal student loans, and \nthese loans can only go to students and families that demonstrate a \nneed for them; nearly 50% of the students that take advantage of \nsubsidized Stafford loans come from families with an annual income of \nless than $50,000. Subsidized Stafford loans help more than 7 million \nstudents attend an institution of higher education without worrying \nthat the interest on their loans will begin accruing while they are in \nschool. It helps more than 103,000 students in Maryland. Middle class \nfamilies are feeling stretched and stressed and if we fail to act, \nstudents could be facing an additional $1,000 in debt over the life of \ntheir loans.\n  It is important to note that we will not expand our Federal deficit, \nand we will help families not expand the family deficit, by keeping the \ninterest rate at 3.4 percent. Senator Reid's legislation offsets the \ncost of this legislation by closing a tax loophole enjoyed by \nindividuals seeking to avoid paying payroll taxes on their income. This \nwould only affect those who make more than $250,000 a year and simply \nrequires people who make any income from a professional service \nbusiness such as lobbying to pay taxes if more than 75 percent of the \nincome from that business comes from three or fewer shareholders.\n  I adamantly oppose the alternative proposal from House and Senate \nRepublicans that would repeal the Prevention and Public Health Fund \nauthorized by the Affordable Care Act. In the last year alone, that \nprevention fund has funded activities in my home state of Maryland to \npromote tobacco prevention, substance abuse prevention, mental health \nservices, and community programs to promote healthy living. The fund is \nalso used to invest in childhood immunizations to decrease the risk of \ndisease among children. In the future, the President plans to use this \nfund to support breast cancer screenings for more than 300,000 women \nand cervical cancer screenings for more than 280,000 women. Repealing \nthe prevention fund would not only\n\n[[Page S3032]]\n\nstrike an unnecessary blow to prevention activities aimed to improve \nthe lives of women and children, it would also promote increased health \ncare costs by eliminating strategic investments meant to prevent or \nmitigate chronic illnesses that can be expensive to treat.\n  Students will bless us if we are successful in keeping their student \nloan interest rates as low as possible. Getting a college education is \nthe core of the American dream and I am going to be sure that every \nstudent has access to that dream and make sure that when they graduate \ntheir first mortgage isn't their student debt. This legislation pending \nbefore us today should be passed in a swift, expeditious, uncluttered \nway. This bill is absolutely a great bill for students and it is a \ngreat bill for America. It gives our students access to the American \ndream. It gives our young people access to the freedom to achieve, to \nbe able to follow their talents, and to be able to achieve higher \neducation in whatever field they will be able to serve this country.\n  I urge the swift passage of Senator Reid's legislation to maintain \nthe current interest rate for subsidized Stafford loans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                                  EPA\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I will be introducing a bill \nin a minute called S. 3053, but as a predicate to that, let me talk \nagain about my ongoing investigation of the overreach of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  Certainly the Washington Post is right-on with their editorial. On \nMay 3, the Washington Post editorial board penned an editorial entitled \n``The EPA is earning a reputation for abuse.'' In this editorial, they \ndiscussed how former region 6 Administrator Al Armendariz's \n``philosophy of enforcement'' has severely hurt the EPA.\n  To refresh your memory, it was a couple of weeks ago at this very \npodium that I read the quotes I am about to quote again today. While \nthe Washington Post doesn't agree with me all the time, I was pleased \nto read that they saw that the ``crucify'' policy Mr. Armendariz \npurported in his visit to Dish, TX, clearly showed that he ``preferred \nto extract harsh punishments on an arbitrary number of firms to scare \nothers into cooperating.'' Further, the Washington Post editorial board \nsaw this attitude as both unjust and threatening to investors in energy \nprojects.\n  While Armendariz has resigned--he is gone now--his statements have \nundermined the legitimacy of the EPA's regulatory authorities. We know \nthat the policy of extracting harsh punishment on arbitrary individuals \nin order to scare others into cooperation was not just an inflated \nrhetoric. Mr. Armendariz followed through on his philosophy when he had \nthe EPA region 6 pursue a trumped-up emergency action against the \nnatural gas company Range Resources in Texas. The EPA is not using its \npowers fairly and is showing its enforcement is arbitrary, unreliable, \ncapricious, and unduly severe.\n  But the Post's editorial board didn't see Armendariz as an isolated \nincident. They also called out EPA's actions in another recent high-\nprofile misuse of power that has hurt the Agency's credibility.\n  The EPA insisted that an Idaho couple, the Sacketts, stop \nconstruction on a home because that violated the Clean Water Act. On \nMarch 21 the Supreme Court ruled unanimously--this was not a split \ndecision; it was unanimous, 9 to 0--that the EPA had exceeded its \nauthority in pursuing the Sacketts and has ensured that they and other \npeople who find themselves in similar situations can overcome the EPA's \nassertion of whether or not their property contains jurisdictional \nwetlands, without submitting to the permit process. A mere 2 days \nlater, the EPA was again called out for overreaching its authority on \nwater issues. Then on March 23 the U.S. district court ruled that the \nEPA overreached in revoking a permit to Arch Coal after the Army Corps \nof Engineers had already granted it. In quite a blow to the Agency, the \njudge said EPA's claim--and I am now quoting what the judge said in his \norder--``that section 404(c) grants it plenary authority to \nunilaterally modify or revoke a permit that has been duly issued by the \nCorps'' is a ``stunning power for an agency to aggregate to itself when \nthere is absolutely no mention of it in the statute.'' That is what the \ncourt said.\n  Yet, in the midst of scathing rebukes from the press and the courts, \nthe EPA is still acting as if everything is the same as it was before \nthese cases happened, and they are actively pursuing more regulatory \npower by attempting to vastly increase the scope of the Clean Water \nAct's reach. In fact, when discussing the results of the Sackett case \nat an American Law Institute-American Bar Association event on May 3 of \nthis year, Mark Pollins, Director of EPA's Water Enforcement Division, \nsaid, ``Internally it is the same old, same old.''\n  I plan to send a letter to Administrator Jackson addressing Mr. \nPollins' comments and trying to find out how an EPA official, in the \nface of a 9-to-0 Supreme Court decision, could say that the Agency is \nnot going to do anything different. And if the EPA is able to finalize \nits new Clean Air Act jurisdictional guidance, it will have given \nitself a whole new set of excuses for pushing the boundaries of the \nClean Water Act as far as possible. This continued overreach is why we \nnow have bicameral, bipartisan legislation introduced to stop this \ncurrent guidance overreach.\n\n  Let's take a moment and go back in time to where this all started. We \nmight remember a couple years ago Senator Feingold from Wisconsin and \nCongressman Oberstar over in the House introduced the Clean Water \nRestoration Act. The Clean Water Restoration Act removed the word \n``navigable.'' This act gave the Federal Government, through the EPA, \nthe jurisdiction over the navigable water. That is what the law was. \nBut they wanted to take out the word ``navigable'' and, therefore, the \nEPA would have jurisdiction over all land in the United States. It is \nvery simple. It was so unfair that not only did we defeat the Clean \nWater Restoration Act but the people defeated Senator Feingold in \nWisconsin and Congressman Oberstar, after they had been in Congress for \na long time. Obviously, this is something that is not popular. It is an \noverreach and everyone understands it.\n  Normally, when the Obama administration can't achieve what they want \nto achieve through legislation, they do it through regulations. We see \nthis in cap and trade right now. We saw the President try to get \nlegislation on cap and trade which amounted to a $300 billion to $400 \nbillion tax increase on the American people and it wouldn't have done \nany good or helped anyone. Yet it would have been the largest tax \nincrease in history. I go back and compare it with what they were \nattempting to do with the Clinton-Gore tax increase of 1993. That is \nwhere they raised the marginal rates, the capital gains tax, the death \ntax--this massive tax increase--a $32 billion tax increase. This will \nbe 10 times greater than that. Now they are trying to do what they \ncouldn't do with legislation through regulation. But that is because in \norder to undertake a Clean Water Act rulemaking, EPA would have to \nfollow a transparent process and engage in a public comment period as \nrequired by the Administrative Procedures Act.\n  For that reason, they didn't pursue that through regulations. Given \nhow unpopular their proposal has been, going through with the \nrulemaking would make it much more difficult to obtain the expanded \nFederal control they are clearly trying to pursue. By changing agency \npractice in this formal and nonregulatory way, they virtually ensure \nthat they will be able to formalize this agenda easily through future \nrulemaking. So what they couldn't achieve through legislation or, in \nthis case, through the proper rulemaking process, they are trying to do \nthrough guidance.\n  What is even more frustrating than the EPA's continued overreach is \nthat this new guidance would provide no improvement to water and would \nlikely hinder real progress on cleaning water. The guidance's broad \nreach and legalistic language would inevitably shift the balance of \nregulatory authority further away from States, which are better \nequipped to protect waters within their borders. Giving the Federal \nGovernment control over nearly all water features will not lead to \ncleaner water. It will, however, lead to tremendous uncertainty, \ntremendous confusion, and economic pain for farmers,\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\nenergy developers, small businesses, and State governments by saddling \nthem with more layers of expensive, onerous, and unnecessary Federal \nregulations. It is yet another Obama administration policy that will be \nall pain for virtually no environmental gain.\n  Congress has been explicitly clear with EPA that this new guidance is \nunacceptable. Last July I wrote a letter, along with Senator Roberts, \nthe ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and 39 of our \ncolleagues to Administrator Jackson, where we raised our concerns that \nthis document went far beyond mere guidance. EPA and the Corps of \nEngineers greatly expanded what can be considered jurisdictional waters \nthrough a slew of new and expanded definitions and through the changes \nto the applications and jurisdictional tests.\n  Administrator Jackson has said this guidance will increase the Clean \nWater Act's scope. In the economic analysis that accompanied the \nguidance, it stated that as few as 2 percent and as many as 17 percent \nof the nonjurisdictional determinations under current guidance would be \nconsidered jurisdictional using the expanded test under the new \nguidance. However, this analysis was only for the Army Corps making \ndredge-and-fill permit decisions when compared to current practice. The \nguidance will apply to the entire Clean Water Act, including the \nNational Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits, the Oil \nPollution Act and Spill Prevention Control, and Countermeasure plans, \nwater quality standards, and even State water quality certifications. \nBecause most States have delegated authority under the Clean Water Act, \nthis change in guidance will also result in a change in the \nresponsibilities of States in executing their responsibilities under \nthe Clean Water Act and a change in how individual citizens are \ngoverned by law.\n  So what we are talking about is what they have been unable to do with \nlegislation they were going to be doing with regulation. But in this \ncase, what they couldn't do with regulation because it would be too \ntransparent they are trying to do through guidance.\n  The finalized guidance document is currently at OMB for formal \ninteragency review before it is finalized. We don't know what changes \nhave been made, but based on a draft that was leaked to the press, it \ndoesn't appear that the document is substantially different from the \nproposed guidance document they put out for public comment last May. \nThis is the last step before this expansive document starts being used \nthroughout the country, and that is why I hope all my colleagues in the \nSenate on both sides of the aisle will join me in trying to stop it.\n  Working with Senator Barrasso, Senator Heller, Senator Sessions, and \nothers, we introduced S. 2245. We call it the Preserve the Waters of \nthe United States Act. It is a bill that stops the EPA from finalizing \nthe guidance and from using the guidance to make decisions about the \nscope of the Clean Water Act or to turn it into a rule. The House has \nalso acted with chairmen and ranking members of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure and Agriculture Committees introducing the bipartisan \nH.R. 4965. I applaud Mr. Mica and Mr. Rahall in this bipartisan effort, \nas well as Mr. Lucas and Mr. Peterson and Mr. Gibbs for their actions. \nThese bills do not change or roll back any current protections in the \nClean Water Act; they simply stop the EPA and the Corps of Engineers \nfrom moving forward and making these unprecedented regulatory changes \nthrough a guidance document.\n  The EPA needs to withdraw this guidance document immediately. If it \nwishes to make changes to the Clean Water Act, it should go through a \ncomplete and proper rulemaking process under the Administrative \nProcedures Act. That is why it is there, so people in America will know \nthe cost of what these regulations mean to them and what they do and do \nnot do. Why do it under the veil of guidance when they should be doing \nit out in the open? That is what we want. That is all we are asking \nfor.\n  I mentioned I am introducing a bill today.\n  (The remarks of Senator Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3053 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, yesterday Republican Senators voted to \nblock the bill to prevent the doubling of the Federal student loan \ninterest rate on July 1. As long as they continue their filibuster, \nthere is no clear way forward to prevent that devastating rate hike \nless than 2 months from now.\n  If that happens, more than 7.4 million American students will be \nrequired to pay an average of $1,000 more per year of school. This is \nespecially important to my State of Iowa--and it is important to all \nStates--where nearly 72 percent of Iowa's college graduates have \nstudent loan debt, the fourth highest percentage in the Nation. Those \nborrowers are carrying an average of $30,000 in student loan debt, \nwhich is the third highest in the Nation.\n  In floor debates this week, Republicans claimed that they, too, want \nto prevent the rate hike. I welcome their support. But if they want to \njoin with us in preventing the rate hike, why in the world won't they \nlet us proceed to the bill? That will give us all the opportunity to \ndebate the bill and offer amendments.\n  I call on my Republican friends, if they want to keep the interest \nrate hike from doubling on students, to call off the filibuster and \nlet's move ahead with the bill. I am not the only one who wants to end \nthis obstruction by our friends on the Republican side. I have heard \nfrom constituents in Iowa who are frustrated at the Senate's failure to \nact. This is a kitchen-table issue for middle-class Americans, families \nall across the country.\n  I have heard reports that over 500,000 signatures from students \naround the country have been delivered to the Hill to show their \nsupport for keeping the rate at 3.4 percent. I know many Senators have \ncome to the floor to share stories from their constituents about how \nthe interest rate hike would affect them. I will share a story I \nreceived from an Iowa student.\n\n       Dear Congressman, [or Senator, as the case may be] I am \n     writing you on behalf of myself, current college students, \n     and future college students everywhere. I recently re-\n     enrolled in college to further my education. This decision \n     came after much time and deep thought. The problem wasn't \n     that I didn't want to attend school, it was whether or not I \n     could afford to attend school.\n       I live on my own, hold a full time job that I previously \n     attended a technical school to obtain. This job supports me \n     fully, and as much as I love parts of my job, I know that my \n     decision to re-enroll in school to further my education was \n     the right decision for me.\n       . . . In the middle of all of this preparation, I came \n     across an article in the USA Today that said the Federal \n     Government might raise student loan interest rates. Not just \n     raise, but double them, unless Congress intervenes.\n       I could not believe what I was reading, and feel so \n     passionate about the subject that I had to write a letter to \n     you. I am already struggling on a daily basis to support \n     myself. I live paycheck to paycheck and often have to rely on \n     the savings account I worked so hard to save before \n     graduating high school, along with consistent help from my \n     parents and grandparents. I wish to be independent from this \n     help even though I am thankful that it is there.\n       This increase in interest rates on loans . . . was not only \n     disappointing, it was infuriating to me. This will have an \n     effect for many years beyond what it should and not only for \n     me.\n       I live in Stanwood, IA, a place that not many people have \n     heard of, and I commute the 35 miles to Cedar Rapids every \n     day for my job. . . .\n       So when I saw that these loans that I am relying on to \n     support me and fund my education were going to double, I was \n     heartbroken and I wonder what is wrong with my country? I am \n     very proud to be an American, and more so an Iowan. . . .\n       I believe that the one thing the USA has going for it: \n     supporting our future, but that is quickly fading in front of \n     my eyes. I hope that you read this and feel every ounce of \n     disappointment in our great country as I do, and do \n     everything in your power to not let the interest rate on \n     student loans increase on July 1.\n       I hope you can put faith in the American students who are \n     relying on these loans to\n\n[[Page S3034]]\n\n     educate themselves, and together get our country back on the \n     right track, not headed down the wrong one. Thank you so much \n     for your time, and I hope to hear great things from my \n     representatives soon.\n       Sincerely, a proud fellow Iowan.\n\n  This is just one of the many stories I have received from my \nconstituents, telling me how detrimental it would be if the rate were \nto double on July 1.\n  This increase is a looming reality for many students and families if \nthis Senate continues to do what it is doing--and that is to do nothing \nto bring the bill up and having Republicans filibuster it, and not even \nletting us proceed on it.\n  For the past 3 days, we have been hearing from Republicans that they \nwant to keep the interest rate at 3.4 percent, but they don't like how \nwe are paying for it in our bill. I have said many times that if they \ndon't like that--and our leader came out here, as many have, saying, \nlook, if my Republican friends don't like how we pay for it, let us get \non with the bill and they can offer their offset or pay-for. We can \nvote on it and they can vote on ours. But that is not acceptable to the \nRepublicans. They don't even want the bill to go forward.\n  We have been hearing from Republicans that our offset, which is \nclosing a loophole in the Tax Code that affects subchapter S \ncorporations--and I might add it only affects a very small sliver of \nsubchapter S corporations, very tightly drawn; they can't have more \nthan three shareholders. How about that. And you have to have more than \n$250,000 in income, and it pertains only to those subchapter S \ncorporations that provide certain kinds of professional services. In \nother words, it doesn't pertain to real estate, or manufacturing, or \nanything like that. It only has to do with certain professional \nservices, such as lawyers and accountants, people such as that.\n  Well, the Republicans say that if we do this--close that loophole--it \nwill hurt the ``job creators.'' How many times have I heard that, job \ncreators--that we are going to hurt small businesses. The other \nside would have you believe that we are doing this for political gain, \nthat somehow we Democrats are doing this for political gain. Well, if \nthat were the truth, why would we pick an offset, a pay-for, to fix a \nproblem that conservatives have railed against in the past? Yes, the \nproblem that we are trying to fix in subchapter S corporations is a \nproblem that conservative Republicans have railed against in the past. \nI want to refresh my colleagues' memories and set the record straight \non this issue of S corporations, the offset we have.\n\n  For starters, in 2004, the Wall Street Journal editorial page said \nthis on July 13, 2004:\n\n       Conservative Support for Closing the S Corp Tax Loophole.\n       Senator Edwards talks about the need to provide health care \n     for all, but that didn't stop him from using a clever tax \n     dodge [these are the words of the Wall Street Journal, not \n     mine] to avoid paying $591,000 into the Medicare system. \n     While making his fortune as a trial lawyer in 1995, he formed \n     what is known as a ``subchapter S'' corporation, with himself \n     as the sole shareholder. Instead of taking his $26.9 million \n     in earnings directly in the following four years, he paid \n     himself a salary of $360,000 a year and took the rest as \n     corporate dividends.\n       Since salary is subject to 2.9 percent Medicare tax, but \n     dividends aren't, that meant he shielded 90 percent of his \n     income. That's not necessarily illegal, but dodging such a \n     large chunk of employment tax skates perilously close to the \n     line . . .\n       CPA Magazine lists it as number 11 of its 15 best \n     underutilized tax loopholes.\n\n  I ask, is the Wall Street Journal in favor of--what did they say?--\nhurting job creators? Are they in favor of that? Is the Wall Street \nJournal in favor of ``raising taxes on the very businesses we are \ncounting on to hire these young people,'' as the minority leader said \non Monday? I repeat, we limit it to only three shareholders. They are \ngoing to count on them to hire these young people, he said. What is the \nminority leader talking about? That same year, in 2004, the late \nconservative columnist Robert Novak wrote:\n\n       It is one of the last loopholes left in the Internal \n     Revenue Code, and it is a big one.\n\n  Here is the whole statement:\n\n       How can John Edwards explain setting up a dummy \n     corporation--subchapter S--to avoid paying an estimated \n     $290,000 in Medicare taxes in the 2 years before he ran for \n     the Senate? This is a classic subchapter S corporation \n     devised to shelter income, mainly for professionals, such as \n     lawyers (and also syndicated columnists, but not me). It is \n     one of the last loopholes left in the Internal Revenue Code, \n     and it is a big one.\n\n  That is Robert Novak. Has anyone ever questioned his conservative \ncredentials?\n  Sean Hannity said this:\n\n       Hey, John Edwards is worth, what, $30 million to $40 \n     million, set up a sub-S corporation to keep him from paying \n     Medicare taxes on 90 percent of his income, and then he \n     lectures the rest of us how Medicare is going broke.\n\n  Finally, Rush Limbaugh himself said this:\n\n       . . . and he [Senator Edwards] has also compounded that by \n     structuring his own personal finances to avoid paying \n     Medicare taxes on 90 percent of the nearly $27 million he \n     earned over four years.\n\n  I ask my Republican colleagues, are Robert Novak, Sean Hannity, Rush \nLimbaugh, and the Wall Street Journal all in support of raising taxes? \nAre they all in support of killing job creators? These are their \nstatements. That is the record.\n  For the last several years, conservative Republicans have been going \nafter this loophole, until they obviously found a Democrat who used it, \nJohn Edwards. Lots of people use it, a lot of lawyers and accountants \nand doctors. A lot of different kinds of professionals have used this \nloophole to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.\n  Here is another classic case where the Republicans say we are using \nthis for political gain. Wait a minute. They are the ones who have been \ngoing after this loophole for years. We said: Hey, we finally have \nsomething on which we can agree. The Wall Street Journal and all these \nother people are saying we have to close this loophole. We have the \nopportunity to do so, and in doing so raise the money both to help \nMedicare and Social Security and to keep the interest rates on student \nloans at 3.4 percent. Yet the Republicans will not even allow us to \nbring it to the floor.\n\n  So who is playing politics, I ask? Who is playing politics?\n  Well, as I have said before, and I will say again, we have come here \nwith a serious offset--one, as I said, that has been supported--at \nleast closing this loophole has been supported--by conservative \nRepublicans in the past. If anything, it is worse today than it was in \n2004. More and more people are finding out about how they do this. They \nform this little subchapter S corporation and avoid paying their taxes. \nIt is time to close that.\n  We came up with a serious offset we thought would be acceptable on \nboth sides because of the history. We are ready to do this now--ease \nthe concern of so many students and families across the country. The \nRepublicans came and wanted to pay for it by eliminating the Prevention \nand Public Health Fund. They want to eliminate the one thing that is \ngoing to prevent obesity, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes \nin the future and save us a lot of money. They want to end that and \ntake that money and put it into keeping the interest rates low. They \nare pitting the low interest rates for students against the health care \nof children--immunizations for kids--which is what we use this \nprevention fund for. And for diabetes prevention. That is what we use \nthe fund for. They want to take that away, pitting students against the \nhealth of our country. That is not a serious offer. That is not a \nserious offer by the Republicans.\n  That alternative is going nowhere. Besides, the President has said he \nwould veto that. So I ask my colleagues on the other side to quit \nplaying politics. Quit playing politics with this. Let's bring it up \nfor a vote.\n  Maybe they should listen to the Wall Street Journal, and the now \ndeceased Novak and Fox News and even Rush Limbaugh and Hannity. Let's \nclose this loophole once and for all and do something good with it. \nLet's do something good with it. Keep the interest rates low for our \nstudents in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the day I flipped on the TV that we \nhave in\n\n[[Page S3035]]\n\nour offices and looked at it as often as I could. I was very impressed \nwith my colleagues who came and talked about why it is so important \nthat we not have an increase in the interest rate for student loans. I \nhave been very happy with my Democratic colleagues who have come here \nand made such a profound case. But I listened also to what the \nRepublicans had to say, and it is beyond my comprehension how they can \ncome to the floor with a straight face and say what they have said. I \nhave listened as my Republican colleagues have come to the Senate floor \nto blame Democrats for stalling legislation to keep college affordable \nfor 7 million people throughout our great country. The claim is pretty \nrich considering that Republicans voted unanimously yesterday to \nfilibuster this legislation. What is a filibuster? It is stopping us \nfrom going to the legislation.\n  Our bill would prevent 7 million students from paying $1,000 more on \ntheir loans. With college already unaffordable for far too many young \npeople, Democrats believe we should be doing all we can to provide \naccess to higher education. That is what these student loans are all \nabout.\n  Republicans have repeatedly claimed they support efforts to support \nlegislation to keep loans from doubling this summer, but they sure have \na funny way of showing it with this endless filibuster. Today, \nRepublicans have said that Democrats should negotiate a way out of this \nstalemate--again, a very strange reasoning. It is hard to negotiate \nwithout a partner.\n  Every Tuesday after we do our weekly caucus meetings, I go to what we \ncall the Ohio Clock. One of the reporters said: Your Republican \ncolleague Senator McConnell said you should negotiate on this issue \nwith Speaker Boehner.\n  Now, how do you like that one, that I, the leader in the Senate, \nshould go to the Republican House and start negotiating with them? That \nis a strange, strange way of doing business.\n  The Republicans claim their only objection to our legislation is how \nit is paid for--by closing a tax loophole that allows wealthy Americans \nto dodge taxes they already owe. That is what we feel should happen. We \ndon't believe it is a tax increase--just that people should pay what \nthey are supposed to pay. They now have a way of avoiding taxes. Rich \naccountants and lawyers avoid it by claiming they are going to pay \ndividends and not ordinary income. It is not fair to everyone else.\n  So if the Republicans object to this, fine. Democrats are willing to \nconsider alternative offsets. In fact, we are even willing to vote on \nthe House Republicans' own proposed offset. Now, that is a doozy, the \noffset from the Republicans coming from the House, which takes away \nmoney for preventive care for virtually everybody. The leading causes \nof death in America are diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. They want \nto take away preventive programs to stop heart disease. And, as we \nknow, there are programs now--mammograms, for example--that stop people \nfrom having to get too far behind with the dread of breast cancer. That \nis their offset. We strongly oppose that alternative, but we are \nwilling to vote on it. We are not running from it. And once their \nproposal to slash programs that save money and lives fails on a floor \nvote--and it will fail--we Democrats are still willing to consider \nother options to pay for this legislation. My Republican colleagues on \nthe other hand have refused to consider alternative ways to pay for a \nbill they claim they support.\n  So I say to my Republican colleagues, let us bring this bill to the \nfloor. If Republicans are so interested in negotiating a solution, they \nshould be willing to take that first step. Once the bill is on the \nfloor, we can debate it, we can amend it with an offset on which both \nsides can agree. But until Republicans end their obstructionist \nfilibuster, there is no path forward.\n  So for my Republican colleagues to come down here and say ``we \nsupport this legislation,'' I repeat, what a strange way of supporting \nthis legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/09/senate-section/article/S3035-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I was in Tazewell County--which is in the \narea of Pekin, in East Peoria, IL--last week at the Veterans \nAdministration Commission.\n  I talked to a number of vets from the Vietnam war and other \nconflicts. We talked about obvious questions: veterans' unemployment, \nwhat was happening with disability payments, education for veterans, \ntopics that most vets are very concerned about. They face some pretty \nsignificant challenges, as we know.\n  We promise these men and women that if they put up their hand and \nswear that they will risk their life for America, we swear we will be \nthere when they come home. It is that basic. We have to keep our word. \nAs a nation, we have a sacred pledge to take care of veterans who \nserve. I take it very seriously--I think both parties do--and we \nshould.\n  We also need to honor those who have lost their lives. Just a few \nweeks ago, we buried another soldier from that county. There was a huge \nturnout at the memorial service. One particular local resident was \ndoing his part to honor our fallen heroes in an extraordinary way. I \nlearned about him when I visited Tazewell County. He is from Little \nYork, IL, and he is known as the Flag Man.\n  Larry Eckhardt is not a veteran, and there are no servicemembers in \nhis family. But in 2006, Larry Eckhardt attended a funeral for a \nsoldier from his area who had died. He said, ``There aren't enough \nflags here.'' So on his own, Larry bought 150 American flags and \nstarted hauling them in his truck to military funerals all across my \nState. As he puts it, ``I just honestly don't believe there's any such \nthing as too many flags for a soldier.''\n  Larry's inventory of 150 flags has grown to 2,200 flags, and he can \nline them up to 14 miles of a fallen soldier's final journey.\n  Traveling in his old 1999 Ford van, stripped down to one seat to make \nroom for all the flags, he has now graced more than 80 funerals from \nWisconsin to Kentucky and Iowa to Indiana and certainly in his home \nState of Illinois. Last year, Larry drove 40,000 miles with his flags \nto these funerals. He covers all the costs out of his own pocket and a \ncouple donations from friends. When asked why he does it, he simply \nsays, ``It's my way of giving back.''\n  Larry rarely uses the word ``I.'' He is quick to praise all the \nvolunteers--often organized by veterans organizations--who help him \nstake the flags in the ground along the funeral procession routes. \n``Without them,'' he says, ``I couldn't get them all done.''\n  In one instance over a long weekend, dozens of volunteers helped \nLarry install the 2,200 flags to honor a 23-year-old Army sergeant \nduring his funeral. After the service, volunteers helped pack up the \nflags for the next stop. Volunteers ranged from kids as young as 3, \nassisting their parents, to an 83-year-old woman who wanted to help out \nin Orchardville, IL. When she was asked her reason for weathering the \ntough January Illinois cold to help, she said, ``We can only bake so \nmany tuna casseroles.''\n  This story is what America and the State of Illinois are all about. \nIt is the common man, such as Larry Eckhardt, following his heart and \ntaking the initiative to do something extraordinary for our fallen \nheroes, and it is about a community rising to the occasion to lend its \nsupport and honor those who deserve so much of our gratitude. Larry may \nhave said it best when he humbly stated:\n\n       This is my feeble attempt to say thank you to every soldier \n     who has ever served and fought to protect the freedoms that I \n     have.\n\n  This speech on the floor of the Senate is my feeble attempt to say \nthanks to you, Larry, and the countless Americans just like you who \nstep up and do their part to show our veterans how much their service \nmeans to each and every one of us. They embody the enduring spirit and \nvalues that make America great and they make me proud to serve in the \nSenate and humbled to represent my State of Illinois.\n  Thank you, Larry, and thanks to all the other Americans who are doing\n\n[[Page S3036]]\n\ntheir part to support our veterans and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/09/senate-section/article/S3036-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO COACH FITZGERALD\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise today to recognize Northwestern University head \nfootball coach Patrick Fitzgerald for his leadership and service to the \ncommunity. Patrick ``Coach Fitz'' Fitzgerald, a lifelong Illinoisan, \nhas enjoyed a long and distinguished relationship with Northwestern \nUniversity.\n  He completed his undergraduate studies and played football at \nNorthwestern, where he racked up several worthy achievements. A two-\ntime first-team All-American, he won the Nagurski and Bednarik Awards \ntwice, was named Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year and Linebacker of \nthe Year, and received the George Ballentine, Jr., Memorial Leadership \nAward.\n  As Northwestern University's head football coach, Pat Fitzgerald has \namassed an impressive record, leading the Wildcats to four consecutive \npostseason games and 5 consecutive years of eligibility for postseason \ngames. And his leadership isn't confined to the football field. His \ncommitment to academic achievement among Northwestern's football \nscholar-athletes has led to many being named Academic All-Big Ten \nstudents and the school's ranking among the Nation's leaders in annual \ngraduation rates.\n  Coach Fitzgerald has been recognized for his work ethic, integrity, \nand positive attitude. He was designated one of college football's top \nrecruiters and serves on the Ethics Committee of the American Football \nCoaches Association and USA Football's Tackle Advisory Committee.\n  Pat and his wife Stacy are active at Northwestern University and in \nthe Chicago community, participating in many charitable activities, toy \ncollection drives, and school health and wellness programs.\n  I congratulate Coach Pat Fitzgerald on the many successes of the \nWildcats' football program and thank him for his service to one of our \nfinest schools and the broader Chicago community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/09/senate-section/article/S3036-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3036-S3037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THE WHITAKER FAMILY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a family who has \nchosen to live and work in the small town of Cromona, KY, which they \nhave come to love over the years. The Whitaker family has successfully \nowned and operated Superior Printing and Publishing Company, Inc. since \n1958. Three generations of Whitakers have been involved in the \nproceedings of the company, with a fourth learning the family trade as \nthey grow.\n  Superior Printing was started as a local printing operation by \nCharles and Bobbie Whitaker. They began the business in a remote part \nof Letcher County, KY, in a town called Cromona. The small town now has \na population of 665 people, but the success of Superior Printing has \nfar surpassed the boundaries of little Cromona. The company has become \none of the most popular printing firms in the tristate area, offering \nbusiness in Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n  You may be asking yourself, how does a company in such a small town \nbecome so successful? Charles's son, Mike Whitaker, president of \nSuperior Printing, thinks it is due to their customer service. He has \nsaid that the only difference between Superior and the larger firms in \nmetropolitan areas is the family atmosphere that Superior provides. \nSuperior employees have love and pride for their hometown and home \nState, and they don't try to hide it.\n  Superior provides services that promote the local economy and the \nentities within the local economy alike. They offer professional color \nprinting that has been known to help all of the local schools in the \narea with various things like sports programs and bulletins. They also \nare a big distributor of print for local fundraisers and fundraising \ngroups. The Whitakers have also recently just began printing hardback \nbooks--something that isn't common in most local printing firms. Mike \nbelieves that the new hardback binding will help local authors be able \nto easily print and publish their books. With some of the amazing \nartistic talent I have seen come out of the Bluegrass State, I am \nanxious to see some of the works by Kentucky's own authors that will \ncome from this new way to print and publish.\n  Not only does the Whitaker family run a successful printing and \npublishing business, but they keep busy with providing Letcher County \nwith the news in their own paper, the News-Press. The Whitaker family \nis devoted to keeping the locals of Letcher County informed about what \nis going on in the county, State, and country, further proving that the \nWhitakers are truly focused on bettering themselves and those around \nthem.\n  Charles and his wife Bobbie are the proud parents of Mike, who has \ntwo sons, Paul and Nick. Paul is a U.S. Army veteran who has completed \ntwo tours of Active Duty in Iraq, while Nick has just recently \ngraduated from Eastern Kentucky University. Both Paul and Nick are \nplanning on staying in Letcher County so that they can be close to \ntheir family and local community.\n  Whether it be creating a business that provides a convenient and \nprofessional service to the local community, making a conscience effort \nto support the local economy with their services, informing the \ncitizens of Letcher County on the news, or helping many undiscovered \nKentucky authors and artists get the exposure they deserve, the \nWhitaker family of Cromona, KY, have made a contribution to their State \nthat will not go unnoticed. I am inspired to see an entire family give \nin so many ways to their local community.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask at this time for my colleagues in \nthe Senate to join me in recognizing the Whitaker family of Cromona, \nKY. There was recently an article published in Eastern Kentucky's local \nperiodical magazine, the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, highlighting \nthe hard work of the Whitaker family. I ask unanimous consent that said \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, Nov. 2011]\n\n         Superior Printing: Family Pride in Each and Every Job\n\n       As you wind along State Route 805 in northern Letcher \n     County, you may not think there's much going on. But Cromona, \n     Kentucky (population 665), is home to one of the finest print \n     shops in the tri-state. Established in 1958 by Charles and \n     Bobbie Whitaker, Superior Printing and Publishing Company, \n     Inc. is a thriving, family-owned business with three \n     generations of Whitakers working and a fourth generation \n     expected to ``watch and learn.''\n       Charles and Bobbie Whitaker's older son, Mike, is the \n     president of the company and currently sees to its day-to-day \n     operations. The company offers all the expected print shop \n     products and services like business forms, letterheads and \n     envelopes, but what is surprising is that it also houses the \n     region's only four-color, sheet-fed press capable of printing \n     up to a 19-by-26 sheet.\n       ``The installation of the press in 2008 has increased our \n     production capabilities as well as the quality of products \n     that we can offer,'' said Mike Whitaker. ``Local firms no \n     longer have to rely upon faraway print houses for their \n     color-printing needs. We're very competitive with the big, \n     out-of-town firms so we can save our customers time and \n     money. Most of our customers really appreciate the \n     convenience of having us close by, and they understand how \n     important it is to keep business here at home when they \n     can.''\n       Mike explained how their press and booklet maker, which \n     automatically collates, folds, staples, and trims books and \n     magazines, has boosted the company's production of programs \n     local schools use as fundraisers. ``Last fall we produced \n     football programs for 16 different schools in Kentucky and \n     Virginia. Our jobs range from full-color brochures and rack \n     cards for the tourism industry to flyers, multi-page \n     newsletters, magazines and books. In fact, more than 500 \n     businesses throughout the region have turned to us for their \n     printing needs.''\n       Since the press purchase, the Whitakers have added hardback \n     book-binding capabilities to the business. ``This is new to \n     us, and we are just getting started producing hardback books \n     in small and large quantities,'' Mike said. He is especially \n     proud of a leather-bound project utilizing the new hardback \n     book-binding equipment. ``With the growing number of local \n     authors, we are excited to offer both soft- and hardback book \n     bindings to our customers.''\n       In addition to commercial printing, the Whitakers own and \n     operate the News-Press, a newspaper based in Letcher County. \n     The conservative-based newspaper has promoted the coal \n     industry, faith and family for over 50 years.\n       Offering quality products at competitive prices is the mark \n     of any successful business, and Superior Printing is no \n     exception. ``Perhaps the only difference between our firm and \n     one from a metropolitan area is the\n\n[[Page S3037]]\n\n     sense of family pride that goes into each and every job,'' \n     Mike said. ``We may have to work a little harder at getting \n     our raw materials such as paper, plates, and ink, but we make \n     up for it with the satisfaction that we are able to live and \n     work in the place we love, here in eastern Kentucky.''\n       Mike Whitaker's sentiments are echoed by his sons, Paul and \n     Nick, who both work in the business. Paul is a U.S. Army \n     veteran with two tours of duty in Iraq behind him and is \n     anxious to spend the remainder of his adult life near his \n     home. Nick is a recent graduate of Eastern Kentucky \n     University who chose to stay in the area to be near family as \n     well. Both plan to raise their families much the same way \n     they were raised in Letcher County.\n       If you have a print order for Superior Printing, you may \n     want to call it in or perhaps email it. If you want to stop \n     by the printing company to place your order, call ahead for \n     directions. It is a little hard to find.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/09/senate-section/article/S3037-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TAIWAN'S PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATION\n\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Taiwan has remained in Alaska's top 20 export markets for \nthe past 15 years. Alaska's exports to the country have totaled more \nthan $22 million in sectors such as energy, forest products, machinery, \nand seafood products. In addition, Taiwan is one of Alaska's three \nsister states or provinces, and it is my hope that we will continue \nthis sister-state exchange for many years to come.\n  We witnessed during President Ma's first years in office his \ndiligence in dealing with economic and international challenges, and \nthe upcoming 4 years for President Ma will continue to be challenging. \nI am confidant President Ma will overcome difficulties and serve his \nnation to the best of his ability.\n  Once again, I offer my congratulations to President Ma, and I wish \nhim all the success in his future endeavors, and for the future of \nTaiwan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/09/senate-section/article/S3037-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL SCHOOL NURSE DAY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor National School \nNurse Day. Today we recognize the contributions that school nurses make \nevery day to improve the health and learning outcomes of our Nation's \nchildren, especially as our children face more challenging chronic \nhealth issues than ever before. A top priority of this Nation should be \nensuring that our children have a healthy and successful future. School \nnurses make this vision a reality each day. Quite simply, healthy \nchildren learn better and are more likely to become successful members \nof society.\n  In New York there are about 3,700 school nurses who are serving our \nstudents out of the more than 76,000 nationwide. School nurses provide \na non-negotiable value to schools, families, communities, and this \nNation as a whole. By keeping children healthy, in school, and ready to \nlearn, school nurses save money and save lives. Every teacher deserves \nto stay in the classroom and focus on educational outcomes, and every \nparent deserves to be able to go to work and send his or her child to \nschool with a nurse who will keep his or her child safe and healthy. \nSchool nurses have the knowledge, skills and judgment to manage \npotentially emergent situations and provide daily care for students \nwith increasing chronic health conditions, ranging from asthma to \nchildhood obesity to Type-2 diabetes to severe food allergies. Research \nshows that when a full-time school nurse is present, student attendance \nrates increase and hospital utilization rates decrease. The school \nnurse also plays a vital role in promoting prevention and wellness, \nfrom detecting outbreaks of communicable diseases, such as H1N1, and \ntaking action to prevent cases from developing to administering \nimmunizations and ensuring students are compliant with regulations. \nEvery day, school nurses are on the front lines, providing access and \ndelivering health care services to our Nation's children.\n  In 1897, after several outbreaks of infectious diseases that affected \nthe New York City schoolchildren, the city's department of health \nappointed the first doctors to examine students for contagious \ndiseases. With the concerns over uneducated and unhealthy youth \ngrowing, Lina Rogers Struthers became the Nation's first school nurse. \nThe impact of nursing services proved dramatic, and after only 1 month \nthe city voted to set aside money to employ trained nurses in its \nschools.\n  Today, the National Association of School Nurses celebrates the \nspecialized practice of school nursing, acknowledging that school \nnurses advance the well-being, academic success and life-long \nachievement and health of students. The American Academy of Pediatrics \nhas also reaffirmed the crucial role of school nurses ``in the seamless \nprovision of comprehensive health services to children and youth.'' \n``The Role of the School Nurse in Providing School Health Services,'' \nAAP, Pediatrics, Vol. 121, No. 5, May 1, 2008, pp. 1052 1056.\n  National School Nurse Day highlights the need for a full-time nurse \nin every school, every day--which is why I have introduced a bill, the \nStudent-to-School Nurse Ratio Improvement Act of 2012, S. 2047. This \nlegislation would help lower the ratios of students to school nurses \nand evaluate the correlation between access to professional student \nhealth services and improved educational outcomes. This Nation must \ninvest in programs and services that seek to improve the health and \nwell-being outcomes of children, which include supporting school \nnurses.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing today \nas National School Nurse Day so we may continue to honor school nurses \nand the care they provide to students day in and day out, paving the \npath for a healthier and more successful future for all of our Nation's \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/09/senate-section/article/S3037-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3037-S3038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING OHIO HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor 369 high school \nseniors in eight northeast Ohio counties for their commendable decision \nto enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. Of these 369 seniors from 128 high \nschools in 87 towns and cities, 83 will enter the Army, 174 will enter \nthe Marine Corps, 25 will enter the Navy, 30 will enter the Air Force, \n4 will enter the Coast Guard, and 53 will enter our Ohio Army National \nGuard. In the presence of their parents/guardians, and high school \ncounselors, military leaders, city and business leaders, all 369 will \nbe recognized on May 10, 2012 by ``Our Community Salutes of Northeast \nOhio.''\n  Later this month, these young men and women will join many of their \nclassmates in celebration of their high school graduation. At a time \nwhen many of their peers are looking forward to pursuing vocational \ntraining or college degrees, or are uncertain about their future, these \nyoung men and women instead have chosen to dedicate themselves to \nmilitary service in defense of our country.\n  Naturally, many may be anxious about the uncertainties that may await \nthem as members of the Armed Forces.

Montoya on the occasion of his retirement as Adjutant General \nof the New Mexico National Guard, and to thank him for his 30 years of \noutstanding service to our Nation. General Montoya has served our \ncountry well, both as a soldier and as a civilian, and New Mexico and \nour Nation are grateful for his efforts and service.\n  General Montoya began his distinguished career as an enlisted member \nof Battery A, 4th Battalion, 200th Air Defense Artillery in Raton, NM. \nHe completed Officer Candidate School and was commissioned in 1983. \nDuring his 9 years as Adjutant General of the New Mexico National \nGuard, General Montoya helped train over 9,000 National Guard men and \nwomen.\n  I also want to thank General Montoya for working so well with my \nstaff and me to effectively support the critical missions of the \nNational Guard, our servicemembers, and their families. The New Mexico \nNational Guard has been instrumental in protecting our country and its \ninterests. Under General Montoya's leadership, the New Mexico National \nGuard has maintained the lowest casualty rate of any State during the \nconflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan with one combat casualty out of 9,000 \ndeployments.\n\n[[Page S3039]]\n\n  General Montoya has also been a tireless advocate for the National \nGuard Counterdrug Program, which provides critical assistance in \nsecuring the border and disrupting drug trafficking activities. The New \nMexico National Guard has also proved to be a successful partner in \nnatural disaster response, including numerous wildfires and the extreme \ncold experienced by parts of the State last year. New Mexico has a long \nand proud history of military service, and we are honored to have many \nliving testaments to American bravery in our State.\n  Knowing his dedication to public service, I am sure General Montoya \nwill continue to play an important role in contributing to our country \nfor years to come. Mr. President, please accept my best wishes for \nGeneral Montoya and his family as he begins the next chapter in his \nlife. I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/09/senate-section/article/S3039-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMENDING UTAH'S ACADEMY NOMINEES\n\n Mr. LEE.

David Cox, the recipient of \nthe 2012 Yitzhak Rabin Public Service Award.\n  This award is given out by the American Friends of the Yitzhak Rabin \nCenter each year to individuals who reflect Prime Minister Rabin's \nlegacy of peace, leadership, and public service. Having come to know \nand appreciate J.

David has worked tirelessly to ensure that Federal employees \nhere in Washington, D.C. and across the nation enjoy the dignity, fair \npay, and safe working environment that they deserve. Based upon the \nnumber of leadership positions he has been elected to by his fellow \nFederal workers, it is clear that they approve of his efforts. In the \npast, he has served as Executive Vice-President of the AFGE National \nVeterans Affairs Council, President of AFGE Local 1738 in North \nCarolina, and Co-Chair of the Department of Veterans' Affairs National \nPartnership Council. In addition to his role as National Secretary-\nTreasurer, he currently is vice co-chair of the AFL CIO's Union \nVeterans Council, vice-president of North Carolina State AFL CIO, and \nwas appointed by President Obama to serve on the Federal Salary Council \nand the Federal Prevailing wage council.\n  J.

He served \nour nation's veterans for 23 years before moving on to AFGE in 2006. As \nChairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have come to value J. \nDavid as an important advocate for veterans as well as VA's Federal \nworkforce. J. David has testified before us several times over recent \nyears and has established himself as a key asset to the Committee. \nThroughout his testimony, J. David has always sought to make sure that \nthe doctors, nurses, and other health professionals at VA have the \nresources they need to provide the best possible care to our veterans. \nIn particular, his vocal support for assured funding and VA budget \nreform help to lead to the current 2-year appropriations process that \nVA uses today.\n  I am grateful for J.

In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to the actions of the \nGovernment of Syria declared in Executive Order 13338 of May 11, 2004, \nas modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in \nExecutive Order 13399 of April 25, 2006, Executive Order 13460 of \nFebruary 13, 2008, Executive Order 13572 of April 29, 2011, Executive \nOrder 13573 of May 18, 2011, Executive Order 13582 of August 17, 2011, \nExecutive Order 13606 of April 22, 2012, and Executive Order 13608 of \nMay 1, 2012, is to continue in effect beyond May 11, 2012.\n  While the Syrian regime has reduced the number of foreign fighters \nbound for Iraq, the regime's own brutality and repression of its \ncitizens who have been calling for freedom and a representative \ngovernment endangers not only the Syrian people themselves, but could \nyield greater instability throughout the region. The Syrian regime's \nactions and policies, including obstructing the Lebanese government's \nability to function effectively, pursuing chemical and biological \nweapons, and supporting terrorist organizations, continue to pose an \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign \npolicy, and economy of the United States. For these reasons, I have \ndetermined that it is necessary to continue in effect the national \nemergency declared with respect to this threat and to maintain in force \nthe sanctions to address this national emergency.\n  In addition, the United States condemns the Asad regime's use of \nbrutal violence and human rights abuses and calls on the Asad regime to \nstep aside and immediately begin a transition in Syria to a political \nprocess that will forge a credible path to a future of greater freedom, \ndemocracy, opportunity, and justice. The United States will consider \nchanges in the composition, policies, and actions of the Government of \nSyria in determining whether to continue or terminate this national \nemergency in the future.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 9, 2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/09/senate-section/article/S3040-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 1:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1302.

A bill to encourage responsible homeowners to refinance \nmortgages, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n[[Page S3044]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nExpanding Refinancing Opportunities Act of 2012.\n  This bill will allow homeowners who are struggling to stay in their \nhomes to refinance their loans at today's historically low mortgage \nrates.\n  The administration's current refinancing programs are designed to \nhelp homeowners whose loans are guaranteed by Federal housing agencies. \nThe problem is, those programs do nothing to help homeowners whose \nloans are owned by banks and mortgage trusts.\n  This bill would create a fund in the Federal Housing Administration \nthat would allow underwater homeowners whose loans are not guaranteed \nby the GSEs or FHA to refinance into today's low mortgage rates. The \nFHA would be able to insure these loans, greatly reducing the interest \nrates charged by lenders.\n  Currently, these homeowners are completely locked out of refinancing \nand are not being served by the private markets.\n  A homeowner paying 7 percent interest on their mortgage could reduce \ntheir interest rate by 2.5 percent or more through this program.\n  The average American homeowner could save up to three thousand \ndollars a year in lower interest payments.\n  The Expanding Refinancing Opportunities Act of 2012 is modeled after \na proposal President Obama outlined in his State of the Union address \nin February.\n  Eligibility requirements for this new program are very \nstraightforward.\n  Homeowners must be current on their mortgage. They must meet a \nminimum credit score. Their loan must be under the FHA conforming loan \nlimit. They must be living in a single-family, owner-occupied home that \nis their principal residence.\n  Additionally, the program requires that loans not be higher than 140 \npercent of a home's value. Housing data shows that homeowners with \nloan-to-value ratios under 140 percent are significantly less likely to \ndefault than those with higher ratios.\n  An added benefit of the 140 percent loan-to-value limit is that it \ncould encourage lenders to write down the principal amount owed on the \nmortgage to allow homeowners to qualify for participation. This would \nbe tremendously helpful for homeowners whose home values have fallen \ndramatically after the collapse of the housing bubble.\n  Some will criticize this proposal, suggesting the government must get \nout of the housing market for it to recover.\n  I believe the government can play a vital role in making sure that \nhome values don't continue their steep declines. Robert Shiller, the \nnoted housing bear and respected housing economist who publishes the \nclosely watched Case-Shiller housing index, believes that home prices \nhave reached normal levels.\n  To those who would oppose this bill, I ask: how much further would \nyou have home values decline?\n  While many economic indicators are increasing, falling home prices \nand foreclosures continue to burden the economy. Here is a quick \ninventory of the state of America's homeowners:\n  Case-Shiller found home prices in February rising for the first time \nin 10 months, although that gain was a nominal 0.2 percent.\n  Nationally, more than 11 million homeowners, or 23 percent, are \nupside down on their mortgage, meaning they owe more than the value of \ntheir home. Almost 30 percent of homes in California are underwater.\n  Median home prices are at levels not seen since the late 1990s, with \nthe gains in the intervening years completely wiped out. Home values on \naverage have dropped by more than 30%, with $7 trillion in household \nwealth lost.\n  And Core Logic found that home prices increased 0.6 percent last \nmonth, but are still down 0.6 percent from a year ago.\n  Many housing economists believe the market is at its bottom, but that \ndoesn't mean we are out of the woods. Further increases in foreclosures \nwould undoubtedly put further downward pressure on home prices, which \ncould further threaten underwater homeowners and feed into a vicious \nnegative cycle.\n  This is also a matter of fairness.\n  When homeowners take on a mortgage, they have no control over whether \ntheir bank will slice-and-dice that loan, selling it to third-party \ninvestors. If that happens, chances of refinancing into lower interest \nrates plummet.\n  I have worked closely with the administration to make sure this added \nresponsibility does not increase the financial risk to the FHA.\n  The Expanding Refinancing Opportunities Act would create a new \ninsurance fund at the FHA, totally separate from the existing mortgage \ninsurance fund that is currently under-capitalized.\n  The new fund would receive its own appropriation and would be audited \nseparately from the existing mortgage insurance fund. Furthermore, I \nhave worked to put safeguards in place to reduce FHA's risk. Most \nnotably, homeowners must be current on their mortgages in order to \nparticipate.\n  Finally, the cost of the new program would be completely offset by a \n0.1 percent increase in guarantee fees for loans backed by Fannie and \nFreddie in 2022.\n  The benefits of this proposal are clear: Refinancing into lower \ninterest rates could save the average homeowner upwards of $3,000 a \nyear.\n  Recent statistics show that the expanded refinancing program the \nadministration announced in November is seeing tangible results. \nAccording to the Mortgage Bankers Association, refinance applications \nhave jumped by as much as 70 percent in some of the hardest-hit States.\n  Clearly, efforts to expand refinancing opportunities are working. \nSimilar benefits should be afforded to those homeowners whose loans--\nthrough no fault of their own--are not insured by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Beyond providing relief to American families, savings on mortgage \npayments would have a broader benefit for the economy.\n  Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has \nmaintained an extremely low interest rate policy to encourage the \navailability of affordable credit.\n  There is no question that these measures have had an effect.\n  The stock market is climbing again after falling off a cliff in late \n2008.\n  Mortgage rates have fallen to near-historic lows, recently dipping \nbelow 4 percent.\n  Consumers are spending less of their income paying down debt, from a \nhigh of 9.1 percent in 2007 to 5.8 percent today.\n  As a result, consumers are saving more and spending more on purchases \nthat have been put off for years. This is a boost to the economy. For \nproof, look no further than the rebound in vehicle sales that has \nfueled the resurgence of American auto manufacturers.\n  However, there is also no doubt that the effects of the Fed's low \ninterest rate policies have been dampened by problems in the housing \nmarket. The Fed has noted that home foreclosures are one of the biggest \ndrags on the economic recovery.\n  Allowing all homeowners to lower their mortgage payments through \nrefinancing is one way to help stop this downward spiral.\n  We cannot have a robust economic recovery while the housing market \nlanguishes. Just as a dilapidated foreclosure erodes the value of every \nhome on the block, a sputtering housing market affects all aspects of \nthe economy.\n  The sooner we reverse declines in the housing market, the sooner we \ncan foster a robust economic recovery. We owe that to every American, \nand I encourage my colleagues to support The Expanding Refinancing \nOpportunities Act of 2012.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BEGICH (for himself and Mr. Boozman):\n  S. 3049. A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, to expand the \ndefinition of homeless veteran for purposes of benefits under the laws \nadministered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague from \nArkansas, Senator Boozman, to introduce a bill that will help veterans \nwho have been forced out of their homes because of domestic violence. \nThis bill will expand the definition of homeless veteran to include \ndomestic violence.\n  Due to an oversight in the law, the legal definition of ``homeless \nveterans'' differs significantly from the existing definition of \nhomelessness. Existing law recognizes individuals who have\n\n[[Page S3045]]\n\nbeen forced from their homes by domestic violence as ``homeless'' but \nfor the purposes of special ``homeless veteran'' benefits, this \nsituation is overlooked. The small wording change in our bill will \nallow those veterans who are in a domestic violence situation access to \nthe same benefits available to other homeless veterans. In order to \nqualify for benefits offered to homeless veterans through the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, must meet the definition of homeless in \nthe McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. That is all we are \nchanging.\n  One out of four women will experience domestic violence sometime in \nher lifetime, including veterans who have served honorably for this \ncountry. They should qualify for the benefits they deserve and need to \nprotect them.\n  This bill simply updates the legal definition of ``homeless veteran'' \nto bring it to the same standard as the rest of the law--correcting a \ngrievous oversight that could deny those who served our country the \nsupport and benefits they earned a thousand times over with their \npatriotism and courage.\n  In closing, it is an honor for me to serve as a member of the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. I feel very privileged to work on behalf \nof our veterans. I appreciate the work of my distinguished colleagues \non the committee and ask them and all senators to join me in supporting \nthis small but very important expanded definition of homeless veterans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Risch, Mr. DeMint, \n        Mr. Wicker, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin, \n        Mr. Paul, Mr. Moran, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Hoeven, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Toomey, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Barrasso, \n        Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Thune, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 3053.

Mr. President, in an attempt to refresh our memory on \nwhat happened with the overreach of the EPA, we might remember that it \nwas from this podium, I guess, 2 weeks ago--it was on a Friday that we \nfound out and we had access to a tape that we released to the public. \nIt has been on the TV and everyone has seen it now. It is a tape of the \nregion 6 administrator of the EPA, Mr. Armendariz. At that time, when \ntalking to the regulators who were under his jurisdiction and along \nwith the public at a public meeting that was taking place in Texas, he \nsaid:\n\n       But as I said, oil and gas is an enforcement priority. . . \n     . I was in a meeting once and I gave an analogy to my staff \n     about my philosophy of enforcement, and I think it was \n     probably a little crude and maybe not appropriate for the \n     meeting but I'll go ahead and tell you what I said. It was \n     kind of like how the Romans used to conquer little villages \n     in the Mediterranean. They'd go into a little Turkish town \n     somewhere, they'd find the first five guys they saw and they \n     would crucify them.\n\n  And let them die on a cross. Everyone would look at that. Then he \nsaid:\n\n       And then you know that town was really easy to manage for \n     the next few years. . . . So, that's our general philosophy.\n\n  This is the EPA we are talking about, and this is 1 of 10 of the \nregulators. This happens to be the region 6 administrator. This \nregional administrator recently resigned when not only his statement \nreceived attention but also following public awareness about the manner \nin which he initiated the enforcement actions in region 6.\n  We know about--and I have already mentioned in my previous remarks--\nthe company down in Texas. This company was cited by Armendariz. They \nare accused of groundwater contamination. They are accused of perhaps \nmisusing hydraulic fracturing. All these were just accusations. But \nthen they sent a letter to them and said we are going to fine you \n$33,000 a day--$33,000 a day. If we read those letters carefully, we \nwill find out that decision isn't already made, it is not going to \nstart, but to the person who is reading the letter, who receives the \nletter, they will think, I can stay in business for 30 more days and \nthat is it.\n  One has to ask the question: How many companies are out there that \nhave received a letter such as this from the EPA and assumed they are \ngoing to have to start paying this fine, so they folded up their tent \nand they quit? This is what they want. They want to put people out of \nbusiness.\n  I told the story from this podium about a company in my State of \nOklahoma. This was back probably 10 years ago. I received a letter--we \nhad a lumber company in Oklahoma and the president of the lumber \ncompany said: I don't know what to do. The EPA has just put us out of \nbusiness.\n  I said: What did you do wrong?\n  He said: I don't think I did anything wrong. He said: I have been \nselling our used crankcase oil to the same licensed operation for the \nlast 10 years and some of that--this contractor was licensed by the \nState of Oklahoma and the Federal Government in the County of Tulsa. He \nsaid: We have been selling it to the same group, this organization, for \n10 years. He said: Some of that has been traced to a site where they \nhave said this came from our used crankcase oil, and they said for that \nreason you have violated the law and we are going to fine you $5,000 a \nday.\n  Now, $5,000 a day, this is to a relatively middle-sized lumber \ncompany, Mill Creek Lumber, it is called--and they are still in \nbusiness today--and that would have put them out of business. I said: \nSend the letter to me and let me read it. I read it and I told him they \nare just threatening you and trying to run you out of business.\n  We have to wonder as to how many companies out there are closed now \nor out of business because of actions such as this. How many of these \ncompanies received a letter such as the operation did down in Texas \nsaying we are going to impose $33,000 a day and, finally, they just \nfold up their tent and quit? We don't know that. There is no way of \nknowing. We have invited people from this podium to call and we have \nreceived calls from people who have been out of business. This is an \nintentional effort we are dealing with and have been dealing with for \nquite some time.\n  So we introduced today, just a few minutes ago, S. 3053. I have a \nwhole bunch of cosponsors--it looks like about 20 cosponsors--on the \nbill. What we do is a very simple thing. I have found in my experience \nin both the House and the Senate that the shorter and simpler we make \nsomething, the easier it is to understand. This is a little, small, \ntwo-page bill, and all it does is say that anyone who is going to be \nappointed--or nominated, I should say--as a regional administrator of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency would have to be appointed by and \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate. We have a list in our laws \nas to what has to have Senate confirmation. The Administrator of the \nEPA has to--and she went through that process and that person is Lisa \nJackson--but not these 10 regional directors. So we are saying they \nshould be subjected to the same advice and consent of this Senate, and \nwe wouldn't have these kinds of problems. I suspect the Administrator \nof the EPA did not know what was going on in region 6 with Mr. \nArmendariz. I will give her the benefit of the doubt that she didn't. \nIn fact, she was very critical of him once we stood here and exposed \nwhat was going on.\n  This will solve the problem. I am going to invite people to join in. \nWe have already introduced it. It is S. 3053. It is one that would \nforce the administrators to be subjected to confirmation by this \nSenate. Keep in mind that these administrators, these regional \nadministrators, have the power of life and death over many companies in \nAmerica.\n  I believe this will solve that problem, and I look forward to passing \nthis bill and having it become law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Boozman, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 3054.

Res. 450\n\n     (Designating May 15, 2012, as ``National MPS Awareness Day'')\n\n       Whereas mucopolysaccharidosis (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``MPS'') are a group of genetically determined \n     lysosomal storage diseases that render the human body \n     incapable of producing certain enzymes needed to break down \n     complex carbohydrates;\n       Whereas MPS diseases cause complex carbohydrates to be \n     stored in almost every cell in the body and progressively \n     cause cellular damage;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS--\n       (1) adversely affects the human body by damaging the heart, \n     respiratory system, bones, internal organs, and central \n     nervous system; and\n       (2) often results in intellectual disabilities, short \n     stature, corneal damage, joint stiffness, loss of mobility, \n     speech and hearing impairment, heart disease, hyperactivity, \n     chronic respiratory problems, and, most importantly, a \n     drastically shortened life span;\n       Whereas symptoms of MPS are usually not apparent at birth;\n       Whereas, without treatment, the life expectancy of an \n     individual afflicted with MPS begins to decrease at a very \n     early stage in the life of the individual;\n       Whereas research has resulted in the development of limited \n     treatments for some MPS diseases;\n       Whereas promising advancements in the pursuit of treatments \n     for additional MPS diseases are underway as of the date of \n     agreement to this resolution;\n       Whereas, despite the creation of new remedies, the blood-\n     brain barrier continues to be a significant impediment to \n     effectively treating the brain, which prevents the treatment \n     of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas the quality of life of the individuals afflicted \n     with MPS, and the treatments available to those individuals, \n     will be enhanced through the development of early detection \n     techniques and early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS diseases;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS diseases extends to \n     individuals within the medical community;\n       Whereas the cellular damage that is caused by MPS makes MPS \n     a model for the study of many other degenerative genetic \n     diseases; and\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS diseases can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 15, 2012, as ``National MPS Awareness \n     Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n                              S.

That should be easy. That should be something we \nshould agree to. We tried to get the Ex-Im Bank done. Everyone wanted \nto get it done. The chamber of commerce, labor, aircraft companies--all \nwanted it done. Everybody wanted it done. But, as a lot of things go \nhere in the Senate, it didn't get done because Republicans wouldn't let \nus get it done.\n  It went to the House, and they sent us back a bill that is virtually \nthe same as the one we weren't able to pass here, so I can't imagine \nanyone would want to slow that one down. I hope I don't have to file \ncloture on it because if I do, I will do it because we will have \nanother chance to vote on it just as it came from the House. Every \nDemocrat voted for it over there. There were 90 Republicans who voted \nagainst it. We all know who they are. But they voted against it. We are \ngoing to have a chance to vote on the exact bill that passed the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/09/senate-section/article/S3050-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
