Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Vermont.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                 GUEST CHAPLAIN FATHER MARCEL RAINVILLE\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am delighted that Father Marcel \nRainville has offered the opening prayer for the Senate this morning, \nand I thank him very much for joining us in doing so.\n  Father Rainville is a native of Vermont. He is a distinguished member \nof the Society of St. Edmund, an order which has a very long history in \nour State. Established in Vermont first at Keeler's Bay in 1891 and \nthen in Swanton in 1895, the Society of St. Edmund still has its \nheadquarters in Vermont. The society founded St. Michael's College, \nwhich was officially incorporated in 1913 as the first Catholic college \nin the State of Vermont with the authority to grant college degrees. \nThe Edmundites have long stood for justice and civil rights in our \ncountry, including in Selma, AL, where they have a mission. The society \nhas established a successful alternative school for African-American \nboys in New Orleans. The Edmundites have as a major part of their \nvocation the mission to help those who are most in need, and we \nappreciate all of the good work they do.\n  Father Rainville was born in Swanton, VT. He was ordained as a priest \nin the Society of St. Edmund, and this year marks the 40th anniversary \nof his ordination. Father Marcel spent part of his life as a priest \nserving in the Edmundite mission in Venezuela, working with and \nsustaining the impoverished in a barrio in Caracas. He currently \nresides in Winooski Park, VT, where he has also served as chaplain. He \ncurrently serves as the director of formation for the Society of St. \nEdmund.\n  It gives me great pride that he has given the opening prayer today in \nthe Senate, and all of Vermont appreciates the wonderful work he has \ndone. He is a kind and gentle human being and is much beloved in our \nState. I thank him again for being with us today, and I thank the \nChaplain for his help in arranging this visit.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last night cloture was filed on the \nsubstitute amendment and the underlying bill, the veterans jobs bill. \nIf we are unable to reach an agreement to move up the timing of the \ncloture vote, then we will have to have these votes as early as we can \nunder rule XXII. Under such a scenario, the first rollcall vote on \ncloture\n\n[[Page S6290]]\n\non the substitute amendment would occur shortly after 1 a.m. Friday \nmorning, and that is tonight. If there are 60 votes to cut off the \nfilibuster on the substitute amendment, then there will be up to 30 \nhours postcloture on the substitute amendment prior to a vote on its \nadoption which would occur at 7:30 a.m. Saturday morning. Immediately \nfollowing the vote on the adoption of the substitute amendment, the \nSenate will proceed to the cloture vote on the underlying bill as \namended. If cloture is invoked on the bill as amended, then there will \nbe up to 30 hours postcloture prior to a vote on passage of the bill as \namended. The vote on passage would occur about 2:30 p.m. Sunday \nafternoon.\n  That is for the information of all Senators. Until we get this worked \nout, everybody better stay right where they are and not go places \nbecause we will have votes every day. We will then be able to finish \nthis work on Sunday sometime late in the afternoon, and then, of \ncourse, with the Jewish holidays on Monday and Tuesday, we would come \nback and work on the CR and a couple of other things beginning \nWednesday.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. President, in the next hour, after I finish my remarks and \nSenator McConnell finishes his remarks, the majority will control the \nfirst half and the Republicans will control the final half. It will be \n1 hour that will be equally divided.\n\n\n                        Veterans Jobs Corps Act\n\n  Mr. President, as we know, it is Thursday, which means Republicans \nhave once again forced the Senate to waste the better part of a week \njumping through procedural hoops that do not do have one positive \noutcome for our country. This week the Senate waited out yet another \nfilibuster. It was the 380th filibuster in the 6 years I have been the \nleader in the Senate. This time the Republicans are not just \nobstructing a measure that would create jobs, which they have done many \ntimes, they are obstructing the measure that would create jobs for the \nmen and women who risked their lives over the past 11 years to protect \nour freedom.\n  Each year 200,000 servicemembers reenter the workforce. The Veterans \nJobs Corps Act, which is before this body, would invest in those \nreturning veterans, easing the transition back to civilian life with \njob-training programs and priority hiring for first responder \npositions. If young veterans want to continue their service to country \nand community by becoming police officers, firefighters, or rescue \nworkers, we should do everything we can to help them achieve that goal. \nThis legislation would also create jobs for veterans restoring forests, \nparks, coasts, and public lands. The least we can do for those who have \nfought for this country abroad is to ensure they never have to fight \nfor a job when they come home.\n  The legislation that is before this body should sail through the \nSenate with bipartisan support. Remember, the substitute amendment is a \nbipartisan measure worked on by Senator Burr and others on the \nRepublican side, but this worthy legislation has met one Republican \nstall tactic after another. Not only has this bill faced a strong \nseries of procedural hurdles, the Republicans have larded it up with \nunrelated ideological amendments. That is what they want to do anyway. \nWhile some of these amendments are certainly important, they don't \nbelong in any jobs measure, let alone a jobs measure that would assist \nreturning veterans.\n  Unfortunately, I am not surprised to see the Grand Old Party blocking \na jobs bill. After all, that has been their tactic all this Congress. \nIt has really been their tactic for 4 years. Republican leader Mitch \nMcConnell said so himself. During the darkest days of the great \nrecession, he said his No. 1 goal was to defeat President Obama--not to \ncreate jobs, not to do anything to boost the economy, but to defeat \nPresident Obama. Obviously, it is still true today. I am dismayed to \nsee them blocking a jobs bill aimed at protecting those who protect \nthis great Nation. This is really a new low for the Republicans. At a \ntime when 175,000 post-9/11 veterans are out of work, and many of them \nare homeless, we can't afford to waste time with election-year \npolitics.\n  Less than 3 weeks before his death, President John F. Kennedy wrote:\n\n       As we express our gratitude, we must never forget the \n     highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by \n     them.\n\n  It is time that the Senate show its gratitude to a new generation of \nveterans with deeds. It is my hope that my Republican colleagues will \nfind it in themselves to put American veterans first and political \naspirations second.\n  This bill could pass today and we could send it to the House and have \nthe President sign it within a matter of days. It is a shame if that \ndoesn't happen. I have gone over the schedule with everyone within the \nsound of my voice, and I hope we can move forward.\n  Mr. President, will you announce the schedule of the day.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Under the previous order, the next hour will be equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nmajority controlling the first half.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and that \nthe time be equally charged.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of my colleague \nfrom West Virginia. We thought the minority leader was coming to the \nfloor to speak so we have gotten a little behind, but I appreciate his \nindulgence for me to recognize a very important Washingtonian.\n\n\n                     Honoring Our Foreign Servants\n\n  However, before I start, I wish to take a moment to say that my \nthoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of the \nhorrific attack that happened in Libya, and that it is now time to \nremember all of the men and women who serve our country abroad at these \nembassies and to thank them for their service and hope for their \nprotection.\n\n\n              Remembering George Hickman, Tuskegee Airman\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, on a chilly day in January of 2009, \nAmericans watched with pride as Barack Obama stood before the Nation \nand took the Presidential oath of office. For some, that experience was \nanother milestone in a long journey to ensure America lives up to the \nidea that this country was built for everyone. The election of an \nAfrican-American President shattered a barrier that many thought would \nnever happen.\n  The American struggle for civil rights has produced many seminal \nmoments, including Rosa Parks and the Montgomery bus boycott, Martin \nLuther King at the march on Washington, and Jackie Robinson stepping to \nthe plate for the first time. Before all of these events, however, \nthere were the Tuskegee Airmen.\n  George Hickman, a Washington resident and a Tuskegee Airman, was \ntruly part of America's ``greatest generation.'' They were a catalyst \nfor an eventual desegregation of the entire U.S. military. On March 19, \n1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron was formed at Tuskegee Institute in \nAlabama.\n  When the United States was waging war against tyranny abroad, the \nmembers of what became known as the Tuskegee Airmen fought it; they \nfought the globe for us. Breaking barriers is never easy. At the time, \nthe competence and patriotism of these African-Americans sometimes were \nopenly questioned, but the Tuskegee Airmen didn't listen to those \ncritics. They were fighting for what this country could be, not what it \nwas.\n  In the first class of graduates there were only five, but before the \nwar ended almost 1,000 pilots went through training at Tuskegee. Of \nthose, 450 flew planes in the 99th Squadron and the 332nd Fighter Group \nin missions across Europe. They used the steely resolve they had shown \nin the face of racism to their advantage.\n  The 99th conducted bomber escort missions with stunning success. They \nflew 200 of 205 of these missions without a loss of a single bomber to \nthe enemy aircraft.\n\n[[Page S6291]]\n\n  The 332nd group achieved just as much. The Red Tail fighters came to \nbe feared in the skies because of the feats like the one Lieutenant \nPierson pulled off when he took out a German destroyer in the Harbor of \nTrieste, Italy, with just a 50-caliber machine gun.\n  Equally important were the Tuskegee pilots who broke barriers at \nhome. They may not have participated in combat, but they proved they \nwere instrumental in powering the American military that eventually won \nthe war. Amidst jeers and insults, the Tuskegee Airmen quietly went \nabout their job with grace. Through grit and determination they \nbarreled through dead ends and blocked doors and shined a light for \nothers to follow.\n  President Obama acknowledged as much when he said: ``My career in \npublic service was made possible by the path heroes like the Tuskegee \nAirmen trail-blazed.''\n  These important Tuskegee Airmen were pioneers, and among them was \nGeorge Hickman from Seattle, proud and smiling as always, as we can see \nin this photograph.\n  So I rise today to honor the life of this American hero and loyal \nWashingtonian. George Hickman passed away on August 19 at the age of \n88. We owe George Hickman a great deal because beneath that big smile \nlay a quiet determination and courageous spirit that helped him make \nAmerica a better place for all.\n  George grew up in St. Louis, MO. He loved building model planes which \nhe bought for 10 cents at Woolworth's, and he dreamed of becoming a \npilot. At age 18 he pursued that dream.\n  When he graduated from high school in 1943, George trained with the \nArmy's all African-American 99th Pursuit Squadron in Tuskegee, AL. He \nwas a Tuskegee Airman and one of our Nation's first African-American \npilots.\n  George's passion for aviation continued after his service was up, and \nas a mechanic with the Tuskegee Airmen he developed skills that allowed \nhim to succeed in and graduate from college. Eventually George brought \nhis expertise to Boeing when he moved to Seattle in 1955. Over a 29-\nyear history he rose through the ranks at Boeing, but that is not where \nthis story ends.\n  George was also an uplifting spirit, and he had the most radiant \nsmile. We can see that from this picture. That smile was there for his \ncommunity, his family, and everyone who met him. George became a well-\nknown figure at Seattle sporting events for the University of \nWashington Huskies and the Seattle Seahawks. In fact, people called him \n``our lucky charm.''\n  For more than 40 years, he served as a press attendant and usher at \nUW sporting events. George never missed a game, including Rose Bowls, \nand he was there to give moral support to everyone. He even went to the \nbasketball and volleyball games and gave high fives to everyone on the \ncourt.\n  As the University of Washington basketball coach Lorenzo Romar put \nit: ``He is a guy that is selfless. He is always trying to lift someone \nelse up.''\n  I also wondered, seeing this picture of George many times before \ntoday, if it was the steely reserve of being an airman that grounded \nhim for what he considered to be really important in life; that is, \nlifting up other people. That is exactly what George did. The \nUniversity of Washington community lifted up George too. They helped \ncollect enough money so he could travel to Washington, DC, to be part \nof President Obama's inauguration, along with 188 other Tuskegee \nAirmen. Some estimates are that more than half of those Tuskegee Airmen \nwho attended the inauguration are no longer with us.\n  With George's passing, certainly there is one more angel in heaven \nwith a very big smile on his face, but here on Earth we have one fewer \nAmerican hero from the Tuskegee Airmen days to tell his story. So, \ntoday, I encourage all Americans to learn about the story of the \nTuskegee Airmen. For those in the Pacific Northwest, I encourage people \nto visit the Museum of Flight in Seattle and the Northwest African \nAmerican Museum because they both have exhibits on display that \nshowcase this epic story. It is a great opportunity to reflect on the \npeople who inspired our Nation's founding ideals and who ended up \nchanging the course of American history.\n  George Hickman may no longer be with us, but he will always be \nremembered for that very big smile, especially by those he touched in \nhis life. His spirit will live on. It is almost as if he is saying in \nthat picture: You can get it done. We can get it done.\n  His legacy lives on through his children Regena, Sheri, Vincent, and \nShauniel, as well as his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. We will \nall carry on this legacy with the U.S. military and the trailblazing \nTuskegee Airmen. George's spirit will also carry on back home at Husky \nStadium and at Hec Edmundson Pavilion. Many people, including the \nSeattle City Council, those at the university, and the Seahawks have \nall honored him in their special ways.\n  So on behalf of a grateful nation, it is my pleasure to submit a \nresolution to honor the life of an American hero, a great \nWashingtonian, George Hickman. As his wife Doris summed it up: ``George \nloved his family and enjoyed life to the fullest.''\n  George Hickman was a true American hero and an inspiration for all of \nus. I hope we agree to this resolution.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                    Veterans Jobs Corps Act of 2012\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank my \ncolleague and good friend from the State of Washington, Senator \nCantwell, for honoring and recognizing a true American hero. We have \nhad so many of them, and we still have so many, and I wish to thank her \nfor that.\n  As the country mourns for those we have lost in Libya and those who \nremain in harm's way to keep us all safe, we are reminded of the sacred \ndebt we owe the men and women who put their lives on the line for us \nevery day. No matter the generation and no matter the war, America's \nsoldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen are always tough, always \ndetermined, and always victorious. Even when we have asked the \nimpossible of them, they have served us well.\n  However, how well have we served them? How well have we kept our \nsacred promise to care for those who, as Abraham Lincoln said, ``have \nborne the battle'' for us and for this great country of ours?\n  The Veterans Jobs Corps Act is an opportunity to make good on that \npromise, but it is more than an opportunity; it is an obligation. It is \nalso a duty and, most importantly, it is a privilege. It is one of the \nbest welcome home celebrations we could give the men and women in our \narmed forces, as well as the 9/11 generation of their families--more \nthan 1 million military spouses and 2 million children, many of whom \nhave lived their entire lives in a nation at war.\n  Today, one of our Nation's great challenges is a new generation of \nveterans coming home to a weak economy. Those veterans are disciplined \nand have some of the best training in the world, but now those veterans \nwho fought in Iraq and Afghanistan now fight for jobs.\n  The unemployment rate for these post-9/11 veterans is 10.9 percent, \naccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics this past August, and that \nis well above the national average. That is unacceptable. That is why \nevery day in the U.S. Senate I will stand with our veterans--as I know \nthe Acting President pro tempore does and all of our colleagues--24/7. \nThat is why one of my top priorities in the Senate has been--and will \ncontinue to be--to make sure there are good jobs for our returning \nveterans.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Veterans Jobs Corps Act includes \nprovisions to provide veterans with access to the Internet and \ncomputers to assist them in their job searches. This is important \nbecause, as we all know, today's veterans are tech-savvy.\n  I have talked with Labor Secretary Solis about establishing an \nInternet portal for job seekers, and I will be working closely with the \nSecretary to make sure this provision of the act is up and running as \nquickly as possible.\n  I do, however, suggest that we amend the legislation so it is \nabundantly clear that employment opportunities available through the \nVeterans Jobs Corps are maintained on one--only one--Internet portal--a \nsimple, one-stop center for job seekers. In this technology age, we \nneed a central clearinghouse to match veterans with available jobs.\n  I also want to propose two more amendments to the Veterans Jobs\n\n[[Page S6292]]\n\nCorps Act that might have been overlooked.\n  First, as written, the legislation addresses commercial driver's \nlicenses, CDLs, as we know them, but not construction equipment or \nheavy equipment operating licenses. I suggest we amend the legislation \nto include reciprocity on licensure, which, clearly, will make it \neasier for veterans to get jobs operating this heavy equipment at \nconstruction and mining sites. They have been doing these jobs already \nevery day in the military. There is no reason why they should have to \nface a complete new hurdle to get a new license for the same work here \nat home.\n  And second, I would like the legislation to encourage Members of \nCongress to lead by example and hire qualified veterans for openings in \nall of our offices both here and at home. I proudly display the ``I \nHire Veterans'' logo in my office, and many of our colleagues do. I \nhave made this a commitment to every veteran: that we will do all we \ncan to put them back into employment. But we must all lead by example.\n  As members of the Veterans Jobs Caucus, we must do everything we can \nto end the unemployment crisis our veterans are facing. In fact, while \nI was in my great State of West Virginia during our most recent State \nwork period, I had the privilege of working with a private sector \npartner, DuPont--International DuPont--which has joined the ``I Hire \nVeterans'' project. They have committed that for all of their new \nhires, at least 10 percent will be veterans. That is tremendous. This \nproject is our new yellow ribbon and, as I have always said, if you \nwant to really help a vet, hire a vet and then do business with folks \nwho also hire vets.\n  I have seen firsthand the positive impact veterans have on our \neconomy. Leadership, teamwork, commitment, and trust--these are the \nhallmark qualities of all of our military heroes. And these are skills \nevery American business--big or small--needs and can use today.\n  Like every generation of warriors, today's young veterans make great \nhires. Their resumes include maturity, crisis management skills, and \nloyalty, and those resumes should be at the top of every stack of a \nperson looking for a good employee today.\n  Patriotism has many requirements and one requirement is to keep faith \nwith those who have worn the uniform of the United States of America. \nIt is one thing to recall President Lincoln's immortal words and the \ncommitment to those who have ``borne the battle.'' It is another to \nlive by them--to always stand with the men and women who have kept this \nNation safe and free.\n  They answered the call. We must do so as well. And I am so proud to \nsupport this legislation.\n  Three million veterans have returned from military service over the \npast 10 years, and another 1 million are expected to return to civilian \nlife over the next 5 years.\n  Can we rise to the challenge, the way our warriors did in Iraq and \nAfghanistan? Can we make sure our economy is ready for them? Of course \nwe can. And just as importantly, we must.\n  So I ask all of my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--to please \nvote ``yes'' on this most important piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from \nWest Virginia for his eloquent and articulate and powerful remarks \nabout the importance of standing with our veterans. We have work to do, \nas Abraham Lincoln so powerfully put it. I want to acknowledge the \ngreat work of my colleague from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                       Wind Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I am here, as I have been on \nmany a morning over the last number of months, to urge all of us to \nwork together in order to extend the production tax credit for wind \nenergy. The PTC, as it is known, is going to expire in a few months. \nThat impending expiration not only threatens the jobs of tens of \nthousands of Americans but also threatens the continued prosperity of \nan industry that has seen tremendous growth over the last decade. We \nsimply cannot let that happen. But each day we fail to act--and, in \neffect, abdicate our basic responsibility to support job creation--we \nare allowing jobs to be exported and we are truly abandoning a part of \nthe bright future of American manufacturing.\n  I have had the opportunity over the last several months, as I \nmentioned, to come to the floor and talk about the benefits of the \nproduction tax credit in individual States. Today I think it is timely \nand appropriate to highlight the great State of Arizona--a State I have \na special affinity for, as does the Acting President pro tempore. We \nwere both born and raised in Tucson, and we both, I know, share a sense \nof pride because Arizona has adopted a renewable electricity standard \nsuch as we have in Colorado, such as we have in the Acting President \npro tempore's State of New Mexico. The important part is not just the \nadoption of that standard but Arizona's commitment to renewable energy \nhas truly produced results.\n\n  When you think about Arizona, you think about solar resources. The \nSun shines many a day in Arizona. But it is also home to more than \nample wind resources. In fact, the studies show that Arizona has enough \nwind potential to provide 40 percent--40 percent--of the State's \ncurrent electricity needs. That is according to the National Renewable \nEnergy Laboratory.\n  Arizona is not letting that wind go to waste. It completed its first \ncommercial wind project in 2009, and it has been steadily adding \ncapacity ever since. This first project was the Dry Lake Wind Project, \nwhich is a wind farm comprised of 30 turbines in Navajo County, which \nis up in the northeastern section of the State, familiar to the Acting \nPresident pro tempore, quite near his home State of New Mexico.\n  But Arizona is not stopping with this one project. There are at least \nseven wind manufacturers in Arizona that are creating good-paying jobs, \nand I want to mention one, Southwest Windpower. It is a national leader \nin the small wind market, and it has a manufacturing facility up in \nFlagstaff, which is in Coconino County, in the center of the northern \npart of Arizona.\n  These online wind projects already power over 33,000 homes, and, as I \nhave highlighted, current projects under construction are likely to \ndrastically multiply that number. Why is this important? Well, we have \nclean, renewable energy that creates American jobs. You talk about a \nvirtuous cycle. This is one.\n  There is a large wind project proposed in Arizona. It is the Mohave \nCounty Wind Farm. It is up in the northwestern section of Arizona. It \nwill produce 500 megawatts of electricity. Mr. President, 500 megawatts \nwould power 110,000 homes per year. As importantly, that is an \ninvestment of hundreds of millions of dollars and, conservatively, it \nwould create nearly 1,000 jobs. Those are impressive numbers.\n  Why do I bring up this proposed project? Well, I bring it up because \nthis investment is at risk. The BLM, under Secretary Salazar's \nleadership, has fast-tracked this project, and it is scheduled to begin \nconstruction next year. But our inaction here literally will thwart \nthose plans. Without an extension of the production tax credit, the \nfuture of this project and the jobs and the clean energy it will \nproduce are in jeopardy. That is flat out unacceptable. We have to act \nhere in the Congress in order for the immense potential of wind power \nto be realized.\n  I want to talk today about something I have not mentioned previously \non the upside. When we produce power from wind in the arid West, we \nsave an enormous amount of water. Recent estimates project that for \nevery 1,000 megawatts of new wind power produced, we save over 818 \nmillion gallons of water on an annual basis. I do not have to tell the \nActing President pro tempore we are in a period of extreme drought not \nonly in the Southwest but in the Midwest. When you add in the fact that \nArizona has a very arid climate, fresh water supplies become \nincreasingly precious. So when we take steps to reduce the demand for \nthat fresh water, we make a downpayment on the future of the Southwest. \nOf course, we know that well in Colorado. We are the headwaters of some \nof the most significant major rivers that feed the water needs of the \nStates all around us. But if we let the PTC expire, we risk all the \njobs, the manufacturing, the water savings that would\n\n[[Page S6293]]\n\nhave really positive effects on our economy.\n  I see my good friend from Arizona is here, and I want to conclude. \nBut I want to conclude on this note: This is not a partisan issue. On \nboth sides of the aisle, we have strong support for the production tax \ncredit.\n  Just last month, the Finance Committee included an extension of the \nproduction tax credit on a strong bipartisan vote. Our good friend, \nSenator Grassley from Iowa, has led the effort here in the Congress, \nand we have support in both Houses. So I want to make a plea to all of \nus: Let's act in a bipartisan fashion. Let's renew the production tax \ncredit.\n  The production tax credit simply equals jobs. So we ought to pass it \nas soon as possible because the production tax credit equals jobs, and \nthat is job one here for those of us in the Senate.\n  In the House yesterday a group of Members--over a dozen of them--made \nthis effort bicameral. They talked on the floor of the House about how \nthe PTC has benefited their districts. Their remarks highlighted what I \nhave been saying for months: Without the PTC, thousands of good-paying \nAmerican jobs will likely be lost or shipped overseas. There is no \nreason that should happen. Let's pass the production tax credit \nextension as soon as possible.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore for his interest and his \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my colleagues from Arizona, Alabama and New Hampshire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             SEQUESTRATION\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we come to the floor today to talk about \nthe sequestration and the looming fiscal cliff. Unfortunately, the \nWhite House missed an important deadline last week by failing to \nprovide Congress and the American people with a required report that \ndetails the administration's plan for implementing the $1.2 trillion \nsequester that is scheduled to take effect on January 2 of next year, \nless than 4 months from now.\n  That report on both defense and nondefense cuts came about because \nthe administration ignored repeated requests to provide Congress and \nthe American people with details about the impact that sequestration is \ngoing to have on critical programs, particularly with regard to our \nmilitary and national defense. Members of both parties agreed that it \nwas necessary for the White House to produce this information, and so \nwe were glad to see that Sequestration Transparency Act bill passed, a \nbill with which Senator Sessions, Senator McCain, and others of us were \ninvolved. The law required the administration to produce by September \n6, last week, a report on how they intended to implement sequestration. \nYet so far we have not seen that report. Here we are, it is a week \nlater, and so far President Obama has chosen to ignore a requirement \nthat he signed into law just over a month ago.\n  All Americans are required to play by the rules and follow the laws \nof the land. It seems to me, at least, the administration owes the \nAmerican people and the Congress, under the law that was passed, a \nreport that would detail the proposal they have with regard to the \nsequestration that is going to occur the first of next year.\n  I think the reason that is important--it is important for a lot of \nreasons, but we do not have a lot of time here. If we are going to do \nsomething to avert what would be a catastrophe for our national \nsecurity interests, we have to take the steps that are necessary to do \nthat. Well, it is very hard to come up with a replacement or an \nalternative to what the administration proposes when we do not know \nwhat the administration is proposing.\n  So we are hoping that when we get this report, which I hope will be \nsoon since it is now a week overdue, we get an idea about what the \nadministration proposes to do and then Congress can move forward, \nhopefully, with an alternative that would avert what would be a major \ndisaster, as has been described by our military leadership in this \ncountry, to America's national security interests. I know the Senator \nfrom Arizona, the Senator from Alabama, and others will detail some of \nthat, but I think it is important to point out what some of the \nPresident's own advisers have said.\n  The Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has issued repeated warnings \nabout the negative impact these cuts will have on our military, saying, \n``It would do catastrophic damage to our military and its ability to \nprotect this country.''\n  General Odierno, Chief of Staff of the Army, said that ``cuts of this \nmagnitude would be catastrophic to the military.'' He went on to say \nthat ``these cuts would incur an unacceptable level of strategic and \noperational risk.''\n  It is interesting, there is a book out now by Washington Post \nreporter Bob Woodward, who describes President Obama and then-OMB \nDirector Jack Lew when they were going through this process as \ninsisting on these defense cuts during the debt ceiling negotiation. It \nis clear they wanted to use these defense cuts as leverage to get tax \nincreases.\n  In fact, if we breach the fiscal cliff, if we go over the fiscal \ncliff, it is now being predicted by the Congressional Budget Office \nthat that will drive unemployment beyond 9 percent next year and plunge \nthe country into yet another recession. In fact, they project--CBO \ndoes--that the GDP will contract by 2.9 percent during the first half \nof next year and by 5 percent over the entire year. Federal Reserve \nChairman Ben Bernanke has also said that estimates ``do not incorporate \nthe additional negative effects likely to result from public \nuncertainty about how these matters will be resolved.''\n  We are heading toward a train wreck. We are heading toward a disaster \nfor America's national security interests. It all started with the fact \nthat this Chamber has not produced a budget for now 3 years in a row. \nThis is what you end up with when you do not have a budget. We do not \nhave a blueprint on how we are going spend $3.6 trillion of the \nAmerican taxpayers' money, so we ended up with a budget control act \nwhich was cobbled together at the last minute to avoid a crisis on the \ndebt limit last summer which put in place a supercommittee designed to \ncome up with these cuts. When the committee failed, this sequestration \nprocess was triggered. That was last November. We have had almost a \nwhole year now for the administration to put forward their plan about \nhow they would implement this sequestration, these across-the-board \ncuts that disproportionately impact our national security spending.\n  It is a disservice to the American people, disservice to the Congress \nfor the administration not only to have not put something out prior to, \nbut now since we passed legislation that was signed into law just a \nmonth ago that required the President to put forward this report, not \nto have received it yet so that we can have the time that is necessary \nto take the action that is necessary to avoid what would be a \ncatastrophe and a disaster for America's national security interests.\n  I hope we will receive that report. This fiscal cliff is real. It is \nnot just the Congressional Budget Office; a lot of the outside analysts \nhave looked at this and come to the same conclusion; that is, if \nsomething is not done to avert these cuts and to deal with the tax \nincreases that will occur on the first of next year, we will go over a \nfiscal cliff, and that could be incredibly dangerous and have \ncatastrophic consequences for America's national security interests but \nalso for our economy and for jobs.\n  I would like to yield to my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, \none of the most respected voices on national security issues and \nsomeone who has been very active on this sequester issue and trying to \nget the Defense Department to at least let us know what they are \nintending to do with regard to the cuts that are going to impact the \nnational security interests of this country.\n  I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be included \nin the colloquy with the Senator from South Dakota, the Senator from \nAlabama, and, naturally, the Senator from New Hampshire as well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S6294]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think the Senator from South Dakota has \nlaid out the problem. One of the regrets that I think all of us have is \nthe failure of this message to get to the American people: the loss of \n1 million defense jobs, $1 trillion taken out of our economy, the \ndevastation to our national security that has been so graphically \ndescribed by our Secretary of Defense and our uniformed chiefs. And \nstill I think most Americans do not understand how the word \n``sequestration'' applies in this particular situation. Now, maybe when \nthis report--thanks to the legislation sponsored by the Senator from \nSouth Dakota--comes out as to the effects, it will give more visibility \nto the train wreck we are facing. It is a train wreck.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues again that the President cut $78 \nbillion from defense in 2011. The budget request this year cut an \nadditional $487 billion over the next decade, and this is another \napproximately $480 billion in addition to that. That is why our \nuniformed service chiefs say they will not be able to carry out their \nmissions if this sequestration takes place.\n  And the President of the United States, whose title is ``Commander in \nChief,'' has said, as far as I know, one, that he wants us to agree to \ntax increases. There have been some comments he has made about, well, \nafter the election, maybe we will sit down. That is not the job of the \nCommander in Chief of the Armed Forces whose No. 1 priority is this \nNation's security. The job of the President of the United States is to \nprevent the catastrophic consequence of sequestration on our Nation's \nnational security.\n  I stand ready--and I know my colleagues do--I stand ready to go over \nto the White House and sit down with the President of the United States \nand say: How can we avert this catastrophe for our Nation's defense? \nWhat is the answer? Well, as soon as the Republicans agree to tax \nincreases, or, after the election, maybe we can sit down. Meanwhile, \nthe Pentagon has to plan. They have to plan on what their budget is, on \nwhat their capabilities are going to be, what their acquisitions are \ngoing to be, how we are going to pay, make sure the pay and benefits of \nour men and woman who are serving are kept up.\n  I will yield to my friend from Alabama in just a second, but this is \nreally an incredibly frustrating situation. We are not going to take up \nthe Defense authorization bill anytime soon. We are going through a \nveterans jobs act that never had a hearing, sponsored by a person who \nis not a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. There are six \nveterans jobs programs already in being today. Then I read in some of \nthese periodicals that we are going to take up a bill from the Senator \nfrom Montana concerning some kind of hunting deal.\n  Meanwhile, the Senate refuses to take up the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, which has to do with defending this Nation. What is \nthe role of the President of the United States on this issue? I ask my \ncolleagues, are we, for the first time in 50 years--the first time in \n50 years--not going to pass and send to the President's desk for \nsignature a defense authorization bill? Instead, we will go back and \nforth filing cloture and arguing on amendments and on which will be \nallowed or not allowed, fill up the tree, blah, blah, blah. Yet the \nmajority leader of the Senate cannot take up the national defense \nauthorization bill, the most important piece of legislation this body \nconsiders, and it may be that we do not take it up for the first time \nin 50 years.\n  We must address the issue of sequestration. I again commit to making \ncompromises, to doing things I otherwise would not agree to, because we \ncannot allow this train wreck that will endanger the lives of our \ncitizens to take place. Do not take my word for it. Take the word of \nthe Secretary of Defense appointed by the President of the United \nStates and our uniformed chiefs appointed by the President of the \nUnited States with the advice and consent of the Senate that this is a \ndevastating challenge to our national security. We just found out in \nthe last couple of days that the world we live in is a very dangerous \none.\n  I thank my colleagues for their involvement.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think we should listen to Senator \nMcCain. Senator McCain made a point that I think he understands. He is \nthe ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee. He has served \nhis Nation with a career in the military. And we have a Commander in \nChief who is not leading. We have a majority leader in the U.S. Senate \nwho is not leading. We are about to have no Defense authorization bill \nthis year for the first time in 50 years.\n  I would also note that this will be the first time since I have been \nin the Senate in maybe--I do not know how long--that we have passed not \na single appropriations bill, zero, including a defense appropriations \nbill. It is going to be part of some massive, ominous CR for 6 months \nwithout any real oversight or thought as to how that money will be \nspent.\n  I am a member of the Armed Services Committee and ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee. I would like to point out how these cuts that, as \nSenator Thune established, were driven by the White House when they set \nup this committee last August--and we committed to reducing spending by \n$2.1 trillion over 10 years. Instead of spending $47 trillion, they \nwould reduce it to $45 trillion. We are spending now at the rate of $36 \ntrillion over 10. We are still increasing spending over current rates, \nbut it would not be quite as much.\n  But the way this fell is remarkable. I wanted to show this chart. \nUnder the fallback sequester, the defense budget shrinks while \nnondefense spending soars. Under the budget as proposed and in law \ntoday, the Defense Department, unless we take action to fix this \nsequestration, would have a reduction of 11 percent over 10 years in \nits programs, while the remaining five-sixths of the Federal \nGovernment--defense is only one-sixth--would get a 35-percent increase. \nThis is the kind of poor management we ought to not allow to happen. \nThe Secretary of Defense said it would be ``catastrophic.'' The \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs said it would be ``catastrophic.'' Yet \nthat is where we are heading.\n  We need leadership now. It will take place in January. We need to fix \nit now because defense contractors and military budget people in the \nDepartment of Defense are right now trying to wrestle with what to do \nabout it.\n  This is not acceptable. So you say--they might say: The Defense \nDepartment has received dramatic increases. It ought to take more cuts.\n  We have heard that said. It is really not so. Let me show you some \nthings about spending. From 2008 through 2011, these are the increases \nin spending by department or major program. Food stamps has gone up 100 \npercent--double. Medicaid went up 37 percent from 2008 through 2011. \nThe Defense Department has increased 10 percent and basically last year \nhad very little increase. The perception is that the Defense Department \nis the one that is driving the increases in spending. That is not \naccurate. Let me point out that under the Budget Control Act agreement \nof August 1 year ago, they totally exempted food stamps from any \nreduction, they totally exempted Medicaid from any reduction--not a \ndime--and that is why the cuts fall disproportionately on defense, and \nSocial Security has no reduction. So these are things we need to \nunderstand as we wrestle with how to manage the people's money.\n\n  I thank Senator Thune for his leadership. To Senator McCain, I just \nwould say this is not a good way to do business. I don't believe it \nwill eventually become law. But right now it is causing disruption in \nthe Defense Department, in our procurement for the Defense Department. \nWe need to do something about it sooner rather than later. It is very \ndisappointing the Commander in Chief, the Chief Executive, doesn't see \nthis problem and begin to provide leadership right now to fix it.\n  I see my colleague from New Hampshire, a fabulous new addition to \nboth the Budget Committee and the Armed Services Committee, has come to \nthe floor. I am so pleased with her grasp of defense issues and her \npassion about it. Senator Ayotte.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into this \ncolloquy with my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. It is an honor certainly to speak after the Senator from \nAlabama, who is the ranking Republican\n\n[[Page S6295]]\n\non the Senate Budget Committee. He knows better than anyone else here, \nas my colleague from South Dakota said, had we done a budget for our \ncountry, we wouldn't find ourselves in a situation such as this, where \nwe are going to put our national security at risk. It has been over 3 \nyears since this body has done a budget. I think it is outrageous. \nHaving been elected in 2010, I am so angry about that, I have signed up \nto support the bill that says we shouldn't get paid until we have a \nbudget because where we end up is with this sequestration deal.\n  This is a lesson we should learn when we have an absence of \nleadership, when we have a majority leader who thinks it is foolish to \nhave a budget, when we have absence of leadership from our Commander in \nChief, who doesn't think this is a priority to resolve. The President \nshould be calling all of us to the table to resolve this because of \nnational security. Without resolving it, we end up putting our country \nat risk. The foremost responsibility we have in representing the \nAmerican people under our Constitution is to keep them safe. If we \ndon't do that, we have nothing else.\n  We have seen the events over the last few days, as Senator McCain has \ndescribed them. He is the ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee and certainly someone known as being more knowledgeable about \nnational security than anyone else in this body. I believe he is right. \nIt is a dangerous time in the world right now. We are faced with Iran \ntrying to acquire nuclear capability, we have the Middle East \nunraveling right now, and there is an absence of American leadership, \nunfortunately.\n  If we take, in addition to the $487 billion in reductions we are \nalready planning for the Department of Defense, another $500 billion \noff that, with what we see happening around the world and the risks to \nour country--terrorists who still want to kill us for who we are and \nwhat we believe in--then as our own Secretary of Defense has said, this \nsequestration will be catastrophic, leading to a hollow force, shooting \nourselves in the head. That is what our Secretary of Defense has said. \nIrresponsible.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the Senator from New Hampshire, is it not true \nwe went to her State and met with a major defense industry in the State \nof New Hampshire that employs thousands of people?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Yes, we did. In fact, I was at the same major defense \nemployer in my State on Monday the same employer we went to--BAE.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What do they say?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. They say they are worried about sequestration because \nthere are thousands of jobs at stake in New Hampshire. But more \nimportant, there is the capacity to make sure our troops have the very \nbest equipment, the very best technology, and that we can prevent \nattacks on our country. When we send our troops into harm's way, we \nneed to know they are protected. We have a responsibility to them.\n  There are jobs at stake and there is safety to our troops. When we \ntalk about hollowing out our force, we mean putting our troops at risk \nand, finally, not only that, but we think about our safety. So there \nare real jobs at stake. As the Senator from Arizona has said, my State \nestimates 3,600 jobs on the defense end and over 1 million jobs in this \ncountry.\n  Let's face it, I saw the workers, I have talked to them, and they are \nvery worried we are not going to take up our responsibility; that there \nis an absence of leadership. Where is the Commander in Chief on this? \nOf all the things the President has responsibility for, this cannot be \npunted until after an election. This should not be used as a bargaining \nchip for other goals he wants to accomplish--increasing taxes in this \ncountry. He should be at the table right now. We are all willing to sit \ndown and listen to ideas and to compromise with the other side, but we \nneed the leadership of our President to do that.\n  I understand the President may be too busy campaigning to do that, \nbut this is too important to leave until after an election.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask the Senator from Alabama, is it not true, if \nthese cuts are enacted in the fashion they are designed right now, we \nare going to have a serious impact on our economy, to the point where \nit could result in even negative growth, according to objective \nstudies?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Congressional Budget Office and others, as Senator \nThune indicated, have said if the tax increases are imposed and the \nsequester cuts are done, we could go back into another recession. The \nlast thing we need to get this budget under control and our finances \nunder control is another recession. It would be unthinkable for us to \ntake action that would put us in that kind of context.\n  As Senator McCain knows, there are requirements the defense \ncontractors--any government contractor--has when they know they are not \ngoing to be able, under the law, to keep the number of people employed. \nThey have to send them a notice they are going to be laid off in \nadvance so they have an opportunity to find other work. They are \npreparing to send out those notices now, and that has a depressing \neffect on the economy as well, I think. It is a very serious matter for \nthe economy.\n  But most important to me is, when we start playing games with \nproduction and procurement of weapon systems and things, it costs the \ngovernment more money. Wouldn't the Senator agree? If a contractor is \nproducing 100 widgets and then they go to 50 widgets, then back to 100, \ndoesn't the government often have to pay penalties and doesn't it drive \nup cost?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Wouldn't that also be true if a defense contractor today \nliterally has no ability to make plans for what their company or \ncorporation would be expected to do on January 1 of 2013?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Absolutely; that is correct. Under the law, these cuts \nwill take place in January. That will happen unless we pass a law to \nchange it--unless we take action to change it. What, are we going to \nwait until December 31? Is that when we are going to deal with this?\n\n  As Senator Ayotte suggests, we should do it now because it is the \nresponsible thing to do to fix this problem and not leave the Defense \nDepartment in turmoil. They will not even send an answer to our \nrequest--Senator Thune, myself, Senator McCain--on where the cuts are \ngoing to occur, I guess because they do not want to or they do not know \nyet. But this is turmoil within the Department.\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator from Alabama will yield on that, I think it \nis important again to point out this could be avoided. Actually, the \nHouse of Representatives passed a budget trying to avoid it. They \naddressed this in their budget. They restricted these reductions, did \naway with the 50 percent whack the Defense Department would get, which \nis disproportionate relative to their share of the budget. Defense \nrepresents 20 percent or about one-sixth of the budget, as the Senator \nfrom Alabama pointed out, but it gets 50 percent of the cuts.\n  But the House of Representatives passed a budget that the Democrats \nhave been down here attacking for the last couple days--the ``Ryan'' \nbudget or the House-passed budget. At least they had a budget. We \nhaven't had a budget for 3 years in the Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't that known as chutzpah--to come down and attack the \nother body's budget when we haven't done a budget for 3 years, which is \nrequired by law?\n  I have to hand it to them--I have to hand it to them. I congratulate \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle who come down and attack the \nother body's budget when they haven't done one in 3 years. \nCongratulations for new levels of hypocrisy.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. If the Senator from Arizona will yield, I too would call \nthat hypocrisy. I mean, when there is no plan in the Senate for the \nfiscal state of the country, when the other side seems unwilling to \nactually do the work of the Budget Committee, when the majority leader \ncalls it foolish--and by the way, when the President's own budget gets \nzero votes--\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, the President did have a budget. It got zero votes. \nNot a single Member on the other side of the aisle voted for their own \nPresident's budget. Yet they will come down and attack a budget \nproposal which, by the way, puts us on a path to a balanced budget, and \nthere is certainly no proposal I have ever seen coming from the other \nside. In fact, the answer, according to them, is spend more money--\n\n[[Page S6296]]\n\nspend more money. Let's have more of everything. Obviously, that has \nnot been a very successful approach over the last 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  Again, I don't mean to be too repetitive, but here we are and what \nare we debating--a jobs bill. It sounds great. It sounds great: a \nveterans jobs bill. What could be better or more important? We have six \nveterans jobs programs that haven't succeeded. The fact is we are not \naddressing the needs of the men and women in the military who will be \nveterans someday. We are not providing them with the equipment, the \ntraining, and the wherewithal to defend this Nation by both ignoring \nsequestration and not taking up the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  My friends, I think the American people see through this charade we \nare conducting in these last few days before we go out to campaign and \nsee if we can find and meet any Americans who are still in that 11 \npercent who say they still approve of Congress.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We are going to have a lot more unemployed veterans if \nwe don't fix this sequester because it is clearly going to cause the \nDefense Department to reduce personnel in a significant number; \nwouldn't the Senator agree?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I totally agree.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Thune mentioned the Ryan budget, a historic \nbudget which changes the debt course of America and puts us on a path \nto prosperity and not decline. It is an honest budget, and it fixes \nthis sequester.\n  I would ask Senator Thune, doesn't the budget passed by the House do \nthat? Isn't that proof that if we put our heads together, we can \ndevelop a way of dealing with this sequester; that it is not impossible \nto do?\n  Mr. THUNE. Right, and it passed months ago. We all talk about the \njobs impact, the Warren Act notices that are going to go out, and all \nthe uncertainty created by not knowing what the impact of this is going \nto be, but the House of Representatives passed a budget months ago \nwhich spelled out in clear detail how they would avoid these Draconian \ncuts to the national security budget, replaced them with alternatives \nby finding reductions in spending in other areas of the budget, and put \na budget out that actually accomplished that objective and avoided what \nwe all know is going to be a disaster and a train wreck at the end of \nthe year.\n  So what happens? The Senate--the world's greatest deliberative body--\ndoesn't pass a budget for the third year in a row. Here we are, at the \neleventh hour, less than 4 months away from when this would take \neffect, with defense contractors sending out pink slips to employees in \nthe very near future, and the Senate has done nothing to avoid what we \nknow is a very predictable crisis.\n  Everybody knows this is coming. The Congressional Budget Office is \npredicting it, the Federal Reserve is predicting it, outside analysts \nare predicting it. Everybody knows the combination of tax increases on \nJanuary 1 and the dramatic cuts in the Defense Department are going to \ntake the country into a place economically that we don't want to go. In \nmost cases, according to the CBO, they have said it is going to take us \nback into a recession. They are predicting a 2.9-percent contraction in \nthe economy in the first 6 months of next year and unemployment over 9 \npercent.\n  It is not as though we don't see this coming. Yet here we are, as \nSenator McCain pointed out, talking about small-ball stuff. We are \ndoing things that in somebody's opinion I am sure is important, but we \nknow we have a disaster looking us right in the eye, and we aren't \ndoing anything to address it.\n  Again, it all starts with the failure by this institution, the \nSenate--the world's greatest deliberative body--not able to pass a \nbudget, its most fundamental responsibility. The ranking member of the \nBudget Committee, the Senator from Alabama, knows full well. The \nSenator from New Hampshire is also a member of that committee. I am not \nsure why our committee exists if we aren't going to pass a budget, but \nwe haven't done it now under the Democratic leadership here in the \nUnited States for 3 consecutive years.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I do believe we are at a point in \nhistory that this Congress has the responsibility. Sequester cannot be \ncarried out in the way it is written today. It will do severe damage to \nthe Defense Department. We are going to fix it at some point. It only \nmakes good sense and good business for us to fix it now, to avoid the \ndisruptions that are ongoing in our Department of Defense.\n  Now I say we will fix it. I know there are a number of friends of the \nPresident who have long desired severe cuts in the Defense Department. \nHe said he doesn't, but he at this point is taking action that I can \nonly conclude indicates he favors these reductions to occur. The only \nway he might not do it is if we have the tax increase he wishes to see \noccur.\n  Mr. THUNE. On that point, it looks as if what they are doing is \nrunning out the clock, doesn't it? They have a requirement by September \n6--last week--to produce at least their proposal. It is by law. We \npassed it. He signed it into law back in August. It was required last \nweek, and we haven't seen it yet. It looks to me what they are doing is \ntrying to run the clock out, hoping Congress is going to go home to \ncampaign and they will not have had to do anything to deal with this--\nuntil the lameduck, at which point they can use defense cuts as \nleverage to try to get tax increases.\n  It is pretty plain what is going on here. But they have a requirement \nunder the law to produce that. They haven't done it. The Senator from \nAlabama and I were authors of that legislation. The Senator from New \nHampshire has been a great leader in trying to get the administration \nto put their proposal for implementation in front of us. That hasn't \nhappened. That is, I think, the only conclusion anybody can draw.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from New Hampshire has campaigned on this \nand talked about these issues. I guess it has been frustrating to serve \non the Budget Committee and the Armed Services Committee and to see as \nmuch dysfunction as has occurred.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. It has. We have to do a budget, I would say to the \nSenators from Alabama and South Dakota, for our country. And we need to \nmake sure that we protect our national security. That is why this \nproblem has to be solved now. We need leadership from the President as \nCommander in Chief.\n  I would point out, in response to the comments of the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, not only has the Department of Defense ignored this law \nof producing a plan as to how they are going to implement \nsequestration; the administration went so far as to have the Department \nof Labor issue an order saying: Employers, don't comply with the law of \nthe Warren Act to tell employees that your job may be at risk and issue \na layoff notice.\n  That is how far the administration is going in not wanting to take \nthis issue head on. But it is too important to the American people. We \nhave got to resolve it. We are willing to try to resolve it. I am the \ncosponsor of another bill that would come up with alternative spending \nreductions to resolve it. We have got to do it now. We owe this to the \nAmerican people. We owe this to our men and women in uniform.\n  Again, if we do a budget and we do what is right for our country, we \nwould never find ourselves in this situation.\n  I see the Republican leader here. We certainly wish to hear from the \nRepublican leader and would end this colloquy and yield back our time \nto the leader.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                           MIDDLE EAST UNREST\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the attacks this week on our diplomats, \nour installations, and diplomatic security personnel have reminded all \nof us of the service of these brave Americans--the service they render \nto our country every single day, from the deadly attacks on a U.S. \ndiplomatic station in Benghazi, to the attack on our embassy in Cairo, \nand now another attack on another embassy last night in Yemen; four \nAmericans are dead; our flag is being desecrated. This is a moment for \nAmericans to show our closest allies in the Middle East that we stand \nwith them unequivocally. No mixed signals. Neither Israel nor any of \nour allies should ever have any reason to doubt that resolve.\n  I am encouraged that Turkey has condemned the violence in Benghazi.\n\n[[Page S6297]]\n\nThere is absolutely no justification for what happened in Cairo, \nBenghazi, or Yemen. None. We must do everything within our power to \nprotect our representatives overseas and hunt down those responsible \nfor these attacks.\n  There were warnings yesterday that other attacks on other embassies \nmay be imminent. This is a gravely serious moment. But America does not \nshrink from the defense of its core values or its interests overseas. \nWe must project strength.\n  The unrest in the Middle East--in Libya, Egypt, and especially the \nSinai, Yemen, and Syria--presents a profound and formidable challenge \nto our interests, in addition to the U.S. Central Command, and to our \nallies. None of our Nation's enemies--al-Qaida, other violent \nextremists, Hezbollah, and especially Iran--should view this moment as \na window of American vulnerability. Now is the moment to send a clear \nsignal to longstanding allies such as Israel that they can rely on our \nsupport. And every member of our armed services, diplomatic corps, and \nintelligence community should know they have our support and gratitude \nin the challenging days that lie ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                            The Ryan Budget\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the so-\ncalled Ryan budget plan, endorsed and fully absorbed by Governor \nRomney--which, when you read it, is nothing more than a diabolical \nblueprint for slashing services that help families, seniors, and \nchildren all across the country.\n  The Ryan-Romney plan--which is the centerpiece of the Republican \nPresidential campaign, and certainly will grow more so--has finally \ncome under the new scrutiny that it needed as people got a good look at \nit leading up to the GOP convention last month. I, for one, have been \nashamed of this document for much longer. I was proud the Senate voted \nagainst it, although it was equally discouraging that a majority of the \nHouse voted for it.\n  I am here today because I want to set the record straight on what, in \nmy judgment, the Ryan-Romney plan would do to people in my home State \nof West Virginia, to the Presiding Officer's home State, and to the \ncountry.\n  The Ryan budget proposal tackles the deficit by shredding something \ncalled the safety net. If people aren't clear what that is, it is the \nnet of public policy underneath the worst possible situation that \nsomebody can come to in terms of health care or inability to live. \nFamilies have counted on that safety net for years in rough times, \nbecause they have had that safety net and they have used that safety \nnet.\n  In essence, the unbalanced Ryan proposal guts programs for seniors, \npeople who are disabled, children, families struggling to make ends \nmeet, and then--most fascinating--turning those cuts into $4 trillion \nworth of tax breaks for the very wealthiest Americans and corporations. \nAnd people say class warfare, but it is mathematics. They give the \naverage millionaire a tidy little tax cut of $265,000 under the Ryan-\nRomney plan while desperately undermining our economy.\n  He says he hopes his plan will balance the budget by 2040. That is \nnot very encouraging, and it is probably optimistic on his part if it \nwere ever to take place. The Ryan plan does not contribute a single \npenny to deficit reduction, which is the great problem we are facing \nand which we are going to deal with--not a single penny.\n  Consider how they shred health care, with $2.9 trillion in health \ncare cuts, not just from repealing health care reform--an amazing thing \nto do--but also by gutting Medicare and Medicaid. In the passing of the \nhealth care act, all of a sudden 30 million Americans--by no means all \nthose who are uninsured--get health insurance coverage. The act makes \nsure that they get health insurance coverage. The Ryan budget, backed \nby Romney, would take that possibility away from 30 million people who \nhave lived without health insurance for many years.\n  The Ryan-Romney plan would take Medicare that more than 50 million \nseniors rely on and turn it into a privatized voucher system. I know \nthis has been said, and it has been said because it is true. They would \ncap how much the government spends on seniors' health care, regardless \nof their health care needs--letting profit-seeking private health \ninsurance companies decide what to cover and what not to cover. That \nalone would cost every individual senior an additional $6,000 per year \nif that plan were to come into effect. If seniors are not able to pay \nthe difference, then they are simply out of luck under the Ryan-Romney \nbudget plan.\n  This plan also rips apart the Medicaid Program by turning it into a \nblock grant program. On this one, I get pretty indignant. Right now, \nMedicaid is a lifeline to 70 million Americans, including families and \nchildren living in or near poverty. Medicaid today provides long-term \ncare for more than half of seniors in the United States of America. \nThey can spend down--get rid of their assets--so they qualify for \nMedicaid so they can get long-term care. There isn't anybody in this \ncountry who isn't going to be faced with long-term care. The difference \nis that some can pay for it and some will have families absorb it \nthrough love and cultural tradition, but most can't. They have to have \nhelp. There is a little bit that is Medicare, but it is virtually \nMedicaid that provides long-term care. That is when you are in your \ndeclining years. That is when you are approaching death. That is when \nyou are at your most dangerous and vulnerable situation. That is when \nyou are scared. That is when your children come from other States to \ntry to help--but then they start spending down the money they have \nsaved for their kids to go to college. It is a desperate situation, \neven as it is today with full Medicaid coverage. This would affect \nthose who need care at home, a lot of home health, and it would also \naffect seniors in nursing homes in terrible ways.\n  The fact is that middle-income families in this country cannot afford \nthe $80,000 or more per year that it costs to keep a loved one in a \nnursing home in something called long-term care. The only way to do it \nwithout bankrupting the entire family is with the help of Medicaid. \nYes, it is a big program. Yes, we are going to have to face reality in \nsome respects on its size. But scaling back Medicaid the way they do it \nin the Ryan-Romney plan so badly hurts American families, and it forces \nState governments to do things which they are not going to be able to \nafford to do. They are going to have to cut services or they are going \nto have to go more deeply into debt themselves.\n\n  So the real prospect is of people in their seventies, eighties, \nnineties, et cetera, with no long-term care because of a theological \npoint of view that government is awful--but what this is awful to is \npeople. It is just terrible for people. The Ryan-Romney plan would mean \nmillions more Americans could not afford basic health care--and we know \nwhat happens next. More people will get sick with untreated illnesses. \nThen health care costs will go up for everyone.\n  That implies that people get health care. Yes, they do because they \ncan go to the emergency room of a hospital. They will not always get \nservices, but for the most part they get those services. But they are \nnot paying for that; the average American is, which adds about $2,000 \nto their family budget every year, paying for other people's health \ncare because the uninsured do not have insurance and therefore they \nhave no place to go. The idea of repealing the health care act and \ntaking 30 million Americans--really, if we had more money we would have \ndone the 45 or 50 million who are really uninsured and underinsured and \ntaken care of them, but we did not have the money to do that.\n  The nursing homes and the 1.8 million people who work there would be \nforced to slash their services or close their doors or certainly turn \naway seniors. In their frenzy to repeal health care reform, and with \nnot a single proposal to replace it--the great silence--Ryan-Romney \nwould also completely undo all of the new consumer protections to fight \nback against cruel health insurance practices.\n  I chair the Commerce Committee. That is about all we dealt with for \nthe past 2 years, health insurance companies and their practices. It is \npretty depressing. For example, the new provision ending discrimination \nby health insurance companies against people with preexisting \nconditions--that is law. Under Ryan-Romney that would\n\n[[Page S6298]]\n\nend. I reiterate, women who are pregnant, millions of Americans who \nhave diabetes, people with asthma, people with acne, have frequently \nbeen just turned down by health insurance companies when they ruled the \nroost. Now they don't rule the roost under the new health care bill, \nand a lot of money is being rebated to American people who were \novercharged.\n  The reform we passed allows parents to keep their children on their \ninsurance plan until the kids are 26 years old. That is one of the most \npopular aspects in the country. That would disappear under the Ryan-\nRomney budget plan.\n  There is a lot of lack of understanding of the health care bill, and \nit is not wildly popular in some parts of the country. Where you and I \ncome from, Mr. President, that is true. But, on the other hand, when \none thinks of it as a bill, people do not know what is in it. When one \nexplains to people what is in it and give them examples, such as up \nuntil the age of 26 children can stay on their family's health \ninsurance plan; curtailing the restrictions of lifetime limits, the \nannual limits first and then lifetime limits in 2014, they are lifted \nso people get the health care they need.\n  Pretty much every night on television we see stories of kids born \nwith some terrible set of health problems. I remember one I talked \nwith, an 8-year-old boy who had cancer, and his family. He had run into \nhis annual lifetime limit. He died. This was 2 years ago. He died. He \nwould not have died under the health care act, but the Romney-Ryan \npeople want to scrap all that.\n  One thing that is very well known is the prescription drug doughnut \nhole, which our reform bill actually had closed. It is a very big deal. \nIt is very hard to understand how that comes about. What is a doughnut \nhole? But seniors understand it because they spend quite a lot of time \npaying premiums to health insurance companies but getting no benefits \nor health care coverage during that period in which they are in the \ndoughnut hole. We stopped that in the health care bill. That would be \nrepealed. They open that doughnut hole right back up, the Ryan-Romney \nbudget plan, putting that $4,200 a year right back on the shoulders of \nour individual seniors all across the country.\n  We can see a pattern here. It is absolutely appalling. It is \nappalling. They do not talk about it, but even Social Security is \nthreatened by their plans. Social Security is a contract the American \npeople have made with themselves. Virtually everyone pays in throughout \ntheir working years so that everyone has a safety net when they retire \nor they become disabled or they die young and have others in their \nfamily to care for--leaving a surviving spouse and children to struggle \nwithout help. Under our bill, of course, nothing is changed. They want \nto change that.\n  Paul Ryan, for whatever reason, has been trying, since 2004, to \nprivatize Social Security. He just flatout has. He can say what he \nwants. He can say he doesn't think that anymore--he actually doesn't \nsay that, but that is what he believes because if someone has been \ndoing something for the past 10 years, they probably believe in it \npretty strongly--meaning he would like to see the American people bet \ntheir retirement savings on the stock market, which is usually not \nstable. I don't buy that. West Virginia seniors do not buy that.\n  Think back to 2008 when the financial crisis hit. If every American \nhad privatized Social Security accounts then, their retirement security \nwould have been wiped out. Instead, while many people lost a whole lot \nof money in that stock market crash back then, their Social Security \nbenefits were safe, and they knew it.\n  People are fragile. Not everybody is a venture capitalist or an \nentrepreneur. Not everybody is born wealthy. People are living at the \nedge. Psychologically, they are living even more closely to the edge. \nFear comes to them easily. So when we do something good like pass a \nhealth care bill which is going to help them, and then people come in \nand say they are going to repeal the whole act and everything about it, \nand then, yes, something about Social Security too--it is cruel. It is \nappalling and it is cruel. We need to protect and strengthen Social \nSecurity, not destroy it.\n  Don't just take that from me. There is far-ranging opposition to the \nRyan-Romney budget plan from economists to religious leaders. A group \nof Catholic Bishops--this interested me greatly because the candidate \nfor Vice President on the Republican ticket said he got his sort of \nsocial values from his Catholic teaching.\n  There is a group of Catholic Bishops recently who asked Republicans \nto stop championing Ryan's proposals because they were appalled by it--\nCatholics are very strong on fairness for people and always have been--\nbecause it is so hurtful to the poor. It fails their morality test.\n\n  My colleague, Senator Kent Conrad, shared with us this week an \namazing quote that I cannot stop myself from giving to you because it \nwas from one of Ronald Reagan's economic advisers, a fellow named Bruce \nBartlett, which bears repeating. He said the following:\n\n       Distributionally, the Ryan plan is a monstrosity. The rich \n     would receive huge tax cuts while the social safety net would \n     be shredded to pay for [those tax cuts]. Even as an opening \n     bid to begin budget negotiations with the Democrats, the Ryan \n     plan cannot be taken seriously. It is less of a wish list \n     than a fairy tale utterly disconnected from the real world, \n     backed up by make-believe numbers and unreasonable \n     assumptions. Ryan's plan isn't even an act of courage [Bruce \n     Bartlett says]; it's just pandering to the Tea Party.\n\n  I think Mr. Ryan is of the tea party, so I don't know of his need to \npander to it. But anyway that is what this Reagan person indicated.\n\n       A real act of courage would have been for him to admit, as \n     all serious budget analysts know, that revenues will have to \n     rise well above 19 percent of GDP to stabilize the debt.\n\n  In the coming weeks and months we will continue to hear a lot of \nback-and-forth about the heartless policy proposals coming from Paul \nRyan and Members of Congress who support his plan. This is a deadly \nserious debate--deadly serious, with enormous consequences for our \ncountry and for every person in it.\n  It is my sincere and urgent hope that as more Americans come to \nunderstand exactly where the Ryan-Romney plan would take our Nation and \nits lifesaving programs and others, that they will decide to run in the \nopposite direction away from it. The Republican budget is a slap in the \nface to millions of Americans. We can and will reduce our deficit. We \nare going to do that because we have to. There is a strong and enduring \nconsensus on that point. But we do not have to do it this way, and we \nmust not do it this way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the veterans jobs \nbill. That is the legislation before us. We voted on it last night, and \nwe will likely be voting on it again today and possibly tomorrow. I \nrise to speak on that bill.\n  I have in fact offered an amendment to the bill because we should do \nall we can to support our veterans. It is very important. They put \ntheir very lives on the line for us, and we need to do all we can to \nsupport them. But we need to do it the right way, and that is why I am \noffering this amendment. We are talking about creating jobs for our \nveterans. The right way to do that is long-term jobs, quality \nemployment, not short-term stimulus-type jobs. That is exactly why I am \noffering this amendment to the legislation that would include approval \nof the Keystone XL Pipeline project.\n  The VFW, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, is an organization that does a \ntremendous amount for our veterans. We all know the VFW. We all know \nthe great work they do on behalf of our veterans. The VFW is already \nworking to help returning vets get jobs--and that is great. They are \nworking to help our returning veterans get jobs constructing the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  The only problem is those jobs are in Canada. Those jobs are in \nCanada because they have not approved the Keystone XL Pipeline in the \nUnited States. After 4-plus years, it is still in the permitting \nprocess. Since the administration has approved the project, we need to \nstep up and approve the project, and we can do that. This amendment \nwould do that.\n  I want to talk a little bit about what the VFW is doing to help \nveterans get jobs in the energy industry by doing things such as \nbuilding the Keystone\n\n[[Page S6299]]\n\nXL Pipeline, as I mentioned, right now in Canada. VetJobs is a job \nplacement company of which the VFW owns 10 percent, so it is partially \nowned by the VFW. They are working with the Edmonton Economic \nDevelopment Corps to hire Canadians in Edmonton and the surrounding \narea in Alberta. Of course, we can see that is where the pipeline is \nbeing constructed in Canada. They are working right now to hire vets to \nwork on such things as the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  Several days ago I spoke with Ted Daywalt. Ted Daywalt is the CEO of \nVetJobs. He told me that in Alberta they have listings in 17 different \njob categories and they could use between 12,000 and 15,000 people in \nAlberta, Canada, just working in the energy industry. Why not put those \nveterans to work right here at home? We all want to have good-quality \njobs, but we want to have it near our home and not have to go to a \ndifferent country to get that job.\n  The Perryman Group estimates that the Keystone XL Pipeline will \ncreate 15,000 to 20,000 direct construction jobs right away, and that \nit will create thousands and thousands of permanent jobs in addition to \nthose construction jobs. That is without spending any tax dollars, that \nis without adding to the deficit, that is without adding to the debt, \nand that is jobs here at home, not in Canada. Also, TransCanada, the \ncompany building the Keystone XL Pipeline, gives a hiring preference to \nveterans. They give a hiring preference to veterans in Canada and they \ngive a hiring preference to veterans in the United States.\n  In fact, they also sponsor a program that is actually delivered by a \nnonprofit entity called Helmets to Hardhats. They train returning \nveterans so they can do these kinds of jobs. So we can make these \nquality, long-term, permanent jobs available right away here in the \nUnited States by supporting this amendment. In addition, we get more \nsafe, dependable, reliable energy.\n  Has anyone checked gas prices recently? It is more than $3.80 a \ngallon on average in this country. That is more than double what it was \nwhen this administration started in office.\n  There is another benefit as well. We reduce our dependence on oil \nfrom the Middle East. Now compare this legislation to the Veterans Job \nCorps proposal we are looking at in the bill that is under \nconsideration right now on the Senate floor. The Veterans Jobs Corps \nproposal spends $1 billion. At this time we are $16 trillion in debt, \nand that is growing. We have legislation that spends $1 billion to \ncreate government jobs for our veterans. Well, let's take a look at \nthose jobs. We want to create 20,000 jobs with that $1 billion, so that \nmeans $50,000 a job for 1 year. Then what do we do? We spent $1 \nbillion, we created a bunch of temporary jobs for 1 year. Then what do \nour veterans do? Do we spend more to try to keep this going? Where does \nthis go?\n  Instead of doing that, by approving this legislation I have offered, \nwe can create thousands of more jobs and we don't spend anything and it \ncreates tax revenues, it creates economic activity, and it reduces the \ndeficit. It also helps us generate more energy for this country instead \nof more government spending, a bigger deficit, and temporary jobs.\n  I think our veterans would very much appreciate knowing that they are \nworking on producing and transporting more energy for the country and \nthat they are helping to reduce gas prices at the pump for our hard-\nworking taxpayers and our consumers. I think they would also appreciate \nthe fact that we are working to reduce our dependence on oil from the \nMiddle East. Maybe that way we would not have to send them back to the \nMiddle East for energy or security reasons. I think our veterans would \nappreciate that.\n  The proposal we are putting forward creates permanent jobs, and it \ncreates them the right way. I encourage support for it because it is \nabout supporting and creating jobs in this country the right way and \nsupporting jobs for our veterans.\n  This amendment is about jobs, and it will help our veterans. It is \nabout energy that will help hard-working Americans with gas prices at \nthe pump. It is about economic growth which will help our economy. \nEconomic growth and better control of spending is what we need to do to \naddress the deficit and the debt. This legislation is about energy \nsecurity, to make our Nation more energy secure.\n  Here are my concluding questions: Why wouldn't we vote on this \namendment? Why wouldn't we have a vote on this amendment? Why wouldn't \nwe approve it for the benefit of our economy, for the benefit of the \nAmerican people in our country and for the benefit of our veterans?\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Ryan Budget Plan\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is nice to see Paul Ryan back in \nCongress. It will be even nicer to see him back as a full-time Member \nin January.\n  There has been a lot of controversy about Mr. Ryan and some of the \nthings he states, why he states them, and the contrast with what he \nsays and what he has done. Perhaps the least credible claim of all \nabout Congressman Ryan is the idea that he is a serious deficit hawk \nand that his budget is a serious attempt at deficit reduction. He is \nnot and it is not.\n  The Paul Ryan budget is about ideology rather than commonsense \nsolutions to the country's economic and fiscal problems. As more and \nmore people are learning, it certainly is not about, as Bill Clinton \nsaid, arithmetic.\n  In Ryan's budget, any savings achieved by his plan to privatize \nMedicare and gut investments in the middle-class do not go to reducing \nthe deficit. He is saying he is creating that pain because we need the \npain for deficit reduction. He uses all those savings to pay for \nfurther tax cuts to the wealthy.\n  This chart explains it pretty well. Independent studies have found \nthat the Ryan budget would raise taxes on the middle class up to \n$2,600. People earning between $50,000 and $100,000 pay $1,300 more a \nyear, people earning between $100,000 and $200,000 pay $2,600 more a \nyear, and then there is a whopping savings to people whose income is \nover $200,000.\n  As a result of the massive giveaways to the wealthiest Americans, the \nCongressional Budget Office found that Ryan's plan failed to balance \nthe budget until 2040. But even this conclusion relies on rosy \nassumptions supplied to CBO by Ryan himself.\n  Ryan's plan could take longer to improve the fiscal outlook under a \nmore realistic set of assumptions, even taking the unrealistically rosy \nassumptions that Ryan stipulates in his budget, for instance, that \nrevenue levels would be 19 percent of GDP. That is almost certainly not \ntrue. His plan would not balance the budget until 2040.\n  Independent experts, such as the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, \nchallenged these assumptions. Under more realistic assumptions, Ryan's \nplan would take far longer to balance the budget and cause the Federal \ndebt to rise even further.\n  Moreover, Ryan's spending cuts are totally unrealistic. Outside of \nMedicare and Medicaid, Mr. Ryan would slash the government, including \ndefense, to 3.75 percent of GDP by 2050. Defense alone is 4.6 percent \ntoday. According to CBO the total has never been below 8 percent since \nWorld War II and defense has never been below 3 percent. Mr. Ryan would \neither have to make massive defense cuts--the very same defense cuts he \ndecried on the campaign trail yesterday--or he would need to virtually \neliminate the rest of the government, such as transportation, security, \neducation, FBI, scientific research, and food testing. We know that is \nnot going to happen.\n\n  The larger point is this: In terms of deficit reduction, the Ryan \nplan is--there is no other way to state it--a fraud.\n  This should come as no surprise. After all, Congressman Ryan \nsupported the Bush policies that got us into this deep fiscal hole in \nthe first place. From the Bush tax cuts to two unfunded wars to the \nunpaid-for creation of Medicare Part D, Congressman Ryan's fingerprints \nare all over the big-spending\n\n[[Page S6300]]\n\nBush policies that turned Bill Clinton's surpluses into the record \ndeficits inherited by Barack Obama.\n  Ryan voted against the Simpson-Bowles framework. When Paul Ryan had a \nchance to walk the walk on deficit reduction, he joined all the other \nHouse Republicans on the Commission in voting down the report. He urged \nSpeaker Boehner to abandon the grand bargain talks with President \nObama.\n  The New York Times reported that during the summer of 2011, Ryan \nappealed to Representative Cantor to cut off negotiations between the \nSpeaker and the White House because he didn't feel the terms of the \nemerging agreement adhered strictly enough to his conservative \nprinciples and the deal might politically benefit President Obama.\n  It is not a secret the Ryan budget both hurts the middle class and \ndoes nothing for deficit reduction. The only people who would benefit \nare the very wealthy and, God bless them, they are doing well in \nAmerica, but as recent statistics just showed, they are the only people \ngaining in income.\n  One other thing I wish to add about Mr. Ryan, he seems like a nice \nman, a nice family, but his recent speeches have been so revealing. He \ndid the same thing yesterday, once again showing he has learned nothing \nfrom the mistakes he has made in the last few weeks. When it comes to \nthe big debates facing our country, Paul Ryan either has an extremely \npoor memory or he has a tendency to play fast and loose with the facts. \nIn one speech, Congressman Ryan falsely blamed President Obama for \nshuttering the GM plant that actually announced it was closing during \nPresident Bush's term; for $716 million in Medicare savings that \nCongressman Ryan included in his own budget; and, third, for the \nSimpson-Bowles blueprint that Congressman Ryan himself voted against. \nThat is just a sampling.\n  Just yesterday he did it again. There you go again, Paul Ryan. He was \ngiving a speech back in Wisconsin when he blamed the President--solely \nthe President--for the year-end trigger, the sequestration, that was \npart of the Budget Control Act. Never mind that Congressman Ryan voted \nfor the very same sequestration himself. Never mind it was his side's \nidea, in fact, to hold our credit rating hostage in the first place and \ninsist on these dollar-for-dollar cuts he now decries. Never mind the \nfact that we all know that if Paul Ryan had opposed the sequestration \nproposal--the chairman of the Budget Committee in the House--it \ncertainly would have failed. Now he goes to Wisconsin and said the \nPresident is to blame for sequestration. It is the same thing he did \nwith Simpson-Bowles. It is not fair. It is not right. All we can do is \nshake our heads at this ``what is good for me is not good for you'' \nkind of double standard.\n  I would say to Paul Ryan: You haven't learned much from your mistakes \nin the past few weeks. There you go again. Your budget proves it, and \neven your speeches, including the one yesterday, prove it again.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          VAWA Reauthorization\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, today marks 18 years to the day since \nPresident Clinton signed the Violence Against Women Act into law. Since \nthat day, this law has protected countless women across the country, as \nseen most directly by the fact that annual rates of domestic violence \nhave dropped by more than 60 percent.\n  Today also marks a far less celebratory day in the history of this \ncritical bill. That is because today is also the 139th day of delay by \nthe House of Representatives since the Senate passed an inclusive, \nbipartisan VAWA bill by a vote of 68 to 31. It marks 139 days since \nHouse Republicans decided not to follow suit and to instead pass a \nversion of our legislation that stripped vital protections included in \nour Senate bill--provisions that protect some of the most at-risk women \nin our country.\n  It has now been 139 days since 15 Senate Republicans stood to join \nwith us to pass this legislation because they knew the history of this \nbill. They knew that every time the Violence Against Women Act has been \nreauthorized, it has consistently included bipartisan provisions to \nexpand protections to women who were not previously covered. They \nunderstand that domestic violence protections for all women shouldn't \nbe a Democratic or a Republican issue.\n  I hope Speaker Boehner and our colleagues in the House hear this: We \nare not backing down and we will keep fighting because 139 days is \ninexcusable. In fact, 1 day is inexcusable. It is now long past time \nfor Speaker Boehner to look beyond ideology and partisan politics. \nTheir obstruction clearly is taking a toll on women across this \ncountry.\n  In fact, for Native and immigrant women and LGBT individuals, every \nmoment our inclusive legislation to reauthorize VAWA is delayed is \nanother moment they are left without the resources and protection they \ndeserve. The numbers are staggering. One in three--one in three--Native \nwomen will be raped in their lifetime, two in five are victims of \ndomestic violence, and Native women are killed at 10 times the rate of \nthe national average.\n  These shocking statistics aren't isolated to one group of women; 25 \nto 35 percent of women in the LGBT community experience domestic \nviolence in their relationship, and three in four abused immigrant \nwomen never entered the process to obtain legal status even though they \nwere eligible because their abuser husbands never filed the paperwork.\n  While these numbers are frightening, what is even tougher is when we \nsit down face to face with women who are at risk of being left out of \nthis bill. Over this last August recess I held a number of roundtables \nin different corners of my State with women who had been trapped in \nabusive relationships. Many of them are from the communities of the \nwomen whom the House Republicans refuse to extend these provisions to. \nThrough painful memories and many tears, they told me about how they \nfeel all alone. Numerous women who are immigrants talked about how they \nwere scared for themselves or their children, so they didn't report \ntheir husbands or boyfriends. Tribal women talked about how not only \nhave they been abused but how they then had to watch their abuser do \nthe same thing to other women on their reservation with no recourse.\n\n  Every moment the House of Representatives continues to delay is \nanother moment these women and 30 million women similar to them are \nleft without the protections they deserve.\n  These statistics should make it perfectly clear to our colleagues in \nthe other Chamber that their current inaction has a real impact on the \nlives of women across America who are affected by violence. Where a \nperson lives, their immigration status, whom they love should not \ndetermine whether the perpetrators of domestic violence are brought to \njustice.\n  These women cannot afford any further delay--not on this bill. We all \nknow what it will take to move this bill forward: leadership from \nSpeaker Boehner. Today, the effort we started in the Senate in May--an \neffort that will continue for as long as it takes--is a call for the \nvery same thing: leadership. It is time for Speaker Boehner to look \nbeyond ideology and partisan politics. It is time for him to look at \nthe history of a bill that again and again has been supported and \nexpanded by both Republicans and Democrats.\n  For 18 years this bill has expanded protection for vulnerable women. \nFor the last 139 days, Speaker Boehner and House Republicans have put \nthis legacy at risk. It is time for them to do the right thing and pass \nthe Senate's inclusive bipartisan Violence Against Women Act.\n  Senator Leahy, who is chair of the Judiciary Committee, will be here \nshortly. He has put tremendous effort into making sure this bill is \npassed in a way that includes women across this country. We owe him a \ndebt of gratitude, as well as all the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, some of whom will be here over the next hour to talk.\n\n[[Page S6301]]\n\n  Again, we are here to remind everyone there are women in this country \nwho do not receive the protections of the domestic violence law that \nwas passed. We are here to make sure we are going to stand for them and \nkeep pushing until Speaker Boehner takes up this bill and passes it to \nprotect women.\n  I see Senator Leahy arriving on the floor just as I was speaking \nabout him. He will be speaking about this issue. We owe him a debt of \ngratitude for standing for women across this country but especially \nfor, this time, fighting to make sure this is an inclusive bill, passed \non a bipartisan vote out of the Senate, and one that will change the \nlives of so many women. We owe it to them and Speaker Boehner owes it \nto them to take up this bill and pass it.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator for her \nkind comments. She knows that this, whether in Washington State or the \nState of Vermont, is a major issue. She has voted for and supported the \nLeahy-Crapo bill, as has the distinguished Presiding Officer. I have \nsaid so many times on this floor that violence is violence is violence \nand abuse is abuse is abuse, and this should not be a partisan issue.\n  Two weeks ago, in Tampa, Republican leaders from Congress and around \nthe country sought to make clear their commitment to advancing causes \nimportant to women. Well, I will say as a Democrat I was pleased to see \nthat commitment from the Republican Party. But now I hope they will put \nthose words into action and prove that this was not just campaign \nrhetoric. While they have not asked me for advice, I would give some \nadvice to my Republican friends. If they do want to show their \ncommitment to women, one significant step Republicans should take would \nbe to help us reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.\n  It was signed into law 18 years ago today--18 years ago today. I \nremember that day. I was there. As one of those who helped draft it, I \nwas so proud to see it signed into law.\n  This landmark bill, which fundamentally changed the way our country \nresponds to domestic and sexual violence, expired, though, 1 year ago \nthis month. There is no good reason why we cannot all work together to \nsee that this lifesaving law is reauthorized immediately. It should not \nbe a Republican or Democratic issue. It is an American issue. How can \npeople say they are not opposed to violence against women?\n  Just yesterday, the Republican attorney general from Utah and the \nDemocratic attorney general from Maryland--people who have completely \ndifferent philosophies--called on Congress to pass the Senate bill, \nwhich covers all victims, including immigrant women. In their guest \ncolumn in Politico, the two noted that the bipartisan Senate bill would \ngive ``a significant boost for law enforcement and public safety.'' At \nthe same time, they said the politically charged House bill ``seeks to \nturn a bipartisan concern for abuse survivors into a partisan wedge'' \nand ``dramatically roll[s] back important protections for battered \nimmigrant women and their children.''\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Politico column, \nalong with a statement released today by Attorney General Holder on the \n18th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act, be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. You hear these continued calls for action. We know the \nLeahy-Crapo reauthorization bill passed the Senate with a strong \nbipartisan majority of 68 votes. Every woman in the Senate--Republican \nand Democrat alike--voted for it. But Republican leaders in both the \nHouse and the Senate have hidden behind a procedural technicality. They \nrefuse to allow the House to vote on the Senate bill.\n  Well, that obstruction has to end. Too many lives are on the line to \nplay these political games. Here in the Senate, we have twice asked \nRepublican leaders to agree to take up a House revenue bill, substitute \nthe bipartisan Senate VAWA bill, and send it to the House immediately \nto overcome this procedural concern. Each time they have refused this \ncommonsense resolution. This contrasts how we moved forward earlier \nthis year using the same process to overcome similar technical hurdles \nwith both the Transportation bill and the FAA reauthorization \nlegislation. So with a little bit of cooperation from the other side we \ncould move VAWA now.\n  People watching this and listening to this might think: Well, these \nare technical and arcane procedures. They are technical and arcane \nprocedures. But they are stopping us from moving forward with the \nViolence Against Women Act. We can set them aside for Transportation \nand the FAA--both important things--but if you are somebody who has \nbeen battered and abused, if you are near death, do not talk to that \nperson about technicalities.\n  I have said many times on this floor--I still have nightmares from \nsome of the crime scenes I went to as a young prosecutor. It was always \nat 2 and 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning. The ones easiest to handle \nwere those where the victim lived, although sometimes just barely. I \nremember riding in the ambulance with a victim on the way to the \nemergency room to find out what happened. Many other times we were \nthere waiting for the coroner to arrive because the body was on the \nfloor.\n  I wish everybody who is hiding behind these technicalities would come \nwith those of us from both parties, those of us who have been \nprosecutors, who have gone to those crime scenes. I guarantee you, they \nwould be back here saying: Get rid of those technicalities.\n  I cannot understand the House Republican leadership hiding behind \nthis excuse to avoid debating and voting on the bipartisan Senate bill. \nThis is a good bill. It brought Republicans and Democrats together in \nthis body across the political spectrum. The House Republican \nleadership should stop blocking it on this obscure technicality. The \nSpeaker can waive the technicality. The House could vote on the Senate \nbill any time.\n  I would like to see people stand up and say: Yes, I want to stop \nviolence against women or I am going to vote ``no.'' Right now they are \nallowed to vote ``maybe.'' No victim wants to hear ``maybe.'' They want \nus to do something. Both in the House and the Senate, we have a \nprivileged position as Members. Do not hide behind a technicality. Have \nthe courage--have the courage--to stand up and vote ``yes'' or ``no.''\n  The House Republicans could have allowed a vote on the text of the \nSenate bill as a House amendment or a House bill. Instead, they are \nchoosing to hold up VAWA reauthorization for all victims. Please \nreconsider. Move forward with us to protect all victims of violence. \nAnd if you are unwilling to do that, if you are going to stand behind \nthis, do not go home and campaign and say you have a commitment to \nwomen.\n  Battered women are in all categories. They go across all political \nspectrums. They go across all economic spectrums. Do not go back home \nand say: I am standing up for you. No, you are not standing up. You are \nhiding. You are hiding. You are hiding behind a technicality. Well, \nthese victims cannot hide. They are sought out, and they become \nvictims. Let's do something for them.\n  Our bill was developed with the input of victims and the service \nproviders who work with them day in and day out. It helps women who are \nvictims of terrible crimes--the very people we claim we want to support \nand protect. It does so in important and responsible ways. Do not go \nhome and say: I stand up for all of you; do not go home and say: I am \nstanding for law enforcement; do not go home and say: I want people \nprotected when you refuse to step around a procedural motion and \nprotect them. Do not be that hypocritical.\n  We have only a few precious days left this Congress to reauthorize \nthe Violence Against Women Act. If the Republican leadership wants to \nhelp end domestic and sexual violence, well then, do so. Now is the \ntime to act. Do not hide behind fiction. Have the courage to stand up \nand say you are on the side of victims. And if you are not on their \nside, then stand up and vote against them. Do not vote ``maybe.'' Do \nnot hide behind a technicality. It is time to make good on our promise \nto\n\n[[Page S6302]]\n\nthe victims of these horrible crimes. Helping them--no matter who they \nare--has to be our goal. Their lives depend upon it. Our lives do not \ndepend upon it, but their lives depend upon it. They are counting on \nus. It is time to stand up.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                    [From Politico, Sept. 11, 2012]\n\n     Weakening Violence Against Women Act Betrays Immigrant Victims\n\n                  (By Mark Shurtleff and Doug Gansler)\n\n       All women who have lived through violence and abuse should \n     have the certainty that the law will protect them--no matter \n     their race, creed, color, religion or immigration status. \n     Unfortunately, Congress is now considering proposals that \n     would erode this certainty--and its failure to act is already \n     causing harm.\n       We urge congressional leaders to move forward now to \n     reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, without \n     provisions harmful to immigrants.\n       As long-time law enforcement leaders, we know this act is \n     crucial. Since passage in 1994, it has helped cut domestic \n     violence by more than half. Still, the scourge of domestic \n     violence remains a serious problem: One in four women \n     experiences an act of domestic violence or sexual assault in \n     her lifetime, and three women die every day at the hands of \n     abusive husbands or partners.\n       Rates of trafficking women--often from one abusive context \n     to another--are also alarmingly high. Roughly 100,000 \n     survivors of human trafficking live in the United States \n     today, according to the State Department, whose estimates \n     suggest as many as 17,500 foreign-born victims are illegally \n     brought in each year.\n       We need every available tool to fight these serious crimes, \n     so we fully support reauthorization of the Violence Against \n     Women Act--but not in a dangerously altered form that would \n     harm vulnerable immigrant women.\n       We don't use ``dangerously'' lightly. When the House sought \n     reauthorization, legislators made changes that dramatically \n     roll back important protections for battered immigrant women \n     and their children--leaving them vulnerable to abuse and, \n     worse, death at the hands of an abuser.\n       Several House provisions would further endanger immigrant \n     survivors of human trafficking and domestic abuse. These \n     provisions would leave them no legal way to break the cycle \n     of violence in which they are trapped and leave law \n     enforcement no way to bring perpetrators to justice. The \n     changes, for example, would discourage immigrant survivors \n     from calling the police, for fear of immigration issues--so \n     police can't intervene and save their lives.\n       For many of these women, immigration status is one more \n     weapon that abusers use to intimidate them. Abusers often \n     threaten, ``You can't call the police. They'll just deport \n     you.''\n       Under the existing law, our response is clear: ``He's \n     wrong. You're safe.'' If we certify that a victim was helpful \n     to law enforcement during an investigation, she can seek \n     special legal immigration status--known as a U visa.\n       But the House bill would make this visa temporary and take \n     away an immigrant survivor's incentive to come forward. \n     ``He's wrong; you're safe'' would be replaced with the far \n     less reassuring message ``You'll have to wait and see.''\n       What kind of person does the U visa help? Consider \n     ``Stephanie,'' an immigrant living in Maryland who lacked \n     work authorization. She had already been sexually harassed by \n     work supervisors when a stranger followed her into a room in \n     the building where she was working and tried to rape her. \n     Stephanie was able to fight him off and immediately reported \n     the incident to police, who found the man nearby and arrested \n     him.\n       After reporting the terrible crime, Stephanie learned she \n     would be eligible for a U visa for her cooperation with \n     police and the state's attorney. Her assistance helped get a \n     rapist off the streets. Today, Stephanie has her U visa and \n     is confident and self-supporting.\n       The House bill would silence thousands of women like \n     Stephanie and derail our efforts to put their attackers \n     behind bars. Worse, it would further endanger some of the \n     very women whom the Violence Against Women Act is meant to \n     help.\n       In late August, we received a reminder of reauthorization's \n     urgency. Our immigration authorities announced that they had \n     reached the limit of 10,000 U visas for the current fiscal \n     year, leaving a six-week gap before the new fiscal year \n     brings a fresh allotment. In the meantime, lives are at risk.\n       The Senate's bipartisan reauthorization bill would increase \n     that visa limit to 15,000, a significant boost for law \n     enforcement and public safety.\n       The law enforcement community now has 17 years of \n     experience with the Violence Against Women Act and has used \n     it successfully to combat human trafficking, sexual assault \n     and domestic violence. We have relied on it to protect \n     survivors of all stripes and hold their abusers accountable.\n       These abusers don't differentiate by race, creed, color, \n     religion or immigration status. In seeking justice for \n     survivors, neither should we.\n       The House version of the Violence Against Women Act \n     reauthorization seeks to turn a bipartisan concern for abuse \n     survivors into a partisan wedge. Congress must not let \n     partisanship stand in the way of our work to protect all \n     women, and their families, from harm.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Department of Justice\n\n                        Office of Public Affairs\n\n         [For Immediate Release--Thursday, September 13, 2012]\n\n\nStatement from Attorney General Eric Holder on the 18th Anniversary of \n                     the Violence Against Women Act\n\n       Attorney General Eric Holder released the following \n     statement today on the 18th anniversary of the Violence \n     Against Women Act:\n       ``Since the landmark Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) \n     became law 18 years ago today, VAWA has vastly improved our \n     ability to address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \n     assault, and stalking and has helped countless victims of \n     these crimes get access to needed services. It's important to \n     remember that none of this progress has been inevitable--it \n     has been the result of the tireless work of advocates, law \n     enforcement, prosecutors, and others. On the front lines of \n     this effort, the Office on Violence Against Women administers \n     VAWA programs, providing states, territories, local and \n     tribal governments, and nonprofit organizations with critical \n     resources to initiate and sustain efforts to reduce and stop \n     violence against women. As Congress moves to consider \n     reauthorizing this critical law, we urge lawmakers to come \n     together on a bipartisan basis, as it has historically, to \n     pass a VAWA reauthorization that expands rather than limits \n     victim access to justice and strengthens law enforcement and \n     prosecutorial tools to seek justice and hold violators \n     accountable. VAWA has been strengthened each time it has been \n     reauthorized, with bipartisan support, and this year after 18 \n     years of progress, it should be no different.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, before Senator Leahy leaves the floor, I \nwant to thank him from the bottom of my heart. What he has shown is \nthat he can team up in a bipartisan way to help the women of this \ncountry avoid needless, senseless, dangerous violence. I thank the \nSenator, and I stand here to support his efforts.\n  The Leahy-Crapo bill is the bill we need to pass. Why? Because it is \nthe bill that includes everyone. We do not want to leave out 30 million \npeople. We do not want to leave 30 million people out of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. That is what the House of Representatives does \nbecause they leave out immigrant people, they leave out the gay and \nlesbian community, they leave out students and Native Americans.\n  When you look at those women and those groups, you find out, indeed, \nthey have a very high percentage of violence in their communities--\nviolence against women that leaves women in deep trouble and threatens \ntheir lives. So only the Leahy-Crapo bill--only the Senate bill--which \npassed here with such a great number of votes can include everyone.\n  So if you take, for example, Cristina, in my home State of \nCalifornia, whose boss threatened her with deportation unless she \ncomplied with his demands for sex, she is not covered in the House \nbill. This is a woman who is essentially being held hostage by her \nboss. He is using his power over her, and she is not covered by the \nHouse bill.\n  The House bill, again, fails to protect LGBT individuals when they \nhave problems with abusive partners and have been turned away in the \npast from shelters because the Violence Against Women Act did not cover \nthe LGBT community.\n  Mika is a student who struggled to get her college to enforce a \nrestraining order against her boyfriend after he had assaulted her and \nstalked her. She should not have had to struggle. Under the Leahy-Crapo \nSenate Violence Against Women Act, Mika will be covered.\n  Then-Senator Joe Biden, now Vice President Biden, wrote the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. It was a long time ago. I was in the House, and I \nwas so honored when Joe Biden came and asked me to carry the House \nversion of the bill. I did that, and I remember being so proud because \nJoe was such a leader on this and he had the faith in me to ask me to \nhelp him.\n\n[[Page S6303]]\n\n  But I can tell you, it was a struggle to get it done. It took several \nyears to get it done. And when I got to the Senate, I watched Joe Biden \nteam up with Senator Hatch, and I helped them on the floor. I was only \nable to get a portion of the bill passed in the House, so there was a \nlot more we needed to do, and we did it.\n  I want to read a statement that Vice President Biden made today--he \njust sent it out--because it speaks to this issue. He said:\n\n       Eighteen years ago today, the landmark Violence Against \n     Women Act was signed into law. It was founded on the basic \n     premise that every woman deserves to be safe from violence, \n     and since its passage, we have made tremendous strides \n     towards achieving that goal. We gave law enforcement and the \n     courts more tools to combat domestic violence and hold \n     offenders accountable. We created a national hotline to \n     direct victims to life-saving assistance. And since VAWA \n     passed, annual rates of domestic violence have dropped by \n     more than 60 percent.\n\n  It is important to reflect on what Vice President Biden is saying. \nBecause of the Violence Against Women Act, we have seen a drop in the \nannual rate of domestic violence by more than 60 percent. And now we \nare here to say: Let's make it even better by including 30 million \npeople who were left out of the bill.\n  Quoting the Vice President, he says:\n\n       But we still have much work to do. Three women still die \n     every day as a result of domestic violence. One in five women \n     have been raped, many as teenagers, and one in six women have \n     been victims of stalking.\n\n  He writes:\n\n       While women and girls face these devastating realities \n     every day, reauthorization of the strengthened VAWA \n     languishes in Congress. VAWA is just as important today as \n     when it first became law, and I urge Congress to keep the \n     promise me made to our daughters and our granddaughters on \n     that day--that we would work together to keep them safe.\n\n  In closing, because I see Senator Coons is here--we are so happy he \nis here to talk on this issue, I feel it is important to note that over \n900 groups nationwide have signed a letter in support of the bill that \nincludes these 30 million people--that includes everyone. We know this \nlaw is working. On today, the 18th anniversary of the VAWA being signed \ninto law by Bill Clinton, let's pass this legislation and send it to \nPresident Obama, legislation that strengthens the law, is bipartisan \nlike the Leahy-Crapo bill, and includes everyone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise today in honor of the 18th \nanniversary of the signing of the Violence Against Women Act into law. \nAs my good friend and colleague the Senator from California has just \nreminded all of us, it was my home State Senator, now our Vice \nPresident, Joe Biden, whose leadership in getting the Violence Against \nWomen Act signed into law in the first place, moved us in this country \ntoward a society that is more just, that is more safe, that is more \nwelcoming.\n  It is, in my view, incredibly discouraging that we are fighting today \nin the Congress a battle that he made such great early progress on and \nthat should have been won decades ago. Why must we fight in 2012 such a \nprotracted legislative battle to maintain, strengthen, and secure the \nrights of more than half of the population of this country and to \nextend the lifesaving programs supported by VAWA to those who need them \nof every background all across our country?\n  It cannot be that it is because those who oppose VAWA's \nreauthorization believe that violence against women is no longer a \nthreat. In my own home county, New Castle County, DE, earlier this year \na man was arrested after a horrifying assault on his ex-girlfriend, \ncommitted in front of all five of her children. The victim's teenage \nson called 9-1-1 in a panic, terrified. This incident, one of sadly \nmany in my home community, is just another stark example of how \ndomestic violence continues to hurt and harm not just its victims but \nentire families, not just the woman or occasionally men who are the \nvictims of domestic violence but the children who witness it and whose \nlives are changed by it.\n  In a world where this sort of violence continues to happen in all our \ncommunities, we still need the Violence Against Women Act. We need it \nto be reauthorized. We need it to be reauthorized and strengthened. We \nneed it to be reauthorized, strengthened, and broadened. It has been a \nfull year since VAWA expired, and still we do not have a \nreauthorization signed into law. Reauthorization is a real opportunity, \none built into the initial act, that requires us as a body, the House \nand Senate together, to sit down and sift through the data and to \nexamine how these programs can be better, stronger, more efficient, and \nmore effective. Every 5 years we have to take a hard look at where we \nare failing and where we are succeeding in this important work against \ndomestic violence, the scourge that lives in the dark throughout our \ncommunity.\n  Here in the Senate we have done that work. The House, sadly, has not. \nIn my view, we must not let them be a roadblock to the critical \nprogress we have been called upon to make. This is our time to make the \nnecessary changes to improve VAWA and to reauthorize it, and we will \nnot back down.\n  In this year's reauthorization we made a number of critical changes, \npositive changes, and two that are particularly important to me: First, \nensuring that every victim of abuse in this country is able to count on \nthe law to protect them, regardless of who they are, where they live, \nor whom they love; and, second, ensuring that we reduce bureaucracy and \nstrengthen accountability, to ensure that taxpayer dollars authorized \nthrough VAWA are spent wisely, responsibly, and effectively.\n  The Senate reauthorization moves us forward by adding protections for \nvictims of domestic violence regardless of their sexual orientation. \nThe reality is, as we learned in reexamining VAWA and the experiences \nof the last 5 years, sadly the reality is that lesbian, gay, bisexual, \nand transgender Americans experience domestic violence at the same \npercentage as relationships in the general population, a shocking 25 to \n30 percent of all relationships. Yet nearly half of LBGTQ victims are \nturned away from domestic violence shelters and one-quarter are \nunjustly arrested as if they were the perpetrators.\n  The Senate reauthorization makes plain that discrimination is not the \npolicy of these United States. It says no program funded by Federal \nVAWA dollars can turn away a domestic violence victim because of their \nsexual orientation or their gender identity, whether the victim is gay \nor straight, American Indian, White, Black, or Latino. In my view, and \nthe view of so many in this Chamber, they deserve protection from abuse \nand justice for their abusers.\n  There are two other important changes in this VAWA reauthorization as \npassed through the Senate, both of which help ensure we bring \nperpetrators to justice no matter who their victims are or where their \ncrimes are committed. These provisions support victims of crime \ncommitted on tribal lands and help law enforcement to secure needed \ntestimony from victims who are unwilling to come forward due to \nreasonable fear of deportation.\n  So in total I think all three of these important changes to the \nsubstance and scope of VAWA strengthen it, carry forward its initial \nspirit, and are completely appropriate things for this Senate and the \nHouse to do in our every 5-year reconsideration and reauthorization of \nVAWA.\n  It is important to remember that VAWA goes beyond basic justice for \nour fellow citizens. It supports the investigation and prosecution of \nviolent crime. Delaying this reauthorization means denying essential \ntools to law enforcement officers in my home State of Delaware and the \nPresiding Officer's home State of North Carolina and all across our \ncountry.\n  As someone who used to be directly responsible for a county police \ndepartment, who worked in close partnership with all of the different \nelements, all the different nonprofit groups and civic and community \ngroups, all of the elements from corrections to law enforcement to \nadvocates to providers of services that were brought together in a \npositive and cohesive way by VAWA, I know how important this is to a \nholistic approach to combating domestic violence.\n  If we are to tackle a problem this large, this pervasive, this \ndangerous, we need well-trained and dedicated law\n\n[[Page S6304]]\n\nenforcement officers. We also need support from the whole community to \nprovide the whole broad range of services that can continue to make \nprogress in pressing back on this evil in our country.\n  In Delaware, that is exactly want we have done. In Delaware, VAWA has \nfostered a community of those dedicated to reducing violence, allowing \neach group to reinforce the other, and adding value that individual \nprograms alone could not create. VAWA touches on everything from \ntransitional housing to national hotlines, from the safe exchange of \nchildren to increased awareness on college campuses, from law \nenforcement grants in rural communities to sexual assault service \nprograms in urban communities--not only for women, for men, for \nchildren but for whole families and whole communities.\n  VAWA is an important piece of legislation, and that it sits \nunauthorized in the other Chamber of this Congress is, to me, a great \nshame and a great tragedy. We must not allow this anniversary of its \ninitial signing into law to pass without redoubling our efforts and \nredoubling our commitment.\n  My colleagues who oppose this reauthorization put all of this \nprogress at risk. Their insistence on excluding some of our friends and \nneighbors just because of their background or their sexual orientation \nis unconscionable. We will keep fighting to secure VAWA reauthorization \nthis year because the safety of our communities depends upon it and \nsimple justice calls for it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I am here today to talk about the \nViolence Against Women Reauthorization Act which, as you know, we \npassed in April with the leadership of Senator Leahy and with the \ncosponsorship of Senator Crapo. We got that strong bipartisan bill \nthrough the Senate on a 68-to-31 vote.\n  As you know, all women Senators, Democrats and Republicans, supported \nthat bill, just like the two prior reauthorizations from 2000 and 2006. \nThis bill improves the current law in many ways to better address \ndomestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. We have heard from a \nlong list of experts in our Judiciary Committee about the changes that \nwere needed for this reauthorization, and we incorporated those ideas \nand language from people on the front line.\n  As a result, this bill, this bipartisan reauthorization bill, is \nstrongly supported by law enforcement, victim service providers, and \nfaith groups across the country. I want to talk about some of the ways \nthat this reauthorization bill builds upon the improvement that past \nreauthorizations made, but first I think it is important to mention the \nbipartisan bill does not ignore the current budget climate. It \nconsolidates 13 programs in only 4. So when I hear about the old bill, \nto keep it going, this bill is actually better from an efficiency \nstandpoint. It consolidates 13 programs into 4 in an effort to reduce \nduplication and bureaucratic redtape. It also cuts the authorization \nlevel for VAWA by more than $135 million a year. That is a 17-percent \ndecrease from the 2006 reauthorization. So this was a clear \nacknowledgement that our country is going to have to make some changes \nin our fiscal situation as we go into this next year. That was one of \nthe reasons this new bill, this reauthorization, was so important.\n  We are doing more with less. No existing grant program receives an \nincrease in authorization levels in this bill, and the legislation \ncreates only one new program, at $5 million a year. That new program \nwill support travel efforts to combat domestic violence on \nreservations.\n  In terms of policy, one of the biggest changes in this year's \nviolence against women reauthorization is a greater focus on preventing \nand responding to sexual assault. We still have a lot of work to do in \nreducing sexual assault in America where nearly one in five women has \nbeen raped at some point in their lives, and over 42 percent were raped \nbefore the age of 18.\n  As a former prosecutor, I am all too aware of the fact that \nprosecution and conviction rates for sexual assault are among the \nlowest for any violent crime. So in an effort to solve that problem, \nthis year's reauthorization opens funding to programs that are more \ndirectly responsive to the needs of sexual assault survivors.\n  I woke up this morning and read my town newspaper in the Twin Cities \nand saw that a 30-year-old rape-murder case was solved--30 years old. \nYou think of the new technology that is available. It was solved \nbecause they kept the DNA from the scene. They were able to match it to \nsomeone in another State who had been imprisoned. They were able to \ncharge that case. Think of the justice for those family members and \nalso for the rest of the country where, hopefully, this conviction will \nbe made. They will be able to make sure that person is behind bars \nforever.\n  Those are the kinds of things that happen in this day with the new \ntechnology, but unless we have people trained to use that technology, \nunless we have people who are able to work with victims, unless we have \nvictims who feel comfortable coming forward when they are sexually \nassaulted or a victim of domestic assault, none of it means anything to \nthis system. That is why the VAWA bill is so important.\n  Another area of improvement in this bill is the effort to more \neffectively provide services to victims from traditionally underserved \ncommunities. This bill adds new definitions that will help make sure \nVAWA-funded programs provide a variety of services that address the \nneeds of racial and ethnic minorities.\n  As Chairman Leahy's committee report points out, studies indicated \nthat women of color are reluctant to turn to traditional domestic \nviolence programs, and culturally specific programming may be more \neffective in meeting their needs. Our recent National Institute of \nJustice study found that women of color may be less likely to receive \nall the services they need.\n  Domestic violence and sexual assault are problems that affect \neveryone in this country, and this new bill, this reauthorization bill, \nrecognizes that fact. The Senate version of the VAWA reauthorization \nalso includes a number of improvements that specifically address the \nneeds of women living in tribal areas. It is a sad reality that Native \nAmerican women experience rates of domestic violence and sexual assault \nthat are significantly higher than the national average. So the VAWA \nreauthorization strengthens existing efforts to confront the ongoing \nepidemic of violence on tribal lands by expanding the tools available \nto Federal law enforcement.\n\n  The Judiciary Committee worked closely with the Indian Affairs \nCommittee to craft the most effective responses to the frighteningly \nhigh levels of domestic violence and sexual assault in tribal areas. \nOne important provision gives tribal courts jurisdiction over a non-\nNative American who has committed acts of domestic violence against \nNative American women in a small subset of cases that meet three \nspecific criteria: No. 1, the crime must have occurred on a \nreservation; No. 2, the crime must be domestic violence; and No. 3, the \ndefendant must live on a reservation. Why did we do this? Because we \nknow a lot of these cases weren't being reported. These cases weren't \nbeing prosecuted. It is very difficult sometimes for State and Federal \nauthorities, with their limited resources, to come in and handle these \ncases. It was simply a pragmatic response to a legal issue, and it is \nsomething which, as I said, in the Senate got broad bipartisan support. \nWe have a significant Native American population in my State, so this \nchange and several others will be very helpful in cracking down on \nthese crimes.\n  Finally, I will briefly mention one part of this reauthorization on \nwhich I worked hard. And I see Senator Hutchison of Texas in the \nChamber, and it is good to see her because I am going to be talking \nabout the amendment she and I worked on together, and that is an \nupdating of our stalking laws.\n  Current law focuses on what the victim knows and requires prosecutors \nto show that the victim experienced a certain level of fear in order to \nsecure a\n\n[[Page S6305]]\n\nconviction. But sometimes the victims of stalkers, particularly high-\ntech stalkers--stalkers who are putting camera equipment and little \npeepholes in hotel rooms, stalkers who are using the Internet--aren't \neven aware of what the stalker is doing until later, until suddenly \nthey see a picture of themselves undressing or a picture of themselves \nwithout clothes on the Internet being distributed across the entire \ncountry, across the entire world, which is a real case that happened in \nthis country with a sports reporter.\n  Those are the kinds of things we are now seeing. So while they are \nexperiencing it, they do not have that level of fear because it happens \nlater. What we have done--Senator Hutchison and I and others--is to \nupdate the stalking law she was involved in before I even came to the \nSenate. We have updated that law to make it as sophisticated as the \npeople who are committing these crimes.\n  This is just a sampling of some of the important changes in this \nreauthorization bill. It is basically about making the Violence Against \nWomen Act, which has been so important to our country and to women in \nthis country, making it more efficient and updating it for where the \nreal needs are. Things change over time. We learn new law enforcement \ntechniques, and we have to be able to put those into action. That is \nwhat this is about.\n  For me, this is about Officer Shawn Schneider, an officer in Lake \nCity, MN, who got called to a scene to respond to a domestic violence \ncrime. He went up to the front door, the door opened, and there was a \n17-year-old victim with a clearly agitated, mentally ill perpetrator, \nher boyfriend, who ends up shooting Officer Schneider. He died a few \ndays later, leaving behind a widow and three little kids, and his \nfuneral was right around the holidays. The last time his family had \nbeen in church was for the church pageant for Christmas. The next time \nhis family walked down the aisle of that church was for his funeral--\nthe funeral of a little girl's father. She was wearing a blue dress \ncovered in stars. That is what I remember--a little girl walking down \nthe aisle of that church at her father's funeral.\n  When I see that kind of thing, I know one thing: Domestic violence \njust doesn't have one victim; domestic violence makes an entire family \na victim, an entire community and an entire nation. And when that \nofficer was called to that scene, he didn't ask: Oh, is the victim an \nAmerican Indian? Is the victim gay? Is the victim a woman or a man? He \ndid his job. He showed up at the scene. Now it is time for us to do our \njob. The House of Representatives should pass this bill, and we should \nget this done.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I am pleased to follow the Senator \nfrom Minnesota because we did work on a piece of legislation, which she \nperfected. It was my bill that first passed on stalking that would take \nthe antistalking laws nationwide because so often it happens across \nState lines, and so we had to put it all together so that if someone \ndid cross State lines to stalk a woman or her children or a man or \nanyone, that would be prosecutable.\n  I was so pleased Senator Klobuchar then came with a bill which I was \nproud to cosponsor which updated the technology criminals now use to \nharass, scare and really make life miserable for people they know. I \nhad a stalker myself for about 12 years. I didn't know him, but he \ncertainly did make my life different, that is for sure. And sometimes \nit is worse than what I experienced because there are actual threats.\n  I will never forget the time I got a call from an attorney in the \nU.S. Attorney's Office in Austin, TX, and he said: I just wanted you to \nknow we got our first conviction under your antistalking law. It was a \nman who was harassing his ex-wife and his children, threatening them \nwith a gun, and we were able to put him away and make that family a lot \nsafer. I thought, you know, we live to actually know something we have \ndone makes a difference. So I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \ncarrying that forward.\n\n\n                     Honoring Our Foreign Servants\n\n  I rise today, Madam President, to talk about Neil Armstrong and about \nNASA, but I can't stand here today with what is going on in the Middle \nEast and not say that I join the thousands and maybe millions of others \nwho mourn the loss of a U.S. Ambassador who was killed in Libya. You \nknow, I would mourn any U.S. Ambassador who is killed in the line of \nduty, but it makes it even harder when we know this one was doing such \na great job. Christopher Stevens had dedicated his life really trying \nto make peace and trying to be a force for the positive in the Middle \nEast. He was our Ambassador to Libya.\n  I am sad to say it appears this was a plot. It was not an accident. \nIt wasn't something that happened because he happened to be in the \nconsulate. It apparently was a premeditated murder of our Ambassador. \nAnd I know the whole country mourns the loss of someone who tried so \nhard to do what is right and to then have this happen. So I want to pay \nmy respects to him and to all who knew and worked with him.\n  In the travels I have been fortunate to make as a U.S. Senator, I am \nalways so impressed with the representatives of the United States in \nour embassies and consulates throughout the world. Our Foreign Service \nrepresentatives do a fabulous job. They take their lives and put them \nin danger sometimes, especially in countries that are strife-torn, as \ncertainly Libya is right now and Egypt as well. So my great respect \ngoes out to our Foreign Service community, and I think we have just \nbeen reminded of the service they give and the sacrifices they make.\n\n\n                        Honoring Neil Armstrong\n\n  Madam President, I wish to speak today about the life of a gentle \ngiant, Neil Armstrong, and also about the future of NASA. This all came \ntogether this week because I have just returned from the National \nCathedral, where I joined congressional colleagues, Senators, and many \nothers in paying our final respects to a man who unquestionably was a \ntrue American hero. Of course, we know Neil Armstrong made world \nhistory when he stepped out on the Moon's surface for the first time an \nAmerican had done so and he uttered those words that will be forever \nenshrined in American consciousness.\n  They say that some seek fame and some have it thrust on them, but \nNeil Armstrong was the rare man who earned his fame and yet shied away \nfrom it at every turn. He preferred to live the life of, as he \ndescribed it himself, ``a white-sock, pocket-protector, nerdy \nengineer.'' He chose to live a private life rather than bask in well-\ndeserved glory. For that, he was more than a hero, he was a role model \nwe would all be fortunate to follow. We have too few of those today. \nNeil Armstrong served his country in Korea, where he was a fighter \npilot and was shot down. He certainly served at NASA, which we all \nknow, and he served his community as a professor at the University of \nCincinnati. He was a serious, dedicated scientist who loved what he did \nand just wanted to get the job done.\n  There is a story told about him of an incident that occurred during \ntraining before the Moon landing where his vehicle forced an ejection. \nHis only injury was biting his own tongue, but it was a near-death \nincident nonetheless. It was a very lucky escape. Another astronaut saw \nNeil working at his desk and said he had heard about Neil being thrown \nout of his vehicle. Then he asked when it happened, and Neil said: \nAbout an hour ago. The astronaut--Alan Bean--later told Neil's \nbiographer:\n\n       I can't think of another person, let alone another \n     astronaut, who would have just gone back to his office after \n     ejecting a fraction of a second before getting killed.\n\n  I was lucky enough to know Neil Armstrong. We first met when he, \nApollo 13 commander Jim Lovell, and Gene Cernan expressed concern over \nthe administration's proposal to abandon NASA's manned space \nexploration program. They wrote an open letter. And let me tell you, \nwhen the first and last men to set foot on the Moon had an issue with \nthe direction of NASA, everybody listened. It was a rare occasion that \nthese astronaut leaders would speak publicly on such an issue, and \nconsidering Neil's propensity to shy away from the spotlight, it had \neven more significance. But he thought it was important, and a great \nbipartisan number of our colleagues agreed it was important that he \nchose to speak out on this very important issue.\n\n[[Page S6306]]\n\n  The plan proposed canceling the existing space exploration program \nand suspending plans to build a replacement for the space shuttle. It \nplaced immediate reliance on commercial capabilities, which at the time \nwere undeveloped and unproven. Neil was particularly concerned about \nleaning too heavily on commercial crew vehicles because he rightly \nbelieved NASA should have ultimate ownership and stewardship of the \nnext phase of deep space exploration.\n  When I asked if that group would testify before the Senate Commerce \nCommittee and give us the benefit of their immense experience, Neil \nArmstrong and Gene Cernan were able to do so. Their testimony in May of \n2010 helped us craft the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2010, which we \nmanaged to pass with a balanced plan that prioritized NASA's \ndevelopment of future exploration beyond low Earth orbit, while putting \nsignificant resources into commercial development of crew vehicles to \nthe space station. We passed it unanimously in the Senate, very \nbipartisan, and we passed it on Neil Armstrong's birthday--on August 5, \n2010.\n  When the space shuttle was retired, some thought the space program \nwas ended. You know, I took a group of Cub Scouts to Johnson Space \nCenter in Houston just a few months ago. They have a great program for \nour Scouts--well, for any group who actually wants to go and spend the \nnight at the visitor's center at Johnson Space Center. They get to tour \nNASA and hear about the great feats of our country in space. And one of \nthe little boys said to our NASA administrator at Johnson: Gosh, I am \nreally sorry the space program is ending. And I was shocked and the \nadministrator was shocked, and we said: Oh, but it is not ending. The \nspace program is not ending.\n  If we allow people to think, if we allow our young--possibly the next \ngeneration of astronauts and scientists--to think the program is \nending, are they going to be inspired to take those courses in \naeronautical engineering that will give them the background to propel \nthem to the next level of space exploration that is going to do things \nmaybe we haven't even thought of yet? We would eliminate the potential \nthat manned space exploration can produce in the next decade.\n  We had a hearing in the Commerce Committee yesterday where we heard \nfrom NASA scientists about the Mars rover called Curiosity.\n  It was just breathtaking to hear the advancements that we have made \nwith that rover that is now plodding around exploring the dirt and the \nrocks and the atmosphere on Mars.\n  One of the scientists pointed out that these NASA programs aren't \njust about exploration, they result in technologies that we use every \nday and that make our lives better right here on Earth. One pointed out \nthat Curiosity is the first step in the next frontier of space, probing \nthe atmosphere and geology of Mars. Each mission will build on the \nsuccess of the last, and these robots and rovers that are going up now \nwill be the precursors to the time when we put people--astronauts--on \nMars.\n  There are myriads of practical results from NASA's programs, and \nthere are many reasons to keep them alive and fully funded, but I think \nthe astronauts--Neil Armstrong, Jim Lovell, and Gene Cernan put it best \nin their open letter:\n\n       America's space accomplishments earned the respect and \n     admiration of the world. Science probes were unlocking the \n     secrets of the cosmos. Space technology was providing \n     instantaneous worldwide communication; orbital sentinels were \n     helping man understand the vagaries of nature. Above all \n     else, the people around the world were inspired by the human \n     exploration of space and the expanding of man's frontier. It \n     suggested that what had been thought to be impossible was now \n     within reach.\n\n  Gene Cernan was one of those who gave the eulogy today at Neil \nArmstrong's memorial service at the National Cathedral. He gave a \npersonal account. They were very close friends. They went fishing \ntogether. They had a long-term and lasting mutual respect, admiration, \nand friendship.\n  America cannot lose its preeminence in space. We are the leaders of \nthe free world, and we are the natural leaders beyond its atmosphere. \nThis is not done in dominance or hegemony but to ensure that technology \ncan be used for our economic benefit. The satellites we have discovered \nwith the space exploration have transformed communications, and \nsatellite-guided missiles have given us defense capabilities that hit \nthe target with less collateral damage.\n  This is my last of 19 wonderful years in the United States Senate, \nduring which I have championed and fought for NASA and our manned \nspacecraft and space flight programs. I have worked with so many \ndedicated colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I am proud of what \nwe have accomplished. I am asking that my colleagues do not let all of \nthe hard work of the past be for nothing. We saved the manned \nexploration program, but there is so much more to be done. NASA must \ncontinue to be a priority.\n  I am a budget cutter. I will match anyone with the budget cutting \nthat I think we need to do in this country. But the key for Congress is \nto remember what the Constitution says: The purse strings belong to \nCongress. So our responsibility is to set that cap on spending--set \nthat cap at the lowest level we can and cover our functions that are \nnecessary to run the government of this country.\n  The normal average spending of the Federal Government is about 20 \npercent of our gross domestic product. We are up to 24 percent in the \nlast few years. We have to come back. We have to come back to 20. We \nmay have to go to 18 in order to end at 20, but we must not refuse to \nset the priorities that will make sure we have a strong economy in the \nfuture. We must invest in the programs that will yield the benefits \nthat will keep our economy going, our people working, and our engineers \nable to continue to produce the great things that have happened in our \nspace program, in our medical research, and more.\n  This is so important to all of us. America's competitiveness depends \non maintaining our dominance in science and technology. We cannot do it \nwithout NASA. Neil Armstrong left his mark on the American people and \non generations around the globe. This is his enduring legacy. Ours must \nbe to maintain the great organization--NASA--that made him a legend and \nhelped make America the greatest Nation on Earth.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am here on the floor again today, \nas I try to be every week, to speak about the continuing effects of \ncarbon pollution on our planet, on our climate, and on our oceans. We \nhave been away for the August recess, so it has been a while since I \nhave done that.\n  August has been somewhat eventful. We have had two party conventions, \nand we have had continued news about what is happening to our climate \nand to our world.\n  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that \nJuly was the hottest month ever in the contiguous United States in \ntheir 118 years of keeping records. According to NOAA's State of the \nClimate reports, nearly 63 percent of the country experienced moderate \nto exceptional drought in July and August. It is affecting all sorts of \nfolks--farmers, obviously. Unexpectedly high spring temperatures, for \ninstance, decimated the tart cherry production in northwest Michigan \nwhere 75 percent of the country's tart cherries are grown. Freezing \nweather, followed by a warmer than usual spring, destroyed the cherry \nbuds, and more than 90 percent of that crop was lost. Grapes and \npeaches and apple harvests were also affected. Losses from this are \nestimated at $210 million, making this year the worst year on the books \nfor Michigan fruit, just to give one example.\n  Electricity generation, of all things, was also affected. Over the \nweekend, a Washington Post article documented electricity-generating \nfacilities are struggling to supply consistent levels of electric \ngeneration because of these drought conditions. Lake Mead, Hoover Dam's \nreservoir, fell 103 feet below its targeted capacity. Low water levels \nhave hindered barge transport of coal up the Mississippi River. Eight \ncoal-fired and nuclear power plants in Illinois needed special \npermission to discharge cooling water that exceeded their Federal clean \nwater permit ceiling of 90 degrees.\n\n[[Page S6307]]\n\n  NASA scientist James Hansen published a study last month concluding \nthat the 2011 heat waves in Texas and in Oklahoma, as well as the heat \nwave at that time in Russia, were likely caused by climate change--by \nthe carbon pollution that we are emitting--with the analysis that what \nthe carbon pollution in our climate does is to load the climate dice in \nfavor of more and more extreme storms and extreme conditions like these \nheat waves.\n  Last week, the University of Colorado's National Snow and Ice Data \nCenter and NASA announced together that Arctic Sea ice has reached a \nrecord low of 1.58 million square miles--nearly 70,000 square miles \nsmaller than the previous modern low. Of course, there are still weeks \nto go in the melting season, and so it will be a lower record than \nthat.\n  In the past three decades the annual average temperatures have \nincreased twice as much over the Arctic as over the rest of the world. \nThe Arctic is really the leading edge for the climate changes that are \noccurring as a result of our carbon pollution. The average extent of \nthe Arctic Sea ice has declined by 25 to 30 percent, and the rate of \nthat decline is accelerating. Habitats are changing, extreme weather is \nincreasing, species are moving, oceans are warming and rising, and \nRepublicans and special interests are denying. They insist on keeping \ntheir heads in the sand. In this case, given the source of much of the \ndenial propaganda, it is probably safe to say that they have their \nheads in the oil sands.\n  The conventions that took place over August were instructive. I \nbelieve history will look back at the Republican Convention as a \ndisgrace of climate denial in the face of the mounting facts. By \ncontrast, President Obama pointed out clearly, simply, and plainly that \ncarbon pollution is heating our planet, that climate change is not a \nhoax, that more droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke, that \nthey are a threat to our children's future. I applaud the President for \nhis leadership in this way.\n  He was not the only Democratic leader to touch on this issue. Senator \nKerry--who gave a brilliant and passionate speech on the floor before \nthe August recess--in his remarks said this:\n\n       Despite what you heard in Tampa, an exceptional country \n     does care about the rise of the oceans and the future of the \n     planet. That is a responsibility from the Scriptures. And \n     that, too, is a responsibility of the leader of the free \n     world.\n\n  President Clinton, in his wonderful magisterial speech, lauded the \nagreement the Obama administration made with the management, labor, and \nenvironmental groups to double car mileage. He pointed out:\n\n       That was a good deal. It will make us more energy \n     independent. It will cut greenhouse gas emissions. And \n     according to several analyses, over the next 20 years, it'll \n     bring another half a million good new jobs into the American \n     economy.\n\n  Congressman Barney Frank of Massachusetts reminded us of the Romney \nwho understood climate change, who said he was for climate change--I \nthink he meant he was doing something about climate change--back when \nhe was Governor of Massachusetts. He reminded us: Now there's a Romney \nwho believes it is a myth.\n  Secretary Ken Salazar, who served with real distinction in the \nSenate, said of the deniers:\n\n       Mock our sacred responsibility as stewards of God's Earth. \n     Their attitude isn't just sad; it's reckless and it's \n     backward.\n\n  Tom Steyer is the cofounder of Advanced Energy Economy. He said this \nabout Governor Romney:\n\n       Governor Romney's road to the future will lead to dirty air \n     and increasing climate volatility, uncertainty over energy \n     prices and less security, not more.\n\n  He contrasted that with President Obama. ``President Obama's road to \nthe future,'' he said, ``will lead us to energy independence, energy \nsecurity, a safer and cleaner environment, and countless new jobs that \ncan never be outsourced.''\n  And as silent and mocking as the Republican convention and the \nRepublican candidate were on this issue, they have doubled down since \nthen. Over the weekend on ``Meet the Press,'' Mr. Romney restated that \nhe is ``not in this race to slow the rise of the oceans or to heal the \nplanet.'' His energy plan makes no mention whatsoever of climate change \nor of promoting renewable energy technology. Instead, it details how \nthe United States can exploit what the platform calls the domestic \n``cornucopia of carbon-based energy resources.''\n  Our platform makes it clear that we take this seriously.\n\n       We know that global climate change is one of the biggest \n     threats of this generation--an economic, environmental and \n     national security catastrophe in the making. We affirm the \n     science of climate change, commit to significantly reducing \n     the pollution that causes climate change, and know we have to \n     meet this challenge by driving smart policies that lead to \n     greater growth in clean energy generation and result in a \n     range of economic and social benefits.\n\n  In our national security platform we state:\n\n       The national security threat from climate change is real, \n     urgent and severe. The change wrought by a warming planet \n     will lead to new conflicts over refugees and resources; new \n     suffering from drought and famine; catastrophic natural \n     disasters and the degradation of vital ecosystems across the \n     globe.\n\n  By contrast, the Republican platform calls on Congress to take quick \naction to prohibit the EPA from moving forward with new greenhouse gas \nregulations.\n  We are at history's junction, as shown by these two conventions and \nthese two platforms. The Republicans would take us back into the past \non a tide of propaganda and denial to serve the special interests of \nthe polluters. The Obama administration would take us forward to \ncompete successfully in the world for clean energy innovation, clean \nenergy technology, and clean energy jobs. It would allow us to meet our \nresponsibility to our children and grandchildren to leave them a world \nas good as the one that was left to us. And it would, in addition, show \nthat this great experiment in human liberty, the United States of \nAmerica, this great democracy, is not for sale.\n  The findings that we made in our platform I will quote again: ``We \nknow that global climate change is one of the biggest threats of this \ngeneration . . . and we affirm the science of climate change'' follows \nthe very strong findings of the American scientific community, indeed \nthe world scientific community. Back in October 2009, a letter from a \ncoalition of respected scientific organizations said this:\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear that \n     climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research \n     demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human \n     activities are the primary driver. These conclusions are \n     based on multiple independent lines of evidence, and contrary \n     assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment of \n     the vast body of peer-reviewed science.\n\n  These were esteemed organizations: American Chemical Society, \nAmerican Meteorological Society, American Society of Agronomy, \nBotanical Society of America, and many others. They do not think the \njury is out on this question. They know that in fact the verdict is in \nand we now have a responsibility to ourselves and to the future to act.\n  Recently, Dr. Richard Muller, a converted climate skeptic, released \nfindings from his research--which was, ironically, partially funded by \nthe Koch brothers--that the Earth's land temperature has increased by \n2.5 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 250 years and 1.5 degrees of that \nover the past 50 years. He states, ``moreover, it appears likely that \nessentially all of this increase results from the human emission of \ngreenhouse gases.''\n  Another benchmark was a monitoring station in the Arctic that \nmeasured carbon dioxide at 400 parts per million for the first time. \nThis is 50 parts per million higher than the maximum contraction of \ncarbon in the atmosphere at which scientists predict a stable climate, \nand it is well outside the 170 parts per million to 370 parts per \nmillion range for carbon in our atmosphere that has persisted for the \nlast 8,000 centuries.\n  Essentially all of human development has taken place within a range \nof 170 to 300 parts per million in our atmosphere and we just broke, in \nthe Arctic, 400 parts per million for the first time. We are not just \noff the road and over the chatter strip. We are way out of history's \nline.\n  Again, we are at a junction in history. I urge we go forward, that we \ndrive our country toward successful competition for a clean energy \nfuture, that we meet our responsibility to our\n\n[[Page S6308]]\n\nchildren and our grandchildren, and that we prove to ourselves and to \nthe rest of the world that our great American experiment in human \nliberty is not for sale to the polluting industries.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes today to \ntalk about our Nation's economy. This speech is not about the economy \nthat we wish we had; this speech is not about the economy that we used \nto have; this is about the economy that we have today.\n  By now, Americans are all too familiar with the bad economic news. \nThe front page of today's Wall Street Journal provides little respite \nfrom that bad news. It reads, and here is the headline, front page: \n``Household Income Sinks To '95 Level.''\n  Let me say that again: ``Household Income Sinks To '95 Level.''\n  The President talks about moving forward. But the reality is that the \nAmerican paychecks are moving backward. The article goes on to describe \na report from the Census Bureau, a report that illustrates what \nmillions of Americans already know. We are not better off than where we \nwere last year or the year before or the year before that. In fact, the \nCensus Bureau data shows that household incomes in 2011 fell for the \nfourth consecutive year. Hard-working Americans do not need census data \nto tell them this, they know it. All they need to do is look at their \npaycheck. For many it is significantly smaller.\n  While paychecks continue to shrink, the cost of everyday living has \ngone up. Gasoline prices have gone up another 30 cents a gallon in just \nover a month. Americans recently paid the highest price ever on a Labor \nDay weekend for gasoline. One out of every seven people in America is \nnow on food stamps.\n  In 2008, that was before President Obama's election, the poverty rate \nwas 13.2 percent, and 38.8 million Americans were in poverty. This \nweek's numbers show a 16-percent increase in just 3 years. Poverty \nrates remain stuck at their highest level since 1993.\n  I made many of the same points last week in the response to the \nPresident's weekly address, but I believe it is important to make them \nagain. While many Americans worry about their shrinking paycheck, far \ntoo many others have no paycheck at all. Today, 23 million Americans \nare unemployed or underemployed. Many of these folks are our friends, \nour neighbors, and family members. The undeniable truth is President \nObama is on track to have the worst jobs record of any President since \nWorld War II.\n  When the President was hyping his so-called stimulus program, his \neconomic team claimed unemployment would not go above 8 percent and \nwould be below 6 percent by now. Instead, it has been higher than 8 \npercent for 43 straight months. According to last week's jobs data, \nunemployment dropped from 8.3 percent to 8.1 percent. Why does that \nhappen? It didn't drop because of newly created jobs. It dropped \nbecause 368,000 Americans simply gave up looking for work. They just \ngave up.\n  With the stimulus bill, the President promised jobs. The only thing \nhe delivered was not jobs but more debt. It is bad enough that the \nstimulus was wasted. Even worse, he borrowed the money, much of it from \nChina.\n  The reality is that America is not better off than it was 4 years \nago. In terms of global competitiveness, the United States has dropped \nfor 4 straight years. When President Obama took office, we were No. 1 \nin the world. Now we are No. 7. Why? American businesses are at a \ncompetitive disadvantage. That is because of our tax rates. They are \nthe highest in the developed world. American businesses are being asked \nto create jobs in the face of a regulatory onslaught the likes of which \nwe have never seen before.\n  Americans know what works. What works here in this country is low \ntaxes, reasonable regulations, and living within our means.\n  President John Kennedy understood that. He said:\n\n       Persistently large deficits would endanger our economic \n     growth and our military and defense commitments abroad.\n\n  He said that 50 years ago, in 1962. Washington's budget deficit that \nyear, in 1962, was $7 billion. From $7 billion then to $1.2 trillion \nthis year. For every year since he has taken office, President Obama \nhas spent at least $1 trillion more than Washington took in--all of it \nborrowed. And there is no end in sight.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the government ran a \n$192 billion deficit last month alone. This is the highest deficit ever \nfor the month of August.\n  Under his watch, government continues to spend too much, borrow too \nmuch, and grow bigger every day. President Obama's record of failure \nhas come at a great cost to our country and to our future. The \nPresident's policies have failed to produce the results, the \naccountability, and the solutions that the American people deserve. The \nObama administration is simply not moving our country forward.\n  A healthy economy comes from a growing private sector. Yet the \nPresident doesn't seem to appreciate or value the private sector. \nRemember, he said if you have a business you didn't build it, someone \nelse did? In Wyoming and in communities all across this country there \nare bakers and florists and dry cleaners and farmers who did build \ntheir businesses and whose families have been working in them for \ngenerations. Those business owners know what President Obama does not. \nThey understand, as Ronald Reagan put it, that you can't be for big \ngovernment, big taxes, and big bureaucracy, and still be for the little \nguy.\n  As a Nation we are being bled by overspending, we are being choked by \nregulations, and we are being paralyzed by a lack of affordable energy. \nJust look at one of the President's favorite legislative \naccomplishments, the President's health care law. The American people \nknew what they wanted from health care reform. They wanted the care \nthey need, from a doctor they choose, at a lower cost. Instead, what \ndid they get? They got a $700 billion cut to Medicare, a government \nmandate that everyone must buy insurance, funding for IRS agents to \ninvestigate you, but too little money for doctors to treat you.\n  Similar to health care, the American people know exactly what they \nwant from our Nation's energy policy. What they want is energy \nsecurity. Yet the President continues to block the Keystone XL Pipeline \nand the oil and the jobs that come with it. The President has wasted \nmillions and millions in taxpayer dollars on Solyndra, and the \nPresident continues to stifle domestic production of affordable \nAmerican energy sources such as coal while driving up energy bills for \nthe American people.\n  Since energy security is not a priority for this President, what \nabout financial security for our children and grandchildren? Washington \nhas piled a mountain of debt on the backs of future generations, and \nthe President keeps adding more. On his watch, the national debt just \npassed $16 trillion, with no end in sight.\n  President Obama says he deserves a grade of incomplete on his \nhandling of the economy, but people only ask for an incomplete grade \nwhen they know they are failing. He is now asking all of us to give him \nmore time. The question is, Can we afford to give him that time?\n  As I said in the beginning of this address on the floor of the \nSenate, it is not about the economy we wish we had or the economy we \nused to have; it is about the economy we have today. It is about \nreality. Instead of giving President Obama 4 more years to continue the \npolicies that have not worked and are not working, it is time for a \nchange.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Madam President, I would also like to take a few moments today to \ntalk, as I do each week in the Senate, as a physician and give a \ndoctor's second opinion about the health care law.\n  I come to the Senate floor just about every week to talk about the \nhealth care law. I have practiced medicine in Wyoming for one-quarter \nof a century. I have taken care of families and many patients on \nMedicare. What I wish to do today is talk about the health care law's \nimpact specifically on our seniors who rely on Medicare for their \nhealth care. Specifically, I wish to talk about how this law is going \nto impact those living in rural and frontier areas such as Wyoming.\n  I know it can be very challenging for people living in rural \ncommunities to get the care they need, especially from\n\n[[Page S6309]]\n\na doctor they choose. The associated press recently described this \nissue in an article entitled ``Boomers retiring to rural areas won't \nfind doctors.'' The story highlighted the trouble Nina Musselman from \nrural Oregon had finding a new family physician when her previous \ndoctor moved away.\n  After 1 year of going to different physicians who would treat her \ntemporarily, she finally found a new permanent provider. The words she \nused to describe her experience were: ``It's a sad situation for \nseniors.'' Unfortunately, because of the President's health care law, \nthe situation for seniors--especially those living in rural \ncommunities--is only expected to get worse. The article not only \nconfirms that fewer doctors are working in rural areas but also that \nthe program pays rural doctors less for a procedure. This fact, \ncombined with the cuts to the program scheduled to take place under the \nhealth care law, means seniors in rural areas will have greater \ndifficulty finding a doctor to take care of them.\n  Mark Pauly, a professor of health care management at the University \nof Pennsylvania put it this way: If the cuts to Medicare are allowed to \ngo through, ``the doctors are saying: We're out of here.''\n  Professor Pauly adds:\n\n       The least they [the doctors] are saying is: ``We'll treat \n     Medicare patients like we treat Medicaid patients,'' which is \n     mostly not.\n\n  Over the past 2 weeks the Republicans and Democratic parties have \nheld their nominating conventions. The Nation has had an opportunity to \nhear from both Governor Romney and President Obama about their \naccomplishments and their visions for America.\n  After hearing the President's speech, I was struck by the fact that \nhe barely mentioned his health care law. The newspaper Politico stated: \n``In back-to-back speeches, Obama and Vice President Joe Biden all but \nignored the Affordable Care Act.''\n  It isn't surprising, given the fact that the law remains deeply \nunpopular with the majority of the American people. In fact, the latest \nRasmussen poll found that half the people surveyed support repealing \nthe health care law.\n  The President and Washington Democrats might be trying to avoid the \nlaw. As a physician who practiced in Wyoming, I believe the topic is \ntoo important to ignore. All seniors, especially those in rural \nAmerica, need to know how this law will impact their ability to get the \ncare they need.\n  Previously, the Institute of Medicine found that there are fewer \nprimary care physicians--as well as other medical specialists--per \ncapita in rural areas compared to urban areas. It is not just primary \ncare physicians and it is not just specialists, it is both. So while \npeople in rural America make up 20 percent of the Nation's population, \nthey are only served by about 9 percent of the Nation's physicians.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation tells us the beneficiaries in rural \nareas account for at least 60 percent of the Medicare populations in \nMississippi, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. \nThis is why I have such a passion for ensuring that all our seniors, no \nmatter where they live, can receive their Medicare benefits. \nUnfortunately, all America knows is that the President's health care \nlaw made significant cuts to Medicare.\n  Specifically, the Congressional Budget Office told us the law takes \nover $700 billion from the Medicare Program. This money will not be \nused to improve the health care received by seniors but, rather, to pay \nfor a whole new government program for someone else. In fact, if the \ncuts in the health care law are implemented, the nonpartisan Actuary at \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that Medicare \npayments for inpatient hospital services would eventually be only 39 \npercent of private insurance rates.\n  The situation facing physicians is not any better. The actuary at CMS \nreported that in 2009 Medicare paid physicians approximately 80 percent \nof private insurance rates. Under current law, if the cuts are allowed \nto move forward, Medicare will eventually only pay about 26 percent of \nthe rate of private insurance. There is no question that the \nramifications of these cuts will directly impact the ability of seniors \nto receive the health care they need.\n\n  As Professor Timothy Jost noted in the New England Journal of \nMedicine:\n\n       If the gap between private and Medicare rates continues to \n     grow--\n\n  As it is under this law--\n\n     health care providers may well abandon Medicare.\n\n  For the millions of seniors who rely on Medicare, losing access to \nthe program is simply not acceptable.\n  When the President passed his health care law, he proudly stated he \nwas expanding health care coverage for millions of Americans. What he \nfailed to mention is that this expanding coverage is being bought at \nthe expense of American seniors.\n  Washington Democrats have long argued that the cuts to Medicare will \ndo two things at the same time. They say it will expand health coverage \nfor the uninsured and extend the life of the Medicare trust fund.\n  In Wyoming and all across the country people know we cannot spend the \nsame money twice. Apparently, the President and supporters of his \nhealth care law, right here in this body, think they can. Their logic \ndefies math and it defies common sense.\n  As a former Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Douglas \nHoltz-Eakin stated in a recent op-ed: ``Any suggestion that Medicare \nwill last longer is an illusion--not a fact.''\n  America's seniors cannot afford the spending illusions contained in \nthe health care law. Congress must act and repeal the law before \nMedicare is transformed from a vital program into an empty promise.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            The Ryan Budget\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I said earlier this week when we came in \non Monday that every day I would come to the floor--and other Senators \nI know are coming to the floor--to let the American people know what \nMr. Romney and Mr. Ryan are trying to hide from them. What they are \ntrying to hide is what their blueprint is for America, where they want \nto take the country. People listen to all of their speeches on the \ncampaign trail, but show me your budget and I will show you what your \npriorities are.\n  A budget is a blueprint, and we have from Mr. Ryan, our colleague in \nthe House, his budget. I think, if I am not mistaken, it has been \npassed twice in the House and I think almost every Republican voted for \nit; the same as here in the Senate. So if Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney were \nto be elected to the Presidency and Vice Presidency, they would then be \nable to move their budget through under a little-known procedure called \nreconciliation. It is a fancy word, but all it means is that it would \ngo through with 51 votes.\n  I think it is important for the American people to know what is in \nthat budget, what is in that blueprint for America. That is why this \nweek I have taken the time to talk about the impact of the budget on \nhealth care and on education. Today I wish to talk about the impact of \nthis budget on where I live--rural America, in the Midwest, where the \noccupant of the Chair lives. What is the impact of the Ryan budget on \nthose of us who live in small towns, in rural communities, those who \nlive on farms, and ranchers in the West? What is the impact?\n  First of all, I think it is important to step back and take a look at \nthe Ryan budget blueprint overall. What it does is it further decimates \nthe middle class in America. The very centerpiece of the Ryan budget is \na dramatic shift of even more wealth to those at the top, targeting \nhuge new tax cuts for the richest 2 percent.\n  For those making over $1 million a year--I have used this chart \nbefore and I will continue to use it--for those making over $1 million, \nthey would get $265,000 more in tax breaks. That is added on to \n$129,000 that they already get from the Bush tax cuts. So under the \nRyan plan, if a person makes over $1 million a year, they will get \n$394,000 in tax cuts. They are entitled to that. That is an \nentitlement. If a person makes that much money, they are entitled to \nget that tax cut. So when we\n\n[[Page S6310]]\n\nhear people talking about entitlements, remember, it is not just the \npoor, it is the rich too. They get a lot of entitlements.\n  They are going to have all of these new tax cuts. The total is $4.5 \ntrillion over 10 years. Where do they get that money? They don't want \nto say how they would pay for it, but we have to look at the budget. \nThe Ryan Republican budget would partially offset the tax cuts by \nmaking deep, Draconian cuts to programs that protect the middle class \nand are essential to quality of life in our country--everything from \neducation, student grants and loans, law enforcement, clean air and \nclean water, food safety, medical research, highways, bridges and other \ninfrastructure, agriculture, and energy.\n  As I said before, the Republican plan would end Medicare. The Ryan \nbudget ends Medicare. They keep saying: Well, it ends it as we know it. \nWell, as we know it, that is what it is. It replaces Medicare with \nvoucher care. Voucher care, not Medicare; voucher care. It would \ncompletely destroy Medicare. They say: Well, people can take their \nvouchers and keep Medicare, if they like, or they can go out and get a \nprivate plan. If one is a healthy elderly person, they might be able to \nget a cheap plan out there someplace. So all of the healthy elderly \nleave Medicare, which leaves only the sickest and the poorest in \nMedicare, so the costs skyrocket and it becomes unsupportable. That is \nthe way to destroy Medicare.\n  Again, they talk a lot--Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney--about reducing the \ndeficit and balancing the budget. Even under the most rosy assumptions, \nthe Ryan budget does not balance the budget until the year 2040--28 \nyears from now. Mr. Ryan is a true acolyte of former Vice President \nCheney who, in a very unguarded moment, said deficits don't matter. \nWell, they obviously didn't, because we see how much the deficits went \nup under the Bush-Cheney administration. I always say Mr. Ryan has \nalso--he won't say it but his budget shows it--they don't think \ndeficits matter either because they have deficits for the next 28 \nyears.\n  Again, when I tell people this, when I outline the budget for folks \nback home, they say, You must be kidding; nothing could be that \nextreme. Well, the Ryan plan is extreme and unbalanced, and I am not \nmaking it up. Even former House Speaker Newt Gingrich criticized the \nRyan budget. He called it rightwing social engineering. Well, all I can \nsay is Newt got that one right. But that is Newt. Let's listen to the \neconomic adviser to the icon of the modern day Republican Party, \nPresident Ronald Reagan. This is what he said. Let's hear what Mr. \nBartlett said. He said: ``Distributionally, the Ryan plan is a \nmonstrosity. The rich would receive huge tax cuts while the social \nsafety net would be shredded to pay for them. . . .''\n  A monstrosity. This is the economic adviser to President Reagan. \nPresident Reagan wouldn't have a chance in today's Republican Party, \nnot with the Ryan budget.\n  Again, the Ryan budget is radical--radical--in shrinking the size of \ngovernment to what it was more than a half a century ago.\n  Today I wish to focus specifically on the devastating impact of the \nRomney-Ryan budget on American agriculture and on our quest for clean \nrenewable energy and energy independence. The Ryan budget would make \ndeep reductions in our Federal commitment to America's farmers and \nranchers, to rural communities, and to consumers, especially consumer \nsafety. The Ryan budget calls for reducing funding for agriculture \nconservation over 10 fiscal years by $16 billion below the funding \nlevels that we have now in the present farm bill. That amounts to about \na 24.5-percent reduction in conservation of soil and water. Our Nation \ncannot afford to back off on our commitment to agricultural \nconservation, not at a time when climate and weather are becoming more \nvariable and damaging to the land and when farmers and ranchers need to \nkeep increasing production to meet demands from a growing population.\n  More and more demands are being put on our land with a changing \nclimate and that is why conservation funding is so critically \nimportant. Farmers and ranchers have made tremendous progress on \nconservation. Yet about a quarter--one-fourth--of U.S. cropland is \nstill deteriorating from excess soil erosion.\n\n  Concerning water quality, nitrates in the Mississippi River and its \ntributaries were 10 percent higher in 2008 than they were 20 years ago. \nThere have been no consistent nitrate declines in the past 30 years. \nHere are a couple of photographs to illustrate what I am talking about. \nThis is a nice, pastoral view looking over some rolling cropland. This \nis a gully. We can see they put up some plastic here to stop it, but \nthis is where the rain comes down, hits it, washes it off, down into \nthe ditches. That is sort of the ``before'' photo. That is before \nconservation practices. Let's take a look at the same picture after we \nhave used Federal conservation plans and the farmer's own money. Look \nwhat we have now--a nice, grassy waterway that absorbs all of that \nrain. That is what conservation does.\n  Concerning water quality, here is another picture. It is a picture of \na gully washer, and we see the land being eroded there, the stream bank \nbeing eroded. That was before. This is what it looks like afterward--a \nnice stream with clean water, a lot of bank protection, a lot of trees. \nIn fact, the farmhouse we saw in the last picture we can barely see \nabove the tree line in this picture. That is what conservation does. \nThe Ryan budget decimates that. It would cut 24.5 percent, almost 25 \npercent, of all of the funding for conservation in America at a time \nwhen we know what is happening in the Mississippi River, with all of \nthe nitrates going down the Mississippi River, with the land erosion. \nAs I said, at a time when our farmers are being asked to produce even \nmore and more to meet a growing population.\n  Also, this doesn't just affect farmers, it affects all of us. Some \npeople might say: Conservation, sure, that looks nice, saving the water \nand soil, but what does that have to do with me, because I live in Los \nAngeles or San Francisco or some place such as that. It has to do with \nthe quality of life in America and it has to do with whether we are \ngoing to preserve the bountiful land that we have for future \ngenerations and whether we are going to commit ourselves to having \nclean water and cleaning up our rivers and our streams and to prevent \nour soil from flowing down the river.\n  That is conservation.\n  Another troubling feature of the Ryan budget is that it would impose \nnew tighter limits on money appropriated for rural housing, rural water \nand wastewater systems, and economic development, as well as other \nvital Department of Agriculture functions such as food safety and \nagricultural research, education, and extension.\n  The Ryan budget adopted by the House would overall cut the funding \nfor, as we said, nondefense domestic appropriations by about 18.9 \npercent, compared to the current appropriations levels, and that is for \nnext year, that is for 2014 and for years thereafter.\n  Let's consider rural development programs at the Department of \nAgriculture. For fiscal year 2012, we appropriated $2.4 billion. That \nis for rural development. That money provides assistance to rural \nhousing, rural cooperatives and other small businesses, and rural water \nand wastewater systems. That figure for fiscal year 2012 that I gave \nyou--$2.4 billion--was already 9 percent below the 2011 appropriation \nfor rural development. The 2011 appropriation was 11 percent below the \nfiscal year 2010 funding.\n  What would the Ryan budget do? Slash another 19 percent--18.9 \npercent--from rural development funding. That would amount to a cut of \nroughly $454 million in 2014--$\\1/2\\ billion in cuts to wastewater \nsystems, rural cooperatives, and rural housing.\n  Consider the food and agricultural research, education, and extension \nsponsored by the Department of Agriculture. The fiscal year 2012 \nappropriation for this was $2.3 billion. Again, that was a slight \nreduction from appropriations in recent years. It was $2.3 billion in \nfiscal year 2012, and in fiscal year 2010 it was $2.59 billion. So we \nhave already taken some reductions. We already know our current levels \nof investment in Federal food and agricultural research are falling far \nbehind what is needed to meet the challenges I just spoke about, the \nchallenges of producing food, more food to meet a growing world \npopulation, the need for\n\n[[Page S6311]]\n\nexports, but to do it in an environmentally benign way, which saves \nsoil and water for future generations.\n  Well, the Ryan budget, again, lops off another 18.9 percent. That \nwould be about $435 million in 2014--$\\1/2\\ billion from these vital \nprograms. Again, these do not just affect farmers, these affect all of \nus.\n  Take food safety--just food safety. People like to know when they buy \nfood someplace--they have a high expectation it is not going to make \nthem sick. Well, the fiscal year 2012 appropriation was $2.5 billion \nfor the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, and $1 billion for the \nFood Safety and Inspection Service. That is the Department of \nAgriculture. That is FSIS, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, that \ndeals with Federal meat and poultry inspection. The FDA handles \neverything else.\n  Now, if the Ryan budget were adopted, again, there would be an 18.9-\npercent cut to both the FDA and the Food Safety and Inspection Service. \nListen to this. That would be a cut of about $472 million from the Food \nand Drug Administration--to inspect our food and our drugs to make sure \nthey are safe--and a cut of about $189 million from the Food Safety and \nInspection Service that inspects meat and poultry. So consumers would \nhave much less assurance in the safety of their food.\n  Need I remind people that the Senate and the House just passed this \nyear a proposal to reauthorize the Food and Drug Administration, to \ngive them more duties, more responsibilities, to do more inspections of \nfood coming into this country from overseas. President Obama signed \nthat into law. It was supported by Republicans and Democrats, \nconsumers, pharmaceutical companies, and food companies. Everybody \nsupported it--a great bill.\n  Now, here is the Ryan budget. They are going to take about $\\1/2\\ \nbillion out of that per year. So we might have given them the authority \nin the authorization bill, but then we are going to cripple it and cut \nthem off at the knees. We are going to cut them off--if we adopt the \nRyan budget--by taking about $\\1/2\\ billion a year from the FDA.\n  Let's take a look at what it would do about energy because this not \nonly means a lot to Iowa, it means a lot to our country in terms of \nmoving ahead to develop renewable, safe, domestically grown energy.\n  The Ryan budget claims that President Obama has stifled domestic \nenergy production by blocking or delaying the production of oil--both \nonshore and offshore--and gas. But what he fails to acknowledge is that \nunder President Obama we have already opened vast expanses of public \nlands for oil and gas exploration, and production of both has \nincreased--by 13 percent for domestic oil; 12 percent for natural gas--\nsince 2008.\n  But most egregious about the Ryan budget is that it completely \nignores and, again, hinders our development of renewable energy.\n  Wind power. Wind power in America has now provided over 35 percent of \nthe new electricity generation capacity installed in the United States \nover the last 5 years. In the last 5 years, wind energy accounts for 35 \npercent of all of that.\n  The wind power industry has doubled its electricity contribution four \ntimes just since 2000. Shown on this chart I have in the Chamber has \nbeen the growth of wind power capacity in the United States since 2000. \nIt has doubled it four times and is continuing to grow.\n  The wind power industry now accounts for 75,000 American jobs--75,000 \nAmerican jobs--heavily concentrated in California, Colorado, Texas, \nIowa, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Well, Mr. Romney has \nsaid he wants to do away with the production tax credit, wipe all that \nout.\n  I wonder how the people of California and Texas and Colorado and Iowa \nand Illinois and Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania might feel about \nthat--not to mention the other States where they are just now beginning \nto develop their wind energy potential?\n  So the Ryan budget does away with the production tax credit, and Mr. \nRomney has given his stamp of approval on that.\n  Now, likewise, with liquid fuels. Americans clearly want to increase \nproduction and use of domestic renewable fuels. We have responded in \nthe past with tax credits and renewable fuel use requirements, the \nrenewable fuels mandate. Small business entrepreneurs have built \nethanol and biodiesel biorefineries all across the country. They now \nsupply about 10 percent of the fuel used in our gasoline-powered autos \nand trucks.\n\n  That is 10 percent that no longer comes from outside our borders. And \nhere is the expansion, as shown on this chart, of all of the \nbiorefineries in the United States just in the last few years. Look how \nthey have grown. There are a lot of jobs there--a lot of jobs, a lot of \nliquid fuels. In fact, if you look at the chart showing the expansion \nof liquid fuels and the decrease of imports of oil, they just about \nmatch. Just take a look.\n  Going back to 2000, this line shows the increase in ethanol \nproduction and this line shows the decrease in oil imports. Boy, they \njust about match. As ethanol production has gone up, oil imports have \ngone down.\n  Well, the Ryan budget basically says we should roll back all this \nFederal intervention--just roll it back. But they say it is OK for the \noil companies to go offshore and drill offshore, drill in very fragile \nareas of our country. I would not be surprised if they wanted to open \nup Yellowstone Park to oil and gas exploration pretty soon.\n  I just want to share the Iowa experience, if I might, about renewable \nenergy because I think it speaks to the potential that we have \nnationwide.\n  Up until a decade ago--10 years ago--my State of Iowa was nearly 100 \npercent dependent on energy imports. All of our gasoline and diesel \ncame from out of State. Most of our electricity came from out of \nState--coal. By contrast, today Iowa generates about 20 percent of its \nelectricity from instate wind power facilities. We now have about 7,000 \njobs in the wind power industry. We build the turbines, we build the \nblades, we build the towers--everything--there. We are teaching a whole \nnew generation of young Americans at our community colleges how to fix, \nrepair, replace, and maintain our wind generators.\n  So instead of paying others for imported coal or for coal-based \nelectricity from other States, Iowans are using their money to build \nand install and operate their own wind turbines and generating \nelectricity from our own instate renewable wind resources.\n  For liquid fuels it is the same. It is remarkable. As I said, \nremember, Iowa imported all of its oil and gas 10 years ago--gasoline. \nIowa now has 54 biorefineries producing about 4 billion gallons of \nethanol and biodiesel a year. That is 50 percent more than the total \namount of liquid fuels that we consume in a year. So Iowa, in 10 years, \nhas gone from a total importer of liquid fuels to a net exporter. We \nmake more than 50 percent more than we actually use, so we get to \nexport to other States. Again, that is good-paying jobs. It is a \nrenewable resource, with higher incomes for farmers. It helps Iowa's \neconomy better than the economies of the Mideast oil states.\n  So America can follow in Iowa's footsteps but only if we continue the \nenergy policies that have enabled these achievements. We need to extend \nthe production tax credit to expand wind power and other renewable \nelectric systems across the country, such as solar electric. The Ryan \nbudget does not account for that. The Ryan budget drops all of these \ninvestments, in renewable biofuels also.\n  So, again, as I said, each day we have looked at the Ryan budget and \nhow it affects health, how it affects education. Senator Boxer from \nCalifornia and others have come out and talked about how it affects our \ntransportation infrastructure in America. But I also wanted to point \nout what it does to our renewable energy sector and what it does to \nagriculture, especially conservation, and how it would decimate our \nefforts to ensure clean water and stop soil erosion in all of our \nStates.\n  So before I close, I just want to provide a broader context so we \nunderstand the consequences of the Romney-Ryan budget. Going back to \nthe 1930s, the American people have supported and strengthened a kind \nof unique American social contract. That social contract says we will \nprepare our young and we will care for our elderly. That contract says: \nIf you work hard and play by the rules, you will be able\n\n[[Page S6312]]\n\nto rise to the middle class or even beyond. That social contract says a \ncardinal role of government is to provide a ladder or ramp of \nopportunity so that every American can realistically--realistically--\naspire to the American dream.\n  Well, in one document, the Romney-Ryan budget would rip up that \nsocial contract, shred it. Do not take my word. Let's go back to Mr. \nBartlett's quote again that I had right at the beginning. Do not take \nmy word for it. It is right here. This is Ronald Reagan's economic \nadviser. He says:\n\n       Distributionally, the Ryan plan is a monstrosity. The rich \n     would receive huge tax cuts while the social safety net would \n     be shredded to pay for them.\n\n  How far do you think Ronald Reagan would get today with this \nRepublican Party with that kind of statement?\n  So, again, the Ryan budget would rip up that sort of contract, \nreplace it with a sort of survival-of-the-fittest, winner-take-all. It \nis sort of ``tough luck; you are on your own.'' If you were born \nwealthy, if you live in the right circumstances, you are OK, or if you \nwin the lottery, God bless you. You are OK if you win the lottery, but \notherwise, tough luck, you are on your own.\n  I agree with what President Clinton said last week when he said there \nare two competing philosophies here. One is the Romney-Ryan budget \nphilosophy of ``you are on your own.'' The other philosophy is what I \nthink we have been proposing; that is, we are all better off when it is \na ``we are all in it together'' philosophy. Again, the Ryan budget, the \nRomney-Ryan budget is a blueprint for where they want to take America. \nThis is not just some phony liberal thing thrown out here. This is \ntheir budget. This tells you where they want to go. It is a blueprint \nfor a building. It is a blueprint for what they want America to become. \nWell, I do not think that is the kind of America my neighbors and I \nwould find acceptable, certainly not one they find acceptable for their \nkids.\n  Mr. Ryan said that he had developed his views on his budget--they \nwere formed by Catholic social teaching. Well, I don't know; I went to \nCatholic schools most of my life, and that is not what I was taught. I \nwas not taught that you are on your own, that government has no \nresponsibility whatsoever to ensure that you have decent health, \nsafety, education, that you have a decent retirement so that you do not \nget put in the poorhouse. I was taught that we are all in this \ntogether. I see the bishops say the same. The Catholic bishops say the \nRyan budget fails the moral test--fails the moral test. They reiterated \ntheir demand that the Federal budget protect the poor, and I said the \nGOP measures fail to meet this moral criteria.\n  So, again, I have taken this floor every day. I intend to take it \nevery day from now until whenever we adjourn to keep pointing out, \nalong with other Senators, what is in this Romney-Ryan budget. It is \nreally scary.\n  A lot of times when we go out campaigning, we tell people: This is \nthe most important election ever. How many times have you heard that \none? This is the most important election ever. You hear both sides \nsaying that. Well, I have been through a lot of elections. I have said \nthat a lot of times. I will not say that. I am not going to tell anyone \nthis is the most important election ever, but I will say this: This is \nthe scariest election I have seen in my lifetime--the scariest. Oh, \nsure, we have had our differences before with Republicans and \nDemocrats. That is OK. That is fine. That is the political give-and-\ntake. And even under President Reagan, who was more conservative than \nany President we have had since probably Herbert Hoover or before, you \nknow, sure they moved the country in a more conservative direction, but \nit wasn't like this. It wasn't anything close to what this Ryan budget \nis doing. Even Presidents who have run in the past, maybe with the \nexception of Barry Goldwater, but I do not know much about his budget--\nI daresay I bet it was not this bad. I bet it was not anything close to \nthis. This is why this is scary. This is turning America back to where \nwe were before Roosevelt. I do not mean Franklin Roosevelt, I mean \nTheodore Roosevelt. That is how far back they would turn this country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I first wish to thank Senator Harkin as chair of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and past chair of the \nAgriculture Committee for his words of concern regarding the House \nbudget as it relates to agriculture. I share those concerns and I thank \nhim for speaking out on that. It is just one more reason to pass a farm \nbill. We need to get a farm bill done right now.\n  Let me say to all of my colleagues, and particularly in the House \nbecause we have done our job in the Senate and we are ready to complete \nthe task of getting a farm bill, we now only have 17 days, 17 days \nuntil the current farm bill expires on September 30. Seventeen days. We \nknow as a practical matter, because the House says they are leaving \nnext Friday, it is actually shorter, but we have 17 days before the end \nof the month, before the current policy expires and we begin to see a \nphase-in of policies that end up going back to 1949 by the first of the \nyear on subsidies and planting restrictions and a whole range of things \nthat cost a lot of money and make no sense.\n  I am asking that the House come together, as we did in the Senate \nwhen we passed our bipartisan farm bill on June 21, and pass a farm \nbill in the House. We passed the Agricultural Reform, Food, and Jobs \nAct by a bipartisan vote of 64 to 35. I believe the votes are there in \nthe House of Representatives if there is a willingness to have a \nbipartisan vote. I believe that together, Democrats and Republicans, \nthere are enough votes to pass it, and the House has time to act. They \nare completing the continuing resolution today, and my understanding is \nthere is nothing else of substance that is on the agenda for next week. \nAnd even if there was, 1 day--1 day--is all we are asking, 1 day to \nbring up and do the work for rural America, for agriculture, ranchers \nacross the country, to create a 5-year farm bill policy that includes \ndisaster assistance that will work for all parts of agriculture. We are \nasking for 1 day.\n\n  Farmers across the country have been hit hard by disasters, as we \nknow--very, very hard. It has been devastating for many of our ranchers \nand farmers between late frosts and the severe drought this year. We \nneed to get a farm bill done. Why is that? Because the farm bill is \nalso a disaster bill.\n  I can speak from the standpoint of Michigan, where the warmth in \nMarch and then the late deep freeze eliminated almost all of our tart \ncherries. We are No. 1 in the country in tart cherries. We do not have \nany. Sweet cherries, apples, peaches hit, grapes, and that, along with \nthe drought, means that every single county in Michigan is under a \ndisaster declaration right now. We address that in the farm bill we \npassed.\n  By the way, disaster assistance is in the farm bill the Senate \npassed, fully paid for with savings within the farm bill.\n  We reinstate the livestock disaster program, and we make it \npermanent. We make it permanent. We support specialty crop growers who \nneed crop insurance and do not have it now, such as our cherry growers. \nTart cherry growers cannot purchase crop insurance because there is no \ncrop insurance. In addition to helping them in the short run, we need \nto make sure we are ready for the future, and we do that in this bill.\n  We put in place a new dairy program to make sure we are not seeing \nfarmers go bankrupt. And our Presiding Officer from Vermont certainly \nunderstands and has led efforts. I remember 2009, 2010, what was \nhappening, what we had to do. We know the current policy is a disaster \nwaiting to happen for dairy. So kicking the can down the road, doing \nsome long-term extension, and not taking any action on the farm bill is \na disaster for diary, which, by the way, is the No. 1 single commodity \nin my State as well.\n  We need to get the farm bill done.\n  We make sure those who have lost crop this year because of the early \nwarm spring and late frost as well as our livestock operators and \nothers get help not just for the future but this\n\n[[Page S6313]]\n\nyear, 2012. That is in the Senate-passed farm bill. It is also, by the \nway, in the House committee-passed farm bill, which is what the Speaker \nand the Republican leadership should be taking up on the floor of the \nHouse.\n  We also strengthen conservation, which is so critical because unlike \nthe Dust Bowl of the thirties where soil was swirling around and all \nthat was happening at that time, despite the horrible drought, soil is \non the ground. Why? Because of conservation efforts and policies that \nhave made a difference. We need to continue and strengthen that as we \ndo in our farm bill for the future. It is critical that we move forward \non conservation.\n  So the House taking up a farm bill addresses the disaster assistance \nthat needs to be addressed for our farmers and ranchers in a \nresponsible way. It is paid for within the savings of the farm bill. \nAnd we make sure we do not have other disasters happening by not moving \nforward with improvements in policy for commodities such as dairy.\n  I am proud of what we did in the Senate. It was bipartisan. We tried \nvery hard. I worked very hard to create an opportunity where there was \nenough time in the summer for the House to be able to take action. We \nmoved, as we all know, quickly, both in committee--Senator Roberts and \nI and all of our colleagues, with the leadership support on the floor, \nmoved quickly in June to pass a bill so that there would be all of July \nand the beginning of August until the break for the House to act so \nthat we could then go to conference committee in August and come back \nright now and pass a final farm bill, which is what should have \nhappened. So now we are in plan B, which is at least--at least the \nHouse of Representatives ought to be doing their job in passing the \nfarm bill so we can work on this in October and come back in November \nbefore the full Congress.\n  I commend the leadership of the Agriculture Committee in the House \nand have great confidence that, working together with them, we can come \ntogether on our differences and put together a responsible, effective \ndeficit reduction farm bill in the final analysis. But we can't get \nthere until the House gives us some kind of a bill to work with.\n\n  So I am asking the Speaker, I am asking the Republican leadership to \ntake just 1 day, 1 day for rural America, 1 day for farmers and \nranchers across this country so that we can address disaster assistance \nand long-term economic policy for rural America.\n  The House leadership, the Republican leadership heard yesterday from \nhundreds of farmers from all over the country that we need a farm bill \nnow. There were over 80 different groups who put that rally together to \nmake it very clear that they do not want a stopgap measure, that they \ndo not want to kick the can down the road or do another 1-year \nextension; they just want us to get it done and to get it done right \nnow. Many of these farmers are in the middle of harvest. It is the \nearliest corn harvest in 25 years because of the drought. They took \ntime from work to come here at their own expense, their own time to \ngive a very clear message to the House Republican leadership. It is \ntime to get this done.\n  Frankly, it is past time to get it done. We have heard that the House \nwants to do a 1-year extension of current policy, but we are not going \nto support that. Do we really want to continue for another year the \nsubsidies, such as the direct payments we eliminated in the Senate farm \nbill, the subsidies that go to people regardless of whether they are \neven growing the crop for which they are getting the subsidies? We \neliminated four different subsidies and instead listened to farmers \nacross this country to strengthen crop insurance. That is what we heard \nfrom Michigan to Kansas, from California to all across this country, \nthat we need to strengthen crop insurance, and that is what we have \ndone.\n  Do we really want to be in a situation where one more time there is \nnot action on deficit reduction? The one piece of legislation we have \npassed in a bipartisan way that reduces the deficit of this country is \nour farm bill. Amazingly, we have $23 billion in reduced spending, in \ndeficit reduction, which goes away with an extension. It won't happen \nif we kick the can down the road, so we need to get this done.\n  I understand there are some in the House who don't believe we ought \nto invest in any kind of agricultural policy. I know there are those \nwho think we shouldn't invest in nutrition or conservation of land and \nwater or agricultural policy or energy jobs or a whole range of things, \nsuch as rural development, supporting our small rural towns. I \nunderstand they do not want to do a farm bill. I also know there are \nsome folks who don't like the reforms we have. They want to continue \nthose payments. I understand that. But I believe the majority of people \nin the House, just like the majority of the people in the Senate, will \ncome together if given the opportunity and vote for reform, for deficit \nreduction, for a strengthened crop insurance program, other risk \nmanagement tools for our farmers, a disaster assistance program that is \npermanent for livestock producers, help for our food growers, strong \nnutrition policy that includes focusing on waste, fraud, and abuse, \nrural development, and a streamlined, more effective conservation \npolicy that creates flexibility and tools for our farmers as well as \nthose who want to hunt and fish and protect our open spaces. I believe \na majority of the House wants to get that done.\n  I think it is very important, with 17 days left, that we remember \nwhat this is about. There are 16 million people in this country who \nwork because of agriculture--16 million people. We talk a lot about \njobs and job policies. I don't know of any we have debated on this \nfloor that have impacted 16 million people and their families, and we \ncame together to get this done because we understood that.\n  Right now, despite the best efforts of the Committee on Agriculture \nin the House on a bipartisan basis to report a bill, the House \nleadership--the Republican leadership--will not take 1 day--1 day--to \nfocus on 16 million jobs, economic development, quality of life in \nrural America for those who have been hit so hard by this economy, and \nthe jobs of the future we have in this farm bill. Time is running out. \nTime is running out. We need to get this done. We understand that.\n  Farmers know that when there is work to be done, they can't kick the \ncan down the road. When a crop is ready for harvest, a farmer can't \nsay: Gee, I am tired; I will do it next week. When the crop needs to be \nharvested, they have to get up and go do it. They do what needs to be \ndone. And we had folks who came here yesterday, who left their fields \nand who basically said: Even though I have a lot of work to do at home, \nI have to go to the U.S. House of Representatives to tell the \nRepublican leadership that it is time to get the job done.\n  Mr. President, I would like to put into the Record a letter that was \nsent from 13 different leadership organizations on agriculture in this \ncountry. I will explain what is in it, but I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a letter dated September 7, 2012, to \nSenators Reid and McConnell.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 7, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: \n     The undersigned farm organizations support finding a path \n     forward to reaching agreement on a new five-year farm bill \n     before current program authorities expire on Sept. 30. We \n     were disappointed that the House did not consider the House \n     Agriculture Committee's bill before the August recess. That \n     bill, and the bill passed by the Senate in June, would \n     provide the disaster relief our farm and ranch families need \n     at this time.\n       Instead, the House passed a separate disaster bill just \n     before the recess that would make supplemental agricultural \n     disaster assistance available for Fiscal Year 2012. \n     Specifically, the bill would retroactively extend the \n     Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), the Livestock Forage \n     Program (LFP), the Emergency Livestock Assistance Program \n     (ELAP) and the Tree Assistance Program (TAP) so that \n     producers are helped for Fiscal Year 2012. All of those \n     programs expired in 2011. Offsets to pay for the disaster \n     assistance would come from imposing caps on two conservation \n     programs, the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and the \n     Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).\n       We know that some Senators will return from the recess and \n     encourage you to consider the House-passed measure. This is \n     something our groups do not support. We\n\n[[Page S6314]]\n\n     strongly urge you to refrain from this as we fear that \n     passage of a bill similar to the House bill could result in \n     further delays in completing a full five-year farm bill.\n       In addition, almost identical provisions to retroactively \n     extend these four programs are included in the Senate-passed \n     farm bill and the bill reported by the House Agriculture \n     Committee, and these provisions are paid for in the context \n     of the measures included in the disaster bill. Those measures \n     would likely be included in any conference committee report. \n     It is imperative that we pass a comprehensive, long-term farm \n     bill. Farmers and ranchers always face decisions that carry \n     very serious financial ramifications, such as planting a \n     crop, buying land or building a herd, and we need clear and \n     confident signals from our lawmakers.\n       Assistance for cattle and sheep producers is very \n     important, and we strongly support helping them in the five-\n     year farm bill, but it is also important to provide \n     assistance to producers of other types of livestock and \n     fruits and vegetables. The House disaster assistance bill \n     does not help hog or poultry producers and only provides \n     limited assistance via the grazing program for the dairy \n     industry. The bill does not help dairy producers who are not \n     located in a designated disaster county with grazing \n     assistance and does not address high feed prices for dairy, \n     hog or poultry producers. Many producers of fruits and \n     vegetables may not have crop insurance available to them as a \n     risk management tool, and they too need some type of help, \n     which this package does not address. The Senate-passed farm \n     bill contains many new, improved and reauthorized risk \n     management tools. It is a more comprehensive response to this \n     year's and future years' drought and other disasters that \n     impact crop and livestock production.\n       The Congressional Budget Office scored the House-passed \n     disaster bill as costing $383 million. That expense is offset \n     by cuts of $639 million from the CSP and EQIP programs, \n     leaving $256 million to go towards deficit reduction. If the \n     House simply passed the five-year farm bill passed by the \n     committee on a bipartisan basis, this disaster bill would not \n     be necessary. The bill costs more than $600 million and would \n     not provide relief to livestock producers less than a month \n     earlier than a farm bill debated and passed in September. \n     Agriculture will already contribute a minimum of $23 billion \n     in deficit reduction by passing the farm bill. We do not need \n     to provide additional deficit reduction in this package only \n     month before we reduce the deficit far more than \n     agriculture's ``fair share.''\n       Both the Senate and the House Agriculture Committees have \n     produced reform-minded, bipartisan bills that address many of \n     the core principles we believe are important, such as \n     strengthening crop insurance as a reliable risk management \n     tool. We remain committed to attempting to pass a five-year \n     farm bill as soon as possible, including the long-term \n     provisions it includes, which would help alleviate the \n     emergency conditions we are seeing across the country.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean \n     Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National \n     Barley Growers Association, National Corn Growers \n     Association, National Farmers Union.\n       National Milk Producers Federation, National Sunflower \n     Association, Northarvest Bean Growers Association, United \n     Fresh Produce Association, U.S. Canola Association, USA Dry \n     Pea & Lentil Council, Western Growers.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this letter was sent to Majority Leader \nReid and Republican Leader McConnell on behalf of the American Farm \nBureau, American Soybean Association, the National Association of Wheat \nGrowers, National Barley Growers Association, National Corn Growers \nAssociation, National Farmers Union, National Milk Producers \nFederation, National Sunflower Association, Northarvest Bean Growers \nAssociation, United Fresh Produce Association, U.S. Canola Association, \nU.S. Dry Pea and Lentil Council, and the Western Growers, all saying: \nDon't do something short term; do the farm bill. They are all saying: \nDon't do some short-term effort that is only focused on disaster. Don't \ndo an effort that does not complete the job.\n  In regard to consideration of the House-passed disaster measure, they \nsay:\n\n       We strongly urge you to refrain from this as we fear that \n     passage of a bill similar to the House bill could result in \n     further delays in completing a full 5-year farm bill.\n\n  These provisions retroactively are in the Senate-passed bill and the \nbill reported from the House Agriculture Committee. They are paid for \nwithin the context of the farm bill. And they know, as we know, that in \nthe final bill we present, they will be included. We certainly are \ngoing to include comprehensive disaster assistance, but they are asking \nus to do it in the context of a 5-year farm bill. That is what everyone \nis saying in farm country, in rural America, that it is not enough to \njust do a little bit here and there. And on top of that, it is not \nnecessary. It is not necessary. We have a comprehensive disaster \nassistance bill within the contents of the farm bill. So does the House \ncommittee. We just need 1 day. There are 17 days left, and we are \nasking the House Republican leadership to invest 1 day in American \nagriculture, and I hope they will do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairwoman of the \nAgriculture Committee if she would be kind enough to stay for a few \nquestions.\n  I came to talk today about the Veterans Jobs Corps Act, but \nagriculture and food security is very important to this country.\n  First of all, I wish to commend the chairwoman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee for putting out an agriculture bill that I think \nreally meets the needs of this country and definitely the agricultural \ncommunity.\n  First of all, I just have to ask--the Agriculture bill sent out of \nthe Senate provides a good safety net for those in production \nagriculture. I know the Senator took that into account. Whether you are \na dairy producer, a corn producer, a wheat producer, or whatever, it is \nthere.\n  The Senator comes from the State of Michigan. That is a little \ndifferent from Montana, but we both know the Midwest has been under \nincredible drought. There have been fires all over this country. I \ntalked to the ranking member on the train yesterday, and he was talking \nabout fires in Kansas, and we have had fires in Montana.\n  Is there disaster assistance in this bill, if the House were to take \nit up and pass it? Would we have to worry about that being taken care \nof in the farm bill?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I wish to thank my friend from Montana, who, by the \nway, is a farmer. I have called him more than one time in Montana, and \nhe has said: I am in the field. I am getting off the tractor. So he \nspeaks with great authority. And the answer is yes, there is \ncomprehensive disaster assistance paid for in the savings of our farm \nbill.\n  Mr. TESTER. So if we combine that with the safety net, if we don't do \na farm bill, as the House wants to do, and just have an extension, what \nwill happen to that $23 billion in taxpayer savings?\n  Ms. STABENOW. It goes away. There is no $23 billion in taxpayer \nsavings if we don't pass the farm bill.\n  Mr. TESTER. And if it is extended, would it, in fact, cost the \ntaxpayers? That $23 billion would not only go away, but wouldn't the \ntaxpayers have to pay for any kind of disaster extension?\n  Ms. STABENOW. No question, we would be paying for disaster \nassistance. By the way, the reforms go away, and I know the Senator \nfrom Montana supports the reforms in the bill. We would see those \nsubsidies continue--direct payments and so on--and we would be rolling \nback to a whole era of planting restrictions and huge subsidies back \nfrom the 1940s and 1950s.\n  Mr. TESTER. One more point. If this farm bill goes away in 17 days, \nthe farmers out there who need help from the bank to get an operating \nloan to continue on the next year, what will happen to those folks?\n  Ms. STABENOW. The Senator raises a very important question because \neconomic certainty means that farmers and ranchers are going to be able \nto know what is happening next year and can go to the bank and get \nthose operating loans and plan for next year what they are going to \nplant. All that certainty will be gone. Everybody talks about how we \nneed certainty for the future and the economy, and I couldn't agree \nmore. This will do more to disrupt rural America and our ability to \nhave a stable food supply and agriculture than anything else.\n  Mr. TESTER. Once again I wish to thank the chairwoman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee for such a great job passing a responsible bill \nout of committee and getting it through the Senate itself. The only \nthing I would like to say is, to my knowledge, the House works on \nmajority rule. I doubt it would even take 1 day. If they want to roll \nup their sleeves and get after this, they could get the Senate farm \nbill passed there.\n\n[[Page S6315]]\n\n  Remember, this farm bill saves $23 billion, it provides a safety net \nfor agriculture, has a great disaster component to it, and provides the \nkind of certainty for people to know, when they go to the bank, which \nis most farmers, and get that operating loan, they have a backstop that \nthe bankers can depend on to offer that loan. So I thank the Senator \nfor her great work.\n\n\n                        Veterans Jobs Corps Act\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to call on the Senate to pass the \nVeterans Jobs Corps Act. Veterans and their families make great \nsacrifices so we can live freely in the greatest Nation in the world. \nToo many of our veterans return home and struggle to find good jobs. \nOur veterans deserve better. They earn our everlasting respect with \ntheir service and our best efforts to help them get good jobs when \ntheir service ends--jobs that will improve the communities they live in \nand jobs that will help us grow our economy.\n  This bill takes good ideas from both sides of the aisle and does just \nthat. It increases training and hiring opportunities for veterans using \nproven job-training initiatives, and it will give local governments the \nresources to hire qualified veterans as police officers, firefighters, \nand other first responders. At a time when local budgets around the \ncountry are tight, putting qualified veterans to work protecting our \ncommunities is smart policy.\n  The Veterans Jobs Corps Act also helps rural America by training and \nhiring veterans to help restore and protect America's forests, parks, \nrefuges, and veterans cemeteries. This is an important step forward, \nbut investing in rural America must also mean investing in the veterans \nwho are from rural America. That is why I added a provision to the bill \nthat would bring more veterans jobs counselors to rural States across \nthis country, including Montana.\n  Job counselors work closely with veterans and local employers to \nconnect former servicemembers with good jobs close to home. These \ncounselors develop extensive knowledge of local job and training \nopportunities and maintain a list of resources that prepare veterans to \nenter the workforce. Right now the Labor Department allocates job \ncounselors based solely on population without taking into account the \ndistances that folks have to travel in rural America. That often means \nveterans in my State of Montana travel hundreds of miles for the \nemployment assistance they have earned, and it leaves the six job \ncounselors we have to cover tens of thousands of veterans over an area \nthe size of the entire northeast border.\n  My provision will fix this imbalance. It will give large and rural \nStates such as Montana enough job counselors to serve all parts of the \nState and help to ensure that they are developing relationships with \nveterans and employers that will put more veterans back to work.\n  The Veterans Jobs Corps Act is fully paid for, and it shouldn't be \ncontroversial at a time when our veterans continue to struggle or at a \ntime when more and more veterans continue to return from the \nbattlefields in Afghanistan. Our veterans fought hard for this country, \nand their families have sacrificed much. We owe it to them to put aside \npolitical differences and to pass this bill. It is a responsible \nmeasure that will make our communities safer, preserve our most \ntreasured places, and will move this country forward. Our veterans \nearned nothing less.\n  I especially want to thank Senator Bill Nelson for his leadership on \nthis important bill. It deserves the support of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, like many of my colleagues, I am \nvery proud to support the Veterans Jobs Corps Act of 2012.\n  Very simply, this measure keeps faith with our veterans, offers them \nemployment opportunities commensurate not only with what they have \ngiven to the country, what they have served and sacrificed to \naccomplish and give back, but also with their skills and talents and \ngifts that have been enhanced and enlarged by their military service. \nThis measure addresses the chronic and persistent problem of \nunemployment among our young veterans. It is a searing indictment of \nour Nation that unemployment among these young veterans is many \npercentage points higher than the average population.\n  What is happening in this country is that a new generation is \nreturning home--a new generation of veterans ready to work, wanting to \nserve in civilian life just as they had in the military. With the \nending of the war in Iraq and the winding down of our presence in \nAfghanistan, 200,000 servicemembers are transitioning to the civilian \nworkforce every year.\n  In July 2011 there were 232,000 post-9/11 era veterans unemployed. \nThat is 12.4 percent as an unemployment rate. The August jobs report of \nthis year shows that the most recent unemployment rate for post-9/11 \nveterans is 10.9 percent, and for Connecticut it is just under 10 \npercent.\n  There are many more statistics that show unemployment rates for these \nyoung veterans--particularly for our enlisted men and women coming back \nfrom Iraq and Afghanistan--are higher, some would estimate double the \naverage rate across the population. They are an indictment of our \ncommitment and our obligation unfulfilled so far by the greatest Nation \nin the history of the world.\n  Too often in our history we have failed to keep faith, and we have \nleft veterans behind. I have advocated measures in health care, \ncounseling, training, and employment opportunities. But I want to focus \non one measure in particular where all of us joined forces and reached \na consensus as recently as last November.\n  The Veterans Jobs Corps Act of 2012 is a new measure that would \nprovide opportunities in conservation and in other kinds of public \nservice, firefighting, and police. But there is an existing measure \nwhose very life is threatened because it will expire in 2012. This \nmeasure is the VOW to Hire Heroes Act, specifically the tax credits \nunder those measures for hiring unemployed or disabled veterans. Those \ntax credits will expire at the end of this year unless they are \nrenewed. That is the reason I am introducing legislation, along with \ncosponsors Senators Webb, Cantwell, Tom Udall, Heller, and Mikulski, \nthat extends the VOW to Hire Heroes Act tax credit through the end of \n2016.\n  This measure is important to be extended because it offers these \nveterans new opportunities, and promotes and incentivizes employers to \nput our veterans to work.\n  Hiring a veteran is not only the right thing to do to honor the men \nand women who have sacrificed, the men and women of our country, it \nalso makes good business sense. Veterans are among our most highly \nskilled, capable, disciplined, reliable, and dedicated workers. \nBusinesses ought to relish their services. Countless businesses big and \nsmall have already found that veterans are a tremendous asset to their \nworkforce. This bill is important to build on the measures we have in \nplace. Simply, it makes these veterans even more attractive.\n  Last month I visited the Arna Machine Company in Bristol, CT, and I \ntalked with a young veteran whose name is Nick Saucier, a former Army \nsniper who served in Afghanistan and now works there as a machinist. \nBeing a former Army sniper, Nick knows about precision and care, taking \nyour time to be on target. He is now training to use computer-assisted \nmanufacturing software with the same care and precision and discipline \nthat he developed in his Army training as a sniper.\n  While I was at Arna, I talked to Stephen Shanahan, the president of \nthe company, who is very proud and rightly proud of having 42 employees \nand growing in this tough economy. He is hiring and he said to me these \ntax credits have helped him fill positions with young qualified \npersonnel who are veterans.\n  I have also worked with Congressman Chris Murphy to survey \nmanufacturers about veteran hiring. This legislation is the result of \nthose conversations and discussions, the data and the\n\n[[Page S6316]]\n\nfeedback we received, as well as consultation with my friend Bud Bucha, \nwho has helped me time and again address the challenges facing \nveterans.\n  These tax credits will expire, they will end unless we renew them. We \nowe it to our veterans, to our business community, to manufacturers and \nsmall businesses that want to do the right thing, to make sure they \nhave this incentive. I have heard from employers and veterans firsthand \nthat many of them were not aware of this tax credit, so I have proposed \nas part of this legislation increased measures to create awareness and \nspread the word about these tax incentives so that big companies with \ntheir tax attorneys, but also smaller companies that may not have the \nconsultants and the accountants to do this kind of work, know of it and \ntake advantage of it.\n  This measure also simplifies the process for veterans and small \nbusinesses to take advantage of the tax incentives. Currently, to be a \n``qualified veteran,'' individuals must gain approval through a local \nemployment agency, which can be unnecessarily time consuming and \nburdensome to them and to the potential employer. This bill offered \ntoday would modify the Work Opportunity Tax Credit process to allow \nindividuals to be considered qualified veterans for tax purposes if \nthey simply provide a DD 214, have an honorable discharge, and valid \nproof of unemployment.\n  This bill would also extend the amount of time employers have to take \nadvantage of tax credits for hiring unemployed or disabled veterans, \nenhancing its use to countless small businesses as well as veterans. It \nwould allow employers to take advantage of these tax credits for an \nadditional 4 years, providing returning service men and women with a \nclear path to employment when they need it, and they will need it over \nthese 4 years.\n  I am very honored that this bill has been endorsed by the Veterans of \nForeign Wars and the American Legion, which have been championing \nemployment opportunities for veterans.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue their support for veterans by \nsupporting this legislation which will create more good jobs. We owe \nour veterans more good jobs. And it will grow our economy.\n  Let me say, finally, nearly three-quarters of a million veterans--to \nbe more precise, 742,000 men and women--are eligible for the employer \nhiring tax credits. Let's do the right thing. Let's extend these tax \ncredits. We adopted them overwhelmingly last November in the VOW to \nHire Heroes Act. We have it in our power and it is our obligation to \nmeet this challenge. For our veterans we should do no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Foreign Aid\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, last evening I had a spirited exchange \nwith the majority leader. The exchange was over whether we should send \nbillions of dollars, billions of dollars we technically don't even \nhave, to foreign countries that disrespect us, foreign countries that \nhave tortured people who are friends of America.\n  In Pakistan, Dr. Shakil Afridi helped us to get bin Laden. He has \nbeen tortured, kept in prison, and now been given a life sentence. I \nhave asked one simple thing. I want to have 15 minutes, have a \ndiscussion, and have a vote on whether we should continue to send money \nto Pakistan. I have said we should send not one penny to Pakistan until \nthis doctor is released. We offered at one time a $50 million reward \nfor help in getting bin Laden. Young men and women sacrificed their \nlimbs to go to Afghanistan, many sacrificed their lives to go to \nPakistan to get bin Laden. And this man who helped get bin Laden, we \nare now letting him rot in a prison. We are now letting this man spend \nthe rest of his life in prison.\n  Do you know what this administration did? About a month ago they gave \nPakistan about $1 billion more. Do you know how Pakistan responded? The \nhead of the security agency for Pakistan said very snidely and with a \ngreat deal of arrogance: Come back and talk to us in 10 years about Dr. \nAfridi. They are going to keep him in prison for the rest of his life \nif he is not killed. His life has been threatened. Other prisoners and \nthe public have threatened his family's life.\n\n  Is this how we treat a friend of America? I have asked for 15 minutes \nto have a vote. Why don't they want to have a vote? Because they know \nthe American people are with me. If you ask the question, ``Should we \nsend money to countries that don't like us and disrespect us?'' 80 to \n90 percent of the American people are with me.\n  They are afraid to vote on this issue. I have been giving them a \nchance to debate this for 6 weeks now. We have spent the whole week up \nhere not having a debate because they do not want to have a vote \nbecause they know if they vote their position, which is to send your \nmoney to Pakistan and to Egypt and to Libya, the American people will \nnot like it. So they are not willing to stand in the broad daylight and \nvote to continue this aid. They just do not want to have the vote.\n  Last evening the majority leader said that his concern is over the \nveterans benefits bill. I also am concerned, so I have reconsidered my \namendment. My amendment before would return the money to the Treasury \nand to counteract the debt. We would take the somewhere between $3 and \n$4 billion and send it back to the Treasury. But if what is holding \nthis up is that the majority leader thinks this is not in any way \nconnected with veterans benefits, why don't we take half of the $4 \nbillion that we would not send to Pakistan, let's take that half of \nthat and put that into veterans benefits. I am willing to triple the \nsize of the veterans benefits bill if we will take the money from where \nwe should not be spending it.\n  Some will stand and they will argue: Gosh, we have to be engaged in \nPakistan because they have nuclear weapons. I am not saying disengage. \nI am just saying you don't have to bribe people to be our friend. We \ndon't have the money anyway. We have to borrow the money from China to \nsend it to Pakistan. I am not saying don't have relations with \nPakistan. Many in Pakistan have been sympathetic to our country. Many \nin Pakistan have helped our country. But many in Pakistan, with a wink \nand a nod, look at us, take our money and laugh at us. They cash our \ncheck and they laugh at us.\n  The American people are tired of this. Our Treasury is bare. There is \na multitude of reasons why we should not continue to send good money \nafter bad. Compound that with the tragedy that has occurred over the \nlast couple of days, the tragedy of our Ambassador being assassinated \nin Libya and three of his fellow workers killed; the tragedy of our \nembassy being attacked in Egypt. We give Egypt $3 billion a year, and \ndo you know what. Egypt cannot protect or will not protect our embassy. \nThere was a phone call to the embassy from someone in Egypt saying the \nmob is coming. A phone call is not enough. Do you think they could have \nsent soldiers and tanks to protect our embassy? They gave us a phone \ncall saying the mob is coming.\n  Egypt needs to act as our ally if they want to continue to cash our \nchecks. My position is: Not one penny more for Libya or Egypt or \nPakistan until they act as our allies. Some say we have to keep sending \nit. Fine, let's send it when they act as our allies. Let's send it when \nthey start behaving as civilized nations and come to their senses.\n  I have an amendment, and I am going to ask unanimous consent to bring \nthis amendment forward. I may be surprised, but I think the other side \nis going to object. I will be asking for 15 minutes of the Senate's \ntime to vote on ending this aid. Instead, we are taking half of the $4 \nbillion we are squandering overseas and giving to people who don't like \nus and putting it toward the deficit and using the other half of that \naid and putting it into veterans' benefits.\n  If we are really talking about veterans' benefits and really serious \nabout providing money for the veterans, let's take it from an area \nwhich is insulting to veterans. Let's take it from a country that \ninsults every veteran in this country, Pakistan. Our men and women gave \ntheir lives to fight a war in Afghanistan and in neighboring Pakistan \nto get the chief architect of 9/11, bin Laden. Let's memorialize those \npeople who sacrificed their lives and the veterans by saying we are not\n\n[[Page S6317]]\n\ngoing to give money to a country that disrespects and disavows \neverything we have done over the last 10 years to combat terrorism.\n  I ask unanimous consent we resume consideration of S. 3457, set aside \nthe pending amendments, and call up my amendment No. 2838.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, let me \nfirst mention that, sadly, this afternoon we learned one of the four \npeople who were killed in Libya, Glen Doherty, is a Massachusetts \nnative, a former Navy Seal and State Department security official who \nwas guarding and caring for the Ambassador and taking care of the \nwounded people there.\n  As Senator McCain, Senator Lindsey Graham, and Senator Lieberman said \non the floor yesterday, I believe cutting the aid to any of these \ncountries right now in this fashion is not the way to honor the memory \nof Ambassador Chris Stevens. He went there in great danger to help that \ncountry be free and have an opportunity for democracy. Glen Doherty did \nthe same thing. He put his life on the line in order to help the \nLibyans.\n  The Senator from Kentucky might be surprised to know that the Libyan \npeople--by vast numbers--are grateful to the United States and are \nmourning the death of Ambassador Stevens. I heard the Senator from \nKentucky--frankly, in a kind of arrogant statement is really the only \nway I can frame it--say several times: Start behaving like a civilized \nnation. Well, by whose standard and when? The Libyan and Egyptian \nGovernments didn't do what is happening there. The Yemen Government \nsent its people to protect our people, and we helped negotiate the \ntransfer of authority to this new government in Yemen.\n  Are they having difficulties? Yes. Go back and look at the United \nStates of America in the 1700s. We had some difficulties. We had to \nwrite slavery out of the Constitution, not to mention a bunch of other \nthings. It takes time. The arrogance of suggesting that we are going to \njudge whether they are civilized today or tomorrow because a mob or a \nbunch of militants took matters into their own hands would just be so \nself-defeating and such a narrow effort that anyone could possibly \nconceive.\n  I ask if the Senator has ever been to Pakistan? Has the Senator ever \nbeen to Egypt? The Senator doesn't want to answer. I presume that means \nhe has not. He ought to go to Egypt and see what those people are \nstruggling to do. There was a revolution in Tehrir Square. It wasn't an \nIslamic revolution; it was a generational revolution, a bunch of young \npeople with smart phones tweeting and Googling each other trying to \ntouch the world and have a future. The Senator wants to cut off \nAmerican assistance to these nascent democratic efforts?\n  Whatever happened to the great commitment of the conservative \nmovement in America to freedom and democracy and to help it develop? \nJust turn our back on it and pull out the aid? What the heck. Because \nwe don't think they are civilized. I find it kind of stunning when the \nSenator says: Foreign countries that aren't friendly. The countries \ndidn't do these things. It is the militant extremists and radical \nterrorists within those countries whom those people are struggling to \nbeat back.\n  Right now there are troops in the western part of Pakistan losing \ntheir lives by fighting extremists. Cut off the aid, and we send the \nmessage: If you don't do exactly what we say, exactly when we say, \nexactly the way we want, we are not going to give you the pittance we \ngive you.\n  We give less than 1 percent of the entire budget of the United States \nof America. Less than 1 percent goes into all of our foreign \noperations, all of our embassies, our security, and our aid. It is 1 \npercent. The impact is extraordinary. The Senator wants to just cut it \noff? OK.\n  We have 130,000 troops in Afghanistan, and they are largely supplied \nnow somewhat from the northern route that has been created. They are \nalso supplied from Karachi by road all the way over the Khyber Pass and \ndown into Afghanistan. We have gone through a long process of working \nwith the Pakistanis to be able to renew and do that.\n  As everybody knows, we have decimated al-Qaida in the western part of \ntheir country. Civilians are being killed in their country in an effort \nto protect our country. They have endured that. Their political system \nhas endured that, and we are just going to turn around and say we are \ngoing to pull the aid out and we only want to do it with 15 minutes on \nthe floor of the Senate? Here is a major policy consideration, and we \njust want 15 minutes because it is that simple.\n  These are four countries which are all critical to the future of the \nregion in the Middle East. Egypt is an essential partner with respect \nto the potential of peace in the Middle East, one-quarter of the Arab \nworld.\n  I have been to Egypt many times. I have sat with the new President, \nPresident Morrissey, and I have met with others engaged in this \ntransformation. They are trying to be a legitimate democracy. Yes, \ntheir people won the election, and we are not exactly on the same page, \nbut that is what happens in democracies. That is what happens when \npeople vote. Are we not going to respect their democracy?\n  I just say to my friend from Kentucky, there are critical issues at \nstake. We are not buying it. What we are doing is trying to help them \nto be able to make this transformation to a full-throated, full-blooded \ndemocracy that can respect its court system and its elected \ninstitutions, and it doesn't come easily.\n  Their police were decimated in the course of the revolution. There \nwas corruption and they are working to change that. There is a whole \nunbelievable transformation taking place. It is not going to be pretty. \nIt is difficult. There are a lot of unscrupulous people we all know \nhave hated us for a long time who would love to get the upper hand. If \nwe pull out, we give them the upper hand. Stay there and we have an \nopportunity to do what Chris Stevens, Glen Doherty, and a lot of other \npeople were doing, which is stand and fight for the interest of the \nUnited States of America because we have real interests in those \nplaces. That is what this is about.\n  First of all, it deserves more than 15 minutes. Secondly, it is not \nappropriate to do it on a veterans bill where we desperately need to \nget this help to our veterans. Do it freestanding. We ought to do it in \nthe proper way. Do it through our committee. We will have a hearing. I \nam happy to have that done properly. This is not the way to do it, and \nthis is not the moment to do it. It would have a profoundly negative \nimpact that could contribute to even more violence and not stem it if \nthat were our reaction.\n  Madam President, I do object, and hopefully at some point I will be \nhappy to have this debate. It is a worthwhile one, but this is not the \ntime and this is not the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Veterans Jobs Corps Act\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the Veterans Jobs Corps bill creates a \nnew mandatory program that would cost $1 billion over 5 years. As the \nranking Republican on the Budget Committee and someone who is committed \nto ensuring that we honor our commitments as part of our process in the \nSenate, I am concerned about the cost of the bill and the fact that it \nviolates our budget agreement entered into last year.\n  The spending on this new program is to be offset by, we are told, \n$119 million in direct spending reductions and $1.132 billion in new \ntaxes. So it is a tax-and-spend bill.\n  My staff on the Senate Budget Committee has confirmed that there is a \n302(f) Budget Act point of order against the Veterans Jobs Corps Act \nwith the managers' amendment as it is presently. So that is the \nsituation. So when I say we have confirmed that, what I mean is that we \nhave talked to the Budget Committee chairman, Senator Conrad, and his \nstaff, and they have\n\n[[Page S6318]]\n\nconfirmed our conclusion that this violates the Budget Control Act.\n  The 302(f) point of order lies against this bill because the Veterans \nJobs Corps bill, as amended, would cause an increase in the budget \nauthority and outlays above the Veterans' Affairs Committee's \nallocation that was deemed by the Budget Control Act. The Veterans Jobs \nCorps bill would specifically cause an increase in budget authority and \noutlays above the Veterans' Affairs Committee's allocation by $61 \nmillion in 2013 and $480 million between the 5 years of 2013 and 2017. \nSo the budget gimmicks in the Veterans Jobs Corps Act are significant \nand very troubling.\n  The CBO accounting procedures don't catch this, but it is very real. \nThey don't catch it because the people who wrote the legislation wrote \nit in a way so they could avoid the proper score from the CBO in this \nprocess.\n  The bill shifts the timing of corporate income tax payments so that \nit appears to collect $135 million in additional revenue in 2013. What \ndoes that mean? A month or so before these payments are due, they \naccelerate the receipt of those payments. The payments fall in this \nyear, and bingo, we say we have another $135 million we can spend. \nIsn't that wonderful. We just accelerate the date and the time that it \nwould be paid. However, this is simply a smoke-and-mirrors scheme since \nthe timing shift in payments will lead to exactly $135 million less in \ntaxes collected in 2014. In other words, if we were planning on \ncollecting $135 million next year and we collect it this year, the \npeople who owed the money next year don't owe it anymore; they have \nalready paid it. So there is a hole in next year. I have offered under \nthe Honest Budget Act, along with Senator Olympia Snowe and other \ncolleagues, legislation that would end this pernicious gimmick. It is \nworse than a gimmick.\n  This bill uses the exact same mechanism in 2017 and in 2018. The bill \ncollects $392 million more in tax payments in 2017, but--and I have the \nchart from the Congressional Budget Office--it collects $392 million \nless in 2018. Do my colleagues follow me? We just accelerate the money, \nwe spend the money, we get it this year, but we don't get it the next \nyear. So over a period of time, this is a gimmick. It creates no new \nreal money, but it creates the appearance of having real money and it \nis the appearance of money that is being spent, not real money. This is \njust one of the examples of how this country is going broke.\n  If this gimmick was not included, the Veterans Jobs Corps bill would \nincrease the deficit by $38 million in 2013 and by $324 million over \nthe period of 2013 through 2017. About one-third of the total \nexpenditure of the bill is based on this gimmick. Our Democratic \ncolleagues have used this budget gimmick to claim that it decreases the \ndeficit by $97 million in 2013 and by $68 million in 2013 through 2017, \na 5-year period.\n  I believe these points about the Federal budget process are \nindisputable. I know what CBO says about it. If we look at their \nnumbers and we examine it over a period of 6 years, we see clearly that \nthe money is not there. I invite any member who wants to suggest that \nthis is real money the U.S. Treasury is receiving to come to the floor \nand explain how they think they are correct. I don't believe that I am \nin error.\n  To put it simply, the money my Democratic colleagues claim in the \nbill as revenue isn't there. It appears to be there on paper, but that \nis not the truth. The American people need to know the truth.\n  We simply spend more money on the Veterans' Affairs Committee \nallocations than was agreed to in the Budget Control Act. We are \nalready violating that. We have done it already this year. As a result, \nwe have eroded the small, but significant steps we took to bring some \nspending under control.\n  The Budget Control Act would have reduced spending by $2.1 trillion \nover 10 years for the entire U.S. budget. Well, how much is that? We \nknow that $2.1 trillion is a lot. It is a lot, but we plan to spend $47 \ntrillion over that 10 years. So we would be reducing our projected \nspending from $47 trillion to $45 trillion over 10 years. Surely we can \ndo that. That is not a cut, because if we spend for 10 years at the \ncurrent level of spending, we would be spending $37 trillion, so we are \nstill increasing spending from $37 trillion to $45 trillion, just not \n$47 trillion. And the Republic is not going to sink into the ocean with \nthose kinds of cuts, but it would begin to put us on a path of honesty \nand responsibility and end the unsustainable debt course we are now on.\n  I am not happy about this. I will make this budget point of order \nformally when we get back on the bill. I don't know when that will be \nbecause for right now we have gotten off of it. But I want my \ncolleagues to know what the situation is, because it may be at 1 \no'clock tomorrow morning when we have that done.\n  I wish to say this: This Congress has had the worst record in \ndecades, maybe in 100 years. We haven't had a budget for over 3 years. \nWe haven't dealt with the sequester that has to be dealt with before \nthe end of the year.\n  This Senate--not the House but this Senate--has not passed a single \nappropriations bill. To my knowledge, I say to my colleague Senator \nHatch, I don't believe we have ever failed to have a single bill, \nalthough several times we have only had a few. But now we have none, \nand they have made it a policy of the majority party not to bring up a \nsingle bill so we can cobble it all together in some big omnibus CR and \npass it in the dead of night, maybe on Christmas Eve, after the \nelection is over. We should have been doing that all year long.\n  We haven't dealt with the tax increases that are going to hammer the \neconomy in January, and we haven't passed a budget in over 1,000 days. \nThe House has passed a good budget which would change the debt course \nof America and put us on a sound path. They sent over a Defense \nauthorization bill. They sent over a Defense appropriations bill, and \nmost of the appropriations bills, until it became clear Senator Reid \nsaid we are not going to pass them anymore. They sent over other good \nlegislation that is dying in the Senate.\n  There are ways to help veterans get jobs. There are already six jobs \nprograms for veterans now--six of them now. Maybe they could be \nimproved or fixed, and if we do it right, we could create a bill that \nhelps veterans get jobs without violating the budget.\n  Before I yield the floor, I am pleased to see my colleague Senator \nHatch, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee. His \nleadership on the Judiciary Committee and Finance Committee is well-\nknown in this body and I am honored to serve with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                          Unfinished Business\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleague, who makes a \nlot of very important points here today, and I hope everyone in this \nbody is paying attention.\n  Back in June I came to the floor to discuss the many items of \nunfinished business the Congress must take up before the end of the \nyear. Among those items are a number of tax-related issues that simply \ncannot be put off without inflicting more damage on our economy and on \nour American taxpayers.\n  When I spoke on the floor regarding this tax agenda 3 months ago, I \nused this chart right here.\n  Sadly, as you can see from this chart, things have not changed since \nthen. We still need to resolve the death tax. As you can see, death tax \nrelief is the third one down listed on the chart. It will expire at the \nend of 2012. We need to act in order to prevent a hike in the death tax \nin 2013. Unfortunately, rather than work to prevent an increase in the \ndeath tax, a number of my colleagues voted earlier this summer to \nexpand it significantly.\n  While we have passed a bill through the Finance Committee, the Senate \nhas yet to act on the tax extenders, which expired 9 months ago. As you \ncan see, we have not done the tax extenders, either, on the floor.\n  We still have not acted to address the alternative minimum tax, or \nAMT, which is set to hit millions of Americans if we do not act to \npatch it. That is right there as the second item on this chart. This \nissue of the AMT, the alternative minimum tax, needs to be discussed in \nsome detail because the failure to resolve the AMT is emblematic of the \nfailure of this administration to take even the most basic steps to \nprotect American families from the\n\n[[Page S6319]]\n\ntax increases looming at the end of this year. Nearly 4 million \nfamilies paid the AMT in 2011. Yet, if nothing is done to address the \nAMT in this session, an additional 27 to 28 million families will be \nhit with a surprise AMT tax increase on tax day next April. Now, that \nbears repeating. There are 27 or 28 million families who have \nheretofore not been hit by the AMT who will be hit if Congress fails to \nact before the end of this year. But even that does not tell the whole \nstory. More than twice that number, that is, 60 million American \nfamilies, will have to fill out the AMT--alternative minimum tax--\nworksheet on their tax forms just to determine whether they owe \nanything under the AMT. This is a textbook example of the \nadministrative burden and deadweight loss that our complicated Tax Code \nimposes on the American economy. For those who will be hit by the AMT, \nthis is not just a reality that will hit on April 15 of next year, it \nis a reality today. Those families ensnared by the AMT are required to \nmake estimated tax payments, and Monday of next week, September 17, the \nthird such payment is due.\n  The AMT has become a unique burden because of the way it is \nstructured. Unlike most provisions in the Tax Code, the level of income \nexempt from the AMT is not automatically adjusted for inflation. For 11 \nyears, we have passed legislation to temporarily raise the AMT \nexemption, which was originally meant for only 155 millionaires who did \nnot pay any taxes. But each time we face an expiration of one of these \ntemporary raises--like we do again this year--we risk seeing the AMT \nreturn to its permanent level. Over time, that becomes more and more \nproblematic as more and more Americans have incomes that reach the \nunadjusted AMT income level. These temporary exemption increases have \nbeen enacted to prevent millions of middle-class American families from \nfalling prey to the AMT. But now, the closer we get to the end of 2012 \nwithout another AMT patch, the more likely it becomes that the tax will \nhit an unprecedented number of American families.\n  Ultimately, we need a permanent fix for the AMT. This annual shell \ngame needs to come to an end. This tax was initially created over 50 \nyears ago to address 155 high-income individuals who paid zero in \nincome taxes--155 people. Because of its poor design, today an \nadditional 27 million Americans, many squarely in the middle class, are \nnow threatened by the AMT.\n  The President and his allies assure us that AMT relief is a top \npriority, but that seems to be just more talk. The President's budget \nproposed a permanent fix to the AMT by replacing it with a so-called \nBuffett tax, but the President's math just never added up. Supposedly, \nnonpartisan policy experts and fact checkers have been eager beavers \nwhen it comes to criticizing the math in Governor Romney's tax \nproposal, but maybe they should check the President's math as well.\n  If we do not eliminate the AMT, it will hit millions and millions of \nAmerican taxpayers, unjustly so. The President claims a permanent fix \nis a priority of his. In his fiscal year 2013 budget, he proposed to \noffset it with the Buffett tax. People treat the President's fiscal \nyear 2013 budget as though it never happened. In some sense, I \nunderstand that. It received not a single vote in the U.S. Senate, even \nwith his own party controlling the Chamber. But that said, it is the \nPresident's budget. He wrote it. He presented it. He owns it. And how \ndoes it add up? Consider the math on his permanent AMT fix. Again, he \nproposes to replace the AMT--ostensibly helping middle-class \ntaxpayers--with the Buffett tax--ostensibly hurting the evil rich. That \nsounds great until you look at the numbers. How much revenue loss would \nthere be from a permanent AMT fix? Madam President, $864 billion, to be \nexact. And how much would the Buffett tax yield? Fifty billion \ndollars--a little less, actually. So the Buffett tax misses the target \nby over 94 percent. The President would need to increase his Buffett \ntax by over 1,600 percent to fill in the gap. There are not enough \nPinocchios in all of Disney World to describe the phoniness that is the \nPresident's AMT proposal.\n  Ultimately, the AMT needs to go in its entirety. It will probably go \nas part of comprehensive tax reform. Unfortunately, President Obama and \nhis campaign are undercutting the prospects for tax reform every day \nwith their dishonest attacks on Governor Romney's tax proposal, a key \nelement of which has been endorsed by the Chairman of the President's \nown Export Council even as his desperate campaign attacks that same \nfeature. But absent a permanent AMT fix, a temporary patch is both a \nviable and a necessary option.\n  So here we are, with all of these must-address measures. We have the \nAMT, tax extenders, the death tax, sequestration, and, of course, the \nexpiration of the 2001-2003 tax relief that threatens to throw our \neconomy into another recession. Yet, at a moment crying out for \nPresidential leadership, we get campaign partisanship. The President \nand his allies only seem concerned about getting past the next \nelection. At a time when serious solutions to our fiscal crisis are \ndemanded, they offer no plans of their own. We hear that we need to \nstay the course, but the course we are on has provided us with four \nstraight trillion-dollar-plus deficits and a debt that threatens not \nonly our long-term but immediate fiscal well-being.\n  The President's suggestion that we can solve these problems by \ncutting defense spending and raising taxes on the wealthy is a parody \nof serious fiscal policy. It might be good for a bumper sticker, a \ncollege sociology seminar, or an Occupy Wall Street sit-in, but the \nnumbers do not add up.\n  The President's mantra is that tax increases on the rich are all that \nis necessary to pay every bill and balance every budget. That is not an \noversimplification. If you watch the President's campaign commercials, \nthe only thing he says about balancing the budget is that he wants to \n``ask the wealthy to pay a little more.'' If that is truly the extent \nof the President's plan for solving our fiscal crisis, he is either \nbeing dishonest or he needs to invest in a new calculator.\n  Let me give an example. Our Nation currently faces what some, \nincluding Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, have called a fiscal \ncliff. With tax relief scheduled to expire at the end of this year, our \nNation faces the possibility of being thrown into another recession. \nAccording to the CBO, that outcome is a certainty if the tax relief \nsigned by both Presidents Bush and Obama is allowed to expire under \ncurrent economic conditions. Yet, rather than working with the \nRepublicans in Congress to extend that tax relief--tax relief that \noriginally passed with bipartisan support and was extended in a similar \nfashion in 2010--President Obama has opted to hold American taxpayers \nhostage in order to extract a tax increase for those making more than \n$250,000 a year. And why? Not to help the economy and not to reduce the \ndeficit but for electoral votes. The President and his supporters claim \nthese tax increases are necessary if we are to get our fiscal house in \norder, but if you do the math, the President's proposal would only \nraise enough revenue to reduce this year's deficit by 5 percent. It \nwould be just enough to fund the government's activities for about a \nweek.\n  Whether we are talking about the Buffett tax in the context of the \nAMT discussion or the President's fixation with raising the top \nmarginal tax rates in the midst of a historically weak economic \nrecovery, it is clear that the President and his allies in Congress are \nnot serious about addressing the issues most important to the American \npeople. These issues will not go away after the election, but the \nPresident has offered no positive program for getting us out of this \nmess. And I have gotten quite a kick out of them saying Governor Romney \nshould be more specific on what he is doing. Where is the President's \nplan? What is he going to do? How are we going to get out of this \nfiscal mess? Not a doggone thing being said except things that do not \nadd up mathematically--to borrow a very important phrase by a person \nfrom the Democratic Party during our convention.\n  Now, the President might envision himself as this century's Franklin \nRoosevelt, but in this campaign the only thing President Obama has to \noffer is fear--fear itself. His failure to offer solutions does not \njust have a theoretical impact, this failure of leadership hits real \npeople in a real way. Do not just ask those making their quarterly tax\n\n[[Page S6320]]\n\npayments on Monday. Ask any small business owner whether they are \nworried about their taxes going up next year. Ask any American who is \nhaving trouble making ends meet if they are concerned that Congress has \nneglected to address so many issues that will dramatically impact their \nfinancial well-being.\n  When the Senate recesses next week until after Election Day, I wonder \nwhat my colleagues in the majority will tell their constituents when \nthey are asked why Congress has not acted on these items. This \nchecklist right here that we were talking about before, all of those \nare important. We have to do those. My guess is they will say it all \nhad to wait until after the election. That is all they can say because \nif they were to come clean, they would have to admit that they did not \nwant to pass any of these things. They were more interested in \ncampaigning on our tax problems than on fixing them.\n  If we go until the end of the year without addressing these pressing \nissues, the wound to our Nation's economic and fiscal well-being will \nbe entirely self-inflicted. These are matters that could have and \nshould have been addressed months ago, and we need to address all of \nthose issues. That we have arrived at this point--three-quarters of the \nway through the year--without fixing these problems should be an \nembarrassment to the President and those in Congress who are supportive \nof his agenda.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have a parliamentary inquiry. What is \nthe parliamentary situation as it exists?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the motion to proceed to S. \n3521.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the pending legislation open for amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not. The Senate is on the motion to \nproceed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How long has the Senate been on the motion to proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate went to the motion this morning.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n\n                         Defense Authorization\n\n  I was just glancing through the often-read calendar of business here \nthat we chop down a lot of trees to provide on every Senator's desk on \na daily basis. It is the Calendar of Business for Thursday, September \n13. On page 58, for order No. 419, is S. 3254, by Mr. Levin, ``a bill \nto authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2013 for military \nactivities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and \nfor defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \nmilitary personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \npurposes.'' This was reported and placed on the calendar on June 4, \n2012. So for nearly 4 months we have had the Defense authorization bill \npending on the legislative calendar.\n  Meanwhile, we have been taken up with other important items, such as \nthe one we are considering now, one that praises, as we all do, our \nveterans, with efforts for our veterans to obtain jobs. We already have \nsix veterans job-training programs, but, what the heck, let's have \nanother one.\n  Meanwhile, the men and women who are serving in the military, who \nwill be veterans, are not having authorized the equipment, the \ntraining, the programs, the health care, family support systems for \nmilitary families, for example, strengthening training, oversight, and \nthe prevention of military sexual assault, ensuring that reductions in \nmilitary personnel are matched with comparable savings in civilian \npersonnel and contractors over the next 5 years, without sacrificing \nmission-critical capabilities. It authorizes $135 billion for military \npersonnel, for the men and women who are serving today, including the \ncost of pay allowances, bonuses, and a 1.7-percent much-deserved, \nacross-the-board pay raise for all members of the uniformed armed \nservices. It also includes nearly $1 billion in unemployment benefits \nfor members who leave military service and cannot find civilian jobs. \nIt authorizes all our major weapons systems and every piece of \nequipment large or small that the Department of Defense needs and the \nmen and women need who are still fighting in a war.\n\n  We found out in the last day or so that we still live in an extremely \ndangerous world. It authorizes $525 billion for the Defense Department, \n$88 billion for operations in Afghanistan and around the world, and \n$17.8 billion to maintain our nuclear deterrent. I think we have just \nseen with the tragic death of our Ambassador that al-Qaida and other \nextremist organizations are making a comeback in places such as Iraq \nand Afghanistan; certainly extremists were present in Libya in the \ntragic death of four Americans.\n  This legislation enhances the capabilities of our military and \npartners to counter and ultimately defeat al-Qaida and its regional \naffiliates which remain intent on attacking the United States and our \ninterests.\n  But there is an issue that all of us are concerned about, cyber \nwarfare, those attacks that we know are coming sooner or later. This \nlegislation improves the ability of our Armed Forces to counter \nnontraditional threats focusing on terrorism cyber warfare and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  I could go on and on about the importance of this legislation which \nhas been before this body for 4 months. And what has the Democratic \nleader of this Senate done? We are about to go out of session next week \nwithout addressing the most important responsibility of this Senate and \ntheir elected representatives which is our Nation's defense.\n  In the meantime, when we take up bills, the majority leader ``fills \nup the tree.'' A lot of people do not know what that means. That means \nwe cannot have an amendment. Then we vote and we drop that particular \npiece of legislation. Then the next week we will take up a piece of \nlegislation that somehow will enhance the majority leader's ability to \nmaintain his position as majority leader, certainly not believing that \nthat legislation will actually be passed by the Senate.\n  Every year for 51 years the Senate has passed the Defense \nauthorization bill, it has gone to conference and been signed by the \nPresident of the United States. The majority leader of the Senate and \nthe Members on the other side of this body have been derelict in their \nduties, and we are about for the first time in 50 years not to \nauthorize what the men and women who are putting their lives on the \nline for us every single day need very badly.\n  You know, sometimes my colleagues wonder why the American people hold \nus in such low esteem. If we cannot enact legislation that has us carry \nout our most important duties as representatives of the people, \nincluding the men and women in the military, then I am surprised that \nso many Americans still approve of the way Congress operates.\n  What have we watched here on the floor of the Senate for the last 4 \nmonths since this bill was put on the calendar and could have been \ntaken up, debated and passed by the Senate as we have every year for 50 \nyears? The majority leader of the Senate has refused to bring this bill \nbefore the body for debate, discussion, amendment and passage, our most \nsolemn responsibility.\n  All I can say is, shame, shame, shame that we have not fulfilled the \nresponsibilities to the men and women who are sacrificing their very \nlives on our behalf, a failure of colossal proportions. All I can say \nis I believe that the American people are aware, and I believe the \nAmerican people deserve a lot better than they are getting from this \nbody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons.) The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I want to follow up on the comments of the \ndistinguished ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee \nwho, of course, through his own service and sacrifice for our country \nknows too well how important it is for us to stand with our men and \nwomen in uniform. I wanted to follow up on what he said.\n  This body is about to go out and adjourn next week without passing a \nDefense authorization bill. It would be the first time in over 50 years \nin the history of our country. There is no plan that we have heard from \nthe majority leader as to when we will take up this incredibly \nimportant legislation for our country.\n  What Senator McCain has already outlined addresses issues such as pay \nfor our soldiers and the equipment they\n\n[[Page S6321]]\n\nneed and benefits they deserve and they have earned, and all of the \nimportant issues that impact the protection of our country, and making \nsure we stand in faith with our men and women in uniform.\n  But I have to say that, unfortunately, this is part of a pattern of \nwhere we are right now in the Senate. It is very disappointing. I got \nelected in 2010. I know the Presiding Officer did as well. I came here \nbecause I saw that our country was in trouble. At the time I ran, we \nwere $13 trillion in debt. Now we are $16 trillion in debt.\n  I have the privilege of serving on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. It really is a privilege. I am the wife of an Iraq war \nveteran, very proud of our men and women in uniform. I take that \nresponsibility very seriously. But here we stand, about to adjourn \nwithout taking up Defense authorization, so important to our men and \nwomen in uniform. Here we stand about to adjourn with our military \nfacing what is called sequestration, which is an across-the-board cut \nwhich our own military leaders have said will hollow out our force, \nwill undermine our military security for generations. These are the \nwords of our own Secretary of Defense, will break faith with our men \nand women in uniform. If we do not take action before January 1, this \nhappens to our military, on top of the fact that we have not taken up \nDefense authorization.\n\n  But not only that, it has been 3 years since the Senate has taken up \na budget for our country, which is one of the reasons we find ourselves \nin the situation with the hatchet coming to our military in January.\n  On top of that, the majority leader has not brought forward one \nappropriations bill that would go with, if done in the right way, the \nappropriate budgeting and responsible budgeting process for this \nNation. Let's identify some of the appropriations bills. None of them \nhas come to the floor. But there are two important ones I can think of \nfor our men and women in uniform, the Defense appropriations and also \nthe appropriations for our veterans. Yet none of that has come to the \nfloor, and here we are about to adjourn next week, not doing the \npeople's business, the reason why people sent us here. If we cannot \nhave a budget and we cannot take care of the foremost responsibilities \nof the American people, which is to keep them safe through preventing \nDraconian defense cuts that are going to undermine and break faith with \nour military, and, by the way also will cost us a million jobs coming \nin January, along with I did not even mention our tax rates are \nexpiring, yet we are all leaving town, I think it is irresponsible.\n  I would call on the majority leader to bring up the Defense \nauthorization bill now. Why can't we do a budget for this country? \nWithout a budget, how are we ever going to address the fiscal issues \nthat are burning and have led us to be $16 trillion in debt?\n  I stand here today to talk about why we should bring the Defense \nauthorization to the floor. I certainly do not want to be part of a \nSenate that for the first time in 50 years has not passed that Defense \nauthorization bill for our men and women in uniform.\n  Here is what is important as well. In the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee we passed Defense authorization out of committee unanimously. \nAt a time when I understand the American people are looking at us \nsaying, there is too much partisanship, we see you fighting too much, \nthis is a bill that passed with unanimous support from Republicans and \nDemocrats from that committee. So in terms of a bill we can bring to \nthe floor that is incredibly important to our country, incredibly \nimportant to our men and women in uniform, and a bipartisan bill, I \ncannot think of a better thing to do for our men and women in uniform, \nrather than continuing to have what we have seen from the majority \nleader, which is sort of political show votes rather than doing the \nreal work the American people have sent us here to do.\n  Defense authorization should be on the top of our list, preventing \nour military from these receiving these devastating cuts that are going \nto diminish our national security at a very troubling time in the \nworld, and also averting this fiscal crisis that is coming in January. \nI think we should stay to do that. I think the American people would \nexpect nothing loss of us.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I know the Senator ran in 2010. I am \nsure you heard this when you ran for office. We need to do better by \nthe American people. I know this. We owe it to our brave men and women \nin uniform to pass Defense authorization--bring it to the floor, debate \nit robustly, and then make sure it goes forward.\n  The House passed their Defense authorization on May 18. We should do \nour job here as well and take it up right away. I hope the majority \nleader will do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Ayotte. She is a great \nmember of the Budget Committee and a very active and aggressive member \nof the Armed Services Committee. She is the wife of an Iraq veteran, \nand knows and cares about these issues and contributes greatly. She and \nsome of our other new Members have been flabbergasted to see how little \nhas been accomplished in the 2 years they have been here. In my \nexperience, Senator Ayotte, this is the worst performance in the 16 \nyears I have ever seen in the Senate. It may be the worst performance \nin 100 years.\n  As the Senator mentioned, the House passed the Defense authorization \nact in May. They passed a Defense appropriations bill in July. We have \nhad all summer and done nothing. The Senator is so correct. We had some \nintense and good debate in the Armed Services Committee over that bill. \nYet when it finished, we had a unanimous vote. I thought that was \nspecial. So why did the bill not get brought up? I do not know. I feel \nas if we have missed an opportunity to do our duty. Not only have we \nnot had a budget, not only have we not had a Defense Authorization bill \nor a Defense appropriations bill, we have not had 1 of the 12 \nappropriation bills brought to the floor, not 1. I believe that has \nnever happened perhaps ever before, at least in maybe a century. The \ndecision that was made by the Democratic leader was supported by his \nconference. He cannot just do things that his conference does not \nsupport, so they have decided not to do this. We end up at the end of \nthe year with this massive CR with multiple changes. They say it will \nbe a clean continuing resolution to fund the government for 6 months at \nthe same level of funding. That is not exactly accurate. There are some \nthings in it. But it is not the way to do business--to have every one \nof the bills cobbled together, all 12 appropriations bills cobbled \ntogether, in one 6-month, half-year, appropriations bill. Because, you \nsee, as of September 30, if we don't pass the appropriations bills, the \ngovernment shuts down. Under the law and the Constitution this \ngovernment cannot spend a dime that Congress has not appropriated. That \nis the way the government works. We have to appropriate money before \nsome bureaucrat can spend it.\n\n  The House has done their duty but not the Senate. We have not passed \na single one. So what will happen to avoid the entire government being \nshut down, the entire Defense Department being hammered? What will we \ndo? We will pass a continuing resolution that continues to fund the \ngovernment. For now, we understand it will be 6 months, and that would \nbe a substitute for doing what we should have done. What will we do 6 \nmonths from now? Will we have another 6-month CR or will we actually \npass appropriations bills?\n  I appreciate the leadership of Senator Ayotte and her participation. \nI have heard her express her frustration as a new member of the Budget \nCommittee that we haven't had a budget and didn't bring one up in the \nBudget Committee and didn't vote on it. As the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee, it was a deeply disappointing thing for me. That was \na decision made by the majority leader, Senator Reid, who said it would \nbe foolish to have a budget. Now we have gone about 1,233 days without \na budget in this country and it has created this kind of dysfunction in \nour government. I don't think it is acceptable. I don't believe there \nis an excuse for it. I believe it has been done purely for politics, \nand that is not good, not when the men and women in uniform are serving \nus, at risk of their lives, losing life and limb on behalf of this \nCongress because we sent them there and asked them to undertake a\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\ndangerous job. Yet we can't even get together and get a bill to the \nfloor.\n  I would say we worked hard in the Armed Services Committee. A bill \nSenator Levin and Senator McCain led us to pass was passed unanimously. \nIt was bipartisan. There were some things I would have liked to have \nseen done differently, and Senator McCain and Senator Levin may have \nhad different ideas, but we couldn't get everyone to agree with \neverything we liked. We did, however, get a pretty good bill and it was \nwithin the budget and it was the kind of legislation we need to pass.\n  So the House has passed their authorization bill, within the budget, \nand similar to our bill. We should be able to conference and produce \nlegislation in a reasonable amount of time. But when a bill such as \nthat comes to the floor, people are entitled to have amendments. They \nare entitled to offer an amendment, as Senator Paul wants, to cut off \nfunding for some foreign aid we have been putting out. But some people \ndon't want to vote on that. It might not be an easy vote, but this is \nthe Senate. People are entitled to offer amendments, they are entitled \nto have votes on issues they believe in and they campaigned on and they \nadvocate and they are entitled to get their vote. But if it is a tough \nvote, it seems around here the leadership on the other side doesn't \nwant us to talk about it. They do not want to be on record as voting. \nSo that is a disappointment to us.\n  I think Senator McCain spoke with clarity. He spoke as a man who \nserved his country, who has been in harm's way, who suffered on behalf \nof our country, who understands foreign policy, who understands the \nDefense Department, and understands Congress. His comments were solid, \non point and correct, and I hope all Americans listen to him.\n  I appreciate the opportunity of sharing my disappointment at this \npoint and just want to make one last point before I yield the floor.\n  Senator McCain, earlier today, and I and others, talked about the \nsequester. That has to be fixed by the beginning of next year. It needs \nto be fixed now. We can fix it now. We will fix it, in my opinion, \nsometime between now and the end of the year. It would be so much \nbetter if we brought it up, confronted the difficulties of the \nsequester and fixed it now rather than leaving a cloud over the Defense \nDepartment.\n  If we somehow fail to alter this sequester, this bill that is \ncurrently on the floor--the Veterans Jobs Corps Act--becomes very \ninsignificant because we are going to be laying off so many members of \nour military who maybe just recently got back from a deployment \noverseas, in harm's way, who would like to make a career in the U.S. \nmilitary. Maybe that is their plan and they all of a sudden get a blue \nslip. All of a sudden they hear Congress couldn't confront the \nsequester, we don't have money, and we are going to have to lay them \noff.\n  Don't think that is not possible. Because if this sequester goes in \nplace, we are going to have to reduce personnel numbers in our military \nsignificantly. We have already taken almost $500 billion out of the \nDefense Department over 10 years. The sequester would take even more--\nan additional $492 billion in this sequester--and it cannot be done \nwithout more personnel reductions.\n  We have already assumed a decline of military personnel with the \noverseas deployments going down--some decline. But this would be a \nrapid, dramatic decline to meet the demands of the cuts of the \nsequester that are unwisely being imposed at this point, and it would \ncause substantial layoffs as well as substantial procurement problems.\n  So I hope we will think about that as we go forward. If we can't get \nit done before we recess, it needs to be done promptly. It should have \nbeen done this summer, and I feel like the leadership of the Senate \nshould have been active in that. I think the President of the United \nStates should have talked to his Secretary of Defense, who said the \nsequester would be catastrophic, would hollow out the military. He \nshould have talked to Secretary Panetta, and he should be over here \nwith Congress providing some leadership, saying: Mr. Reid, fix this \nsequester. We cannot allow it to happen. I am the Chief Executive of \nthe U.S. Government, I am the Commander in Chief of the U.S. military, \nand you are going to do damage to the military of the United States. It \nis my responsibility as President to insist that you and Congress get \nthis thing done. I am prepared to provide leadership and suggestions \nand help to get it done.\n  Has the President done that? No. He has not said one word about our \nadvancing or putting any effort into leadership that would lead us to \nfix this problem. I think that is disappointing. I have to say it is. \nMaybe others think it is all right for him to lead from behind, to sit \nin the White House and go make speeches and not worry about the \nsequester and not worry about the fact we haven't passed a Defense \nbill. I don't think so. I think you are still President of the United \nStates, even when you are running for reelection. I think a phone call \nor two to the Senate leadership would get the ball moving. That is \nabout all it takes, frankly.\n  It seems to me the White House is perfectly happy with inaction. That \nis the bottom line, in my opinion. They are perfectly happy. They want \nto tell the Republicans: If you don't raise taxes, like we want taxes \nto be raised, we are going to hammer the Defense Department. But he is \nCommander in Chief. He has a moral obligation to those men and women, \nto make sure we are safe and they are treated fairly. I don't think \nthat is responsible.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Failed Economics\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, anyone who happened to be watching the \nSenate floor a little earlier today got a taste of why, in the midst of \na national job crisis, Americans are still in danger of being slammed \nby one of the biggest tax hikes in history; why the U.S. military is \ntoday at risk of cuts that would devastate national security; and why \nthere is now a very good chance another major ratings agency will \ndowngrade our Nation's credit.\n  There is a reason all these things may actually happen, and it has \nnothing whatsoever to do with the Republicans:\n  The Nation is at risk of an entirely avoidable economic calamity \nbecause the President of the United States and the Democrats who \ncontrol the Senate would rather spend their time picking apart Paul \nRyan and his budget plan--which the House has already passed--than \nproducing one of their own. They would rather sit on the sidelines and \nhope people focus on the other guy's attempts to solve our most \npressing domestic problems than bother to do anything about them \nthemselves. This has been the Democratic M.O. for 2 long years, and it \nis a disgrace.\n  Later today the House will pass a 6-month continuing resolution to \nfund the government beyond the end of the month. Why? Well, because \nDemocrats refuse to do the basic work of government. The Democratic \nSenate hasn't passed a budget in more than 3 years. This year they \nhaven't passed a single appropriations bill. For 2 years Democrats have \ndone nothing--nothing but cast blame.\n  The law says Democrats have to pass a budget. A simple majority can \npass a budget. The law has been ignored. The President proposed a \nbudget of his own. They have opposed that one as well.\n  The Nation is just 3\\1/2\\ months away from going off a fiscal cliff, \nand they actually seem to welcome it because their overriding goal \nisn't to help the American people find work, it isn't to get a handle \non the debt, it isn't to give small businesses a boost, it is to make \ngovernment even bigger than it already is. And they are perfectly \nwilling to let the country plunge into an even deeper economic mess to \nensure they get the bigger government they want. That is how extreme \nWashington Democrats have become.\n  They are on an ideological crusade. They spent the first 2 years of \nthis Presidency putting their policies in place, and when they lost \ntheir big majorities in Congress they decided to sit on their hands \nrather than change their approach, as all of these challenges built and \nbuilt and built.\n  For 2 years this President got absolutely everything he wanted \nlegislatively. Aided by giant majorities in both Houses of Congress and \ngoaded on by a chief of staff who told him to brush aside any pleas for \nbipartisanship, he spent 2 years putting into\n\n[[Page S6323]]\n\nplace the big government agenda he and his liberal allies had dreamed \nof--an agenda so extreme that their biggest challenge was making sure \nMembers of their own party didn't defect.\n  The results of those efforts are clear for all to see. Unemployment \nhas been above 8 percent for 43 straight months. Growth is an anemic \n1.5 percent, the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. The \nFederal debt is a stratospheric $16 trillion. A full 15 percent of \nAmericans are now on food stamps. The Census Bureau said just yesterday \nthat household incomes have declined every year of the Obama \nadministration, and one out of six Americans is living in poverty. And \nthe labor participation rate--the percentage of those who can work who \nare actually working--is at its lowest point in decades.\n  If we count people who have given up looking for work, unemployment \nis above 11 percent, not the 8 percent we read about. These are the \ngrim realities of the Obama economy. And make no mistake, the framework \nfor it was laid in 2009 and 2010.\n  So, yes, President Obama and Governor Romney have different \nphilosophies on how to lead America back to prosperity. But the biggest \ndifference is this: One of them has had 4 years to implement his \nvision, and it should be obvious to everyone it has been a total \nfailure. It has failed to lift us out of a jobs crisis. It has helped \nprevent the type of recovery we all know is entirely possible. Yet all \nwe get from the President or from Democrats in Congress is feel-good \nrhetoric, attacks on Republicans who are actually working to solve our \nproblems, and political show votes that are deliberately designed to \nfail.\n  Blame the other guy and maybe people will not notice your own refusal \nto lead or the implications of your own vision. Because, make no \nmistake, in order to fund the government this President wants, there \nwould be no choice but to go after the very middle class he claims to \nbe fighting for.\n  That is the dirty little secret behind the President's vision for \nAmerica. That is the math he didn't mention in Charlotte, and that is \nthe real story about what has been going on around here for 2 long \nyears. The President and Democrats in Congress laid the foundation for \nthe economy we are in right now. They were so sure it would work that \nthe President said if it didn't, he wouldn't deserve reelection. Well, \nit didn't.\n  So for the last 2 years Republicans in Congress have done everything \nwe could to convince the President to go in a different direction, to \nchange course. He didn't. He doubled down on the same failed policies, \nand when he wasn't able to get them through Congress, he blamed \nRepublicans for the consequences. Well, blaming us for the results of \nhis policies is almost as ridiculous as concluding that the vision \nbehind them will be any more successful over the next 4 years than it \nhas been over the last 4 years.\n  It is time for Democrats, from the President on down, to stop blaming \nothers and to start leading. Our problems are too serious and our \nchallenge is too urgent to wait another day to act.\n\n\n                      Tribute to James Billington\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, tomorrow the Librarian of Congress, Dr. \nJim Billington, will mark 25 years on the job, and so I would like to \njust say a few words of congratulations in honor of his service.\n  Dr. Billington has enjoyed a distinguished career. He is a Rhodes \nScholar, earned his doctorate from Oxford, served in the Army, and \ntaught history at Harvard and Princeton. He is a renowned author and a \nRussian scholar, advising numerous Members of Congress, administration \nofficials, and even Presidents.\n  Dr. Billington's tenure at the Library of Congress has been \nexemplary. His most significant contribution is certainly his vision to \nbring the Library of Congress into the 21st century by digitalizing its \ncollection. Because of his actions, Dr. Billington has expanded the \nLibrary of Congress's reach into thousands of educational institutions \nand millions of homes here and throughout the world. Under Dr. \nBillington's leadership, the Library of Congress has strengthened and \nflourished.\n  So today we honor and we thank Dr. Jim Billington for an outstanding \njob leading the Library of Congress for the past 25 years. We wish him \ncontinued success and thank him for a lifetime of service to inspiring \nand educating others.\n  Dr. Billington, congratulations.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I too wish to offer congratulations and \ngratitude to Dr. James H. Billington on the occasion of his 25th \nAnniversary as Librarian of Congress on September 14, 2012.\n  Dr. Billington was sworn into office as the 13th Librarian of \nCongress on September 14, 1987, after being nominated by Ronald Reagan \nand unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate. A distinguished Rhodes \nScholar, author, and humanitarian, he has received over 40 honorary \ndoctorates and has authored several books on Russia and the former \nSoviet Union. Earlier in his career he served in the U.S. Army and \ntaught history at Harvard and Princeton Universities. Later he went on \nto become the director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \nScholars in Washington, D.C. where he founded the Kennan Institute for \nAdvanced Russian Studies and seven other new programs as well as the \nWilson Quarterly.\n  Mr. Billington's tenure at the Library has been remarkable for his \nvision, his commitment to excellence, and for the wide-ranging \nintellect and experience he has applied to making the Library of \nCongress one of the most respected citadels of knowledge in the world.\n  Dr. Billington led the Library into the digital age, giving on-line \naccess to its many treasures to Members of Congress and people \nthroughout the world with the Library of Congress National Digital \nLibrary Program, the THOMAS data base, and the Open World Program. He \noversaw the establishment of the Kluge Center, an endowment fostering \nscholarly interaction between world thinkers and policy makers that \nincludes a million-dollar prize honoring lifetime achievement in the \nstudy of humanity. His encouragement and enthusiastic leadership led to \nthe creation of the Packard Campus Audio-Visual Conservation Center \nwhich consolidated all of the Library's recorded sound and film \ncollection in a single, state-of-the-art facility for conservation and \npermanent archival storage. These are just some of the many \naccomplishments for which he will be long remembered.\n  Dr. Billington has also overseen the restoration of the Thomas \nJefferson and John Adams buildings. Today, the Thomas Jefferson \nbuilding, with its pristinely restored marble columns, staircases, \nmosaics, and paintings is considered to be one of the most beautiful \npublic buildings in America.\n  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library and Chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Rules and Administration, I extend my appreciation \nto Dr. Billington for his visionary leadership and extraordinary \naccomplishments that have made the Library of Congress, one our \ngreatest national institutions, the remarkable place that it is today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The Ryan Budget\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, all week my Democratic colleagues in the \nSenate have been coming to the floor and using scare tactics and \ndemagoguery on the so-called Ryan budget. Of course, what they are \nreferring to is the budget that was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives months ago.\n  I suppose it is fair anytime someone produces something to have that \ncriticized, critiqued, scrutinized, looked at, and discussed. But at \nthe same time it seems if someone is going to attack the product that \nsomebody else had put forward the natural follow-up question would be: \nSo what are you proposing? Where is your budget proposal?\n\n[[Page S6324]]\n\n  I think it begs the question on behalf of the American people that \nthe Democrats in the Senate who want to attack the House-passed budget \nhaven't produced a budget of their own.\n  It has been over 1,200 days--1,232 to be precise--that we have not \nconsidered a budget in the Senate. For those who are trying to do that \narithmetic in their minds right now, that is 3 years and 4 months--3 \nyears and 4 months without a budget in the U.S. Senate. That, at the \nsame time that we continue to get bad news about the economy.\n  This week we received news that Moody's intends, if we end up going \nover the fiscal cliff next year, to downgrade America's credit rating. \nThat would follow with other credit rating agencies that have already \nmade that assumption about the American economy and the American fiscal \nsituation. We also received notice last week that the World Economic \nForum had downgraded America's global competitiveness.\n  When President Obama took office in January 2009, America was ranked \nfirst in the world when it comes to global competitiveness. We dropped \ndown to fourth or fifth in the last year or two. But just in the last \ncouple of weeks, the World Economic Forum has dropped the United States \neven further. We are now seventh in the world when it comes to global \ncompetitiveness.\n  The reasons they cite for that are many, but it comes back to the \nbasic issues of spending and debt and taxes and regulations and redtape \nand the cost of doing business in this country. It seems as though the \nDemocratic solution is to tax more so we can spend more. Raise taxes to \ngrow government. That seems to be the only solution the other side is \nwilling to put forward.\n  Now, when I say that is the only solution, that is what we hear \ncoming out of the White House in terms of the so-called fiscal cliff \nand in terms of the response to dealing with the sequester: Well, we \ncould do away with the sequester if we just had more revenues. If \nWashington could just raise more money--more tax revenues--from the \nAmerican people, this problem would all go away.\n  But what it misses is the fact that the real issue in Washington, DC, \nisn't that we tax too little; it is that we spend too much. Washington \nhas a spending problem that needs to be corrected. At least the House \nof Representatives put forward a budget plan that addressed the \nfundamental problems that plague our Nation's fiscal situation.\n  You look at what we are facing in terms of obligations, liabilities, \nresponsibilities in the years in the future--Medicare, Social Security, \nMedicaid, other programs--they continue to grow at two or three times \nthe rate of inflation. That is not sustainable. That is going to lead \nus to bankruptcy. We are on an unsustainable fiscal path. The \ntrajectory we are on today cannot be sustained over time. Yet we have \nnot seen any proposal put forward by the Democrats here in the Senate--\nnot just for this last year but the year before that and the year \nbefore that. It has been 3 years and 4 months now since the Democrats \nin the Senate have put a budget on the floor that we would have an \nopportunity to vote on and to give the American people at least an idea \nabout where we want to lead this country.\n  So when they come down here, hour after hour, day after day, night \nafter night, attacking the House-passed budget, I think the American \npeople have to say to the Democrats here in the Senate: Where is your \nplan? Where is your budget? Show us what you would do. Show us how you \nwould address the fiscal crisis we are facing.\n  The answer is, there is none, it is nada, it is zero. There is not \none, no budget, no plan, not this year or the year before or the year \nbefore that. For 3 years and 4 months now there has not been a budget \nput on the floor of the Senate for us to vote on, for us to discuss, \nfor us to have any kind of conversation about the future of this \ncountry and what we are going to do to address the fiscal crisis that \nwe all acknowledge exists.\n  This is the most predictable crisis, as has been pointed out, in \nAmerican history. We all know where we are headed. You can look at the \nnumbers. It is not complicated. It is not rocket science. It is simply \na function of math and the math is working against us, and every day we \nwait it becomes more complicated, difficult, and problematic, I \nbelieve, for us to solve this problem, and it further threatens the \nfuture and puts at risk our children and grandchildren and the quality \nof life and the standard of living they are going to experience and \nenjoy in their lifetimes.\n  When the ratings agencies such as Moody's come out and say that this \nfiscal cliff, if we go over it, means a downgrade in the credit rating \nof the United States, when you have organizations such as the World \nEconomic Forum say that the United States is now seventh when it comes \nto global competitiveness as opposed to first--which is where it was \nwhen the President took office--we all should take notice. It is \nanother flashing light, another warning sign, another red flag, if you \nwill, that things are not well in the United States of America. Yet the \nonly proposal that has been put forward that would address that is the \nbudget passed by the House of Representatives. Why? Because the U.S. \nSenate again has not passed a budget. We have not produced a budget now \nfor over 3 years.\n  It is interesting because one of my Democratic colleagues who was \ndown here talking earlier this week described the budget as a set of \nvalues; in attacking the House-passed budget, that somehow the House-\npassed budget represented the wrong values. It did not represent, \nsomehow, American values. If the budget represents a set of values, \nwhat does it mean, then, when you do not have one? If you do not have a \nbudget, what does that say about your values?\n  It seems to me, at least, that at least the House of Representatives, \nto their credit, has put forward a proposal that, whether or not you \nagree with it, does address the fundamental problems we have as a \nNation; that is, out-of-control Federal spending, a trajectory with \nregard to entitlement programs that literally will bankrupt the \ncountry, and a Tax Code that is overly complicated that needs to be \nreformed. Those were all addressed in the House budget. A lot of people \nattacked the whole idea in the House budget with regard to Medicare \nreform, which is referred to as premium support. Premium support is not \na new idea. It is something that was popularized by liberal think tanks \nyears ago. In fact, this year the House-proposed idea, when it comes to \npremium support, was something advanced by Representative Paul Ryan and \nSenator Wyden here in the U.S. Senate. It was a bipartisan idea.\n  It was also something advocated by the Rivlin-Domenici task force \nthat looked at our fiscal situation, made recommendations, and when it \ncame to the notion of how to reform Medicare, premium support was \nsomething that was put forward as something that could be a new idea \nthat can save the government--the taxpayers--money, introduce \ncompetition in the same way that the Medicare Part D Program has \nintroduced competition and actually saved money over what it was \nproposed to cost.\n  It is not a new idea. It is an idea that has been tried. When \nMedicare Part D was adopted, the premium support concept was included \nas part of that and you can see the results of that have led to lower \ncosts, much lower costs than were predicted. Frankly, that is, I \nbelieve, because it introduced the element of competition into the \nwhole way we deliver health care services under Medicare. That was \nsomething that was proposed and built upon, developed as part of the \nbudget that was passed in the House of Representatives. But, again, it \nis something that is not new around here. It has had lots of support in \nthe past from Democrats.\n  It seems to me at least that if we know what we have today is not \nworking, we ought to be willing to at least entertain a discussion and \nconversation about some ideas that might actually solve the problem and \nmight work. Yet here in the Senate for 3 years we have not had a \nbudget.\n  Some would argue that the President of the United States has put \nforward a budget. In fact, as a matter of I guess delivering a set of \npapers to the Congress, he did do that. But I would argue and I think \nmost would agree it was not a serious effort. It certainly was not a \nmeaningful attempt to address\n\n[[Page S6325]]\n\nthe issue of spending and debt or entitlement reform and that was \nevidenced by the fact that when it was put on the floor in the Senate \nto be voted on, it was defeated by a vote of 97 to 0. In the previous \nyear the House of Representatives had a vote on the President's budget. \nThat year it was voted down in the House by something like 419 or 420 \nto 0. The President's budget for 2 consecutive years here in the Senate \nhas not received one vote from any Democrat in either the House or the \nSenate.\n  That should speak volumes about the President's attempt to do this. I \nthink what it suggests is it was not serious, it did not make a real \neffort at trying to address the issues of spending and debt and getting \nthe economy growing again and reforming our Tax Code and driving down \nthe cost of doing business in this country instead of increasing \nthe costs, which is something that seems to be happening every single \nday. As I travel across my State of South Dakota and listen to \nbusinesses from other parts of the country, I hear over and over again \nthat the cost of doing business is making us uncompetitive. We continue \nto be saddled with regulations, with requirements, with mandates, with \ntaxes. Those sorts of things, the redtape of doing business, are making \nit incredibly difficult for our small businesses and job creators to \nget this economy back on its feet and get it growing again.\n\n  I would simply say in response to the attacks that have been leveled \nby my colleagues on the other side on the proposal that was advanced \nand put forward by the House Republicans, that it would bode well if \nyou want to have a debate about priorities, if you want to have a \ndebate about values and if you want to have a debate about budgets, to \nhave one. It starts with a budget. We don't have one. We do not have \nany plan for how we are going to deal with the very factors, the very \nelements that led organizations such as Moody's and the World Economic \nForum to determine that the United States credit rating is in jeopardy \nand that our global competitiveness has dropped from first in the world \nto seventh.\n  Those are things I think we ought to be talking about, and you cannot \nstart talking about those things unless you have a plan, unless you \nhave a budget that describes what you would do to address the drivers \nof Federal spending, the drivers of Federal debt.\n  Again I cannot emphasize this enough: the only thing I hear coming \nout of my colleagues on the other side to address it is we need more \nrevenues. We need to raise more taxes. We don't have enough revenue. If \nwe could raise more revenue we could solve all those problems. I say to \nmy colleagues what we have here in Washington, DC, is not a revenue \nissue, we have a spending problem. Washington does not tax too little, \nit spends too much. That is why we need to get spending under control, \nbut it starts with the budget.\n  I think it behooves our colleagues on the other side, as they come \ndown here day after day and berate and attack and suggest somehow that \nthe budget that was passed by the House of Representatives is not \nrepresentative of American values, to come down here with something of \ntheir own that might lay out a plan that actually does address Medicare \nreform, Medicaid reform, tax reform--the things that we know have to be \ndealt with in the future if we are going to hand a better and more \nprosperous and stronger Nation to our children and our grandchildren. \nThat simply has not happened.\n  They can come down here and say what they want, but when there is no \nbudget, there is no blueprint, there is no plan, then there is no path \nforward that addresses these difficult, complicated challenges and \nproblems that face us and face our Nation in the future. I hope we \neventually see that. I hope the President will come to the table and \nthat we can sit down and talk about how we are going to solve the \nfiscal cliff we are headed over at the end of this year. Again, it is \nnot just the credit rating, it is not just global competitiveness, it \nis the American economy that is at stake as well. The Congressional \nBudget Office has said if we go over this fiscal cliff where taxes go \nup on January 1, where these disproportionate cuts take effect on the \nmilitary budget, we are looking at an economic recession next year, a \ncontraction of the economy of 2.9 percent and unemployment above 9 \npercent. This is about America's standing, about our competitiveness, \nand it is about jobs in the economy, fundamentally. It is high time \nthat we had help and cooperation and an idea, perhaps, from the other \nside about how they would solve these problems. I hope we will get \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first I note Senator Grassley is on the \nfloor and I thank him for the courtesy of allowing me to go next.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time on behalf of Maryland \nfarmers. They are hurting, along with many farmers around the Nation, \nbecause of the devastation from the drought. I am talking on behalf of \nthe poultry farmers. As the Presiding Officer knows, in the Delmarva \npeninsula the impact they have had from the drought on the corn crop \nmakes it extremely difficult to make ends meet. I am talking about \ndairy farmers in western Maryland. We have a robust agricultural \ncommunity. It is one of the largest parts of our economy. That is true \nin just about every State in the Nation. We have seen the worst drought \nin 50 years. It is affecting 42 States in this Union. This is \nwidespread. Congress needs to act.\n  First we should encourage our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives to take up and pass the farm bill that we have passed. \nThat was a bipartisan bill. It was a bill that was debated in this \nChamber. It is a bill that would help our agricultural community to get \nthrough this crisis brought about by extreme weather. As I mentioned, \nthe farm bill was a bipartisan effort. It dealt with many components \nthat would help segments of our agricultural community as a result of \nthe conditions from the drought. Let me mention a few.\n  The livestock disaster provision that expired in 2011 in the farm \nbill is strengthened, it is made retroactive back to 2012, and it would \nhelp those who are in the cattle producing part of agriculture get \nthrough the conditions of this drought. Seventy-two percent of the \ncattle-producing areas are affected by the drought. It is going to have \nan effect on our entire country. We have a responsibility to make sure \nour farm policies help them get through the unusually disastrous \nweather conditions. As I mentioned earlier--and the Presiding Officer \nbeing from Delaware knows the poultry industry has suffered \nunbelievably. The reason, quite frankly, is--and I will talk a little \nbit more about this--the price to produce a chick in the poultry \nindustry is so much dependent on the price for feed and corn. The corn \nprice is extremely high as a result, in part, of the drought \nconditions.\n\n  The farm bill we passed would help the corn producers which, in fact, \nwould help the poultry industry, so it is an important part of the farm \nbill. From my fruit and vegetable growers, the reform in the Crop \nInsurance Program would help them during these very tough times.\n  Let me mention the conservation programs. I know Chairman Stabenow \nhas talked about this frequently on the floor, but the farm bill we \npassed reforms the conservation programs and allows our farmers to do \nthe right thing. One of the things we learned from the Dust Bowl--the \ncrisis we confronted in the 1930s--was that we have to take care of and \nprotect our water and soil. We need to be attentive to water and soil. \nAfter the Dust Bowl crisis, we passed in the Congress different types \nof conservation acts.\n  The farm bill we passed in this House consolidates, reforms, and \nstrengthens the conservation programs so our farmers can do the right \nthing not only for producing today but producing tomorrow and taking \ncare of the circumstances we know Mother Nature will be throwing at us. \nWe can't do anything about that until the House takes up the farm bill. \nThey have yet to take it up.\n  I urge my colleagues in the other body to take up this bill. We need \nto do that for many reasons, one of which, of course, is the extreme \nconditions that the agricultural community in this country is \nconfronting as a result of this drought.\n\n[[Page S6326]]\n\n  Let me talk specifically about poultry. On the Delmarva Peninsula, \nthe poultry industry is in crisis. It is in crisis. The Senator from \nDelaware, the Presiding Officer, understands this. Seventy-five percent \nof the cost to produce poultry is in the price of feed. The poultry \nindustry uses corn for feed. They need to have corn. At the present \ntime, corn is approaching $9 a barrel. What does that mean? If the \nprice is at that rate, it would cost about $2 per pound to produce a \nchick for market. The retail price is $2 a pound. It doesn't take too \nmuch of an economic background to know we cannot make it under those \neconomic conditions.\n  Our poultry industry needs help. They need to be competitive, and it \nis difficult to do that when we are so dependent upon the price of \ncorn. The problem with corn is we are competing uses. It is not only \nused in the food chain, it is used as an energy source as a result of \ncorn-based ethanol, which distorts the food chain.\n  I have introduced legislation, along with Senator Boozman and Senator \nMikulski, that would modify the renewable fuel standards. Those are the \nstandards which require a certain percentage of our renewables in corn \nethanol. It would modify that, and let me explain how. It would link \nthe amount of corn ethanol required for the renewable food standards to \nthe amount of the corn supply. That makes sense. When we have more \ncorn, fine, we can meet the renewable standards. But this year we have \nhad drought conditions so we have much less corn. As a result, corn is \ngoing up in price, making it very difficult for our poultry industry. \nSo then the requirements would be reduced. We think that makes sense. \nThat is using market forces to help meet our energy needs but also to \nhelp deal with the realities of the poultry industry.\n  I have also joined with Senator Hagan, Senator Chambliss, Senator \nPryor, and Senator Boozman in authoring a letter to the Environmental \nProtection Agency calling for them to waive the renewable fuel \nstandards conventional ethanol product mandate for this year. Again, \nlet the farmers be able to compete. Don't let us distort the \nmarketplace.\n  Let me just say, in summary, agriculture is critically important to \nthis country for many reasons. It is one of the largest parts of our \neconomy, it is important for our national security, and it is part of \nour way of life. We lead the world in agriculture productivity. It is \nimportant for us on international trade and all the reasons I \nmentioned. We need to be attentive to how we deal with agriculture in \nthis country. We need a farm and agricultural policy.\n  The farm bill we passed is necessary to be enacted or we are going to \nhave a lapse in our agricultural programs. We have done our work. It is \ncritically important before the House goes home that they take up the \nfarm bill. I hope they will pass our farm bill in order to help farmers \nin Maryland and around the Nation. I then hope we would also pay \nspecial attention to the poultry industry, to recognize that because of \nthe price of corn related not just to the food chain but to energy we \nhave a responsibility to help an industry that is so dependent upon \ncorn as a commodity to produce the poultry product.\n  We need to help our agricultural community to do the right thing. It \nis important for our country, and I urge my colleagues to pay attention \nto these issues before we recess for the fall elections.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I come to the floor to discuss the State of our economy \nand to give suggestions on how to improve it. But before I go to the \nmain purpose of why I came here, I wish to say to the Senator from \nMaryland that I agree with him. The House of Representatives ought to \ntake up a farm bill. I hope they will, and that is my urging.\n  I also wish to take advantage of the opportunity to explain a little \nbit about ethanol and how that works in with the situation he brought \nup about increasing feed for chickens or any other animals.\n  This year, farmers planted 96 million acres of corn. There were more \nacres of corn planted than in any other year since 1938. Most of that \nis because of the ethanol industry. If we didn't have the ethanol \nindustry, we would normally plant somewhere between 80 and 85 million \nacres of corn.\n  Let's assume we never heard of the word ``ethanol'' or the product \nethanol, that it didn't even exist, and farmers planted the usual 80 to \n85 million acres of corn. Let's also assume we had the same drought we \nhad this year--over about two-thirds of the United States--and the corn \ncrop is going to be reduced because of it. If we planted 80 to 85 \nmillion acres of corn and we had the same drought, we would still have \nthe high price of grain we have right now, but we wouldn't have ethanol \nto blame for it.\n  So the marketplace is bringing about the increased production of corn \nbecause of feed, fuel, and fiber. We should not be scapegoating \nethanol, because if we didn't have ethanol to blame, we wouldn't be \nplanting 95 or 96 million acres of corn. We would be planting about 80 \nto 85 million acres of corn and we would still have the same high price \nand the same problem for the poultry producers.\n\n\n                          Economic Leadership\n\n  Now to the point that I came to the Senate floor. We all recognize \nour Nation faces challenging times. We have had years with unemployment \nat unacceptable levels and anemic economic growth that shows no sign of \nlifting us out of the situation. Meanwhile, rampant government \nspending, which we were promised would jump-start the economy and \ncreate jobs, has instead displaced private sector investment and choked \noff job creation. More and more Americans are starting to doubt that \ntheir children and grandchildren will have better opportunities than \nthey had, not to mention the fact that they will be forced to pay for \nall that spending.\n  We keep being told by President Obama and members of his party that \nchange is just around the corner. If we just keep doing what we are \ndoing, things will get better. After almost 4 years of failed policy \nand dashed hopes, that line is wearing thin. Fortunately, our problems \nare not insurmountable and the solutions are common sense. All that is \nneeded is sufficient leadership to make the tough decisions.\n  In fact, this is the same situation Great Britain faced in the 1970s. \nBritain was mired in debt and even had to go to the IMF for a bailout. \nSuccessive British Prime Ministers had recognized the looming financial \nproblem for years but failed to get the budget under control. At that \ntime, in the 1970s, Britain was known as the ``sick man of Europe.'' \nStill, as in this country, interest groups that benefited from public \nspending threatened to bring down any British Government that even \nconsidered measures to control spending.\n  We see those same forces in the Congress of the United States telling \nus we can't cut anyplace. In fact, Britain did face massive strikes in \nthe winter of 1978 to 1979, better known as the winter of discontent.\n  As a result of the inability of several different Prime Ministers to \ntake the difficult steps necessary to turn things around, many pundits \nstarted to speculate Britain had become ungovernable. There were even \nmany British politicians who had decided the best they could accomplish \nwas to manage the economic and political decline of Britain. We hear \nthe term in the United States of a ``new norm.'' I hope we aren't \ngetting into that same attitude the British had in the 1970s.\n  But they had a leader who came along by the name of Margaret \nThatcher. She utterly rejected the notion that decline was an option. \nIn fact, she was famous for repeating the phrase: ``There is no \nalternative.'' So I would like to take those words, ``there is no \nalternative,'' as a guiding point for us in the Congress, Republican or \nDemocrat, that we have to do something.\n  ``There is no alternative.'' Prime Minister Thatcher meant that \ncontrol of the policy based on uncontrolled spending had failed. If \neconomic recovery was the goal, the only alternative was the free \nmarket. This meant cutting spending, reducing growth-inhibiting income \ntaxes, and reining in government micromanagement of business--things we \nhear from the private sector in the United States today.\n\n  Despite the hard lessons of experience, the prevailing economic \ntheory of the day still held: that government\n\n[[Page S6327]]\n\nspending was good for the economy and that government central planners \ncould operate more efficiently than private business left alone.\n  That is the situation she was describing in Britain. However, for us \nin the United States, whether it is government or the private sector, \nit is like asking: Are 535 Members of Congress smarter to determine the \ndirection of the economy or are the 308 million people outside of the \nCongress in the United States better prepared to do it, and which will \ndo the most good?\n  Now, Thatcher faced intense opposition both from true believers in \nthe stimulus ideology and from those with a vested interest in the \nstatus quo, but having rejected national decline, as she did, as an \noption, there really was no alternative. She explained to the British \npublic why her course of action was necessary and stood up to the \nspecial interests that stood in the way of prosperity. We hear from our \nconstituents we ought to do something about those special interests, \nbut we don't seem to do much about it.\n  When the media began speculating she would fail to follow through and \nthat she would lose her spine and make a U-turn as so many of her \npredecessors had done, Mrs. Thatcher's response was: ``You turn if you \nwant to . . . The lady's not for turning.''\n  What Prime Minister Thatcher provided for Britain is very simple: \nLeadership. That is what the United States needs today.\n  Most Americans I talk to believe in our opportunity society and \nrefuse to accept that the American dream of a better life for our \nchildren is dead or that there is a new norm or that America is in \ndecline. For those of us who feel that way, restoring the dynamic \nAmerican free market economy is essential. In the words of Margaret \nThatcher, there is no alternative. We must reduce spending. There is no \nalternative. We must have low, simple, and stable taxes. There is no \nalternative. And there is no alternative to reducing and reforming the \ngrowing regulatory burden.\n  During the last 3\\1/2\\ years, the national debt has grown by more \nthan $5 trillion--an increase of 50 percent. This year will be the \nfourth consecutive year with trillion-dollar annual deficits. These \ndeficits and a Federal debt that now totals $16 trillion are, in fact, \ndampers on private sector job creation.\n  When Washington takes and spends the wealth created in the private \nsector, it crowds out new investments that would have been made by \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs, investments that would have resulted in \nthe creation of new wealth and job opportunities for more Americans. \nThe out-of-control spending has created a stagnant economy with \nunemployment stuck above 8 percent now for 42 consecutive months.\n  Economic freedom must replace bigger government. Economic growth must \nbe our top priority, and fiscal discipline in Washington is a \nprerequisite to sustainable economic growth. In the words of Prime \nMinister Thatcher, there is no alternative.\n  The 4-year experiment attempting to increase economic prosperity by \ngrowing government and managing the economy through government \nintervention has failed. To address the anemic economic recovery and \nget America back to work, we must reduce the size and scope of the \nFederal Government. In the words of Prime Minister Thatcher, there is \nno alternative.\n  Again, our Nation is $16 trillion in debt. How much is $16 trillion? \nWell, if we started counting to 16 trillion one second at a time, it \nwould take a person over 500,000 years to reach that level.\n  The Federal Government will spend more than $11 trillion just on \nMedicare and Medicaid over the next 10 years. Medicare and Medicaid \nserve a vital role in providing health care services to individuals who \nare poor, elderly, or disabled. But just because those programs have \noperated a certain way for 47 years doesn't mean they operate \nefficiently, even though we all agree they are part of the social \nfabric of America and must be maintained. If we want to save those \nprograms for future generations, the current path of just saying no to \nevery proposal and every special interest is not an option. In the \nwords of Prime Minister Thatcher, there is no alternative. There is no \nalternative but to look at their very structure and ask the question: \nCan we do better?\n  As we begin to take the steps to pull ourselves out of this fiscal \nmess, we also need to reform how Washington does business so we don't \nfind ourselves in this situation again. One major step that could \nproduce long-term fiscal discipline is a balanced budget amendment, but \nif we passed that today it would not get us out of the hole we are in. \nHowever, once we get out of the hole, it is going to keep us from \ngetting into it again.\n  The national debt now is reaching a point where if we do not \nintervene with a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, it is \ngoing to become unsustainable. Mere laws have not controlled deficit \nspending because Congress can always change a law when it becomes \npolitically expedient. I went through this one time because I was an \nauthor with a former Senator in this body by the name of Harry Byrd \nfrom the State of Virginia, not West Virginia. He and I worked together \nwhen I was a Member of the House. We got legislation passed requiring a \nbalanced budget. For 15 years that law was on the books and never in \nthose 15 years was there ever a balanced budget.\n  So it makes it very clear that statutes will not control deficit \nspending. I concluded a long time ago that a constitutional amendment \nis a ``must'' to provide Congress with necessary discipline. The \nexample right now of Europe's debt situation is sobering. Nations that \nallow debt to grow out of control risk default.\n  Think of Greece as an example. If we do not take effective, \ncorrective action, the European future could be ours, and maybe sooner \nthan we think. The time for tinkering around the edges of the budget is \nover. We must take bold action to address the debt crisis before it is \ntoo late. In the words of Prime Minister Thatcher, there is no \nalternative.\n  Another area crying out for decisive action is our voluminous Tax \nCode. Uncertainty in our Tax Code and the threat of higher taxes is \nlike an anchor preventing our economy from setting sail. At the end of \nthe year, the across-the-board tax relief first enacted in 2001 and \n2003 will expire. Its expiration will lead to a higher tax bill for \nvirtually every taxpayer, representing one of the largest tax increases \nin the history of the country, and, as my colleagues know, that can \nhappen without even a vote of Congress. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben \nBernanke has testified about the negative impact of higher taxes on a \nfragile economy.\n\n  More importantly, I hear from employers that uncertainty about the \nfuture makes it difficult to plan, take risks, and make decisions to \nexpand and hire. Tax certainty must be a priority in creating a \nprogrowth environment. In the words of Prime Minister Thatcher, there \nis no alternative.\n  Even President Obama has acknowledged the negative impact of tax \nincreases on economic growth saying we shouldn't raise taxes in a \nrecession. We remember because he campaigned on tax increases in 2008, \nbut before he was even sworn in he warned people we can't have that tax \nincrease now because we are in a recession. Nevertheless, nearly every \nday our President is on the campaign trail in 2012 talking about tax \nincreases on the so-called rich claiming them to pay their fair share. \nBut I have never had a definition from the President of the United \nStates of what a fair share is.\n  However, the so-called rich already pay the overwhelming majority of \nFederal taxes. Do my colleagues know that the top 20 percent of \nhouseholds currently account for 95 percent of Federal income taxes? \nMoreover, the top 1 percent we hear so much about bears nearly 40 \npercent of the Federal income tax burden. It is no wonder our job \nsector, especially the nearly 1 million small businesses targeted by \nthe President's tax increase, are reluctant to make business decisions \nand invest in this climate when taxes are going to go so high at the \nend of this year. There are businesses ready to expand and create jobs. \nThere are millions of dollars in private sector investment waiting to \nbe invested and to create jobs. But businesses are holding back, \nwaiting for the heavy boot of higher taxes to drop. It is time we \nreplaced divisiveness and demagoguery with a progrowth tax policy.\n  This country does not need more taxes; we need more taxpayers. The \nway to get more taxpayers is to get\n\n[[Page S6328]]\n\nmore people working. The way to get more people working is to encourage \nthat investment. We need to take the uncertainty out of the present \npolitical environment here that has an impact on the economy.\n  When businesses and entrepreneurs are willing to put everything on \nthe line by opening a new business or expanding an existing business, \nwe must assure them that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their \nsuccess, not punish them with a higher tax bill which takes money out \nof their cashflow. When a business operates on cashflow, they cannot \nhire people if they don't have the cash.\n  So we must act decisively to stop job-killing taxes from going up. In \nthe words of Prime Minister Thatcher, there is no alternative.\n  It isn't just the threat, though, of taxes that has caused \nuncertainty and held back private sector investment. The threat of \ncostly new regulations has paralyzed many industries. In fact, I hear \nmore complaints from small businesses about regulation than I do this \nbiggest tax increase in the history of the country coming before us \nthis December.\n  During the past few years, thousands of new Federal rules were \nfinalized. Those who view government intervention into private \nenterprise as positive might say: So what.\n  All of these rules come with real costs. This administration has \nissued about 200 major rules that each have an impact of $100 million \nor more. A Gallup poll taken at the end of last year found that \ncompliance with government regulations is the single biggest issue \nfacing small business owners today. When 70 percent of the new jobs in \nAmerica are created by small business, we ought to be concerned about \nwhat these small businesspeople are saying is their No. 1 problem.\n  On top of the outright cost of new regulation and the compliance \nburden, the uncertainty about when a new regulation might come down \nmakes businesses reluctant to expand. In recent years we have seen \nregulation on top of regulation. No one knows when the next one will \nappear or how much it will cost.\n  During the Great Depression, the avalanche of new agencies with \nnewfound regulatory powers led to businesses sitting on large amounts \nof cash, even in industries that were not yet affected by the new \nregulations because the uncertainty about who would be targeted next \nfroze private sector investment. Now we are seeing pretty much the same \nthing today.\n  It would be one thing if these were essential protections for the \nenvironment or public health as proponents often claim, but for many of \nthese new regulations the cost of compliance outweighs the public \nbenefit.\n  It doesn't make any sense to try to regulate dust on farms when there \nis no practical way to stop the wind blowing. Still, I don't know how \nmany years the EPA has been working on what they call a ``fugitive dust \nrule.'' Does it make any sense to make a dairy farmer fill out pages of \ndocuments to prove they have a plan in place in the case of an \naccidental milk spill? Well, they considered that regulation, but it \nwas too outlandish that they made a public announcement they were not \ngoing to do that. Then why was EPA wasting time considering these \nregulations in the first place? There are legitimate forms of pollution \nthat need attention, but even then the EPA seems intent on overkill.\n\n  Did the Utility MACT rule, which was intended to limit mercury \nemissions from powerplants, really need to be the single most expensive \nregulation in EPA history?\n  In addition to this rule, powerplants that rely on coal, like most of \nthose in my State of Iowa, are facing a whole new string of overlapping \nrules with their own compliance deadlines and paperwork.\n  These include the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, the National \nAmbient Air Quality Standards, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, \ncooling water intake regulations, clean water effluent guidelines, and \ncoal ash regulations.\n  Taken separately, each of these may have some justification, but when \nyou put them all together, the cost and compliance burden is enormous, \nespecially on small utilities.\n  Yesterday there was a delegation of Iowa rural electric cooperatives \nin my office explaining exactly how costly this was to them and their \nconsumers.\n  That leads many people to suspect that the real motivation for this \nburst of regulation is an ideological drive to artificially raise the \ncost of electricity generation using coal, which would hurt the economy \nin places such as Iowa that rely on coal for cost-effective energy. A \nregulatory approach that imposes excessive costs for little or no \nbenefit does not do anyone any good.\n  Regulatory agencies should be held accountable for meeting the cost-\nbenefit test and also--a little more difficult to measure--the \ncommonsense test. The deluge of regulations in recent years and the \nuncertainty--there is that word again: ``uncertainty''--about what is \ncoming next is acting like a wet blanket on our economy. We must put an \nimmediate stop to unnecessary, costly new regulations. In the words of \nPrime Minister Thatcher, there is no alternative.\n  In the long run, we need comprehensive regulatory reform. The \nConstitution vests all legislative powers in the Congress, which is \ndirectly accountable to the American people. However, over the years, \nCongress has delegated more and more authority to unelected and \nunaccountable bureaucrats. And once delegated, it is difficult to take \nback. As a result, then, we have a massive administrative state full of \nwell-meaning but unelected government officials who have great power to \nwrite regulations with the force of law, with little or no democratic \naccountability.\n  This has led to the implementation of major policy decisions that \nimpact the economy and the lives of the American people that likely \nwould never have been approved if they would have had to have been \nvoted on by the Congress.\n  That is why I am an original cosponsor of the Regulations From the \nExecutive in Need of Scrutiny Act. REINS is the acronym. The REINS Act \nwould require every major Federal regulation to come before both Houses \nof Congress for a vote and be signed by the President before it can be \nimplemented. This will allow voters to hold their Members of Congress \naccountable for ill-conceived regulations. It would be a check on the \nmistake that Congress makes by delegating so much power in the first \nplace. It would also provide more transparency and predictability to \nthe regulatory process, thus reducing job-killing uncertainty.\n  Reforms such as the REINS Act would be a major change in how \nWashington does business, and that upsets a lot of apple carts. In the \nwords of Prime Minister Thatcher, there is no alternative.\n  If we want economic growth and jobs, if we want a brighter future for \nAmerica, we cannot afford to dither any longer. We need leadership like \nBritain had under Margaret Thatcher that is willing to tell all the \nspecial interests and all the political power players, there is no \nalternative.\n  We must take steps I have outlined to reinvigorate the free market \neconomy. Just like Britain in 1979, there is no alternative.\n  We have tried President Obama's theory on economic stimulus. It was \nsupposed to keep unemployment under 8 percent, and it has never been \nunder 8 percent since the day he signed it. We saw a massive expansion \nof government and deficit spending as a result. More than $800 billion \nwas spent on a failed economic stimulus bill that was supposed to keep \nunemployment down. We all know how that turned out.\n  Government spending in the process has reached unprecedented levels. \nToday, the size of government--if you combine local, State, and \nFederal--is 40 percent of our gross domestic product. One hundred years \nago, it was 8 percent. If it were true that government spending creates \neconomic growth, then we should be living high off the hog today, but \nit is not.\n  The private sector creates jobs. It is the responsibility of the \ngovernment to merely create an environment that leads to job growth. \nRemember a very basic premise: Government consumes well. It does not \ncreate well. Through economic freedom, entrepreneurs are free to \ninnovate and prosper. This economic success leads to higher standards \nof living and a better quality of life. Importantly, these gains do not \nthen come at the expense of others. Because, contrary to what some \naround\n\n[[Page S6329]]\n\nhere would have you believe, when someone produces a product or a \nservice that others want, they are creating new wealth and everyone is \nbetter off. But too often around here, we think matters of the economy \nare a zero-sum game.\n  One person's prosperity, then, does not come at the expense of \nanother's. In fact, business success and economic growth lift all boats \nthrough employment gains, higher wages, and greater value to the \nconsumer.\n  We sometimes hear it implied that individual success cannot be \nachieved without government involvement or intervention. Some people \nseem to believe that an individual's success must come at somebody else \nbeing deprived or that the success was only achieved collectively and \nwith the help of government. This line of thinking concludes that \ngovernment and society is, therefore, entitled to some of the fruits of \nthat individual's labor. This line of thinking is in stark \ncontradiction to our country's founding principles that government \nexists to protect the individual's right to life, liberty, and the \npursuit of happiness. Happiness is not found in a government paycheck \nredistributing what somebody else earned. In fact, government \ndependence leads to resentment.\n  By contrast, this great American dream of ours is based on individual \nAmericans working hard and earning their own success.\n  A country with an increasing number of citizens dependent on a \ngovernment that lives beyond its means and redistributes what remains \nof a once great economy would, then, cease to be the great America that \nwe have had for 225 years. Such a future is unacceptable to most \nAmericans, just as it was unacceptable to Prime Minister Thatcher, who \nsaid, there is no alternative.\n  The American dream is our birthright and our obligation to posterity. \nWe must return to progrowth policies and an opportunity society. There \nis no alternative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Travel Tourism\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, anybody who has been outside today knows \nthat we had a beautiful day, and the last couple of days have been \nbeautiful, so it is hard to believe that the summer is actually coming \nto a close. But as it does end, I wanted to take a few minutes this \nafternoon to highlight something that is very important to us in New \nHampshire and to the country. That is tourism, particularly the outdoor \nindustry association and its importance to local economies in New \nHampshire and across this country.\n  New Hampshire has long recognized the importance of conservation and \nthe economic benefits that come from supporting outdoor recreation. Our \nbeautiful State, like Connecticut, has an abundance of natural \ntreasures, the White Mountain National Forest, our scenic lakes, our \ncoastline--we may only have 18 miles of coastline but it is beautiful, \nwith beautiful beaches and rocky coves.\n  These treasures draw visitors from across New England, from all over \nthe world. Protecting these natural resources is not just good for the \nenvironment, it is also critical for our economy. In fact, the outdoor \nrecreation economy supports 53,000 jobs in New Hampshire alone, 6.1 \nmillion American jobs across the country. That is more than we have in \nthe construction industry, in the finance and insurance industries or \nin the education industry. And even in this time of economic recovery, \noutdoor recreation produces $646 billion in direct consumer spending.\n  Again, that is more than the pharmaceutical industry, motor vehicle \nparts, and household utilities. Americans today spend nearly as much on \nsnow sports as they do on Internet access, and considerably more on \nbike gear and trips than on airplane tickets and fees. This is all \ndetailed in a report called the Outdoor Recreation Economy, which is a \nvery interesting analysis of what the outdoor recreation economy means \nto this country.\n  I recently had the opportunity to visit Eastern Mountain Sports. EMS \nis a New Hampshire-based business that specializes in outdoor apparel \nand equipment. At EMS, I saw the direct economic benefit that comes \nfrom our support for the development and conservation of outdoor \nrecreation areas. I had a chance to talk to some of the 300 or so \nemployees at EMS. They have stores throughout the east coast, and they \nare just one example of the countless businesses that have grown \nstrong, thanks to the careful stewardship of our beautiful areas in \nthis country, of the landscapes that so many of their customers visit.\n  One of the ways we have preserved the great outdoors at the Federal \nlevel is through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The fund was \ncreated in 1965. It protects lands, forests, State and local parks, and \ncritical wildlife habitat. This critical program also helps ensure \nhunting and fishing access, something also very important to New \nHampshire. It supports battlefields, trails, sporting facilities, and \noutdoor recreation opportunities in every State.\n  Every year since I arrived in the Senate in 2009, I have led a letter \nwith Senator Leahy of Vermont to appropriators that supports robust \nfunding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The most recent \nletter was signed by 44 Senators from both sides of the aisle, a very \nstrong showing of bipartisanship from supporters who know this is a \nprogram that works for the environment and works for small business.\n  I am also pleased to cosponsor legislation--bipartisan legislation--\nthat is led by Senator Bingaman, which would permanently authorize the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund with dedicated funding. In New \nHampshire, the LWCF has supported more than 650 local recreation and \nconservation projects and it helps protect locations such as the White \nMountain National Forest, the Appalachian Trail, the Umbagog National \nWildlife Refuge, and the Silvio Conte Wildlife Refuge.\n  These scenic locations, whether they are enjoyed for relaxation or \nexercise, support jobs and local economies by increasing the demand for \noutdoor recreation equipment and by attracting visitors to our State. \nThose visitors eat in our restaurants, they shop at our small \nbusinesses, they stay in some of the most beautiful hotels you will \nfind anywhere in America.\n  The outdoor economy supports tourism, and tourism should be \nrecognized as the economic engine that it is throughout this country. \nThe travel and tourism industry is one of the top 10 industries in 48 \nStates in the country. It supports over 14 million American jobs. In \nNew Hampshire, travel and tourism is our second largest industry, \nsupporting over 60,000 jobs.\n  I had the opportunity yesterday with a number of small business \nowners and representatives from New Hampshire to visit Brand USA, which \nis the national initiative that is the result of travel and tourism \nlegislation passed by the Senate and Congress in 2010 to begin \nadvertising the United States outside of this country. They have \nadvertisements now in Canada, in the UK, and in markets that are \nimportant as we think about how we can attract visitors to the United \nStates. In New Hampshire, it is not difficult to see why tourism is so \nimportant. Visitors are drawn to New Hampshire for our charming \nattractions, for our landscapes, for our foliage--which is about to \nbegin, actually--and they provide a beautiful environment for families \nto spend time together.\n\n  During August my husband and I actually had the opportunity to take \nall of our grandchildren--our 7 grandchildren; actually, our entire \nfamily, 14 of us--up to the White Mountains. We stayed at the Mount \nWashington Hotel, which is at the base of Mount Washington. It is a \nbeautiful hotel where the Bretton Woods monetary conference was held \nback in the late 1940s. We had a great time. We went hiking, my oldest \ngrandson went fishing with his father, one of my granddaughters went \nhorseback riding with my daughter, we visited the flume, which is a \nnaturally\n\n[[Page S6330]]\n\noccurring gorge in New Hampshire, and we ended the several days we were \nthere visiting at a place called Clark's Trading Post, which is a great \nfamily business in New Hampshire. They work with black bears that roam \nthe woods of New Hampshire, and they have been working with them for 50 \nyears, so it is a real trained-bear show. In addition to that, they \nhave attractions from New England, they have a railroad, and it is just \na great place for the family to spend the afternoon. This was a \nwonderful trip. It brought our family closer. It allowed the cousins to \nvisit with each other. We came back rested, restored, and we had a \ngreat time investing in New Hampshire businesses.\n  As our family saw last month, conservation programs such as LWCF are \npart of what we need to do to make sure those kinds of experiences are \navailable to everybody in New Hampshire and across this country. They \nare a part of our responsibility to safeguard our environmental \nheritage. More than that, as the outdoor recreation economy shows, as \nso many reports show, they are an economic imperative that supports \nmillions of jobs nationwide.\n  I am going to continue to work to strengthen programs such as the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund and to promote tourism and the outdoor \nrecreation economy, and I urge all of my colleagues to join these \nefforts because they not only protect America's great outdoors, they \nsupport the businesses and the outdoor recreation economy they sustain.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor this evening to \nmake a few things abundantly clear about the Veterans Jobs Corps \nlegislation the Senate is currently considering.\n  First and foremost, the bill in front of us is fully paid for, using \noffsets that both Republicans and Democrats have supported in the past. \nSo this bill is paid for.\n  Secondly, no matter what Republicans try to tell us, this is a bill \nthat includes ideas from both sides of the aisle. In fact, of the 12 \nprovisions in this bill, 8 of them started as Republican ideas.\n  We in fact included Senator Burr's entire alternative to this bill to \nmake it even more bipartisan. On top of that, we have included bills \nthat are sponsored by Senator Toomey, Senator Boozman, Senator Johanns, \nand Senator Isakson. So don't let anybody tell you we have not been \ninclusive in this process.\n  We know on this side that we do not have a monopoly of good ideas to \nhelp solve the problems of veterans who are looking for work today, and \nthat is why we have included as many avenues to employment as possible \nin this legislation.\n  Finally and most importantly, I want to make sure that everyone who \nis considering voting for the budget point of order that Senator \nSessions has been out here talking about and indicated he may raise \nknows exactly what is at stake. Believe me, every single veteran in the \ncountry needs to know what is at stake as well. What his budget point \nof order says is we are now going to draw a line in the sand on what we \nwill provide for our Nation's veterans. It does not matter if the bill \nis paid for. The point of order puts a pricetag on the care of veterans \nand then says not a dime more.\n  This point of order really ties our hands. It says even at a time of \nwar, even at a time when nearly one in five young veterans is out of \nwork, at a time when the veterans' suicide rate is skyrocketing and \nwhen more young veterans are becoming homeless, we are done; veterans \nare on their own.\n  It says even if we find offsets for new investments and ideas to aid \nour Nation's heroes--we paid for it--tough luck; nothing you can do. It \nsays countless bills waiting for consideration in the Senate, sponsored \nby Republicans and Democrats, can be tossed along the wayside.\n  When are we going to realize that our veterans are a cost of these \nwars; that helping to give them the skills and training to find work is \na cost of war; that their transition home is a cost of war and it is a \ncost we are going to face, not just this year or next year or 10 years \nfrom now but for the rest of the lives of these men and women? When are \nwe going to realize it is not enough to pat our veterans on the back \nfor their service but not give them a helping hand when they come home? \nThe budget point of order says we have done enough for veterans.\n  I say we cannot do enough. Less than 1 percent of U.S. citizens have \nserved. Less than 1 percent of U.S. citizens have served for the well-\nbeing of the other 99 percent. It is simply wrong for us to say we are \nout of help.\n  Veterans across the country are watching, they are waiting, and they \nare tired of excuses. They want to see we can get this bill to the \nfinish line.\n  I know some Republicans have pointed to the calendar as a reason for \ntheir opposition to this bill. Honestly I wish it were not September \neither and we did not have to deal with politics here in Washington, \nDC. But, you know, who could care less about what month it is or how \nmany days out we are from an election? The nearly 1 million unemployed \nveterans looking for work. When you talk to them, their concern is not \nwhat month it is or how many days before election, it is about what \njobs are available in their community. What training program can they \ntake advantage of. What is being done to honor their two or three or \nmore tours overseas.\n  Our answer cannot be that we are all out of options. It cannot be \nthat their service was worth only so much. I am here to urge \nRepublicans to join us this evening in rising above politics as we have \ndone time and time again throughout history for our veterans, to ignore \nthe calendar and do what is right. Let's send a message from the Senate \nthat our veterans come first; that we will keep our end of the bargain; \nthat we will never put a price on the commitment we owe them.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in waiving the budget point of order \nwhen it is offered later this evening.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the Senator's request, the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, earlier our colleague, Senator Murray, \ncomplained that objections to the Veterans Jobs Corps bill was \npolitical--I think that was the thrust of part of her remarks--and that \nwe should just pass it and move on.\n  My sole problem with the legislation--and Senator Murray, as a member \nof the Budget Committee understands this--is it violates the budget and \nis subject to a budget point of order. It would spend more money on \nthis legislation than the veterans committee is authorized to spend. If \nwe do that, we are supposed to vote on it, and a budget point of order \nwould lie, and those who want to waive the budget would move to waive \nthe budget and we would vote. It takes 60 votes to waive the duly \nagreed upon spending limits we have in that regard. That was part of \nthe Budget Control Act in which we raised the debt ceiling by $2.1 \ntrillion. We agreed to put some limits on spending--not much but some. \nHere we are already, after several different prior violations of the \nbudget, back at it again. So that is the concern.\n  Senator Burr has offered legislation that would help solve the \nproblem of unemployment among veterans, and his doesn't violate the \nbudget. We could support it. I would note that the veterans committee \nnever had a hearing on this. Therefore, nobody ever: studied it, called \nexpert witnesses, had hearings in public, or examined witnesses to find \nout if this plan is the best way to help veterans who are unemployed. \nWe have six programs already that do this. Maybe it would be better to \nconsolidate some of them and add a little to it. Maybe some of them \nought to be eliminated and a new program that is outlined in the Murray\n\n[[Page S6331]]\n\namendment could be utilized to do that. But we have had no real \nopportunity to do that.\n  So what is the politics? I would say the politics is that the \nmajority party and the majority leader, do not want to talk about real \nissues of great importance, so this bill is brought up and utilized to \nfill up the whole week. So we are not going to take up several other \npieces of legislation that are important.\n  It was suggested that those Republicans who don't favor this way of \ndealing with unemployment of veterans--if we don't do that, we don't \nlike veterans and we don't like people who have served our country and \nwe are insensitive about that. Let me ask a question. If those on the \nother side care about veterans--if they say this bill, which would cost \n$900 million, which is a lot of money but not that much in terms of \nwhat we deal with--so if we don't support this bill, they say we don't \ncare about veterans. So let me pose this question: If my democratic \ncolleagues care about our men and women in uniform who serve our \ncountry and veterans, how could they oppose authorizing the Defense \nbill?\n  Senator Reid, the majority leader, blocked bringing up the \nbipartisan-approved Defense authorization bill. It has been passed \nevery year for over 50 years. That amounts to $631 billion. If we don't \npass that, we are not taking care of the pay raise for military men and \nwomen and a lot of other initiatives that are in there. I would just \npoint out to my colleagues that it passed the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee on a bipartisan basis--not just on a bipartisan basis, \nunanimously. Yet Senator Reid will not bring it up. The House has \npassed the Defense authorization bill. They passed it in May. We have \nnever brought it to the floor. The leader has refused to bring it to \nthe floor.\n  I suggest if my colleagues have a question about the jobs bill for \nveterans for us, why don't we ask this question: What do they think of \nthe military if they will not bring up a military authorization bill? \nDo they care about them?\n  What about the Defense appropriations bill? The House has passed the \nDefense appropriations bill. The Appropriations Committee of the Senate \nhas passed the Defense appropriations bill. It is on the Senate floor \nwaiting to be called up and voted on. It is not being voted on, and we \nare, again, talking about $600 billion. But this $900 million bill is \ntaking up the whole week and the other bill will not even be brought \nup.\n  One more question: If my Democratic colleagues are concerned about \nveterans and jobs, what about the sequester? We are on track to hammer \nthe Defense Department with half of the budget cuts. The Defense \nDepartment makes up about one-sixth of the Federal Government spending. \nIt is going to take half of the cuts. It has already taken almost $500 \nbillion in cuts. This would be another $492 billion in cuts to the \nDefense Department. Secretary Panetta, the Secretary of Defense, has \ntold the President and the whole world this would be catastrophic. It \nwould hollow out the military. It would endanger our ability to fulfill \nour mission, but we are on track to have that go into effect--those \ncuts take place in January--and we are going to have military officials \nreduce dramatically, if that occurs, the number of men and women in \nuniform. We are going to have people coming off the battlefield in Iraq \nand Afghanistan and other places wanting to make a career out of the \nmilitary, thinking they could make a career out of the military, and \nall of a sudden, because of this sequester, they are going to walk in \nand they will get a pink slip. ``Sorry, we don't need you anymore. Good \nluck.''\n  We have plans under the cuts that are in place in the Defense \nDepartment to draw down the number of personnel. This would be \ndramatically more. Where are they going to get jobs? Many of the people \nwho would also lose their jobs in that process work for defense \ncontractors or civilian employees of the Department of Defense who also \nare veterans, who got jobs as civilian employees in the Department of \nDefense. They will be laid off.\n  Why aren't we dealing with the sequester? Earlier today Senator \nMcCain said it was a shame that we are not dealing with these issues. \n``Shame, shame, shame,'' Senator McCain said. I think that is right. \nYet we are having the spectacle of the majority party in this Congress \nattacking the Republicans for not liking the military because we don't \nagree to a budget-busting bill on how to create jobs. That has never \nbeen through the committee for veterans, jobs for veterans--neve been \nthrough the committee and never had a proper process.\n\n  I do not agree with that. We have a serious problem in this Senate. \nWe have a majority party in this Senate that is refusing to undertake \nthe basic requirements of the U.S. Senate. We have not passed a budget. \nWe have not passed a single appropriations bill. We certainly did not \npass a Defense appropriations bill. The Defense authorization bill, as \nhas been noted, was passed for 50-plus years. It will not be even \nbrought up to have debate on, and it passed the committee unanimously.\n  What is this? This is a fear, it seems to me, a political fear. And \nthe political fear is, if you bring up these bills, Democrats might \nhave to vote on amendments and things, and they do not want to vote. If \nyou get to bring a budget to the floor, well, you have a right to offer \namendments about the future financial course of America, and we get to \nhave full debate about it, and talk about it, and offer amendments and \nbe on record as to what we believe in, how much debt we think we can \nsustain in this country.\n  They do not want to do that. Senator Reid said it is foolish to have \na budget. It is not foolish to have a budget, of course. That is why we \nare in such a fix today, I would suggest.\n  So can we do more for veterans? I think we can do more, and I think \nwe can help them with their employment circumstances. I served 10 years \nin the Army Reserve. One of my duties was to be the representative for \nthe employer support of the Guard and Reserve, and that was to ensure \nthat people who were called up for our National Guard or our Army \nReserve or go on active duty--to make sure when they come back they get \nthe job they had, they will not lose their employment position as a \nresult of serving their country. That is one of the things we did.\n  When I was a U.S. attorney, I prosecuted some cases--and we won--\nwhere I felt people had lost their job as a result of being called up \nto military service. That is not acceptable. We need to protect our men \nand women. I have a history of that.\n  But this bill does not guarantee that we are going to use the money \nwisely that is being spent. So I am amazed we are using our last hours \nhere to move forward a bill that violates the budget when we do not \nhave to. Senator Burr's bill does not violate the budget, and it will, \nI am confident, do the job, do the same kind of job for helping \nveterans get jobs. This is very odd, to suggest that somehow those of \nus on this side are using politics to block a benefit to veterans. Give \nme a break. That is kind of an odd charge, isn't it?\n  I would say that people on our side are standing and asking \nprincipled questions. Yes, we want to do more for veterans. Yes, we \nhope to help them find jobs. But we agreed just last August to spending \nlimits. We agreed just last August, in exchange for raising the debt \nceiling $2 trillion, to reduce some spending--not a lot, but some \nspending. Here we are, just over a year later, and we are already \nbusting those limits we agreed to. It is not right, and it cannot be \nthe kind of thing we should be doing.\n  One more thing, and it is obvious to those of us in the Senate, if we \ntake a minute to think about it; and that is, sustaining the budget \npoint of order, not waiving the budget, does not kill the Murray bill \nor the Burr bill. It simply says, go back to committee, have a real \nhearing, bring a bill forward that actually stays within the budget. \nThat is all it says do.\n  If we continue this process--and we have done it several times \nalready this year--of violating the budget, pretty soon the budget \nnumbers we have are going to be worthless. That would be my concern. \nLet's send the legislation back to committee, let's have a hearing, \nlet's let a bill come forward, let's consider the six jobs programs for \nveterans that are already in place, see if they need to be improved, \nexpanded, consolidated, how this bill should be passed to complement \nthose programs, and see if we do not get the maximum benefit for \nveterans for every dollar the taxpayers have sent to us.\n\n[[Page S6332]]\n\n  To the extent to which we spend a dime above the budget, it is either \nborrowed or paid for by new taxes. There is no doubt about it. There \nare new taxes in this bill, new revenue that is in this bill. Some of \nit is gimmicky, I have to tell you, and it is not the way we should do \nbusiness, in my view.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share these thoughts. I believe the \nbudget point of order should not be waived. We should not spend more \nthan the deemed budget allocations allow. We should send this bill back \nto committee, tell them to get busy on a thorough review of the jobs \nsituation of veterans, and come forward and produce a bill we can pass \nthat does the job and does not violate the budget. We spend $3,700 \nbillion. We ought to be able to find $900 million somewhere in that \nbudget to meet this challenge.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank a \nman who has been a good friend to me and a strong advocate for working \npeople in our home State of Illinois, across America and beyond.\n  Congressman Jerry Costello has represented the 12th Congressional \nDistrict of Illinois in the House of Representatives for nearly a \nquarter century. We served together for 8 years in the House, from 1988 \nto 1996.\n  Congressman Costello will be retiring at the end of this Congress. He \nhas flown home nearly every weekend for 24 years. He and I have shared \nmore flights between Washington and Illinois than either of us can \ncount. I will miss his company on those flights, and all of us in the \nIllinois congressional delegation will miss his leadership and good \ncounsel in our ranks.\n  Jerry Costello and I were both born in East St. Louis, IL, which was \na hard-scrabble, working class town even back then. Jerry's family \nlived in Holy Angels Parish and I was a St. Elizabeth Parish kid, but \nwe were both taught by the Marianist brothers at Assumption High \nSchool, home of the Pioneers.\n  Jerry's family moved to Belleville, IL, when Jerry was in high school \nand his dad was elected St. Clair County sheriff. In seventh grade, he \nmet the love of his life, Georgia Cockrum. They married when they were \njust 18.\n  Jerry put himself through college working as a court bailiff. He also \nworked as a deputy sheriff, probation officer and court administrator.\n  In 1980 he was elected St. Clair County Board chairman, making him \nCEO of one of Illinois' largest counties.\n  In 1988 he won a special election to fill the term of a longtime \nCongressman who had died in office. Mel Price was a veritable legend \nwho had served in Congress since before Jerry Costello was born.\n  I remember when Jerry Costello was sworn in. I was one of the newer \nmembers of the Illinois delegation back then. Welcoming him to our \ndelegation that day were Illinois Senators Paul Simon and Alan Dixon, \nalong with Congressmen Sid Yates, Frank Anunzio, Ken Gray and me.\n  We kidded Jerry and called him ``Landslide'' because of his narrow \nmargin of victory. It was the one and only time in his congressional \ncareer that he had a close election.\n  The 12th Congressional District in southern and southwest Illinois \nruns along the Mississippi River, from Alton south to Cairo. It is a \nmix of agricultural and industrial communities including East St. \nLouis, Belleville, Carbondale and Granite City.\n  People there don't care much about political labels, they care about \nresults--and that is what Jerry Costello has always focused on. He is \npragmatic and bipartisan.\n  The Almanac of American Politics said it well. Jerry Costello: As \npractical and district-minded as any member of the House. If it can be \ndone, Costello will surely do it.\n  He has fought for smart, responsible economic policies. He supported \nhistoric deficit reduction bills in 1993 and 1997 that helped produce \nthe first balanced budget in a generation. Four years ago when our \nNation was on the verge of economic collapse, he voted for the Recovery \nAct to help prevent a second Great Depression.\n  On that day 24 years ago that he was sworn in, Jerry Costello \nexpressed interest in serving on the House Public Works and \nTransportation Committee. He won that assignment. Today he is the \nsenior Democrat on the House Transportation Aviation Subcommittee, an \nassignment he has used to keep the aerospace industry alive and well in \nsouthern Illinois.\n  He has also been a relentless advocate for aviation safety. He has \nhad a\n\n[[Page S6333]]\n\nhand in every major aviation safety bill over the past decade. \nCongressman Costello's legacy will be safer skies and runways for \nAmerica.\n  No one in Congress has a better understanding of or a stronger \ncommitment to improving America's transportation infrastructure.\n  Jerry Costello has helped write three national Transportation bills. \nWe served together on the conference committee for the most recent \nTransportation Act, which passed earlier this year. It was a bipartisan \nvictory that will create or save 3 million good jobs, strengthen \nAmerica's infrastructure and provide the certainty that transportation \nplanners and builders need.\n  Building modern, regional transportation networks to support economic \ndevelopment and improve people's quality of life has always been one of \nhis top priorities.\n  Jerry Costello has been involved in every major transportation \nproject in the St. Louis-Metro East region for the last 30 years, from \nconstruction of the Clark Bridge to the New Mississippi River Bridge \nconnecting St. Louis and East St. Louis.\n  He helped bring light rail to the Metro East region and he helped \nlead the effort to create a high-speed rail corridor connecting St. \nLouis and Chicago. He helped pass the strongest airline safety law in \n50 years. His leadership was critical in securing the funding to \nstrengthen the flood control levees and dams along the Mississippi \nRiver and in the adoption of new flood insurance maps that are fair and \nequitable.\n  The first vote Jerry Costello cast in Congress was a ``yes'' vote to \nhelp bring a South Africa trade sanctions bill to the floor for debate. \nHe has remained a committed, consistent champion of basic human rights \nand worker rights--including worker safety and the right to bargain \ncollectively.\n  He has fought for fair trade, for efforts to create good jobs in \nAmerica, and against rewarding companies for shipping American jobs \noverseas. He has voted to make college more affordable, and he helped \npass the Affordable Care Act. Presidents and Congresses tried for a \ncentury to pass comprehensive health care. Jerry Costello bravely cast \none of the votes that finally got the job done.\n  Coal lies below 65 percent of Illinois' surface. It could be a real \neconomic and energy boon to America--if we can find a way to use it \nsafely and cleanly. Jerry Costello has fought for cutting-edge new \ntechnologies and public-private partnerships including FutureGen and \nthe new Prairie State Energy Campus that can advance clean coal \nexploration and bring thousands of good new jobs to Illinois. He has \nalso been a strong supporter of expanding the use of biofuels--a move \nthat would help our environment, boost our energy security and benefit \nIllinois farmers.\n  Scott Air Force Base is the largest employer in Illinois south of \nSpringfield. When the future of the base hung in the balance during \nsuccessive rounds of BRAC closings between 1995 and 2005, Jerry \nCostello led the effort to maintain and expand its missions. Instead of \nshutting down, Scott Air Force Base actually added 800 new jobs and \nwhen then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates visited Scott in 2007 he \nhailed it as one of America's three most important air bases.\n  Congressman John Shimkus has called Jerry Costello the ``patron saint \nof Scott Air Force Base'' and he's right. Jerry's energy and skill did \nmore to save Scott Air Force Base from being closed by the BRAC process \nthan any other factor.\n  Loretta and I want to thank Jerry's wife, Georgia, their three grown \nchildren, Jerry, John and Gina, and their eight grandchildren for \nsharing so much of their husband, father and grandfather with our State \nand our Nation all these years.\n  Jerry has said that he might like to teach government next. He would \nbe good at it. The success of our democracy depends on our ability to \nsolve hard problems by reaching honorable compromises. Jerry Costello \ncould teach that lesson because he has lived it. Whatever his future \nholds, I wish my old friend the best of luck and I want to thank him \nagain for all he has done for our State and our Nation.\n  I now ask unanimous consent to enter Senator Kirk's statement \nhonoring Congressman Costello's service to the State of Illinois into \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise today to give thanks to the \n     dean of Illinois' House of Representatives delegation, \n     Congressman Jerry Costello, who has announced his retirement \n     after more than two decades of service in the Congress. \n     Congressman Costello has been a fixture in the halls of the \n     Capitol long before I took office in 2001, and we will miss \n     his leadership and dedication to the people of the 12th \n     Congressional District.\n       From his senior position on the House Transportation and \n     Infrastructure Committee, he has been a tireless advocate for \n     our Nation's road, rail, waterway and aviation \n     infrastructure. His work to improve southwestern Illinois' \n     levee system in particular will pay lasting dividends for his \n     district's safety and economic development.\n       Congressman Costello has been such an effective legislator \n     not just because of his knowledge of the issues, but also due \n     to his ability to work across the aisle. In a time of \n     increasing partisanship in Washington, Congressman Costello \n     has established himself as a bipartisan partner, more \n     interested in delivering for his district than scoring \n     political points. This fact is underscored by his close \n     relationship with our colleague Congressman John Shimkus. \n     Together, they have advanced numerous priorities for southern \n     Illinois, including their support for clean, domestic energy \n     production.\n       But his work on behalf of the men and women of Scott Air \n     Force Base is what I believe will be one of his lasting \n     legacies. Congressman Costello fought to keep Scott open \n     during Base Realignment and Closure Commission process and \n     has been a strong advocate for the base's core medical, \n     communications, and logistics missions, along with the \n     communities that surround Scott.\n       I know I speak for our entire delegation when I wish \n     Congressman Costello a happy and well-earned retirement. His \n     leadership will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/13/senate-section/article/S6333-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6333-S6334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         2012 PARALYMPIC GAMES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this past Sunday, the closing ceremonies \nof the 2012 summer Paralympic games were held in London. More than \n4,200 athletes seated in the arena were joined by 80,000 cheering \nspectators to celebrate the culmination of 11 days of athletic \nachievement with parades, fireworks, and music.\n  Of the 227 American athletes competing in this year's London games, \n20 are members or veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces, including three \nActive Duty servicemembers. This is especially noteworthy given that it \nwas disabled British World War II veterans using sports as \nrehabilitation who founded what has become today's modern Paralympic \ngames.\n  Among those representing Team USA in the London Paralympic games were \nmany athletes from Illinois, including a number of students and alumni \nof the University of Illinois' acclaimed Adapted Varsity Athletics \nProgram.\n  Evanston native Greta Neimanas arrived at her second Paralympic games \nas a 7-time national champion, 13-time world championship medalist and \nParaPan Am games gold medalist. A longtime patient of the \nRehabilitation Institute of Chicago (RIC) and an inspiration to many of \nRIC's younger patients, she competed in both track and road cycling \nevents in London.\n  Joe Berenyi left London with three Paralympic medals: a gold, a \nsilver, and a bronze. The cyclist, who was born in Aurora, IL, also set \na world record on his way to becoming the Paralympic champion in the \nmen's individual C3 Pursuit. A father of three, Joe returned to Oswego \nthis week where he was surprised by a parade of family and friends in \nhis honor.\n  Centennial High School graduate Nichole Millage of Champaign won her \nsecond silver medal in sitting volleyball as a member of the women's \nteam. Even before winning silver in Beijing, Nichole saw the amputation \nof her left leg as an opportunity, not a disability.\n  Born in Chicago, Justin Zook is a three-time Paralympic gold medalist \nand world recordholder. Justin's victory in the 100-meter backstroke in \nLondon was all the more impressive given his disability \nreclassification on the eve of the games, placing him alongside \nathletes with a lower level of physical disability than he had competed \nagainst previously.\n  University of Illinois junior Tatyana McFadden, who goes by the \nnickname ``Lady Velocity,'' won four medals in London: three gold and \none bronze. She competed in the 100, 400, 800, and 1,500 meters and the \nmarathon and was only\n\n[[Page S6334]]\n\nprevented from medaling in all five by a punctured tire during the \nmarathon. She still came in ninth. As a leading voice advocating for \ndisability rights, her motto is ``Sports is my passion, paving access \nfor others is my purpose.''\n  Born and raised in Chicago, Eric Barber has been playing wheelchair \nbasketball for 20 years. He captured his second Paralympic medal this \nyear in London as a member of the bronze-winning U.S. men's wheelchair \nbasketball team. Eric was also a member of the wheelchair basketball \nteam that won bronze in Sydney in 2000.\n  Joining him on the men's wheelchair basketball team was former \nUniversity of Illinois point guard Steve Serio, who led the U.S. team \nwith 20 points and recorded four rebounds and eight assists during the \nteam's bronze-medal game against host Great Britain.\n  Team captain Will Waller was the third Illini on the men's wheelchair \nbasketball team at his fourth Paralympic games.\n  Jennifer Chew represented the University of Illinois on the women's \nwheelchair basketball team. When not training herself, she manages the \nDenver Lady Nuggets basketball team and assistant coaches the Junior \nRolling Nuggets basketball team.\n  Teammate and fellow Illini Sarah Castle was in London at her fourth \nParalympic games but only her second as a basketball player. Sarah \ncompeted at the 2000 and 2004 Paralympic games as a swimmer--winning \nsilver in Sydney--before a shoulder injury prompted her to pursue \nwheelchair basketball instead.\n  Paralympian Adam Bleakney has competed in wheelchair racing events \nranging from 100 meters to the marathon in the 2000, 2004, 2008, and \nnow 2012 summer games. Adam completed both his undergraduate and \ngraduate education at the University of Illinois in Champaign, where he \nnow serves as head coach of the wheelchair track team.\n  Three-time Chicago Marathon winner Josh George claimed bronze in \nLondon in the men's 800 meters. After graduating with honors from the \nUniversity of Illinois, Josh continued to participate in the school's \nprogram as a volunteer assistant coach. When not racing, he works at \nIntelliwheels, a startup that develops innovative wheelchair \ntechnologies at the University of Illinois' EnterpriseWorks.\n  Anjali Forber-Pratt began wheelchair racing when she was just 9 years \nold. She went on to win a total of four gold, six silver, and two \nbronze medals at the Junior National Wheelchair Games before claiming \ntwo bronze medals at the Paralympic games in Beijing and competing in \nthe 100, 200, and 400 meters in London. Anjali embodies her personal \nmotto, ``Dream, Drive, Do'' not only as an athlete but also as a \nstudent--she holds three degrees from the University of Illinois, \nincluding her doctorate.\n  Illinois freshman Ray Martin dominated the track, sweeping the men's \n100, 200, 400, 800 meters. His impressive four gold medals placed him \nat the top of the medal count for Illini athletes.\n  Since competing in his first marathon in 2007, Aaron Pike has become \none of the top wheelchair racers in America in the event. At the \nUniversity of Illinois, he led the Illini to four straight finals of \nthe National Intercollegiate Wheelchair Basketball Tournament, and two \ntitles.\n  Jessica Galli of Savoy has competed in four Paralympic games, where \nshe has won one gold, one bronze, and four silver medals. She holds \nboth a bachelor's and a master's degree from the University of \nIllinois, where she also competed on the wheelchair track team. She \nserves as an advocate for disabled athletes through her work on the \nU.S. Olympic Committee's Athletes' Advisory Council, Wheelchair and \nAmbulatory Sports USA, and USA Wheelchair Track and Field.\n  In a momentous year for Brian Siemann, he not only competed in his \nfirst Paralympic games, but he will also graduate from the University \nof Illinois, where he is currently a senior. The 2012 U.S. Paralympic \nNational Champion in the 100 and 200 meters, Brian lives his favorite \nquote: ``Don't stop believing.''\n  Recent University of Illinois graduate Ryan Chalmers competed as a \ncollegiate athlete in both basketball and track, where his multisport \ntalent earned him an athletic scholarship. Ryan chose track over \nbasketball before being selected as a member of Team USA for the 2012 \nParalympics.\n  After an intense summer training in Champaign, Amanda McGrory \ncompeted in London in five events, including the 800, 1,500, 5,000 and \nthe marathon. The University of Illinois graduate began as a sprinter \nbut changed her mind after her first marathon, one of the sport's most \ngrueling events.\n  Although she hadn't ever competed in a marathon until moving to \nChampaign to attend the University of Illinois just a few years ago, \nSusannah Scaroni represented the United States in the distance event in \nLondon. A member of the Illini track and road racing team, this was her \nfirst Paralympics.\n  It is no coincidence that so many of Illinois' Paralympians are \ncurrent students or alumni of the University of Illinois at Urbana-\nChampaign. Since becoming the first in the Nation to open its doors to \nthose with disabilities in 1949, our State's flagship university has \nbecome a world leader in disability sports. The University of Illinois' \nadaptive sports program draws athletes from across the globe, and has \nsent students, alumni or coaches to every Paralympics since 1960.\n  Just as their nondisabled counterparts, the athletic ability and \ntenacious commitment of each and every one of these athletes serves as \nan inspiration to their friends, their families, and to Americans \nacross the country. Although each faces some form of physical \nlimitation, these athletes accept no limits on what they can achieve.\n  I congratulate all of Team USA's athletes on their success at this \nyear's Paralympic games, and especially those from Illinois. It is an \nhonor to represent them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/13/senate-section/article/S6334-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, today, the House of Representatives passed \nS. 3245, legislation to reauthorize the job-creating EB-5 Regional \nCenter Program for an additional 3 years. In addition to this important \nprogram, the legislation also prevents the expiration of three other \nimmigration programs important to Senator Conrad, Senator Hatch, and \nSenator Grassley.\n  I am very pleased the House acted with such strong bipartisan \nsupport, and I commend House Judiciary Committee chairman Lamar Smith \nfor his quick action on the bill. Once again I thank the Judiciary \nCommittee's ranking member, Senator Grassley, for his partnership on \nthis legislation.\n  Passage of this legislation in the House today will ensure that the \njob-creating EB-5 Regional Center Program will continue. Today's action \nwill allow the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to continue to \nimprove and grow the program administratively and will give me and \nother interested lawmakers, agency officials, and private citizens the \ntime needed to consider and find consensus on lasting statutory \nimprovements to the program so that it may continue as a permanent and \nvital part of our immigration system. Most importantly, it will allow \nAmerican entrepreneurs to continue building job-creating development \nprojects around the country.\n  This program is and will remain a productive part of America's \nimmigration system. Like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United \nKingdom, the United States is right to provide the world's citizens the \nopportunity to immigrate to its shores based upon investment. This \nprogram welcomes people from around the world who devote substantial \ninvestment capital to American businesses to invigorate American \ncommunities. And it does so at no cost to the American taxpayer. \nMoreover, those who immigrate through this program will purchase\n\n[[Page S6335]]\n\nreal estate and other goods, enroll their children in our schools, \ncolleges, and universities, pay taxes, and enrich the communities in \nwhich they will live and work.\n  As the availability of credit in the United States has become \nrestricted, particularly for new and small businesses, many have turned \nto this program for capital. The program's growth over the last several \nyears has been significant. And with increased growth comes the need \nfor the law to keep pace and for the administering agency to adapt to \nthis growth and devote the necessary resources. As we move forward, I \nlook forward to continuing my work on comprehensive legislation to make \nthis program an efficient, more productive, and permanent part of our \nimmigration law. We have already seen many instances of the way in \nwhich this program can harness together many individual investments to \ndo big things in many communities. But the law can and will benefit \nfrom some improvement in the coming months, and I stand ready to work \nwith any Senators who recognize the value and potential of this \nprogram.\n  Our immigration law provides 10,000 visas each year for this program. \nWhen this program reaches the point at which it is fully subscribed, \nbased on the minimum required investment amount and the statutory job \ncreation requirement, it has the potential to direct $5 billion in \nforeign capital investment into American communities each year, with \nthe potential for the creation of 100,000 American jobs. And that \ncalculation does not take into account the domestic capital that can be \nattracted when projects are capitalized and carried out through this \nprogram or the ancillary benefits that communities experience when \nlocal economies are strengthened, nor does it account for the \nimmeasurable contributions that new Americans make to our communities \nacross the country every day.\n  We all recognize the need to take steps to do whatever we can to spur \nour economy and create jobs for American citizens. I have no doubt that \nthe action taken unanimously by the Senate on August 3 and the decisive \naction taken by the House of Representatives today to complete the \nlegislative process on this bill will help us meet this shared goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/13/senate-section/article/S6335-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             2012 OLYMPIANS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, every 4 years families across the United \nStates and around the world come together as summer begins to wind to a \nclose to watch as supremely gifted athletes from across the globe \nshowcase their talents in peaceful competition. The many thrilling \nmoments that comprise this 16-day span are both awe-inspiring and \nriveting, and I congratulate each of the athletes who competed in the \n2012 Olympic games in London for their effort, sacrifice and \ncompetitive spirit. Being an Olympian is a tremendous feat and is the \nproduct of a relentless commitment to intense, event-specific training, \ncoupled with the drive, determination, and perseverance to excel. These \nevents and these athletes captured our imagination, and once again, \nreminded us that achievement is limited only by our will and our \naudacity to dream big.\n  Representing their country in London is an experience these athletes \nwill cherish for a lifetime. They leave with new bonds and new \nfriendships borne of mutual respect. London was a welcoming and \ngracious host for these athletes, their family and friends, as well as \nthe multitudes of fans that witnessed these enthralling sporting events \nfirsthand. The venues were breathtaking, and the opening and closing \nceremony was a feast for the senses, taking us on a splendid journey \nthrough history and foreshadowing what was to come. I, along with many \nacross Michigan, applaud their effort.\n  There were many firsts at these games. For the first time, a woman \nwas a member of every Olympic delegation, including a Saudi Arabian \nwoman competing bravely for her home country. The London games also \nfeatured the debut of women's boxing. It was particularly gratifying to \nwatch a Flint Northwestern High School student earn the first gold \nmedal in Women's Boxing for the United States. The poise, quickness and \ngrit of Flint native Claressa Shield displayed en route to her victory \nwas a delight to watch. There was also Oscar Pistorius, a bold and \ngraceful athlete who has overcome many obstacles to compete alongside \nable-bodied athletes as peers.\n  And none of us will forget Michael Phelps, who followed up his \nbrilliance in Athens with another dramatic and impressive performance \nin London, solidifying his place among the greatest Olympians of all \ntime. The medal total for this Michigan Wolverine is astonishing--22 \nOlympic medals, 18 of them gold.\n  Nor will we forget the passion and spunk of the ``Fierce Five'', led \nby DeWitt's own Jordyn Weiber. Jordyn experienced a range of emotion at \nthese games, from the high of winning the team gold in gymnastics for \nthe United States to disappointment of falling just short of \nqualifying, by the narrowest of margin, for the highly coveted \nindividual All-Around title. Her grace in both victory and \ndisappointment set a fine example for aspiring young gymnasts.\n  And there was two-time Olympian Allison Schmitt, who earned three \ngold medals in swimming to increase her lifetime Olympic medal total to \nsix.\n  As evidenced by these and other impressive performances, Michigan was \nwell-represented in London. Impressively, 30 athletes with strong ties \nto Michigan competed in these games, including Chas Betts in wrestling, \nTia Brooks in track, Tyler Clary in swimming, Ellis Coleman in \nwrestling, Desiree Davila in track, Geena Gall in track, Jake Herbert \nin wrestling, Charlie Houchin in swimming, Connor Jaeger in swimming, \nKara Lynn Joyce in swimming, Ken Jurkowski in rowing, Justin Lester in \nwrestling, Spenser Mango in wrestling, Sam Mikulak in gymnastics, Brett \nNewlin in rowing, Jamie Nieto in track, Tom Peszek in rowing, Jeff \nPorter in track, Ben Provisor in wrestling, Dathan Ritzenhein in track, \nDaryl Szarenski in shooting, Davis Tarwater in swimming, Sarah \nTrowbridge in rowing, Peter Vanderkaay in swimming, Lauryn Williams in \ntrack, and Sarah Zelenka in rowing.\n  In addition to these outstanding American athletes, Michiganians \nproudly witnessed a number of talented athletes from other nations with \nstrong ties to Michigan compete in these games, including Eric \nAlejandro in track, Bradley Ally in swimming, George Bovell in \nswimming, Nate Brannen in track, Syque Caesar in gymnastics, Milorad \nCavic in swimming, Franklin Gomez in wrestling, Janine Hanson in \nrowing, Barry Murphy in swimming, Wu Peng in swimming, Krista Phillips \nin basketball, Tiffany Porter in track, Nicole Sifuentes in track, and \nNick Willis in track.\n  The joy and excitement on the faces of these fine athletes as they \nfulfilled their dream to compete against the best in the world was \ninfectious. Their determination was searing. Watching them compete in a \ngracious way as the world tuned in reminds us of what is possible. They \nnavigated cultural differences, overcame language barriers and set \naside historical disputes to engage in fair, peaceful competition. \nWhile it is in many ways symbolic, it is nonetheless significant. It \nreminds us all that we are a human family and that respect and dignity \nis deserved for all.\n  Barbara and I are honored to salute the many athletes with ties to \nMichigan who competed in London. Their hard work was evident; their \nskill was exquisite; and the competition that resulted was fascinating \nto watch. The inspiring example of excellence these athletes have put \nforth will not soon be forgotten. In homes across our State, young \npeople are working a little harder, setting their goals a little higher \nand aspiring to equal or exceed the athletic prowess displayed in \nLondon time and time again. Our future is a little brighter as a result \nof each of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/13/senate-section/article/S6335-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6335-S6336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WORLD WAR II VETERANS\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, On September 23, nearly 100 World War II \nveterans from Montana will be visiting our Nation's Capital.\n  With a great deal of honor and respect, I extend a hearty Montana \nwelcome to each and every one of them.\n  Together, they will visit the World War II Memorial and share stories \nabout their service. This journey will\n\n[[Page S6336]]\n\nno doubt bring about a lot of memories. I hope it will give them a deep \nsense of pride also.\n  What they achieved together almost 70 years ago was remarkable. That \nmemorial is a testament to the fact that a grateful nation will never \nforget what they did nor what they sacrificed. To us, they were the \ngreatest generation. They left the comforts of their family and their \ncommunities to confront evil from Iwo Jima to Bastogne. Together, they \nwon the war in the Pacific by conquering an empire and liberated a \ncontinent by defeating Hitler and the Nazis.\n  To them, they were simply doing their jobs. They enlisted in \nunprecedented numbers to defend our freedoms and our values. They \nrepresented the very best of us and made us proud.\n  From a young age I remember playing the bugle at the memorial \nservices of veterans of the first two world wars.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate one of \nmy home State's local leaders in charitable giving, the Nevada \nCommunity Foundation, on obtaining its National Standards for U.S. \nCommunity Foundations accreditation from the Community Foundations \nNational Standards Board.\n  The Foundation's commitment to the highest philanthropic standards \nfor operational quality, integrity, and accountability has continuously \nprovided the citizens of southern Nevada with invaluable services and \nleadership in their neighborhoods.\n  In the fall of 1988, the Nevada Community Foundation was incorporated \nas the first community foundation of Nevada. Designed to be a center of \nphilanthropy for Nevada, the foundation is dedicated to improving the \nlives of current and future generations of southern Nevadans. By \nencouraging philanthropy, providing leadership, and promoting grant \nlending, the Nevada Community Foundation has worked tirelessly to meet \nthe needs of southern Nevada. The foundation is committed to supporting \nlocal services, including education, social services, health, arts and \nculture, and the environment.\n  Serving the southern region of the Silver State for more than 24 \nyears, the Nevada Community Foundation has remained a trusted \nphilanthropic partner and champion for community investment. I applaud \nthe Foundation's values of community, humility, and stewardship that \nhave helped to enrich our communities and hope that they serve as an \nexample for others within the state.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Nevada \nCommunity Foundation on receiving its National Standards accreditation. \nOn behalf of the residents of southern Nevada, I congratulate the \nNevada Community foundation on this accomplishment and commend the \nfoundation's dedication to my home State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/13/senate-section/article/S6336-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. McCathran, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/13/senate-section/article/S6336-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/13/senate-section/article/S6336-4", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:55 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3857.

A bill to encourage the adoption and use of certified \nelectronic health record technology by safety net providers and \nclinics; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nof 2009, ARRA, provided Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments to \nproviders that adopt and meaningfully use electronic health records, \nEHRs, in their practices. While this program has helped thousands of \nproviders, practices, and hospitals nationwide, many safety net \nproviders and clinics have not been able to benefit from the Medicaid \nEHR incentives.\n  Safety net providers serve as a critical entry point into the health \ncare system, and provide essential health care services for millions of \nlow-income, uninsured and underinsured individuals. Given that Medicaid \neligibility levels are so low in many States, it is difficult for many \nsafety net providers to meet the 30 percent Medicaid threshold required \nto participate in the Medicaid EHR incentive program even though their \npatients are predominately low-income. Congress addressed this problem \nonly for practitioners working in federally-qualified health centers \nand rural health centers by creating a 30 percent ``needy'' threshold \nin ARRA for those providers. Unfortunately, ARRA fails to provide a \nsimilar standard for other providers serving low-income individuals.\n  The Medicaid Information Technology to Enhance Community Health, \nMITECH, Act of 2012 seeks to eliminate the barriers that prevent safety \nnet providers from qualifying from Medicaid EHR incentives. \nSpecifically, it would expand eligibility for meaningful use incentives \nto providers that practice predominantly in a qualified safety net \nclinic, QSNC. The act defines a QSNC as a clinic or network of clinics \nthat is operated by a private non-profit or public entity and that has \nat least 30 percent of its patient volume attributable to needy \nindividuals. The act also directs the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to develop a methodology to allow these clinics to be eligible \nfor meaningful use payments as an entity, similar to the current \nprocess that exists for hospitals.\n  I would like to thank the 13 national organizations who have been \nintegral to the development of this legislation and who have endorsed \nit today, including the Association of State and Territorial Health \nOfficials, the HIV Medicine Association, Mental Health America, the \nNational Association of Public Hospitals, the National Family Planning \nand Reproductive Health Association, and the Trust for America's \nHealth.\n  The MITECH Act will allow safety net clinics to better communicate \nwith patients about necessary screenings, help ensure compliance with \nprescription drugs, and will strengthen the safety net which provides \nessential care to so many Americans. It is my hope that we can move \nforward with this bill in a bipartisan manner. I ask all of my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Franken):\n  S. 3545. A bill to amend title 11 of the United States Code to \nclarify the rule allowing discharge as a nonpriority claim of \ngovernmental claims arising from the disposition of farm assets under \nchapter 12 bankruptcies; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Franken, the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Tax Clarification Act of \n2012. This bill addresses the recent United States Supreme Court case \nHall v. United States. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the \nprovision I inserted into the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and \nConsumer Protection Act did not accomplish what we intended. The Family \nFarmer Bankruptcy Tax Clarification Act of 2012 corrects this and \nclarifies that bankrupt family farmers reorganizing their debts are \nable to treat capital gains taxes owed to a governmental unit, arising \nfrom the sale of farm assets during a bankruptcy, as general unsecured \nclaims. This bill will remove the Internal Revenue Service's veto power \nover a bankruptcy reorganization plan's confirmation, giving the family \nfarmer a chance to reorganize successfully.\n  In 1986 Congress enacted Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code to provide \na specialized bankruptcy process for family farmers. In 2005 Chapter 12 \nwas made permanent. Between 1986 and 2005 we learned what aspects \nworked and did not work for family farmers reorganizing in bankruptcy. \nOne problematic area was where a family farmer needed to sell assets in \norder to generate cash for the reorganization. Specifically, a family \nfarmer would have to sell portions of the farm to generate cash to fund \na reorganization plan so that the creditors could receive payment. \nUnfortunately, in situations like this, the family farmer is selling \nland that has been owned for a very long time, with a very low cost \nbasis. Thus, when the land is sold, the family farmer is hit with a \nsubstantial capital gains tax, which is owed to the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  Under the Bankruptcy Code, taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service \nreceive priority treatment. Holders of priority claims must receive \npayment in full, unless the claim holder agrees to be treated \ndifferently. This creates problems for the family farmer who needs the \ncash to pay creditors to reorganize. However, since the Internal \nRevenue Service has the ability to require full payment, they hold veto \npower over a plan's confirmation, which means in many instances the \nplan will not be confirmed. This does not make sense if the goal is to \ngive the family farmer a fresh start. Thus, in 2005 Congress said that \nin these limited situations, the taxes owed to the Internal Revenue \nService could be treated as general, unsecured debt. This removed the \ngovernment's veto power over plan confirmation and paved the way for \nfamily farmers to reorganize successfully.\n  However, in Hall v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that \ndespite Congress's express goal of helping family farmers, the language \ninserted into the Bankruptcy Code in 2005 conflicted with the Tax Code. \nThe Hall case was one of statutory interpretation. There is no question \nwhat Congress was trying to do; rather, did Congress use the\n\n[[Page S6343]]\n\ncorrect language? My goal, along with others at the time, was to \nrelieve family farmers from having their reorganization plans fail \nbecause of huge tax liabilities to the federal government. Justice \nBreyer noted this in the dissent: ``Congress was concerned about the \neffect on the farmer of collecting capital gains tax debts that arose \nduring (and were connected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings themselves. \n. . . The majority does not deny the importance of Congress' objective. \nRather, it feels compelled to hold that Congress put the Amendment in \nthe wrong place.'' Hall v. United States, 132 S.Ct. 1882, 1897, 2012, \nBreyer, J., dissenting, internal citations and quotations omitted.\n  As a result of the Hall case, family farmers facing bankruptcy now \nfind themselves caught in an unfortunate situation. The rules have \nchanged and must be corrected in order to provide certainty and clarity \nin the law. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Tax Clarification Act of 2012 \nwill provide the clarity needed to help family farmers reorganize in \nbankruptcy.\n  This bill strikes the current language in the Bankruptcy Code, which \nthe Supreme Court said does not work, 11 U.S.C. Sec. 1222(a)(2)(A) and \ninserts a new 11 U.S.C. Sec. 1222(a)(5). The new provision transforms \nall government claims arising as a result of the sale or transfer of \npost-petition farm assets into unsecured, non-priority claims, \nnotwithstanding any language in the Internal Revenue Code to the \ncontrary. The bill also provides new sections for treatment of these \nclaims during the bankruptcy process. The bill recognizes that some \nasset sales may occur post-confirmation. As a result, we also provide a \nmechanism for plan modification as a result of these sales, if used for \nthe specified purpose of reorganization, to assist in reorganization. \nFinally, we make a technical change to 11 U.S.C. Sec. 1228(a), which \npractitioners and commentators have long argued is needed. This \ntechnical change is within the limited scope of this clarification \nbill, as it provides greater certainty and clarity that has troubled \ncourts and practitioners alike.\n  I recognize the end of this session of Congress is near and the time \nto do something is short. However, we have been fine tuning this \nlegislation to ensure it properly corrects the Hall case. We will seek \nto do what we can during the remaining Congressional calendar to fix \nthe problem this year. Should we run out of time, then we will maintain \nour focus on this problem into the next year. The Family Farmer \nBankruptcy Tax Clarification Act of 2012 ensures that what Congress \nsought to do in 2005 actually occurs. In the wake of the Hall decision, \nclarification is needed to help ensure family farmers facing bankruptcy \nwill have a chance to reorganize successfully.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3545\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981 to clarify \nprovisions enacted by the Captive Wildlife Safety Act, to further the \nconservation of certain wildlife species, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Big Cats and \nPublic Safety Protection Act to protect public safety, improve animal \nwelfare, assist international big cat conservation, and to help clarify \nthe existing patchwork of current state regulation. This is a companion \nfor legislation previously introduced in the House by Representatives \nHoward McKeon and Loretta Sanchez. Amazingly, it is unknown even how \nmany big cats such as lions, cougars, leopards, and cheetahs live or \nare bred in private possession in the United States. This bill would \nprevent the private possession and breeding of big cats, while still \nallowing properly accredited zoos and wildlife sanctuaries to continue \nto operate in the critical conservation and animal welfare roles that \nthey occupy today.\n  Why is this legislation so important? First, this is a public safety \nissue, which was made tragically clear almost a year ago in Zanesville, \nOhio, when the owner of a backyard zoo opened the cages of his tigers, \nleopards, lions, wolves, bears, and monkeys before killing himself. \nWild animals were literally roaming the streets where children were \nplaying and people were going about their daily lives. Sadly, the \nsituation gave police no choice but to shoot and kill almost 50 \nanimals, including 38 big cats, before they could enter populated \nareas. Public safety officials were, understandably, not trained or \nequipped to deal with large exotic animals especially 300 pound tigers. \nThis tragedy should serve as a chilling wakeup call about our lack of \nsafeguards around large, wild species being kept as pets. In the past \n11 years in the United States, incidents involving captive big cats \nhave resulted in the deaths of 21 people, 16 adults and 5 children. \nDuring the same time period,\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n\nthere have been 246 maulings, 253 escapes, 143 big cat deaths, and 128 \nconfiscations.\n  This is also an animal welfare issue. Research shows that the captive \nbig cat community is characterized by a systemic culture of inhumane \nmistreatment of the animals. One major reason for this is that once \nindividual big cats have outgrown the infancy stage when they are most \nprofitable, they are often warehoused in terrible conditions. Because \nprivate ownership is allowed to continue, many sanctuaries for \nmistreated or unwanted big cats are at or nearing capacity and lack \nfinancial reserves to provide greater assistance. The recent closure of \na major sanctuary in Texas that had over 50 big cats has made matters \nworse.\n  Third, this is a matter of conservation. Tigers, for example, are \nextremely endangered by poaching and trade, and illegal tiger products \ncontinue to be smuggled into the U.S. from foreign countries. One of \nthe biggest threats to wild tigers is the demand for tiger parts and \nproducts, and leakage of captive tiger parts and products into the \nillegal market continues to encourage demand, perpetuating poaching and \nthreatening remaining wild populations.\n  Finally, this bill will address the current patchwork state \nregulation. There are still two states that have no regulations or \npermits at all regarding private ownership of exotic animals including \nbig cats. Seven other States have little to no regulations of private \nownership of exotic animals including big cats. Another 14 states allow \nbig cat possession only with a state permit, and 27 states and the \nDistrict of Columbia have enacted full bans on private ownership of big \ncats, though all of those exempt federally-licensed exhibitors. Given \nthe risks I have already outlined, this kind of regulatory patchwork is \nsimply unacceptable and could be dangerous.\n  I believe that the Big Cats and Public Safety Protection Act will \nhelp ensure that lions, tigers, and other potentially dangerous big \ncats do not threaten public safety, harm global conservation efforts, \nor end up living in squalid conditions where they are subject to \nmistreatment and cruelty.\n  A number of organizations are supportive of this bill, including the \nInternational Fund for Animal Welfare, the Humane Society of the United \nStates, Born Free USA, Big Cat Rescue, the Animal Welfare Institute, \nand the World Wildlife Foundation.\n  I would like to recognize Senators Lieberman, Sanders, and Blumenthal \nas original cosponsors of this bill. I look forward to continued \nprogress in enhancing the protection and conservation of wild big cats \nand in increasing public safety from the dangers of these untamed \nanimals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 3548. A bill to clarify certain provisions of the Native American \nVeterans Memorial Establishment Act of 1994; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on Indian \nAffairs, I am introducing legislation to make technical corrections to \nthe National Native American Veterans' Memorial Act of 1994.\n  The 1994 Act honors the profound contributions of Native Veterans by \nauthorizing the construction of a National Native American Veterans' \nMemorial. Unfortunately, technical issues with the law have made it \ndifficult to move forward with the Memorial. The bill I am introducing \ntoday seeks to alleviate those obstacles.\n  My legislation would make technical corrections in order to allow the \nNational Museum of American Indian to join the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians in the fundraising efforts for the Memorial. In \naddition, my bill would allow the Memorial to be constructed on the \nproperty provided for by the National Museum of American Indian Act.\n  Per capita, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians \nserve at a higher rate in the Armed Forces than any other group of \nAmericans. Native peoples have served in all of the Nation's wars since \nthe Revolutionary War. A memorial in their honor is well-deserved and \nlong overdue.\n  My non-controversial, no cost, technical amendments bill will make it \neasier to construct the authorized memorial to honor our Native \nVeterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/13/senate-section/article/S6344-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 554--CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S \nREPUBLIC OF CHINA TO FACILITATE THE IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE \n                OF GAO ZHISHENG, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Cornyn) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Res. 557\n\n       Whereas Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari, who was born in Nyarong, Kham \n     in 1949, was recognized according to Tibetan Buddhist \n     tradition as a reincarnate lama and began his monastic \n     studies at 4 years of age in Lhumorhab Monastery, which was \n     located in what is now Kardze Prefecture, Sichuan Province;\n       Whereas, in 1958, 9-year-old Lodi Gyari fled Nyarong with \n     his family to avoid pursuit by the Chinese People's \n     Liberation Army and was said to have led his group to safety \n     in India through prayer and divinations;\n       Whereas Lodi Gyari, as a young man in India, began a \n     career-long commitment to the Tibetan struggle against \n     Chinese oppression in Tibet, becoming editor for the Tibetan \n     Freedom Press, founder of the Tibetan Review, the first \n     English language journal published by Tibetans in exile, and \n     a founding member of the Tibetan Youth Congress;\n       Whereas Lodi Gyari served as a civil servant in the Central \n     Tibetan Administration of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, as \n     Chairman of the Tibetan Parliament in exile, and as a Deputy \n     Cabinet Minister for the Departments of Religious Affairs and \n     Health and Cabinet Minister for the Department of Information \n     and International Relations;\n       Whereas, in 1991, Lodi Gyari moved to the United States in \n     the capacity of Special Envoy of His Holiness the Dalai Lama \n     and was soon after selected to be President of the \n     International Campaign for Tibet;\n       Whereas, for 3 decades Lodi Gyari has met with leaders and \n     diplomats of governments around the world and with Members of \n     the United States Congress and parliaments of other nations--\n       (1) to explain the Tibetan position with regard to \n     engagement with China;\n       (2) to urge supportive strategies and policies from \n     governments;\n       (3) to explain the Dalai Lama's ``Middle Way'' philosophy \n     of seeking genuine autonomy for Tibet within the People's \n     Republic of China that contributes to harmony between the \n     Tibetan and Chinese peoples; and\n       (4) to promote Tibetan statecraft as the Dalai Lama's \n     senior ambassador-at-large;\n       Whereas, during his time as Special Envoy based in \n     Washington, D.C., Congress approved many policy and \n     programmatic measures on Tibet, which served to \n     institutionalize the Tibet issue within the Government of the \n     United States, most notably the establishment of a Special \n     Coordinator on Tibetan Issues within the Department of State \n     and support for Tibetan refugees;\n       Whereas, in 1999, Lodi Gyari became a United States \n     citizen;\n       Whereas in May 1998, His Holiness the Dalai Lama authorized \n     Special Envoy Lodi Gyari to be the principal person to \n     reestablish contact with the Chinese government on the \n     Tibetan issue;\n       Whereas, between September 2002 and January 2010, Lodi \n     Gyari led the Dalai Lama's negotiating team in 9 formal \n     rounds of meetings with Chinese officials with tireless drive \n     and immense skill, winning the respect of the international \n     community;\n       Whereas Lodi Gyari presented the Chinese government with \n     the Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy for the Tibetan People and \n     its accompanying Note, thus detailing the Tibetan side's \n     vision for a political solution for Tibet consistent within \n     the framework of the Chinese constitutional and laws on \n     autonomy;\n       Whereas Lodi Gyari, in service to the Dalai Lama, came to \n     represent in national capitals around the world, the great \n     hope and conviction that the rights of Tibetans could be \n     protected and their repression could be ended.\n       Whereas, in the personally and professionally difficult \n     task of representing Tibetan interests in dialogue with the \n     People's Republic of China, Lodi Gyari demonstrated spirit, \n     intelligence, and extraordinary tact, and brought civility, \n     reason and a measure of mutual understanding to the Tibetan-\n     Chinese relationship;\n       Whereas Lodi Gyari has credited the far-sighted wisdom of \n     His Holiness the Dalai Lama in empowering the Tibetan people \n     by his devolution of his political authority to an elected \n     Tibetan leadership; and\n       Whereas, Lodi Gyari resigned his position, effective June \n     1, 2012, in the context of the deteriorating situation inside \n     Tibet, including increasing incidents of Tibetan self-\n     immolations, and expressing deep frustration over the lack of \n     positive response from the Chinese side in their nearly 10-\n     year dialogue, and in respect for the process of the \n     devolution of political power to the elected Tibetan leaders.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the service of Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari as Special \n     Envoy of His Holiness the Dalai Lama;\n       (2) commends the achievements of Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari in \n     building an international coalition of support for Tibet that \n     recognizes--\n       (A) the imperative to preserve the distinct culture and \n     religious traditions of Tibet; and\n\n[[Page S6346]]\n\n       (B) that the Tibetan people are entitled under \n     international law to their own identity and dignity and \n     genuine autonomy within the People's Republic of China that \n     fully preserves the rights and dignity of the Tibetan people;\n       (3) acknowledges the role of Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari, as a \n     naturalized United States citizen, to promoting understanding \n     in the United States of the Tibetan people, their culture and \n     religion, and their struggle for genuine autonomy, human \n     rights, dignity, and the preservation of unique linguistic, \n     cultural, and religious traditions; and\n       (4) strongly supports a political solution for Tibet within \n     the People's Republic of China that satisfies the legitimate \n     grievances and aspirations of the Tibetan people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/13/senate-section/article/S6346-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 558--CONGRATULATING THE ATHLETES FROM THE STATE OF \n NEVADA AND THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE 2012 \n OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES AS MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES OLYMPIC \n                          AND PARALYMPIC TEAMS\n\n  Mr. REID of Nevada submitted the following resolution;

In\n  the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any subsequent\n  application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed\n  labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and\n  decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that\n  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject\n  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was\n  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's\n  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not\n  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the\n  new active ingredient or first food use application. (3) Where the action involves approval of a new or\n  amended label, on or before the end date of the decision review time, the Agency shall provide to the\n  applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by the Agency that differ from the applicant-\n  submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency. The applicant will notify the Agency that\n  the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with the draft accepted label as amended by the\n  Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one\n  or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests additional time to\n  resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but\n  forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases described in (b), the applicant shall have up to\n  30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the\n  applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as in (a), including upon resolution of differences\n  in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-stamped label to the registrant within 2 business\n  days following the registrant's written or electronic confirmation of agreement to the Agency.\n\n\n                               ``TABLE 4. -- REGISTRATION DIVISION -- NEW PRODUCTS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                    Registration\n     EPA No.         New CR No.                      Action                      Decision Review     Service Fee\n                                                                                Time (Months) (1)        ($)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nR300              44               New product; or similar combination         4                           1,434\n                                    product (already registered) to an\n                                    identical or substantially similar in\n                                    composition and use to a registered\n                                    product; registered source of active\n                                    ingredient; no data review on acute\n                                    toxicity, efficacy or CRP - only product\n                                    chemistry data; cite-all data citation,\n                                    or selective data citation where\n                                    applicant owns all required data, or\n                                    applicant submits specific authorization\n                                    letter from data owner.

The\n  application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of\n  five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is\n  submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to\n  the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that\n  are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time. In\n  the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any subsequent\n  application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed\n  labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and\n  decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that\n  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject\n  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was\n  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's\n  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not\n  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the\n  new active ingredient or first food use application.\n(3) If EPA data rules are amended to newly require clearance under section 408 of the FFDCA for an ingredient of\n  an antimicrobial product where such ingredient was not previously subject to such a clearance, then review of\n  the data for such clearance of such product is not subject to a registration service fee for the tolerance\n  action for two years from the effective date of the rule.\n(4) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision\n  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by\n  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.\n  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with\n  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-\n  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the\n  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without\n  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases\n  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the\n  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as\n  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-\n  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic\n  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.\n(5) Amendment applications to add the new use(s) to registered product labels are covered by the base fee for\n  the new use(s). All items in the covered application must be submitted together in one package. Each\n  application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new\n  use application package is subject to the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval.\n  However, if a new use application only proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no\n  amendments in the application, then review of one new product application is covered by the new use fee. All\n  such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the new use decision review time.\n  Any application for a new product or an amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to\n  submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its decision review time and (c)\n  containing the same new uses, will be deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a separate\n  registration service fee and new decision review time for a new use. If the new-use application includes non-\n  food (indoor and/or outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is due for each type\n  of new use and the longest decision review time applies to all of the new uses requested in the application.\n  Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the\n  applicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application after completion of the technical\n  deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full\n  registration service fee for the new use application.\n\n\n                      ``TABLE 9. -- ANTIMICROBIALS DIVISION -- NEW PRODUCTS AND AMENDMENTS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                    Registration\n     EPA No.         New CR No.                      Action                      Decision Review     Service Fee\n                                                                                Time (Months) (1)        ($)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA530              84               New product; identical or substantially     4                           1,159\n                                    similar in composition and use to a\n                                    registered product; no data review or\n                                    only product chemistry data; cite-all\n                                    data citation, or selective data citation\n                                    when applicant owns all required data, or\n                                    applicant submits specific authorization\n                                    letter for data owner.

If the new-use application includes non-\n  food (indoor and/or outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is due for each type\n  of new use and the longest decision review time applies to all of the new uses requested in the application.\n  Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the\n  applicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application after completion of the technical\n  deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full\n  registration service fee for the new use application.\n\n\n   ``TABLE 13. -- BIOPESTICIDES AND POLLUTION PREVENTION DIVISION -- MICROBIAL AND BIOCHEMICAL PESTICIDES; NEW\n                                                    PRODUCTS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                    Registration\n     EPA No.         New CR No.                      Action                      Decision Review     Service Fee\n                                                                                Time (Months) (1)        ($)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nB652              118              New product; registered source of active    13                         11,577\nNew                                 ingredient; requires petition to amend\n                                    established tolerance or tolerance\n                                    exemption; requires 1) submission of\n                                    product specific data; or 2) citation of\n                                    previously reviewed and accepted data; or\n                                    3) submission or citation of data\n                                    generated at government expense; or 4)\n                                    submission or citation of scientifically-\n                                    sound rationale based on publicly\n                                    available literature or other relevant\n                                    information that addresses the data\n                                    requirement; or 5) submission of a\n                                    request for a data requirement to be\n                                    waived supported by a scientifically-\n                                    sound rationale explaining why the data\n                                    requirement does not apply (2)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nB660              119              New product; registered source of active    4                           1,159\n                                    ingredient(s); identical or substantially\n                                    similar in composition and use to a\n                                    registered product; no change in an\n                                    established tolerance or tolerance\n                                    exemption.

The\n  application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of\n  five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is\n  submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to\n  the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that\n  are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time,\n  except where the new inert approval decision review time is greater than that for the new active ingredient,\n  in which case the associated new active ingredient will be subject to the new inert approval decision review\n  time. In the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any\n  subsequent application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the\n  proposed labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee\n  and decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that\n  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject\n  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was\n  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's\n  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not\n  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the\n  new active ingredient or first food use application.\n(3) An application for a new end-use product using a source of active ingredient that (a) is not yet registered\n  but (b) has an application pending with the Agency for review, will be considered an application for a new\n  product with an unregistered source of active ingredient.\n(4) (a) EPA-initiated amendments shall not be charged registration service fees. (b) Registrant-initiated fast-\n  track amendments are to be completed within the timelines specified in FIFRA Section 3(c)(3)(B) and are not\n  subject to registration service fees. (c) Registrant-initiated fast-track amendments handled by the\n  Antimicrobials Division are to be completed within the timelines specified in FIFRA Section 3(h) and are not\n  subject to registration service fees.

(e) Submissions with data and requiring data review are subject to registration service fees.\n(5) Amendment applications to add the new use(s) to registered product labels are covered by the base fee for\n  the new use(s). All items in the covered application must be submitted together in one package. Each\n  application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new\n  use application package is subject to the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval.\n  However, if a new use application only proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no\n  amendments in the application, then review of one new product application is covered by the new use fee. All\n  such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the new use decision review time.\n  Any application for a new product or an amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to\n  submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its decision review time and (c)\n  containing the same new uses, will be deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a separate\n  registration service fee and new decision review time for a new use. If the new-use application includes non-\n  food (indoor and/or outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is due for each type\n  of new use and the longest decision review time applies to all of the new uses requested in the application.\n  Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the\n  applicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application after completion of the technical\n  deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full\n  registration service fee for the new use application.\n\n\n                   ``TABLE 16. -- BIOPESTICIDES AND POLLUTION PREVENTION DIVISION -- OTHER ACT\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                    Registration\n     EPA No.         New CR No.                      Action                      Decision Review     Service Fee\n                                                                                Time (Months) (1)        ($)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nB614              143              Conditional Ruling on Preapplication Study  3                           2,294\nNew                                 Waivers; applicant-initiated\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nB615              144              Rebuttal of agency reviewed protocol,       3                           2,294\nNew                                 applicant initiated\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[[Page S6383]]\n\n \nB682              145              Protocol review; applicant initiated;       3                           2,205\n                                    excludes time for HSRB review\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended\n  to end on the next business day.\n\n\n     ``TABLE 17. -- BIOPESTICIDES AND POLLUTION PREVENTION DIVISION -- PLANT INCORPORATED PROTECTANTS (PIPS)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                    Registration\n     EPA No.         New CR No.                      Action                      Decision Review     Service Fee\n                                                                                Time (Months) (1)        ($)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nB740              146              Experimental Use Permit application; no     6                          86,823\n                                    petition for tolerance/tolerance\n                                    exemption.

EPA often seeks technical advice from the\n  Scientific Advisory Panel on risks that pesticides pose to wildlife, farm workers, pesticide applicators, non-\n  target species, as well as insect resistance, and novel scientific issues surrounding new technologies. The\n  scientists of the SAP neither make nor recommend policy decisions. They provide advice on the science used to\n  make these decisions. Their advice is invaluable to the EPA as it strives to protect humans and the\n  environment from risks posed by pesticides. Due to the time it takes to schedule and prepare for meetings with\n  the SAP, additional time and costs are needed.\n(6) Registered PIPs stacked through conventional breeding.\n(7) Deployment of a registered PIP with a different IRM plan (e.g., seed blend).\n(8) The negotiated acreage cap will depend upon EPA's determination of the potential environmental exposure,\n  risk(s) to non-target organisms, and the risk of targeted pest developing resistance to the pesticidal\n  substance.
