Mr. President, Republican leaders in the House of \nRepresentatives wasted this week pursuing a rightwing proposal they \nknew from the start could not pass the Senate. From the very beginning, \nSpeaker Boehner's Band-Aid approach was fatally flawed. It would have \nput us back in this incredible position we are in today--debating \nwhether the debt limit should be increased, something that was \nincreased I don't know really how many times but about 19 or 20 times \nduring the Presidency of Ronald Reagan.\n  I had a little whisper to my left that said 18 times, so 19 or 20 was \nnot too bad. The Band-Aid approach the Speaker came up with was totally \nflawed. It would have put us back in this incredible position of \nfighting to increase the debt limit--something we did 18 times during \nRonald Reagan's administration. We would be fighting the clock to \nprevent financial collapse. We would start that again in just a few \nweeks.\n  The Speaker's legislation was a concession to tea party extremists. \nYet it barely passed the House yesterday with only Republican votes. It \nfailed on a bipartisan basis last night in the Senate.\n  There was an excellent article in the New York Times yesterday. The \nheadline was ``The Centrist Cop-Out.''\n\n       The facts of the crisis over the debt aren't complicated. \n     Republicans have, in effect, taken America hostage, \n     threatening to undermine the economy and disrupt the \n     essential business of government unless they get policy \n     concessions they would never have been able to enact through \n     legislation.\n\n  That is the way it is. It could not be said more clearly. But knowing \nall along that this radical legislation, which was neither balanced nor \nbipartisan, would not and could not pass in our Chamber, Democrats have \nbeen working on a true compromise in the Senate. We have solicited \nideas from our Republican friends and colleagues.\n  Let it never be said that Democrats in the Senate were afraid to \ncompromise. We would welcome compromise. As recently as yesterday, I \nasked my friend the Senate minority leader to help make this Senate \ncompromise more palatable. But we have heard very little from the \nRepublicans.\n  I am satisfied that in the conversations I have had with a couple of \nRepublicans this morning--I hope it bears fruit. I spoke to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee a short time ago. One of the proposals \npropounded by a Republican--my friend Senator Conrad is working on it \nto see if he can work it out so it is language we can all live with. \nSenator Conrad is an expert with\n\n[[Page S5090]]\n\nbudget matters. I thought it was important that he take a look at that.\n  I would have hoped, though, that someone would come to us, come to \nthe bargaining table on behalf of the Republican caucus with ideas to \nimprove a proposal already cut from the Republican cloth. Democrats are \nstill willing to sit down and negotiate. My door is still open. I say \nagain that I appreciate that several of my Republican colleagues have \nreached out to me in the last few hours hoping to reach a compromise. \nSenate Democrats welcome their input and look forward to working with \nthem on a path forward.\n  My friend the Republican leader must generate some more action on \nbehalf of his Republicans. The two parties must work together to forge \nan agreement that preserves this Nation's economy. We will need input \nfrom reasonable Republicans, including my friend the Republican leader, \nto get this done. But, unbelievably, another filibuster stands in our \npath. Republican filibusters have become routine. From the smallest \nmeasure to the greatest measure of national importance, they stall and \ndelay and use every procedural trick in the book to keep this body from \ndoing its job. But a filibuster at this late hour and when so much is \nat risk is irresponsible; it puts our economy at risk.\n  A majority vote was good enough for the Speaker's proposal in the \nHouse yesterday, but Republicans believe it is not good enough for the \nSenate today. And I have heard from my friends on the House side, to \nshow how they are gaming the system over there, that they are going to \nhave a vote on my proposal on suspensions. For those of us who served \nin the House, this is for naming courthouses and little measures that \nare of little importance. But this important matter, this matter \ndealing with the debt limit of this country, will take a two-thirds \nvote to pass. So they have gamed this system from the very beginning.\n  As I said earlier from the New York Times article:\n\n       The facts of the crisis over the debt ceiling aren't \n     complicated. Republicans have, in effect, taken America \n     hostage, threatening to undermine the economy and disrupt the \n     essential business of government unless they get policy \n     concessions they would never have been able to enact through \n     legislation.\n\n  So they are going through, as I understand, on the House side, an \neffort to vote on our legislation, setting up a two-thirds standard to \nget this done, recognizing, of course, as I will outline here in a \nminute that a filibuster at this late hour here in the Senate and when \nso much is at risk is really irresponsible, and to say it puts our \neconomy at risk is an understatement, and that is for sure. A majority \nvote was good enough for the Speaker's proposal in the House, but \nRepublicans believe it is not good enough for the Senate today.\n  Rather than filibuster, I ask my Republican colleagues to work with \nDemocrats to make our proposal better. We have offered a reasonable, \nrational way for Republicans to help us avert default.\n  But let me tell you about the legislation at issue, how we believe \nhow reasonable our legislation is.\n\n  This legislation was written by Democrats with both parties' \nprinciples in mind. It would avert default while cutting $2.5 trillion \nfrom the deficit over a decade. It includes no revenues--a concession \nto House Republicans and Senate Republicans. It establishes a joint \ncongressional committee to find additional savings this year and \nguarantees that the committee's recommendations will see an up-or-down \nvote on the Senate floor. It takes into consideration that--that \ncommittee must take into consideration proposals like the Gang of 6. \nLiterally every single spending cut has been voted on or endorsed by \nRepublicans in both Houses. That is the gist of the legislation: $2.5 \ntrillion and extending the debt ceiling until March of 2013--a pretty \nfair deal.\n  We have made some changes to this proposition. We hope it becomes \nmore amenable to Republicans. We have improved the program integrity \nlanguage to allow for more savings by combatting government waste and \nfraud.\n  We have removed a measure that would have raised revenue by selling \nthe spectrum--some $15 billion--which will be done, and we should do it \nnow, but it caused what is called a blue slip problem, which says if \nyou have any revenue measures, according to our Constitution, they have \nto originate in the House. So it presents a so-called blue slip \nproblem. I just eliminated it from this bill. It was $15 billion out of \n$2.5 trillion.\n  We also added a process conceived by my friend Senator McConnell to \nallow two additional votes over the next year and a half, two motions \nof disapproval before the President can raise the debt ceiling.\n  This proposal also protects Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid \nbenefits.\n  As you can see, this legislation was designed to appeal to our \nRepublican colleagues as well as to our Democratic colleagues. We are \nwilling to listen to ideas--I have said this several times--from \nRepublican Senators to make this proposal better. But to say the time \nis short is an understatement. We can amend the underlying legislation \nthat is here before us in the so-called message to the House. We still \nhave time to do that. We could do it tonight and we could still meet \nthe deadline on Tuesday. But we need to do it soon. That is why, at \n1:10 in the afternoon this Saturday, I hope I have more Republicans \ncontact me to see if they can work out something to work with us.\n  Already the economy has gone from bad to worse. Stocks continued a \nweeklong slide yesterday. I know my Republican colleagues love this \ncountry, every single one of them. I believe they want to do what is \nbest for our economy, every single one of them. But I have to say--and \nI say this for the third time:\n\n       The facts of the crisis over the debt ceiling aren't \n     complicated at all. Republicans have, in effect, taken \n     America hostage, threatening to undermine the economy and \n     disrupt the essential business of government unless they get \n     policy concessions they would never have been able to enact \n     through legislation.\n\n  That is why together we must avert a default that would jeopardize \nveterans' benefits, senior citizens' benefits, Social Security \npayments, and checks for troops, even troops on the front line. It \nwould also effectively raise taxes on every American family: Vermont, \nIllinois, Kentucky, Idaho, Nevada, all over this country. Oregon. All \nof the Senators on the floor. Even Wyoming, which does not pay much in \nthe way of taxes. We could do that. It would effectively raise taxes on \nevery American family. And businesses would also suffer by the increase \nin the cost of everything from groceries to their mortgages.\n  So I urge my Republican friends to join me and move forward with the \nonly compromise plan that is left--in fact, the only option left at \nall--to save this country from default.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/30/senate-section/article/S5090-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there is nobody in the Senate I respect \nand admire more than my counterpart, the Democratic leader. But we have \nbeen subjected, last night and again just a few moments ago, I would \nsay to my colleagues from Wyoming and Idaho, to some Orwellian \ndiscussion about what is a filibuster. Most Americans, when asked the \nquestion ``What is a filibuster?'' would believe it was delaying \nsomething--delaying something.\n  So we have the astonishing development here that my good friend the \nmajority leader is delaying a vote on something he wants to pass. We \nwere prepared to have this vote last night. We are prepared to have \nthis vote momentarily. We are prepared to have this vote at any point.\n  I want to disabuse my good friend of the notion that somehow it is \ngoing to pass. We just--he has not seen it yet, but we just delivered a \nletter to his office with 43 of my colleagues on it saying they are not \ngoing to vote for it. The House of Representatives is going to speak at \n2:30 on this issue. They are not going to vote for it.\n  With regard to the 60-vote threshold, let me quote my good friend the \nmajority leader:\n  March 5, 2007: ``In the Senate, it has always been the case, you need \n60 votes.''\n\n[[Page S5091]]\n\n  January 30, the same year: ``60 votes are required for just about \neverything.''\n  Now, look, we know that on controversial matters in the Senate, it \nhas for quite some time required 60 votes. So I would say again to my \nfriend, it is pretty hard to make a credible case that denying a vote \non your own proposal is anything other than a filibuster.\n  We know that August 2 is Tuesday. The American people are frustrated \nwith us. They want us to come together and reach an agreement. The \nmeasure my good friend is offering is not acceptable to the Senate, is \nnot acceptable to the House, will not pass. I think the American people \nwould appreciate it if we go on and get that out of the way and get \nserious about talking.\n  With regard to talking, let me say who ought to be in the talks. The \nmajority leader, myself, the Speaker, and the minority leader of the \nHouse spent most of last weekend talking to each other. In fact, we \nwere called down to the White House for a meeting around 11 o'clock on \nthat Saturday, and I suggested the President give us a chance to go up \nto the Hill and see what we could work out together. We came close \nenough together to where my good friend, the majority leader--while I \nunderstand he believes he didn't fully endorse it but at least went \ndown there to advocate what we thought we could agree to on that Sunday \nafternoon. The President said no.\n  I became convinced that even though my friend, the majority leader, \nand I would love to work this out, we can't do it by ourselves. It has \nto have the only person who can sign something into law. There are 307 \nmillion Americans, but only 1 can sign something into law.\n  My suggestion to my good friend, the majority leader, is let's vote \non his proposal. It is not going to pass. Let's get to talking to the \nadministration again in the hopes that we can come together behind \nsomething that can pass both the Senate and the House and be signed \ninto law before Tuesday.\n  I don't blame anybody for being confused about what has been going on \nin Congress this week. I will take a moment to explain what is going on \nright now.\n  Last night, the Democrats, who control the Senate, proposed a bill \nthat would lead to the largest debt ceiling increase in the history of \nthe United States and which completely ignores the roots of this \ncrisis. This bill has one goal: to get the President through his next \nelection without having to have another national debate about the \nconsequences of his policies. The President wants to make sure this \nkind of debate doesn't happen again, even as he gets Democrats in \nCongress to give him permission to add trillions more to the debt. That \nis what the Reid bill does. It is not going anywhere, as I described. \nIt will not pass the Senate. It will not pass the House. It is simply a \nnonstarter.\n  Senate Republicans refuse to go along with this transparently \npolitical and deeply irresponsible ploy to give the President cover to \nmake our debt crisis even worse than it already is. Forty-three of us, \nas I indicated, have now signed a letter to the majority leader \npledging that we will not vote for his $2.4 trillion debt limit \namendment, which, if enacted, would result in the single largest debt \nceiling increase in the history of the United States.\n  Moreover, as I indicated earlier, we will soon know with certainty \nthat this bill can't pass the House of Representatives, as they will be \nvoting on it shortly.\n  Since there is no possibility this bill will be enacted into law, I \nsay again to my friend that he can hold the vote on his proposal here \nand now. We are ready at any point to go on and have that vote and not \nwaste another minute of the Nation's time on this reckless piece of \nlegislation we know will not pass.\n  Earlier this week, the majority leader told the Speaker of the House \nhe was wasting the Nation's time by proceeding with a bill Senate \nDemocrats pledged to block, which the majority leader himself helped \nput together but which he decided to oppose, as I indicated, after the \nPresident said he didn't like it.\n  The question now is this: Why would my friend, the majority leader, \nwaste the Nation's time by refusing to vote on his own bill--his own \nbill--which we also know will fail? Why would he not take his own \nadvice and get it over with? The answer seems to be obvious. The \nDemocrats are running out the clock. They want to delay the hard work \nof negotiation until the August 2 deadline they have been warning us \nabout all summer.\n  The Democrats' entire strategy this particular week, since last \nSunday, has been to run out the clock so the Nation focuses more on the \nAugust 2 deadline than their own failure to do something about the \nunderlying problem.\n  Republicans have now passed two pieces of legislation that would put \nus on a path to fiscal sanity--not one but two have passed the House of \nRepresentatives. Democrats spent the last few weeks figuring out how to \navoid that particular bill.\n  Democrats have spent their time talking about the tea party instead \nof talking about a solution. They have done absolutely nothing but \nstand in the way of a meaningful solution to this crisis and criticize \nRepublicans for having the audacity to suggest we might try to balance \nthe books.\n  Now we are reduced to this. They would not even allow a vote on their \nown bill. They are delaying the inevitable so they can avoid doing \nanything responsible. It is simply indefensible.\n  Once again, I ask my good friend the majority leader to let us vote \non his legislation. Let's get this irresponsible bill that we know will \nfail up for a vote so we can get down to the real work of negotiating a \nsolution to the crisis with, as I indicated, the only person in America \nwho can sign something into law, the President of the United States.\n  The lesson from last weekend is, anything two parties agree to here \ndoesn't mean a thing if the President decides he doesn't like it and \nthat the Democrats will abandon their own agreements if the President \ndoesn't support them. Look, I don't blame them. I have been leader in \nthe party when we had a Republican President. It is a tough spot. One \nis not a free agent. But we don't have time to go through that again. \nWe have a couple days to work this out, and we cannot do it without the \nPresident.\n  Republicans have proposed solution after solution to this crisis. It \nis time for our friends on the other side, including the President of \nthe United States, to figure out how we are going to come together and \nsolve this problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe my distinguished Republican friend \nmust be a little bit confused because he is usually totally logical. He \ntells the American people this morning he was called to the White House \nlast week and said: Mr. President, let us do the deal, and now he is \ntelling the President he wants the President to do the deal. That is \nsomewhat illogical.\n  I wish to make sure everybody in the Senate understands clearly that \nwhen negotiations took place last Sunday, in a meeting between Leader \nPelosi, me, the Speaker, and Senator McConnell, we tried very hard to \nwork something out. But everyone should understand, when we left that \nmeeting, we did not have anything worked out. We had nothing worked \nout. They were focusing on a 6-month extension, trying to come up with \na trigger for the joint committee, which we have never been able to \naccomplish.\n  It is OK they keep talking about an agreement the President \noverruled, but the President cannot overrule an agreement we don't \nhave.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will my friend yield on that?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Then it proves my case, if that is the case. We cannot \nreach an agreement without the President. We tried to. I will concede \nthe point. My friend says he didn't actually agree to that. I take his \nword for it. But it makes my point that there simply is no way, under \nour constitutional system, for my friend and I to work this out. We \nhave to have the President at the table. I think the approach we tried \nlast weekend--we both agree it did not lead to an agreement.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the President of the United States, in the \npresence of Senator McConnell, Senator\n\n[[Page S5092]]\n\nDurbin, Senator Kyl, and the House leaders, said to all of us: No \nPresident in history has spent as much time as I have on a compliant \nbasis--meaning with leaders--trying to come up with some effort on this \nbudget problem we are having today. The President has spent hours, \ndays, and weeks of his time working on this. As we know, he believed he \nhad--as I understand it--two tentative agreements with the Speaker. The \nSpeaker backed out of both of those.\n  The President--and I have not spoken to him this morning, but I did \nseveral times yesterday--is willing to work with anybody who can give \nhim a proposal. That is my point today. As I said earlier--a letter is \ncoming, terrific--I have not received it yet, but I am sure it is \ncoming. The Republicans say they will not vote for my legislation. What \nwill they vote for? Do they have any ideas? Let me know. I will be \nhappy to work it in. We have gone so far as to even accept the \nRepublican bill we got from the House as a shell. Nobody has to worry \nabout it being my bill. If we work something out, it will be the \nBoehner bill, if that makes everyone happy.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If my friend will yield, I think the answer is a bill \nthe President agrees to sign. That is what we were trying to achieve \nlast weekend. We don't have time to ping-pong stuff across the Hill \nanymore.\n  I think the majority leader and I are probably in basic agreement \nthat, with 2 days left, the only legislation Congress has time to deal \nwith, and should deal with, is something the President says he is \nwilling to sign. I am certainly not critical of the President for not \nspending time on this. He has spent enormous time on it. But we have \nnot gotten a result yet.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are here dealing with reality, not a \nworld of fantasy. We are dealing with reality. The reality is, the debt \nceiling is fast approaching, and we have to raise it or default on our \ndebt. We have a matter before this body that would increase the debt \nceiling until March of 2013. It would reduce the debt by $2.4 trillion \non basically issues that the Republicans voted on. They talk about, I \ndon't think we need to do the overseas contingency fund because the \nwars that were started--and still going on--by President Bush cost a \nlot of money, trillions of dollars. The Congressional Budget Office and \nthe Office of Management and Budget have said those wars are winding \ndown. As a result of that, we will save $1 trillion. They have scored \nit. That is a reduction in our debt.\n  I also think that if the Republicans have some way they want to \nimprove my legislation, please let somebody know. If they don't want to \ncall me, call the President of the United States. But we have to work \nforward. Mine is the only proposal we have. If mine passes, we will \ncontinue to push this because it should pass because it is the only \nproposal we have left.\n  My friend says let us vote. We say the same thing. Let us vote. We \nwant to vote. Why in the world, on something as important as this, \ncan't we have an up-or-down vote as they had in the House? To underline \nmy point, my friend, the assistant Democratic leader, the whip, served \nin the House longer than I did. They are taking up over there today, as \nI understand it, what we call a consent calendar, which are issues that \nare of minor importance, no controversy whatsoever. They are taking up \nextending the debt ceiling on that calendar. I think that is unheard \nof.\n  We are willing to vote right now, but 60 votes we are not willing to \ntake because this should not be filibustered. We are not going to agree \nto the 6-month proposal because, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, \nthat would mean we would be back in this mess in a matter of weeks. We \nwant to be fully engaged.\n  I repeat to the people who are supposedly sending me this letter, \nwhat do you want? What do I say to my caucus because my Republican \ncolleagues haven't come up with any alternative. It is easy to do. We \ncan amend my legislation. In the meantime, that will not happen, and we \nare going to proceed forward and do the best we can to overcome this \nfilibuster.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will wrap up my comments by pointing \nout again the comments from my good friend, the majority leader, about \nthe nature of the Senate. He said it has always been the case that we \nneed 60 votes. We all know that. It is widely known in the country as \nwell. Most people believe a filibuster means we are trying to delay \nsomething.\n  I wish to make clear to the American people Senate Republicans are \nready to vote on cloture on the Reid proposal in 30 minutes, in an \nhour, as soon as we can get our colleagues over to the floor. We are \nready to vote. By requiring 60 votes, particularly on a matter of this \nenormous importance, is not at all unusual. It is the way the Senate \noperates.\n  I will not belabor it any further. We are happy to vote at any time \nthe majority leader thinks it would be appropriate to vote on his \nproposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, a filibuster is known all over America as a \nway to stall, prevent votes. That is all this is about. If my \nRepublican colleagues are so anxious to vote, let us have a vote. We \nwould move this matter down the field very quickly.\n  Finally, the matter that is now known as the Reid amendment, is that \nthe President's first choice? No. He wanted to do what he called the \ngrand deal. He thought he had that worked out with the Speaker. But the \nPresident knows what I have put forward is good for the country. It \nextends the debt ceiling and reduces the debt.\n  I say to my friend the Republican leader the President will sign my \nlegislation. My friend says he wants something the President will sign. \nHe will sign this. We can pass it tonight and get it through the House \nand he would sign it tomorrow.\n  So, Mr. President, I would hope the world understands, our country \nunderstands--because all Senators understand--this is another \nfilibuster being conducted in an effort to prevent our moving forward \nto handle the debt situation we have in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/30/senate-section/article/S5092-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nfrom 1:30 to 7:30 is equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees in alternating 30-minute blocks, with the \nmajority controlling the first block of time.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, those who are following this debate--and I \nthink many across America are--should understand what just happened. \nThere was a discussion about the filibuster. A filibuster is a Senate \nrule that does two things: It says you cannot move an item to a vote, \nand you have to wait a period of time to have what is called a cloture \nvote. In order to pass a cloture vote, you need 60 votes, not a \nmajority. So I would just correct, if I can, the record. A filibuster \ndoes more than delay the vote; it establishes a higher vote \nrequirement--60 votes, not a majority.\n  Yesterday, the Speaker of the House brought before his body of 435 \nMembers\n\n[[Page S5093]]\n\nthe proposal to end this deadline. He received 218 votes--one more than \nhalf of the membership. He had a majority vote--not one more but a \nmajority vote. We are asking for the same opportunity. Let us bring our \nproposal forward for a majority vote. The Republicans have refused. \nThey have put us into a filibuster. They have said: No, we will require \n60 votes, and we will delay the vote until possibly 1 a.m. Sunday \nmorning. That is where we are.\n  Let me say a word about the underlying issue. This morning, as many \nMembers of the Senate, I wanted to get away from this place and spend a \nfew minutes reflecting on something other than the give-and-take of the \npolitical debate. I got up early, walked over to Eastern Market, bought \na cup of coffee, and sat on a bench for about 3 hours just watching \npeople walk by and trying to clear my mind. While sitting there, I got \nan e-mail from a buddy of mine from high school. Now, that goes back a \nfew years. His name is Eddie Renollet, and he lives in Florida. I would \nlike to read into the Record what my buddy from high school wrote to me \nthis morning. He said:\n\n       I sent this e-mail to our Republican Senator from Florida, \n     too. I have rode out the storms of many high seas in the last \n     20 or so years, but this one has me worried. Let's get the \n     ship on the right course and get this fixed. You all need to \n     get past being Democrats and Republicans. Many mistakes have \n     been made over the past years. Compromise and get this \n     squared away. I am in the later years of my life, and I will \n     be damned, if I want to see it go down the drain because you \n     all can't agree on the debt issue. I am neither a Democrat, \n     Republican, or Tea Party person. I'm an American. And I \n     believe that you both have my best interest at heart.\n\n  Eddie Renollet from Florida. I would just say, under these \ncircumstances, he expresses the views of many people across America. \nThis is not a crisis which we couldn't control. This isn't an \nearthquake or a tornado or a hurricane. It isn't a war. It is a created \npolitical crisis.\n  The extension of the debt ceiling has been done routinely 89 times \nsince 1939--55 times by Republican Presidents, 34 times by Democratic \nPresidents, and President Ronald Reagan holds the record having \nextended the debt ceiling 18 times in 8 years, without confrontation, \nwithout the American economy threatening a collapse. This is a \nmanufactured political crisis, and it is time for both parties to rise \nand come up with a solution.\n  What the majority leader has put on the table--half of it--was a \nproposal by Senator McConnell, the Republican leader. Some people \ndidn't like it. Majority Leader Reid said it will be bipartisan; I am \nputting McConnell's proposal on the table. I will put a proposal, as \nwell, on the table from our side, make it bipartisan, and move it \nforward. Now 43 Republican Senators have said they are not voting for \nit, so we are at a standoff.\n  A word about the President's role in this: President Obama--and I \nknow this because I attended the meetings as a member of the \nleadership--spent more time on this issue than any President I can \nrecall. He met at least six or seven times for 2 and 3 hours at a time \nwith the leadership of the House and Senate--Democrats and \nRepublicans--and tried to work out differences. He proposed the \ncreation, under Vice President Biden's leadership, of the group that \nwould negotiate. It sat and met for months, and then, finally, the \nRepublican leader in the House, Eric Cantor, walked out. He made quite \na noise as he left the room, and said: I don't want to be part of this \nanymore.\n  Then the President started working with Speaker Boehner directly to \nget something worked out, and twice Speaker Boehner walked away from \nthat.\n  So to fault the President in this is not fair. He has engaged all the \nleaders time and time again. Last Saturday, Senator McConnell said: We \nno longer need the President in this picture. We are going to do it \nourselves.\n  Well, we spent a week at it, and we have not achieved that. I am sure \nthe President is ready and willing to do everything in his power to get \nthis back on track.\n  What is at stake in this debate is the fate of the American economy \nat a point when we are recovering from a recession with millions of \nAmericans out of work. Those who are showing great bravado and giving \ngreat political speeches are calling bluffs with other people's chips. \nWhat will happen at the end of the day, regardless of what the \npoliticians say back and forth, is that ordinary people are going to be \naffected--their lives, their businesses, their savings are going to be \naffected by what we decide to do in the next few days.\n  I think what we need to do is clear, and Senator Reid's proposal \naddresses it: No. 1, reduce spending. Let's get this deficit under \ncontrol. Senator Reid's proposal does just that--$2.4 trillion in \nspending reductions--all of which have been voted for by Republicans \nalready. So there is no controversy there. It is bipartisan.\n  Secondly, we cannot lurch into another round of this debate every few \nmonths. The President is right, and this bill reflects it, that we need \nto move this debate until after next year so our economy is strong \nagain, and the next debt ceiling vote will be in 2013. Let's not face \nthis again and again. America doesn't want to see this movie over and \nover.\n  I would also say the provision in Senator Reid's bill, proposed by \nSenator McConnell, that would, in fact, say the President has to \npersonally ask to extend the debt ceiling, is a responsibility the \nPresident will accept, and he should accept it.\n  I think what Senator Reid last offered is a balanced approach, a \nbipartisan approach, and it should be the basis for a compromise. But I \ncertainly hope one thing comes out of this exchange on the floor this \nmorning. I hope Senator McConnell will finally agree to sit down with \nSenator Reid, on a bipartisan basis, work with the House leaders and \nthe President, and get this done. The American people are running out \nof patience, if they haven't already run out of it, and we are running \nout of excuses.\n  We have a limited amount of time left to avert a crisis that will \naffect a lot of innocent people across America. It is time for us to \nroll up our sleeves, on a bipartisan basis, and get this job done.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Republican leader, a few moments ago, said this \nhappens around here from time to time--that 60 votes are required. Is \nit not true the reason 60 votes are required from time to time is \nbecause there is the threat of a filibuster unless the opponents \nsucceed in getting an agreement that there be 60 votes?\n  It is the short way to find out whether the debate will be had. Is it \nnot true, though, that it is the threat of a filibuster the opponents \nmake which produces an agreement to get 60 votes?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Michigan has been here longer than I \nhave. He knows this better than I do. But he is right. This threat of a \nfilibuster has raised the vote requirement from a majority to 60, and \nthat is the issue that was being discussed on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it not true--if I may ask my friend--whether the threat \nis carried out, we will know tonight at 1 a.m.? Because at 1 a.m. \ntomorrow morning, we will vote not on the Reid measure but on a motion \nwhich 18 Senators signed which reads as follows: That we, the \nundersigned Senators, in accordance with rule XXII, hereby move to \nbring to a close the debate on the Reid motion. Is that not true?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is what the vote will be at 1 in the morning.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So what we will be voting on is not, as the Republican \nleader characterized it--which he says he is willing to vote on right \naway--the Reid motion but a vote on whether we will end debate on the \nReid motion?\n  And is it not further true that people who vote no tonight are voting \nto filibuster the Reid motion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Michigan is correct. Those who say they \nwant to bring this to a vote will have an opportunity to join us in \ndoing so by producing at least 60 votes when we vote at 1 in the \nmorning.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Finally, would the Senator from Illinois agree, if tonight \nRepublicans refuse to bring this debate to a halt and to allow a vote \non the Reid motion, would the Senator from Illinois not agree there \nwill be a strong negative public reaction to a filibuster on a measure \nin the face of an economic calamity which would avoid that calamity?\n\n[[Page S5094]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would agree with the Senator from Michigan. Time is of \nthe essence. Any delay at this point jeopardizes any possibility of a \ncompromise to avert this economic crisis.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would just add to what Senator Reid, \nSenator Durbin, and Senator Levin have said: that a 60-vote requirement \nis a filibuster. It is to block this.\n  Now, speaking of how long people have been here, I came here when \nPresident Ford was President. I have served under President Ford, \nPresident Carter, President Reagan, President George H.W. Bush, \nPresident William Jefferson Clinton, President George W. Bush, and now \nPresident Obama. I cannot remember, with any of those Presidents prior \nto President Obama, of this insistence for a 60-Member vote to raise \nthe debt limit ceiling.\n  Certainly, with the number of times we raised the debt limit under \nPresident Ronald Reagan, I do not remember one single Republican \nsuggesting that we needed 60 votes. The same was true I believe under \nPresident George H.W. Bush, and under President George W. Bush. The \nnumerous times the debt ceiling was raised, not a single Republican \nsaid it is so important we must have a 60-vote margin.\n  Yet all of a sudden, with President Obama, the whole criteria \nchanges. Suddenly the rules that were good enough for Republicans with \na Republican President are something to be changed with this President.\n  The American public, Republican or Democratic, can see through that. \nThis is a different standard. We are saying this President must follow \ndifferent rules from every President before him--Republican or \nDemocrat. There is no way that can be considered fair; no way that can \nbe considered anything but a gimmick.\n  It is unfortunate that a partisan faction first manufactured this \ndebt limit crisis and now continues to prevent a bipartisan solution. \nAn unwillingness to compromise and find a bipartisan solution has led \nus to the brink. The United States of America is now just 3 days away \nfrom defaulting on its obligations for the first time in the history of \nthis country. And Senators are demanding we have to have a \nsupermajority vote to stop this from happening.\n  That is not responsible. We are needlessly risking financial turmoil \nthroughout this great country, and it will send ripple effects \nworldwide. A temporary solution is no solution at all. It would \nundermine the stability that our economy needs to grow.\n  Now is the time to set aside partisan bickering, pass a bill. It is \nthe time for the grownups in the room to take over and reach a \nbipartisan solution on the debt ceiling, as has been done every time in \nthe 37 years I have been here.\n  A my-way-or-no-way faction in the other body has had no qualms about \nplaying Russian roulette with our entire economy and with every \nAmerican family in it. Regrettably, as we all saw so clearly again \nyesterday, the House leadership's response to win this faction's votes \nhas simply been to shift their bill even further away from helpfulness \nor reality. Everybody knows the House debt bill, written under this \nduress, was a sham, with no chance of passing and with no chance of \naverting a debt catastrophe.\n  On Friday, at the finish line, shortly prior to a vote on their debt \nbill, House leaders added to their package the idea of amending the \nU.S. Constitution with a balanced budget amendment. This was done as a \ndesperate attempt to win a few more votes. This is not the time for \nbumper sticker politics. It is a time for real leadership and real \nbipartisanship.\n  Many in this body recall, as I do, the period just two short decades \nago when we were able to not only balance the Federal budget but to \ncreate budget surpluses that were on their way to paying off the \nnational debt. On the one hand, we had people who said let's pass a \nconstitutional amendment for some time a decade or two decades in the \nfuture. We actually voted to balance a budget. Not a single Republican \nvoted to balance the budget. They talked about it, but not a single \nRepublican voted to balance the budget. We had to actually have Vice \nPresident Gore vote to break a tie vote. But we balanced the budget. It \ncreated enormous surpluses, it started paying down the national debt, \nover 20 million new jobs were created, and President Clinton was able \nto give a huge surplus to President George W. Bush. Unfortunately, \ndecisions made by that administration and ratified by the new Congress \nsquandered the surplus and started, once again, piling up debt.\n  So this good and great Nation does not need the straitjacket of one-\nsize-fits-all change to our Constitution to do what needs to be done. \nWe have done it. What the American people want and need and deserve is \na return to wise and disciplined leadership. We need the return of \nwillingness by those of us chosen to serve within the Halls of \ngovernment, to cooperate and to forge bipartisan solutions.\n  At this point, Majority Leader Reid's debt reduction package of $2.2 \ntrillion in spending cuts is Congress's best chance to avoid default \nand prevent a disastrous credit-rating downgrade. Unlike the House \nplan, the Reid solution is an invitation to consensus. The Senate \nsolution incorporates spending reductions reached in bipartisan \nnegotiations, yielding greater overall budget savings sooner than the \nHouse proposal. But it would also save the country the ordeal of going \nthrough this torment again just a few months from now. We have seen how \nthis current debate has taken much longer to do what we need to do.\n  As this calamity has unfolded in slow motion, it has been smothering \nthe chance for action on nearly all other national priorities, from \njobs to national security, to air traffic control. The congressional \ndeadlock has prevented passage of a routine renewal of the Federal \nAviation Administration's charter to operate. Today, the Senate could \nbe considering the America Invents Act that is a bipartisan, bicameral \nbill ready to move across the finish line that creates hundreds of \nthousands of jobs and unleashes American innovation and does not add a \npenny to the deficit. But instead of acting on constructive and \nnecessary priorities such as these, we are stuck playing a dangerous \ngame with our economy. The deadline for default would not change. I \ncommend Leader Reid for his willingness and desire to work in the \nspirit of compromise with the Republican leader and others to find a \nbipartisan solution to halt this perilous march to the edge of the \nfinancial cliff.\n  All American people want this solved now, with a fair solution and \nthrough the give-and-take of our representative government, not by some \nextra special vote but just vote it up or vote it down. I am confident \nthat if we can work together, Congress will avert this looming, man-\nmade economic calamity. It is late but it is not yet too late for \nRepublicans and Democrats to come together, for the sake of our \ncountry, in fashioning a bipartisan solution to raise the debt limit, \nreduce our long-term debt, and give our economy the long-term \nfoundation to prosper.\n  I have had the privilege to represent Vermont in the Senate for 37 \nyears. I have been blessed enough to witness many times when the Senate \nhas shown its remarkable ability to rise to reflect the conscience of \nthe Nation. I believe now is such a time for Democrats and Republicans \nin the Senate, for the good of the country, to once again rise to the \noccasion and to have us be the conscience of the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan is on the floor, who is one of the best legal minds in \nthe Senate, I wanted to engage him to further to take us through the \ndelay tactics that are presently now underway.\n  Given the fact that we have a solution right underneath our noses, a \nsolution that is so close between the two opposite sides that all we \nwould have to do is to have a majority vote or all we would have to do \nis to have a few Republican Senators but we are engaged in this \nstalling tactic that is literally going to take us all night, I would \nlike to ask the distinguished Senator from Michigan, given the rules, \ngiven the fact that a filibuster is now underway, what can the minority \nin the Senate hope to achieve, since we are so close to agreement?\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. The reason people filibuster is to try to defeat a measure \nand stalling and delaying a vote is much worse than just defeating a \nmeasure. It is defeating the American economy. It will be putting the \neconomy in a ditch if we do not resolve this issue.\n  So we have to be very clear on what the vote is tonight. It is not a \nvote on the Reid measure. It is a vote on this motion to bring the \ndebate--and these are the words of the motion: We, 18 Senators, move to \nbring to a close the debate on the Reid motion.\n  That is what we are voting on and the Republican leader tries to coat \nthat or characterize that as a vote on the Reid motion. It is not. We \nwant to vote on the Reid motion. We want to vote. But we will not be \nallowed to vote on the Reid motion, on the proposal which the majority \nleader has offered which has a majority support in this Senate; we will \nnot be allowed to vote on that if debate is not ended, if the \nfilibuster continues because 60 Senators are not willing to end it. We \nwill have at least 50-plus to end debate.\n  But let it be clear, let the public understand that if we are not \nallowed to vote on the Reid measure tonight, the Republicans presumably \nwill continue their filibuster, and we are not going to just simply \nallow them to defeat it. We are not going to just simply sit down and \nsay: Well, we couldn't end the debate and the filibuster; we didn't get \n60 votes--if we don't--tonight. We are not going to do that. That is \nnot going to happen tonight. This is too important to simply let a \nminority defeat the will of the majority by a filibuster.\n  The Republican leader wants to characterize this again, and \nmischaracterize this, saying he is willing to have a vote right now on \nthe Reid motion. No, he is not. If we were allowed a vote on the Reid \nmotion, that would be fine. That is a regular majority vote. But what \nthe Republican leader wants is to require 60 votes on the Reid motion \nin order for it to pass. That is not the way things happen under our \nrules. Under our rules, 60 votes are required to end a debate if the \nminority threatens a filibuster and insists it will filibuster unless a \nmeasure gets 60 votes.\n  So we know what is happening. We saw it last night. We saw it here \ntoday. It is clearly the threat of a filibuster, in the hope we will \nsay that Reid will be pulled down and defeated if we don't get 60 \nvotes. That is what this is all about. This time, we simply cannot \nallow this measure to be talked to death and a vote denied. We cannot \nbe thwarted because the American economy is at stake.\n  So tonight, if we don't get 60 votes--and let me repeat this so \neveryone understands it. Tonight, if 60 votes are not there to end \ndebate, if the Republicans intend to filibuster, then tonight that is \nwhat is going to happen. The public will see very clearly it is a \nfilibuster, if they haven't seen it already.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will make comments later. I see the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is here.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, as I understand it, we are allocated 30 \nminutes each. But I have no objection to the Senator having 5 \nadditional minutes as long as 5 additional minutes are added to the \nRepublican side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator from \nNew Hampshire will have 10 minutes and the Republican side will have an \nextra 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I appreciate the consideration of my colleague from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor because I wish to share with \npeople what I am hearing from my constituents in New Hampshire about \nthe situation we are in in Washington.\n  I have heard from small business owners, from retirees, from working \npeople all across the State, and one of the things that struck me about \nthe majority of people whom I have heard from is they are willing to \nmake sacrifices to help this country address our debt and our deficits. \nBut they want to see us in Congress act and they want to see us \ncompromise. Let me just take a few minutes and share some of the \ncomments I have received from the people of New Hampshire.\n  First is from Diane, who is from Manchester, our largest city. Diane \nsays:\n\n       Please get off the party line and work together. My welfare \n     and the welfare of my small business is at risk. I only \n     employ 5 people, but it's 5 people that don't need to collect \n     unemployment or take another job. Don't take away what's left \n     of my retirement by crashing the market. Work as a ``we,'' \n     not as an ``I,'' and get it done. This is not the first time \n     the debt cap needs to be raised and it won't be the last. \n     Please do what will have to be done anyway so we can continue \n     to bring this country back. I don't want to lose my business. \n     Who is going to win the next election is not what any of you \n     should be thinking about. I believe if you don't act, all of \n     you will lose.\n\n  David from Meredith says:\n\n       At the age of 25, I am already the owner of a small \n     software company in the lakes region. We currently have five \n     employees with plans to grow. We are expecting our profits \n     for next year to exceed $1 million. As an employer, small \n     business owner, and at my age, I feel as though I will be \n     greatly affected by budget decisions we make during the next \n     week and into the future. I want to make sure that America \n     stays as one of the best Nations in the world. I have never \n     written a letter to any Member of Congress before tonight.\n\n  Then we have Janine from Auburn who says:\n\n       Settle the budget now. The dysfunction in Congress is \n     embarrassing this country. As a small business owner, I can't \n     afford the uncertainty of a political fiasco. If interest \n     rates rise, I can't keep my business afloat. I would rather \n     pay increased taxes.\n\n  Eric from Hollis says:\n\n       As a small business owner, I am unable to plan and hire \n     employees due to the uncertainty the current standstill in \n     Washington has created. Please get the USA back to work and \n     making progress and stop the bickering.\n\n  Then Brenda from Enfield says:\n\n       My 77-year-old husband retired last year. I am planning on \n     retiring this year collecting Social Security at full \n     retirement age of 65. We have been good citizens, running our \n     own small business for 40-plus years, and we have been \n     diligent in taking responsibility for our own retirement \n     savings. As you know, over the past 2 years, due to economic \n     pressures, we have faced substantial reductions of our \n     retirement portfolio and, again, now face irreparable damage \n     just as we retire. My husband and I urge you to do whatever \n     it takes to build a cooperative bridge in Congress to protect \n     the economy from further trauma.\n\n  Cynthia from Exeter says:\n\n       I am receiving Social Security due to a disability, but I \n     would gladly give up $5 a month if everyone shared in the \n     idea of balancing our Nation's budget issues and deficit. I \n     would like to see revenue raised at the same time I would be \n     willing to sacrifice some of my Social Security.\n\n  Finally, Sue from Campton says:\n\n       My husband and I would be willing to pay higher income \n     taxes--and we would be in that higher tax bracket--to come up \n     with a compromise to save this great Nation. I hope that when \n     you read this message you will understand that there is a \n     majority of Americans who are willing to sacrifice for our \n     country. Please find compromise. Our great State of New \n     Hampshire and our country depends on it.\n\n  I want to tell Diane and David and Sue and all the others who have \ncalled and e-mailed and written to me that I agree with them. We must \nact and we must compromise. That is what I am trying to do. That is why \nI have supported a comprehensive approach to dealing with this \ncountry's debt and deficits. It is an approach that has been \nbipartisan, offered by the so-called Gang of 6. It addresses all \naspects of our budget: domestic discretionary spending, defense \nspending, mandatory programs, and revenues. But I understand we are not \ngoing to be able to get that done between now and Tuesday, so that is \nwhy I am willing to support an approach that only makes cuts to the \nbudget, because I know we have to compromise. But compromise means that \neveryone, all sides--the House and the Senate, Republicans and \nDemocrats--all sides have to give up something. I believe we have good \npeople in the Senate on both sides of the aisle, the majority of whom \nwant to see a resolution to this impasse. The time is now for all of us \nto compromise and to do what is in the best interests of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today when the Chaplain opened the \nSenate, he prayed for divine guidance to end\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\nthe paralysis of analysis in Congress. I thought it was an excellent \npoint. When I heard the two leaders speak today I realized where that \nparalysis was. We were paralyzed by analyzing our differences and \nfailing to look at what we have reached common ground on already.\n  I have been worried about a default on our debt for some time, but \nright now I am worried about Congress defaulting on our country. \nFailure should not be an option for us in this case and it is time we \nstarted finding common ground. So for the purpose of discussion, I want \nto put forward some thoughts about where we agree, some identification \nof where we do not but where we could be.\n  We have already agreed, in one form or another--whether it was the \nVice President's group or the Speaker's group or whoever--that we ought \nto have a $1 trillion downpayment in initial cuts to bring about \ndeficit reduction.\n  There is common agreement between both sides in the Senate and I \nthink in the House as well that we need a short-term committee, equally \ndivided in a partisan way, to come up with at least another $1.8 \ntrillion that results in reductions in debt and in deficit. We have \nagreed on those two things.\n  Third, we have agreed we do not want to default on our debt. There \nmay be a handful of people around here who think that is a good idea, \nbut with all due respect it is not a good idea and the ramifications of \ndefault are already showing themselves in small measures in the market \nbut will show themselves a lot greater next Wednesday if we fail.\n  Where do we differ? We do not differ on raising the debt ceiling, we \njust differ on when we raise it, how we raise it, and how long we raise \nit. The President favors raising it past the election in November 2012. \nThere are others who want to have votes every 6 months or 10 months. \nFrankly, there is something to be said for waiting until after the \nNovember election of 2012 so we have 18 months of stability and \npredictability in the United States of America; there is not the \nuncertainty of us coming back.\n  There are a lot of differences on the other side about whether we \nhave a constitutional amendment on the balanced budget vote. Frankly, I \ncannot understand why in the end anybody would reject both bodies being \nable to have a vote in regular order on a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. We are supposed to vote. We are supposed to \nconfront those decisions. I think an agreement could be reached between \nthose two differences that would ensure us moving closer to an \nagreement on the entire package.\n  Third, and probably toughest, we do not disagree on the committee \nthat is appointed to find the $1.8 trillion or better in savings or \ncuts, but we disagree on the mechanism with which that is enforced. I \nwant to talk about that for a minute. There is a fear--and a lot of it \nis justified because of the way we are acting right now--that if you \nhad a committee of 12, 6 Democrats and 6 Republicans, charged with \nfinding $1.8 trillion or more in reductions, they would never agree; \ntherefore, they would be gridlocked; therefore, those reductions would \nnot take place. I understand that fear and agree with the concern for \nthat fear. So we need a mechanism where there is a risk for them to do \nthat.\n  One of the discussions that has been floating around--last night it \nwas in a discussion I had with the officer presiding right now--is you \nshould allow the Congress itself to create a committee with an equal \nnumber of Democrats and Republicans of some accountable number, such as \n10 or 20, to come together. If the committee fails to make its \nrecommendations and make alternative recommendations, that must by \nrequirement of the law be voted on on the floor of the House and \nSenate. If for some unbelievable circumstance that did not happen, \nthere has to be an absolute fail-safe to ensure that failure is not an \noption. I have suggested automatic sequestration. I know that causes \nheartburn with some. But somewhere there is a silver bullet. The Lone \nRanger had it. Tonto had it. Wyatt Earp had it. Why can't the Congress \nfind it? Why can't we find the majority bullet that is the enforcement \nmechanism that ensures we come together on the $1.8 trillion or more? \nIf we do those things, we have an agreement. We have already agreed in \nprinciple on most of them and we understand our differences on the ones \nwe have not agreed on. We ought to be spending the next 24 hours \nfinding out where our differences are and coming to find common ground \nbecause we are not that far apart.\n  I want to go back to the prayer of Barry C. Black this morning. I \nlisten to his prayer just about every morning because it is very \ninsightful. In fact, there is a clear message in it and he is usually \ntalking to all of us because he watches all of us and he is concerned \nand I am concerned.\n  I have three children and nine grandchildren. I said in my campaigns \nthe rest of my life is about leaving them a country as prosperous, \nfree, and great as the country my parents left me. If we blink on this \nissue before us, that is not going to be the case. There is irreparable \nharm that can come from a failure to act. It doesn't harm me as a \npolitician, it harms my kids and my grandkids. It harms those people I \nknow on Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid, and it harms those \nstanding right now on a firing line somewhere in Afghanistan, realizing \ntoday could be their last day on this Earth so America could live to \nsee another day. That is how serious the consequences are.\n  I suggest instead of being paralyzed by our analysis of where we \ndiffer, let's come to an analysis of where we find common ground. We do \non raising the debt ceiling; we know we should raise it. We know we \ncould find $2.8 trillion and hopefully more in cuts in the deficit and \nspending over time. We know we have to extend the debt ceiling to some \npoint in time, and if it is past the Presidential election of 2012, \nlet's ensure that each body in regular order can vote on a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, which leaves us with \none difference, and that difference is what is the enforcement \nmechanism on the $1.8 trillion cut that the joint committee, equally \ndivided, is supposed to come up with.\n  I submit we can find the common ground to find the silver bullet that \ncauses that to happen and I encourage all of us to forget now where we \ndiffer and recognize where we agree and then work on building a bridge \non those differences so the United States of America does not default \non its debt and the Congress of the United States does not default on \nits obligation to the people of the greatest country on the face of \nthis Earth, the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the discussion has boiled down to a \ndesire by the President to have the largest debt increase in the \nhistory of America at a time when our spending is out of control, and \nthis debt ceiling limit that we have now reached is at a point where it \ndoes need to be raised.\n  I thought we had a national consensus that as part of raising the \ndebt ceiling we would begin to change our habits around here; we would \ndo things better; we would not be running up so much debt because every \nwitness who has testified before our Budget Committee has said we are \non an unsustainable path. They mean that. We cannot sustain the debt \npath we are on. We have never been in a deeper fix.\n  The President wants this huge debt increase, but he only wants to \nhave a very modest decrease in spending. The bill that is before us \nwould decrease spending about $927 billion. It might sound like a lot, \nbut over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, we will increase the debt of America by $10 trillion--$10,000 \nbillion, not $927 billion. That will not change the debt trajectory. We \nhave to have more than $927 billion in spending reductions.\n  It appears we are not going to be able to get that. The Democratic \nmajority in the Senate will not allow it and say they are prepared to \nlet the country default if we try to cut any more. So we have to \ncontinue the dialogue and the debate about the course we are on.\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\n  Why is it so important to get a bigger debt ceiling increase? I \nthought and believed we had an agreement that the debt ceiling should \nnot be increased more than spending is decreased, that spending is \ndecreased over 10 years. We cut it $1 trillion, we raise the debt \nceiling $1 trillion. We give 10 years of spending cuts, but immediately \nwe get a $1 trillion increase in the debt ceiling.\n  Why are we in this fix? I hate to say it, but this is why, there is \nno doubt about it: The President said last week:\n\n       The only bottom line that I have is that we extend this \n     debt ceiling through the next election, until 2013.\n\n  Through the next election. It is all about him. It is about politics. \nIt is about his desires, what he wants. That is not correct. This is \nabout America, what is good for our country.\n  The House of Representatives submitted a fabulous budget earlier this \nyear. It reduced spending by as much as $6 trillion over 10 years. This \nbill would only reduce it $1 trillion. Why would the House of \nRepresentatives, after much debate, pleading, hard work, why would they \nagree to send a bill over here that only does $1 trillion in spending \ncuts over 10 years? The reason is they love our country. They know this \nis a dangerous time. They know at this point in history we don't need \nto create more uncertainty on top of the tremendously dangerous debt \npath we are on.\n  By not raising the debt limit we don't know for sure what will \nhappen. Bad things could happen, so they have made a tremendous \ncompromise in what they proposed and sent it over here. It seems the \nonly thing the President cares about is not having to talk about this \nagain until after he gets reelected.\n  I think we need to understand something. This is not enough reduction \nin spending. It will not change the debt trajectory we are on now, \nwhich is on a path to do $9 trillion to $13 trillion more in debt added \nto our Nation's books in 10 years. It is just not enough.\n  We raise the debt ceiling, and we get out of this immediate crisis, \nand in doing so we send a message to the world, the American people and \nthe financial markets that we are still working on it. We are still \ngoing to bring down the numbers. We know we cannot continue on this \nrate of spending. We know that so we are going to work to get the \nnumbers down, and we are not going to wait 2 years after some \nconvenient or inconvenient election. We are going to start early next \nyear or late this year, and we will stay on it until we make the kind \nof changes that put us on a path to growth and prosperity. I feel \nstrongly about that.\n  I know people don't want to hear us talking about this bill or that \nbill or who is for this and how many votes it has. They are tired of \nhearing that. They want us to make changes. I do not think the American \npeople just want a deal. That is how the media spins it and politicians \nspin it: Is there a deal? Is there not a deal? The American people want \nus to change our debt course. They want us to get off the path that is \ntaking us to financial destruction. It really is. I don't know when it \nwill happen, but everybody says we cannot continue, and in a period of \nyears we will be in a situation like Greece, and the numbers are pretty \nclear in that regard. There is no doubt about it. It doesn't have to \nhappen, so we can do something about it.\n  Republicans have passed a good budget that would reduce the debt and \nput us on a path to prosperity. That was rejected by our Democratic \nleaders. Indeed, they brought it up and mocked it. President Obama \ncalled for a conference at the White House. He put Congressman Ryan, \nthe brilliant young budget chairman in the House right in front of him, \nand then he mocked and attacked the budget that the House did that \nwould actually do something for America and make us better. I don't \nappreciate that. We have to do something. I am prepared to compromise. \nI feel deeply that we need to cut more spending than this, but we are \nat a point in history where we need to pass a debt ceiling increase. We \njust have to. We don't need to quit talking about the problem. We need \nto continue the dialogue, continue the debate, and continue to look for \nand find ways to reduce spending.\n  The House passed a cap-and-balance bill that would have capped \nspending and created a permanent constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget, and then they passed the Boehner legislation that was voted \ndown last night. That legislation would have cut all spending at just \nabout the amount that Senator Reid wants, the $900-or-so billion. \nSpeaker Boehner didn't exaggerate how much it was. He agreed to that \namount and agreed to raise the debt ceiling immediately by an amount \nequal to the amount of spending we reduced over 10 years. It was a very \ngenerous, significant compromise from the position they believed was \ncorrect and that they took openly and publicly through the normal \nlegislative process when they passed their budget.\n  Now our Democrats in the Senate have not passed anything. They didn't \neven bring up a budget. Now it has been 822 days since Congress has \npassed a budget. A budget was not passed here when my Democratic \ncolleagues had 60 Democratic Senators.\n  Senator Reid said it would be foolish to pass a budget. Why is that? \nWell, he meant it would be foolish to have his Members actually have to \nvote.\n  When you move a budget, it has priority. It cannot be filibustered. \nIt can be passed with a 50-vote margin, but people get to offer \namendments and people would have to vote on amendments. The people who \nproduced the budget would have to say how much taxes they were \nincreasing, how much spending they were cutting, and how much debt was \nstill going to be out there, and they did not want to expose \nthemselves. They did not want to come before the American people and \nshow where they stood. They preferred to bring up the House budget and \nvote it down and mock it while the leadership didn't have the courage \nor the responsibility to pass a budget themselves. They would show \nwhere they wanted to go with the future of America. It is just that \nsimple.\n  We need to go back to the regular order in the Senate, and that means \npresenting a budget, bringing up bills, having votes, having \namendments, having people be accountable to their constituents. If you \nwere sitting back home, you would want to see government reduce some of \nthis reckless spending. Wouldn't you want to know how your elected \nofficials, the people representing you, voted? Well, we have had no \nvotes, and that has been the plan--to shield the Members from votes so \ntheir constituents could not hold them accountable.\n  For heaven's sake, we don't want to have a vote in January or \nFebruary when we have an election in November. Why, that is too close. \nPeople would see what we did. They might remember it when election day \ncame up. They might not like it that they don't have a plan to do a \nbetter job of changing the unconscionable debt course this country is \non.\n  That is the way they think in Washington, and it is not acceptable. \nWe are borrowing 40 cents of everything we spend.\n  Mr. President, do we have a time agreement at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 20 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Well, it is a big deal, and we need to get this done. There are just \nnot enough votes to pass the Reid bill, and there are not enough votes \nto pass the Boehner bill. That is just obvious, even though Speaker \nBoehner drew down dramatically the amount of spending cuts the House \nbelieves should be achieved.\n  We have to get our folks busy while we are continuing to debate into \nthe night instead of actually recognizing that the Reid bill doesn't \nhave the votes to pass the Senate, and it absolutely doesn't have the \nvotes to pass the House. It just doesn't. At this last desperate \nmoment, hopefully, our leaders will get busy, quit worrying about those \nthings, and actually begin to suggest something we can work on. We \nreally should not be in this position.\n  As I have explained at some length--and I will not repeat it--but I \ndon't like it. I do not like it. I don't think it is right that we have \na couple of Senators and a couple of House Members, our leaders, go off \nand somehow plop down on the Senate their solution to our problem, and \nif we don't pass it, the government is damaged and the economy is \ndamaged because they have waited until the absolute eleventh hour-plus \nto produce it.\n\n[[Page S5098]]\n\n  It should have never happened that way. It is irresponsible, and it \nundermines the integrity of the entire congressional process. We have \nseen this coming all year long. We should not have allowed it to happen \nin this way.\n  Well, let me talk a bit more technically about the Reid bill. It \npurports to reduce spending and savings by $2.4 trillion. That is not \ncorrect. Actually, it reduces the debt that would be increasing by only \n$927 billion, and we have done our best with the Budget Committee staff \nto be honest and fair about it.\n\n  That is about the same number Speaker Boehner has in his, but \nMajority Leader Reid insists his saves $2.4 trillion. Why? Because if \nit is $2.4 trillion, he can justify that the next time we address this, \nwhich will be after the next election, will be 2 years away.\n  He doesn't cut that much. What he claims is not accurate. Why? Well, \nthey are working into the night to see how they can make the accounting \nlook better. They didn't like the 927 figure, so what do they do? They \nlook at the budget projections where it was projected war costs would \nbe coming down. Actually, we will have a $40 billion reduction this \nyear in the cost of Iraq and Afghanistan. Those costs are coming down. \nThe President had projected they would come down to $50 billion soon \nand would stay at that for the rest of the year, which would mean $1 \ntrillion less spending. Remember, we are going to increase the debt by \n$9 to $13 trillion, but $1 trillion would have been--by reducing the \nwar cost, we save $1 trillion. But that was already in the books. That \nis already accounted for.\n  So how did they do it? Well, they came in and they put in a bill that \nmandated the come-down because, oddly enough, the Congressional Budget \nOffice doesn't assume war costs will come down. The Congressional \nBudget Office assumes that it will stay up and we will spend this $1 \ntrillion more on the war when there is no intent to do that. Therefore, \nthey put it in the legislation and require it to come down, these \nnumbers, and all of a sudden CBO scores $1 trillion in extra savings \nwithout any change in spending projections or reality at all.\n  Speaker Boehner didn't count his bill as reducing spending by that $1 \ntrillion when he took the same numbers, same assumptions that spending \non the war would come down. But they did that to try to make it look as \nthough they were reducing spending more; therefore, they could extend \nthe debt limit more, they would make it past the election, and they \ncould get the political result they want. That is really what it is.\n  Another way they get another $300 billion gimmick is that if we \nassume a $1 trillion reduction in the war, then we are not paying \ninterest on that money because we would have to borrow it because we \nare already in debt, and every amount we can reduce means we borrow \nless money. Every less-spending provision saves money, and it also \nsaves interest on that money. Well, it would be $300 billion in \ninterest saved under the theory--the gimmick--that is being used here. \nSo that really amounts to $1.3 trillion in overestimating right there \non the amount of savings in the Reid plan.\n  I thank the Chair. I hope we will reject the Reid proposal, and I \nhope our leaders can achieve in short order a change in our plans for \nmanaging our money, raise the debt ceiling, and begin to put this \ncountry on a sound path.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I am happy to come to the \nfloor with two of my colleagues--my colleague from Minnesota and my \ncolleague from Alaska--to speak about the damage created by the \nRepublicans' insistence on looking at just one side of the equation and \nfailing to understand what businesses need to move forward during the \nnext 28 minutes or so.\n  As my good friend from Alabama leaves the floor, I wish to say that I \nhave enjoyed working with him on many issues. We have been shoulder to \nshoulder advocating for gulf coast restoration and many other issues. \nHowever, I have to strongly disagree with some of the points he has \njust made, and I will go into those in just a moment.\n  Part of the problem with the Senator from Alabama and other Senators \non that side is that when they speak to the American people on this \nissue, they only talk about one side of the equation; that is, \nspending. They never, ever talk about revenues. Anybody--any family, \nany individual, any business, any high school student, any college \nstudent--understands--like the commercial running on television now \nthat talks about equations--equations have two sides, not one. There is \na spending side and there is a revenue side.\n  If a family's budget is out of whack--they are spending too much, and \nthey are not taking in enough money--they could get a third job and fix \nthat problem by bringing in more money to the budget or a second job or \na part-time job and bring in more revenue, and that problem is solved \nor they could choose to not get another job and cut back spending all \nthe way down to their income and solve the problem.\n  The problem with the other side is they are disingenuous. They do not \nwant to be truthful with the American people and say that not only do \nwe have a spending problem, which all Democrats agree with, but we also \nhave a revenue problem, and that is why we are on this floor fighting \ntoday.\n  I wish to show beyond a shadow of a doubt the truth about what I am \nspeaking. This is data from the Senate Appropriations Committee. This \nshows discretionary defense spending, all other spending, and mandatory \nprograms for 10 years.\n  In 10 years, from 2001 until today, 10 years later, defense spending \nhas increased $364 billion--73 percent--and that is because we have had \ntwo wars and any number of defense and security issues. We can debate \nwhether that is right, but we have spent 73 percent more money, \nadjusted for inflation.\n  For mandatory programs, the increase has gone up 310 percent in 10 \nyears. That is Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. This is the \ndriver. This is the budget-buster. There are all sorts of solutions to \nthat problem. Unfortunately, we are not talking about any of them \ntoday. But the push on the spending is coming from mandatory programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe charts I have been referring to.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            TABLE 1.2--SUMMARY OF RECEIPTS, OUTLAYS, AND SURPLUSES OR DEFICITS (  ) AS

0.05 percent or less.\nNote: Budget figures prior to 1933 are based on the ``Administrative Budget'' concepts rather than the ``Unified Budget'' concepts.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, what the Republicans fail to tell \npeople, which makes me so angry and should make everyone angry, is that \nall other spending in the Federal Government has remained flat. There \nhas been a zero-percent increase in 10 years, if we adjust for \ninflation--zero, not a 2-percent increase, not a 3-percent increase. \nThese are the facts.\n  It is also true that we are spending more money--25 percent of GDP--\nthan at any time since World War II, but that spending is being driven \nby defense and mandatory. But what do they want to cut? What are they \ndemanding to be cut today? They are demanding cuts from this line item, \nincluding agriculture, health, education, and respite care for the \nelderly. This is what they want to cut. This is why Democrats are \nsaying: Wait a minute, take a couple of steps back. That is what this \nfight is really about.\n  In addition to waging this fight--and one would think this is a big \nfight to have--we would have it in the safest place possible. Some \nwould think we would be having it in the safest place possible. My \ncolleagues know that in the old western movies, when two guys\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\nwant to shoot it out, they say: Meet me on the edge of town. Do these \nguys meet you on the edge of town? No. Do you know where they meet us? \nRight on Main Street, where small business and big business and self-\nemployed have been struggling for years, coming out of the greatest \nrecession that in large measure they helped to create. Where do they \nwant to stage this fight? On Main Street. That is what this fight is \nabout. They could have chosen anyplace for this battle, but where do \nthey choose it? They choose it over raising the debt ceiling, which, if \nwe don't fix it in the next 72 hours, it is going to raise interest on \nevery business.\n  I am already getting piles of letters from Louisiana that I will \ninclude in the Record from small business owners pleading with us to \ncome to a deal because they are holding the economy hostage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters I just \nreferred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 27, 2011.\n     Mrs. Monique Jones,\n     Raceland, LA.\n       Senator Landrieu, I am writing with my concern regarding \n     the debt ceiling issue. I am appalled at the current GOP \n     tactics, their inability to compromise and their absolute \n     refusal to put the good of the nation, the economy and the \n     average middle class American before some rigid political \n     ideology. Louisiana may be a red state, but the Tea party \n     does not speak for all of us! Increasingly, I am frustrated \n     and dismayed that there is no ability to grasp even common \n     sense ideas--debt reduction works by increasing revenue and \n     cutting spending, for example--or their apparent amnesia and \n     the fact that it was previous administrations that put wars \n     on the credit card! Why weren't they shouting over fiscal \n     responsibility back then?\n       I have contacted my Congressman expressing my lack of \n     support for Cap, Cut and Balance. I am equally not impressed \n     with the Reid plan. I SUPPORT tax increases, closing \n     corporate tax loopholes and . . . please . . . please . . . \n     can Hedge Fund Managers pay their fair share? I'll be frank, \n     my husband and I are small business owners, registered \n     Independents and completely middle class. Our income was \n     decimated by the oil spill, and last year we paid a lot more \n     taxes than GE did. Not fair!\n       Please Senator, do what is right for the middle class. Get \n     some revenues. Protect Medicare. I understand that we need to \n     cut spending, but not on the backs of the middle class. How \n     about letting the Bush tax cuts expire for starters? The \n     President and the democrats have compromised, but the GOP \n     reminds me of playground bully. Shaking down the other kids \n     for their lunch money. I am appalled that they would rather \n     run the country into the ground than compromise! This \n     moderate Independent is angry.\n       The President asked that we give you guys a shout out to \n     let you know what we think. I support the Democrats. I will \n     do so in upcoming elections as well. The GOP has proved \n     themselves incapable of actual governance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Monique M. Jones.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 27, 2011.\n     Mr. Matthew Cope,\n     Baton Rouge, LA.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu, What is wrong with revenues?? Or why \n     not close a few tax loopholes (or does that constitute tax \n     increases--bilge water!!).\n       Look at what people were paying in taxes under Eisenhower--\n     we are supremely under-taxed. Why do people think we can fund \n     multiple wars with tax cuts and no revenues??? No one has an \n     inkling of what sacrifice is. Go see Captain America: it's \n     all about the war effort and doing your part. No one does \n     that (or even thinks about it) anymore. Stop enriching those \n     who need it the least. I am a 40-year-old small business \n     owner--all this default talk is doing nothing but making it \n     harder for me to grow my business. And I vote!!!\n           Sincerely,\n     Matthew Cope.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 27, 2011.\n     David Beriss,\n     New Orleans, LA.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu, please stop the idiotic debt ceiling \n     debate. It is time to raise the debt ceiling and move on to \n     legislation that creates jobs.\n       Cutting government spending and reducing government jobs is \n     a ridiculous and irresponsible policy when we are trying to \n     recover from a recession. Please stop letting the Republican \n     ideologues drive the political debate in Washington. There is \n     only one issue that matters: jobs. The debt ceiling debate is \n     an artificial crisis and a distraction from what matters.\n       Get this done and move on!\n       It is all about jobs, not about stupid ideological \n     smokescreens like ``big government,'' or a ``balanced budget \n     amendment'' (which is a truly stupid idea, by the way).\n       Can we count on you to work forcefully to get the Senate \n     (and all of Congress) to focus on issues that really matter, \n     like creating jobs?\n           Sincerely,\n     David Beriss.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 27, 2011.\n     Mr. Daniel Threlkeld,\n     Fort Polk, LA.\n       Senator Landrieu, first of all, I want to thank you for \n     your support of our military. I am a Captain in the Army and \n     have humbly served our great country for nearly 13 years. I \n     am writing to you today to let you know how disheartened and \n     down-right disgusted I am with how our government is dealing \n     with today's economic problems--in particular the debt \n     ceiling issue. I have dealt firsthand with the enormous \n     emotional trauma caused by the last budget problem which \n     almost caused our young fighting men and women to temporarily \n     stop getting paid. At the time, I was a Battery Commander \n     stationed at Fort Lewis. I had combat veterans who served \n     multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan wearing the weight of \n     this country on their shoulders only to have that same \n     country almost turn its back on their pay and benefits. I had \n     numerous Soldiers who lived paycheck to paycheck, and even a \n     temporary stop in pay would have been devastating to that \n     Soldier and his family. Fortunately, you all reached an \n     agreement several months ago at the last minute in which you \n     passed the 2011 Budget so we could get paid.\n       Now we are at another impasse, and now the military once \n     again faces the possibility of not getting paid. Not only \n     that, but all of the arguing and bickering amongst our \n     Congressmen & Women are bringing our entire economy down. \n     Bottom line: You (all of Congress and the President) need to \n     reach a deal. Throw out all of the politics, Democrat versus \n     Republican tricks, and unite as Americans and make a deal \n     that will bring our country out of this mess. Don't turn your \n     backs on the very people who elected you. Please, from one \n     humble American to another, make a deal and secure our \n     future. I have faith that you will help make this happen.\n           Respectfully,\n                                       CPT(P) Daniel S. Threlkeld.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Has anybody read the newspapers this morning? It is \nfull of cartoons: Republicans holding the economy hostage. They are not \nholding Barack Obama hostage. They are not holding Democrats hostage. \nThey are not holding the Federal Government hostage. They have decided \nto fight the battle on Main Street, holding economic growth hostage, \nand they think that is a compromise or a fair fight. This hostage isn't \nstrong enough to survive this siege.\n  Do we ever hear any one of them say that perhaps we need to raise a \npenny or two or three? Absolutely not. Now, there are Senators who have \nagreed to do so, but they haven't been as vocal as they possibly could \nbe. I am honored to serve with many good Republicans who understand \nthis equation has two sides: both taking spending down in the right \nways and raising revenue.\n  Let me get one more fact out there, and I will turn it over to my \ncolleague.\n  I understand corporate tax rates are higher than some other countries \nin the world, and our corporations are having some tough times, as well \nas some businesses. But I am going to submit data for the Record which \nshows that the top 400 companies in this country are not paying a 35-\npercent rate, they are not paying a 34-percent rate, their practical \nrate is 17 percent. Why would that be the case? Because this Tax Code \nis full of loopholes for special interests that many of them on the \nother side think are justified.\n  So we are not going to be able to solve all of these problems today, \nbut I wanted to come to the floor on behalf of businesses--small \nbusinesses and large--and say that when the Republicans start talking \nabout both sides of the equation, these Democrats, including myself, \nwill walk up and negotiate. In the meantime, we are going to work hard \nto find a deal that works for the American people, and one solution \nthat will work for the American people is not to have to repeat this 4 \nmonths from now.\n  I am going to conclude with this. Just a few months ago, we were \ngetting letters from the other side saying business needs certainty, \nbusiness needs to know what taxes they are going to pay. They need to \nhave certainty. And then, all of a sudden, today this side is arguing \nthat we have to go through this debate 4 months from now.\n  I am telling my colleagues that this hostage will not survive their \nsiege. We have to fix this for the long term now.\n  I am going to turn it over to my colleague from Minnesota, who is \ngoing to talk about the businesses in her State and what she is hearing \nfrom businesses in her State and why this is so\n\n[[Page S5101]]\n\ngrossly unfair from Republicans who want to bring this economy to its \nknees, and they are doing a really good job of it.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank very much the Senator from \nLouisiana for her passionate remarks. There is a reason she has that \npassion, and it is because we are in the ninth inning. This is it. The \ntime for political posturing is over. There is no more time to say we \nare not going to talk to each other. There is no more time to pretend \nwe can have one plan and then another plan. It is time to get an \nagreement.\n  Look at what has happened in just the past week. The markets have \ngone down more than they have in over a year. We have seen realtors--\nand this is a study that just came out a few days ago--people backed \naway from one out of six deals this past month. If you look at the \nmonth before, it was only 1 out of 25. People are feeling the \nuncertainty in this economy, and it is time to come to a bipartisan \nagreement.\n  Last week, I held a call with business leaders from across my State \nto update them on the status of negotiations, to hear their thoughts \nand their concerns, and to answer their questions. Their message back \nto me was clear and unified: If we fail to act, the consequences for \nour economy are real and serious. I will be honest. They don't care \nwhat combination of votes--Democratic, Republican--it takes to get us \nacross the finish line. Many of them may prefer Republican plans, and \nsome would prefer a Democratic plan. What they want is consistency. \nThey want us to get this done. They want us to not default on our debt. \nThey want a deal to be passed by August 2 that prevents the United \nStates from defaulting on its financial obligations and provides some \nlong-term certainty.\n  Now, make no mistake, they see our debt crisis as real and serious \nand something that must be addressed. But while failure to bring the \nnational debt under control is threatening America's future, the danger \nof default is already harming our economy. We must address both. The \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce has called the possibility of default \nunthinkable and unacceptable, arguing it will have real, immediate, and \npotentially catastrophic consequences.\n\n  As economists and experts from across the ideological spectrum have \nsaid, if this continues, interest rates will rise for everyone. That is \nwhat they say. This will mean higher rates for American consumers and \nthe small businesses that drive our economies. Car loans, mortgages, \nbusinesses, and student loans will all be more expensive. Higher \nborrowing costs and a falling dollar means slower economic growth and \nslower job creation. That is the last thing we need right now.\n  Just an hour ago I received in my office an e-mail from a major \nemployer in my State saying the commercial paper market nearly seized \nup yesterday, and by the afternoon only overnight rollovers were \npossible. That is what they were seeing, and that is identical to what \nhappened to capital markets in September of 2008, according to this \nmajor company. They said this in the e-mail:\n\n       The sooner the debt limit issue can be resolved, the sooner \n     this market can begin functioning as it should and the sooner \n     lenders will begin lending for longer than overnight.\n\n  Here are some things I heard from business leaders in my State. This \nis from Hubert Joly, the president and CEO of Carlson Companies, \nheadquartered in Minneapolis. It owns and manages over 2,000 hotels and \nrestaurants across this country and across the globe. He writes this:\n\n       As one of the largest private family owned companies in the \n     United States, Carlson would like to highlight how critical \n     it is for Congress to reach a constructive compromise before \n     August 2 to ensure that the U.S. does not default on its debt \n     obligations. The ongoing uncertainty--\n\n  Note that word--\n\n     and lack of resolution of the debt ceiling debate is not \n     healthy for the global financial markets or for consumer \n     confidence. It is highly detrimental to the overall economy \n     and to the travel and hospitality industry which millions of \n     families in the U.S. depend upon for their livelihood. We \n     therefore urge congressional leadership to act in the best \n     interests of the nation and deliver a compromise agreement \n     that avoids default and demonstrates the nation has a \n     credible plan to reduce the federal deficit. A short-term fix \n     is not sufficient, as we must not allow or accept prolonged \n     uncertainty, which will only create volatility and \n     instability for the globe and the U.S. economy.\n\n  I have multiple other letters--from snow mobile manufacturers, etc., \nwhich I will later put in the Record. Since we are having dozens come \nin every hour, I want to get them all gathered for tomorrow. But one \ngentleman said this:\n\n       In regard to the current debt ceiling situation, default is \n     not an option and reasonable compromise is what we need to \n     add certainty that will lead to growth for American \n     manufacturers.\n\n  Certainty and growth. Another one:\n\n       The current debate over the debt ceiling has serious \n     implications for American business. For example, the impact \n     to my company will be felt not only by 3,300 U.S. employees, \n     but by suppliers, customers, and, consequently, shareholders.\n\n  Just in case you do not draw the connection, these are major \nbusinesses that are in small towns throughout my State--sometimes the \nonly major employer in those towns. That is what they are saying. Let \nme tell you, these are not Democrats who are writing those letters. \nThey are not siding on one particular plan or the other. They are just \nsaying: We need a compromise, and we need it by August 2.\n  Ken Powell, chairman and CEO of General Mills, a major Fortune 500 \ncompany, writes:\n\n       We think it is critically important for the entire \n     country--both at the business and individual level--that \n     Congress come to an agreement on this issue and move forward.\n\n  An individual from a major financial institution that manages the \nsavings and retirements of over 2 million individual business and \ninstitutional clients writes this:\n\n       I urge the U.S. Congress to reach a bipartisan agreement to \n     raise the debt ceiling and return the country's focus to \n     economic growth and job creation.\n\n  None of us in this Chamber wants to see our economy damaged. \nDemocrats do not want it. Republicans do not want it. As these letters \nshow, the business community in this country knows we cannot have this \nhappen. What they want is for us to work together to show the American \npeople and the world that Washington is not broken; that instead we are \nwilling to put aside our politics to do what we have been elected to do \nand get this done. That is what is right for America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska is here to \nfinish out this segment, which is focusing on the difficulties that \nbusinesses are going to have. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \njoining us for this segment.\n  I just want to get something in the Record before yielding to the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  I said the spending is high, 25 percent of GDP. Everyone acknowledges \nthat. We are working hard to get it down. But I want to put in the \nRecord that revenues coming into the Treasury are the lowest since \nWorld War II, at 14 percent. We do not have revenues in this solution \nbecause Democrats have compromised and conceded on this point, which is \na very difficult compromise for us to make when faced with the truth of \nthe situation. But in trying to compromise, we have done that. We have \nnot been met halfway. I hope the minority leader will reengage with the \nmajority leader--having said last night he did not believe he wanted to \nengage with the majority leader to try to come to a compromise--because \nbusinesses are depending on it.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an \nexcellent column in the Washington Post today to capstone my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n                          (By Colbert I. King)\n\n                       Limbaugh's Singular Focus\n\n       Rush Limbaugh was responding to my observation during \n     Gordon Peterson's ``Inside Washington'' show on ABC-7 last \n     weekend that an anti-Obama mood was fueling some of the \n     opposition to getting anything done in Washington. Referring \n     to Limbaugh's commentary earlier in the week, I said that he \n     made ``no reference to saving the country, no such reference \n     to averting disaster with the debt ceiling. It was a question \n     of helping or hurting Obama.''\n\n[[Page S5102]]\n\n       I wasn't wrong. Limbaugh continued his anti-Obama rant \n     during last Monday's show: ``Mr. King is, in a way, exactly \n     right. . . . The point is you can't save the country if you \n     don't defeat Obama.''\n       Which helps explain the virtual knee-jerk opposition of \n     right-wing Republicans to anything that comes out of the \n     Obama administration. It also explains their willingness to \n     put the country on the path to economic suicide if the \n     downgrading of U.S. debt will help bring down President \n     Obama. For wingers, there is no price too high to pay to \n     break Obama. Sabotaging the president of the United States \n     is, in their view, good for the country.\n       It seems to have been ever thus. Limbaugh was pulling for \n     the Obama administration's downfall even before the president \n     took the oath of office. Four days prior to Obama's \n     inauguration as the nation's 44th chief executive, Limbaugh \n     famously declared, ``I hope he fails.''\n       Barack Obama, contends Limbaugh, is the danger from which \n     America must be saved.\n       As the Limbaugh camp sees it, Obama is a threat to the \n     American way of life. They hold that he is the cause of 9 \n     percent unemployment and the reason homeowners are \n     underwater. Three years of Barack Obama--not eight years of \n     George W. Bush--are why prosperity is beyond the reach of \n     many Americans. And it is the prospect of, in Limbaugh's \n     words, ``Obama having control over all the money and choosing \n     to whom to send it, to distribute it, or redistribute it,'' \n     that threatens America.\n       That Obama hasn't collapsed keeps conservatives like \n     Limbaugh up nights. They won't acknowledge it, but under \n     Obama's leadership--and within three years after inheriting \n     one of America's worst enemies--a bleeding al-Qaeda is on the \n     run, and Osama bin Laden is swimming with the fishes.\n       Troops are finally coming home from a costly, Bush-inspired \n     Iraq war that is leaving our arch regional foe, Iran, \n     strategically better off than it was before the U.S. \n     invasion.\n       The automobile and financial services industries--on the \n     ropes when Bush left office--are back on their feet. For the \n     first time, 30 million uninsured Americans will face the \n     future with health insurance.\n       Not to mention the mess Bush left behind: a projected $1.2 \n     trillion deficit, two wars and huge tax cuts for the \n     wealthy--all financed by borrowing.\n       Obama, to be sure, has spent trillions, in part because he \n     was trying to extend health-care coverage and stave off \n     another depression. But prior presidents incurred most of the \n     nation's $14.3 trillion debt.\n       The country is going downhill, Limbaugh asserts, ``because \n     of policies implemented by [Obama] who, I don't care, is \n     either clueless or is himself a saboteur.'' Note the \n     allusions to stupidity and subversion--staple slurs in the \n     conservative book of slime.\n       Make no mistake that is the mindset that stands in the way \n     of saving the country.\n       Produce a package that staves off default, lifts the debt \n     ceiling high enough to cover federal obligations into 2013, \n     reins in the budget by cutting $4.5 trillion over the next \n     decade through spending reductions and the elimination of tax \n     loopholes and tax breaks benefiting the rich, and guess what? \n     A solid phalanx of congressional right-wingers, egged on by \n     Limbaugh, says no. And, hell no, if it means Barack Obama \n     might share the credit.\n       Getting Obama isn't just an important conservative \n     Republican goal; it seems to be their only goal.\n       And Limbaugh has the unmitigated gall to go on and on about \n     how much he cares about saving the country, telling his \n     listeners: ``Every waking moment . . . even when I am on the \n     golf course, I care.''\n       Now that's what you call sacrifice.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Alaska, who has been an \nabsolutely outstanding champion for small business not only in Alaska \nbut around the Nation, who will talk with us about this short-term, \nrepeat, 6-month uncertainty and how damaging that would be to \nbusinesses in Alaska. I thank the Senator for joining us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana very \nmuch. I am happy to join my friend from Louisiana and my friend from \nMinnesota. I am a small business owner. I have been from my teenage \nyears. My wife is a small business owner. I understand the plight they \ngo through--how to raise capital, how to start a small business, how to \ntake a dream to reality. Sometimes those dreams do not work out so \nwell, and what happens next?\n  As we sit here and talk about the short term versus the long term, in \nbusiness you lay out a business plan. It is a long-term plan. \nBusinesses that set a short-term plan are the ones that have those big \nbanners that say: ``Going out of business.'' Those are the short-term \nplanners in the business world.\n  We debate today--and I think we are a lot closer than maybe the media \nlikes to portray--but it is a difference between in the next 6 months \ndo we deal with this issue and have another debt limit vote in 6 months \nfrom now, and another 6 months later, and 6 months, or do we plan for \nthe long term, get our economy more stable, more certain, so businesses \ncan invest and do the right thing?\n  As I said at the beginning, any business that you see that has a \nshort-term plan usually has a sign that says: ``Going out of business'' \nor ``Quitting.''\n  We are not going to quit. We are going to have a long-term plan.\n  I heard earlier today my colleague and friend from Georgia, from the \nother side, who practiced in real estate, Senator Isakson. Both of us \nhave been in the real estate business for many years. As he said, also, \nwe are closer than people think we are. But we have some slight \ndifferences, ones we need to make sure we resolve and move to a long-\nterm plan.\n  Earlier this week, I challenged businesses that want to have a short-\nterm plan to call my office; I would be happy to mention them on the \nfloor of the Senate. I waited and I waited and I waited. No one--not \none business--called my office and said: Give me a short-term plan. But \nI will tell you, several Alaskan businesses did call my office and say: \nCompromise. Get a long-term plan.\n  Let me read to you from just a couple.\n  JoeMarie Thomson from Anchorage owns Crucible Designs, a Web site \ndesign firm. She writes:\n\n       I'm very concerned about the posturing surrounding the debt \n     ceiling negotiations. As a small business owner I'm already \n     seeing the effects of this uncertainty. My clients are also \n     small business owners and so I am right in the line of fire \n     on this one.\n       I've heard from more than a few clients that if the U.S. \n     defaults on the debt that the resulting interest rates will \n     put them out of business. With this fear increasing the \n     closer we get to August 2, it's really hurting my bottom \n     line.\n\n  Another one, Rita Fleckenstein from Anchorage, owns Rita's Family \nDaycare, a small daycare center for children. Her husband is retired \nAir Force.\n\n       It is my sincere hope that you will try to influence your \n     other Alaskan partners to take a balanced approach to solve \n     the current budget crisis. I am a small business owner and \n     loyal Alaskan voter and I am tired of all this posturing \n     among the House members.\n\n  She is referring to the debate that occurred last night.\n  A man from Anchorage:\n\n       I am a long time Alaskan, father of two, Iraq war veteran, \n     small business owner, and my small business provides \n     engineers and managers to the oil and gas industry in Alaska. \n     I am a registered independent but am conservative in regards \n     to budgetary issues.\n       . . . As a small business owner, I would never jeopardize \n     the well being of my family, my employees, or my clients in \n     regards to a business agreement or transaction. There is \n     always room to compromise and allow all parties engaged in \n     the deal to walk away with the feeling they got a fair deal. \n     . . . I fully expect increases in my taxes and am ok with \n     that in order to continue to support our country.\n\n  Another one, actually from someone I know well, who owns Arctic Wire \nand Rope, Eric McCallum. He won Alaskan manufacturer of the year in \n1986 and employs 14 people. He is important to our oil and gas \nindustry. Fortunately, Eric has no debt, but he is terribly concerned \nabout the debt crisis. He says small businesses like his are the \n``canary in the mineshaft'' and will be negatively impacted more than \nbig businesses. Eric states:\n\n       There will be far more impact on Main Street than Wall \n     Street from this debt crisis.\n\n  Eric adds that he is more than willing to pay his fair share to help \nbalance the Federal budget.\n  These have come in and in and in, and it is amazing to see what \npeople are talking about in my State. There are 68,000 small businesses \nin Alaska. My wife is one of those. Almost 16,000 employ many \nemployees. The fastest growing segment of our business community in \nAlaska is small business, growing by almost 31 percent over the last 6 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, to the Senator from Louisiana, \nas a small businessperson, all they want to see is certainty. They want \nthe bickering, the partisan bickering to end. They want certainty so \nthey can continue to invest and see their future.\n  There are just some simple differences that I think the folks from \nboth sides can sit down and work through. One is, clearly, how long\n\n[[Page S5103]]\n\nshould this debt limit increase go for? As I said earlier, if you do a \nshort term, that is the business that is saying: I quit. I am out of \nbusiness. If you do a long term, it gives certainty and opportunity to \nplan and build for the future.\n  Should we have a vote up or down separate from the debt limit issue \non a balanced budget amendment? It is a great debate. More than likely, \nwe will probably have that debate. I have supported a balanced budget \namendment before. But it is time we raise the debt limit to create the \nlong-term certainty we need for our small business community not only \nin Alaska but throughout this country, where they are the backbone that \nwill drive this economy in the right direction.\n  It is an honor, again, to be down here with the chairwoman of the \nSmall Business Committee. She has worked tirelessly on bill after bill. \nWe were unsuccessful this year on a couple that were critical to small \nbusinesses because we could not get past the logjam. Maybe this will \nbreak the pathway, if we can get past this debt limit in a bipartisan \nway, where we can then bring many more other small business bills back \nto the floor because what I hear most often from Alaskans, beside the \nfrustration of what is going on here, is they want us to focus on \nbuilding this economy, to get regulation out of the way, to help invest \nin the needed things to ensure that businesses can create the jobs we \ndesperately need not only for the people who are unemployed today, but \nfor future generations. That is what we need.\n  So, again, Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to speak. \nAgain, I thank my friend from Louisiana for the opportunity to say a \nfew words but also for her leadership and her continued tenacity to \nfight for the small businessperson every single day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have in this segment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senators, again, from \nMinnesota and Alaska for coming and making the point and underlying and \nscoring the point that this filibuster the Republican caucus is holding \ntoday--not allowing us to have a simple majority vote on the Reid \nplan--is hurting business.\n  As the Senator said, this is a pattern, unfortunately, it seems like \ncoming from the other side. We had to overcome their filibuster just \nlast year to pass the small business bill that is now having a terrific \neffect throughout the country in some pockets. We still are not where \nwe would like to be, of course, in job creation, and the recovery is \nslow. I am starting to think that maybe that is what they want--for the \nrecovery to be slow.\n  Then they filibustered the SBIR bill, which is the largest single \nresearch investment program for small businesses in America. We still \ncannot get that passed. They are filibustered.\n  Then they filibustered the EDA bill, which is one of the most \nimportant programs to Chambers of Commerce, which is not a liberal \nstronghold in America. Now they are filibustering this bill and \ndemanding a two-step solution, and no businessperson has written to \nCongress saying they think that is a good way to go.\n  The opposite. They are saying: Get this over with now. The \nuncertainty is killing us.\n  I will yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Just for a question. The way I understand this is, for \npeople who may be watching or listening, a filibuster requires 60 \nvotes. All we are asking for is the same thing the House of \nRepresentatives did last night on their bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. A simple majority.\n  Mr. BEGICH. A simple majority, allow an up-or-down vote so we can \ndetermine what plan or what action we take. That is all we are asking \nfor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It would be clear if we could get 51 votes that the \nReid plan would pass, just like the Boehner plan passed. Neither one \ncan get the other side to agree. But at least then we would have the \nbasis for a compromise.\n  But, no, the Republicans have decided we cannot have that vote. So \nthis is getting strung out, and with every hour, with every day, \nbusinesses are hurting. Maybe that is what they want because, then, the \nPresident can be blamed for businesses not doing well, when they are \nthe ones who are stepping in the way.\n  The details from the budget summary that I stated: 14 percent of the \nrevenues coming in--this is on the Web site for anybody who wants to \nknow. I have letters from Louisiana that I printed in the Record from \nbusinesses that have written to me saying: Not a two-step process, a \none-step process. Get a good solution and move on.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to begin by speaking for just a \nmoment about some comments the distinguished majority leader gave this \nafternoon in his opening comments and then talk a little bit about the \ngeneral issue we are faced with--frankly, in an effort to see if we can \ncome to common ground.\n  Let me start with a couple comments the majority leader made this \nafternoon. He has talked more than once about the fact that in his \nview, the Republican leaders have wasted time by pursuing a proposal \nthey knew the Senate would not pass. I think there are two things to \nsay about that.\n  One could say the same about the majority leader's proposal. He hopes \nthe Senate will not pass that either. So we have two proposals, one by \nSpeaker Boehner that passed the House of Representatives but Senator \nReid declared dead on arrival, and indeed it was tabled last night; the \nother, the Reid proposal, which is also dead on arrival in the Senate. \nAs Leader McConnell noted this morning, there is a letter that has \nsufficient signatures on it to defeat it, and, in addition to that, I \ncan tell you I have talked to my colleagues--all my Republican \ncolleagues--and it will be defeated. I think the majority leader knows \nthat.\n  So the only question with regard to the Senate majority leader's \nproposal is, Why would we waste additional time debating a proposal we \nknow is going to fail? Why have that vote at 1 a.m. tomorrow morning? \nLet's get it done, get it over with, and move forward. I think that is \nthe best way to try to reach a conclusion.\n  I would also note the reason the majority leader declared the Boehner \nproposal dead was for two reasons; one, because it had a balanced \nbudgeted amendment attached to it. I just wish to make the point that I \nknow most of my Democratic colleagues do not support a balanced budget \namendment. But I do think it is worth noting that depending upon which \npoll, 70, 80, more than 80 percent of the American people support a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I do not think we can blame Speaker Boehner for including a balanced \nbudget amendment in the Boehner legislation that was sent over here. It \nis pretty logical that if the American people say they support \nsomething with that degree of support, that we would include it in \nlegislation to try to balance the budget.\n  But the majority leader here said no. That means it is dead on \narrival in the Senate. That should tell us something about the Senate \nDemocrats. President Obama talks about the need for a balanced \napproach. Speaker Boehner says: How about a balanced budget? Leader \nReid says no. That is the first point.\n  It seems to me the second point is there is a difference of opinion \nabout how long this debt ceiling extension should last. Speaker Boehner \nhas always said there should be at least a dollar-for-dollar reduction \nin spending for every $1 the debt ceiling is increased. I think that \nmakes sense. If we are going to increase the debt ceiling $2.4 \ntrillion, then we ought to have $2.4 trillion in savings; otherwise, we \nare going to have to keep on raising the debt ceiling over and over. I \nwould note the savings are savings that occur over a 10-year period of \ntime. So it is not as though we are cutting that immediately, although \nthe debt ceiling\n\n[[Page S5104]]\n\nextension would be $2.4 trillion for just the next 16 months. That is \nhow much debt we are going to accumulate, just to the end of President \nObama's term in office.\n  There is not enough savings to do that, that has been agreed to. \nRepublicans have all kinds of ideas about savings that could get to \n$2.5 trillion. Democrats have said no. The only thing we can agree on \nis about $1.2 trillion. So the Republican leader said: Fine, let's do a \ndebt extension equal to $1.2 trillion. That takes us at least through \nthe end of the year, and then we will have a committee--both sides \nagree we need to have a select committee that will make recommendations \nfor how to get the remainder of the savings and potentially more. That \nis a good idea.\n  But the President has said he does not want to rely on that process \nbecause maybe it will not result in actual savings he can count on. He \nmight have to veto it. For whatever reason, he is not confident it \nwould occur, and he does not want to have to face this issue again at \nthe time he is campaigning for election. I do not blame him for that. \nHe might well view it as a distraction. It certainly is unsettling to \nthe markets.\n  But I would argue that as much it is a result that we would like to \navoid, by the same token, it does focus the public's attention on what \nwe need to do around here, which is reduce spending. We did not get \ninto this mess for any other reason other than the fact that we have \nspent too much money.\n  We have had annual spending of about $1.2 trillion since President \nObama became President. We have had annual deficits of about $1.4 \ntrillion. Do we see any connection there? Obviously, our problem is \nspending. So we need to get a handle on that. That is why I think the \nBoehner proposal made sense, but the leader says it was dead on \narrival. He was right. The Reid proposal is also dead on arrival. Let's \nget it over with and move on to a solution we can agree with.\n  The second thing I wanted to mention, the majority leader has been \nvery critical of what he calls tea party extremists, people who do not \nwant to vote to increase the debt ceiling under any circumstances. It \nkind of reminds me of Senator Barack Obama, who voted against extending \nthe debt ceiling, and the language is eerily similar. It is ``failed \nleadership'' he pronounced. Tea party folks say this represents failed \nleadership, so we are not going to vote for a debt extension.\n  The President did not vote for the debt ceiling extension when he was \na Member of this body. I do not say that to criticize the President but \nrather just to suggest to my colleagues that we ought to have the same \nstandard applied to all. If they think it is wrong for the tea party \npeople to stand on principle and say we are not going to raise the debt \nceiling, then they can say the same about President Obama when he was a \nSenator. But if they are going to criticize the tea party folks for \nstanding on principle, criticizing leadership, saying they do not want \nto raise the debt ceiling, they might want to think about what their \ncolleague, then-Senator Obama, did.\n  The fact is, name calling does not help. Let's stop talking about \nextremist tea party folks. I would not call the President an extremist \nwhen he voted against the debt ceiling extension. He has already \nadmitted he made a mistake. Republicans in the leadership in both the \nHouse and Senate have made it clear we believe the debt ceiling should \nbe extended. We want to be able to do that, for a variety of reasons we \nhave discussed.\n  We do not want to put the American economy in jeopardy. We do not \nwant to jeopardize the savings of people who could see those savings \ndissipate if the stock market continues to go down, and so we do need \nto get this issue behind us.\n  The majority leader complained this morning that Republicans need to \ncome talk to him. The minority leader needs to come and talk to him. He \nsaid I would have hoped someone would come to us, come to the table, \nand he specifically referred to Senator McConnell.\n  My response is, Why do the Republicans always have to come up with \nthe ideas? Three times the House of Representatives has passed a \nproposal only to be criticized each time by the Democrats who invite \nthem to come up with proposals. Remember, the first was the Ryan \nbudget--savaged by my Democratic colleagues and by the President.\n  House Republicans said yes; Senate Democrats said no. Then, they came \nup with cut, cap, and balance, something that is pretty popular around \nthe country. It would cut spending, would cap it, and would ultimately \nhave a balanced budget amendment that would keep it capped. Democrats \nroundly criticized that. In the Senate, they voted it down.\n  Finally, John Boehner came up with his last proposal, and it also \nincluded a balanced budget amendment--declared dead on arrival. The \nthird time Democrats said no. I think Republican leaders are getting a \nlittle tired of being invited by our Democratic friends to come up with \nideas, only to have them voted down and criticized. Where is the \nDemocratic proposal? Where is the proposal by the President? I think it \nis time for Democrats to come up with an idea and maybe Republicans can \ntake a look at it to see whether we like it.\n\n  Finally, the majority leader said we have another filibuster in our \npath. ``They,'' meaning Republicans stall and delay. Last night, Leader \nMcConnell said: Let's have the vote tonight, right now. We do not need \nto stall or delay another minute.\n  The majority leader said: No, I do not want to vote on my proposal \nyet. I want to vote on it at 1 a.m. on Sunday morning. Leader McConnell \nsaid today: We are ready to vote on it today without delay--now, at 3 \no'clock, at 6 o'clock, whatever. Let's vote on it. We do not need to \ncontinue to waste time. The majority leader said: No, we will vote on \nit at 1 a.m, Sunday morning. OK. I will be here. But I wonder what the \nAmerican people think of such a dysfunctional body that we cannot even, \nby unanimous consent, bring a matter to the Senate floor, vote on this \nmotion to invoke cloture to proceed to the leader's bill.\n  Those are some things I just wanted to comment on that the leader had \nto say. Finally, what I would like to do is ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record, at the close of my remarks, a Wall Street \nJournal editorial entitled ``The Road to a Downgrade,'' dated July 28.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me quote from a piece of this. The \neditorial starts by noting that the President:\n\n     . . . inherited a recession and responded by blowing up the \n     U.S. balance sheet. Spending as a share of GDP in the last \n     three years is higher than at any time since 1946. In three \n     years the debt has increased by more than $4 trillion thanks \n     to stimulus, cash for clunkers, mortgage modification \n     programs, 99 weeks of jobless benefits, record expansions in \n     Medicaid, and more.\n       The forecast is for $8 trillion to $10 trillion more in red \n     ink through 2021. Mr. Obama hinted in the press conference \n     earlier this month that if it weren't for Republicans, he'd \n     want another stimulus.\n\n  Wall Street Journal says:\n\n       Scary thought: None of this includes the ObamaCare \n     entitlement that will place 30 million more Americans on \n     government health rolls.\n\n  Then they conclude:\n\n       This is the road to fiscal perdition. The looming debt \n     downgrade only confirms what everyone knows: Congress has \n     made so many promises to so many Americans that there is no \n     conceivable way those promises can be kept. Tax rates might \n     have to rise to 60 percent, 70 percent, even 80 percent to \n     raise the revenues to finance these promises, but that would \n     be economically ruinous.\n\n  It concludes:\n\n       This insistence on no reform reinforces the notion that our \n     entitlement state is too big to afford but also too big to \n     change politically. This is how a AAA country becomes AA, the \n     first step on the march to Greece.\n\n  Charles Krauthammer, a terrific observer of the political scene, in \nhis column Friday in the Washington Post, concluded with the following \nwords:\n\n       Obama faces two massive problems--jobs and debt. They're \n     both the result of his spectacularly failed Keynesian gamble: \n     massive spending that left us a stagnant economy with high \n     and chronic unemployment--and a staggering debt burden.\n\n  That is the problem, a staggering debt burden that requires us to \nincrease our debt ceiling, and Republicans are saying: In order to stop \nthis cycle of more promises and more spending, we have to apply some \naccountability, some common sense, some good judgment. And that means,\n\n[[Page S5105]]\n\nfirst and foremost, stop the spending. I note, as I said before, that \nunder President Obama annual spending has gone up $1.2 trillion in each \nof the years and the deficit by $1.4 trillion. I ask again, do you \nnotice any correlation there? That is the problem.\n\n  I know my Democratic colleagues love to complain about President \nBush. I note that in the year 2007--a year before the recession--the \ndeficit under President Bush was just $161 billion--a 10th of what the \ndeficit is today.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues and I all need to focus on the issue \nbefore us, which is to begin to reduce spending, to insert some \naccountability into the process, and to include some system changes so \nthat we can't continue this unwieldy government spending we never seem \nto be able to stop. The evidence of how difficult it is is the fact \nthat for the last 4 weeks now we have been arguing with each other \nabout how we are going to effect $2.4 trillion in savings in order to \nextend the debt ceiling by $2.4 trillion. We can't figure out a way to \ndo it. That should show you what is wrong with our system and why we \nneed to put in some accountability.\n  I am confident that over the next 48 hours or so, the White House and \nlegislative leaders are going to find a way to both extend the debt \nceiling and come up with savings that begin to create a downpayment on \nthis incredible debt as well as system reforms that will give not just \nthe markets but American businesses and families some sense of \nassurance that we will be able, in the future, to avoid the problem \nsome European countries are going through right now. But that will mean \nwe have to forget about this business of tax increases--which is the \nworst medicine possible in a time of recession, as the President \nhimself noted--find ways to reduce spending we can agree upon, provide \naccountability in our government in the future, and in that way assure \neveryone that we can continue to grow, that growth will produce \nprosperity and, ironically, more revenues to the Federal Treasury but, \nmore importantly, the standard of living Americans have become \naccustomed to and have every right to expect.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, July 28, 2011]\n\n                        The Road to a Downgrade\n\n       Even without a debt default, it looks increasingly possible \n     that the world's credit rating agencies will soon downgrade \n     U.S. debt from the AAA standing it has enjoyed for decades.\n       A downgrade isn't catastrophic because global financial \n     markets decide the creditworthiness of U.S. securities, not \n     Moody's and Standard & Poor's. The good news is that \n     investors still regard Treasury bonds, which carry the full \n     faith and credit of the U.S. government, as a near zero-risk \n     investment. But a downgrade will raise the cost of credit, \n     especially for states and institutions whose debt is pegged \n     to Treasurys. Above all a downgrade is a symbol of fiscal \n     mismanagement and an omen of worse to come if we continue the \n     same habits.\n       President Obama will deserve much of the blame for the \n     spending blowout of his first two years (see the nearby \n     chart). But the origins of this downgrade go back decades, \n     and so this is a good time to review the policies that \n     brought us to this sad chapter and $14.3 trillion of debt.\n       FDR began the entitlement era with the New Deal and Social \n     Security, but for decades it remained relatively limited. \n     Spending fell dramatically after the end of World War II and \n     the U.S. debt burden fell rapidly from 100% of GDP. That \n     changed in the mid-1960s with LBJ's Great Society and the \n     dawn of the health-care state. Medicare and Medicaid were \n     launched in 1965 with fairy tale estimates of future costs.\n       Medicare, the program for the elderly, was supposed to cost \n     $12 billion by 1990 but instead spent $110 billion. The costs \n     of Medicaid, the program for the poor, have exploded as \n     politicians like California Democrat Henry Waxman expanded \n     eligibility and coverage. In inflation-adjusted dollars, \n     Medicaid cost $4 billion in 1966, $41 billion in 1986 and \n     $243 billion last year.\n       Rather than bending the cost curve down, the government as \n     third-party payer led to a medical price spiral.\n       LBJ launched other welfare programs--public housing, food \n     stamps and many more--that have also grown over time. Last \n     year, the panoply of welfare programs spent about $20,000 for \n     every man, woman and child in poverty, according to Robert \n     Rector of the Heritage Foundation.\n       Social Security's fiscal trouble began in earnest in 1972 \n     with bills that increased benefits immediately by 20%, added \n     an annual cost of living adjustment, and created a benefit \n     escalator requiring payments to rise with wages, not \n     inflation. This and other tweaks by Democrat Wilbur Mills \n     added trillions of dollars to the program's unfunded \n     liabilities. Believe it or not, these 1972 amendments were \n     added to a debt-ceiling bill.\n       None of these benefit expansions were subject to annual \n     budget review and thus they grew by automatic pilot. They are \n     sometimes called ``mandatory spending'' because Congress is \n     required by law to make payments to those who meet \n     eligibility standards, regardless of other spending needs or \n     tax revenues.\n       According to the most recent government data, today some \n     50.5 million Americans are on Medicaid, 46.5 million are on \n     Medicare, 52 million on Social Security, five million on SSI, \n     7.5 million on unemployment insurance, and 44.6 million on \n     food stamps and other nutrition programs. Some 24 million get \n     the earned-income tax credit, a cash income supplement.\n       By 2010 such payments to individuals were 66% of the \n     federal budget, up from 28% in 1965. (See the second chart.) \n     We now spend $2.1 trillion a year on these redistribution \n     programs, and the 75 million baby boomers are only starting \n     to retire.\n       We suspect that in the 1960s as now--with ObamaCare--\n     liberals knew they had created fiscal time-bombs. They simply \n     assumed that taxes would keep rising to pay for it all, as \n     they have in Europe.\n       On Monday night Mr. Obama blamed President George W. Bush's \n     ``two wars'' for the debt buildup. But national defense \n     spending was 7.4% of GDP and 42.8% of outlays in 1965, and \n     only 4.8% of GDP and 20.1% of federal outlays in 2010. \n     Defense has not caused the debt crisis.\n       Many on the left still blame Ronald Reagan, but the debt \n     increase in the 1980s financed a robust economic expansion \n     and victory in the Cold War. Debt held by the public at the \n     end of the Reagan years was much lower as a share of GDP (41% \n     in 1988 and still only 40.3% in 2008) compared to the \n     estimated 72% in fiscal 2011. That Cold War victory made \n     possible the peace dividend that allowed Bill Clinton to \n     balance the budget in the 1990s by cutting defense spending \n     to 3% of GDP from nearly 6% in 1988.\n       Mr. Bush and Republicans did prove after 9/11 that the \n     Washington urge to spend and borrow is bipartisan. \n     Republicans launched a Medicare drug benefit, record outlays \n     on education, the most expensive transportation bill in \n     history, and home ownership aid that contributed to the \n     housing bubble. The GOP's blunder was refusing to cut \n     domestic spending to finance the war on terrorism. Guns and \n     butter blowouts never last.\n       Then came Mr. Obama, arguably the most spendthrift \n     president in history. He inherited a recession and responded \n     by blowing up the U.S. balance sheet. Spending as a share of \n     GDP in the last three years is higher than at any time since \n     1946. In three years the debt has increased by more than $4 \n     trillion thanks to stimulus, cash for clunkers, mortgage \n     modification programs, 99 weeks of jobless benefits, record \n     expansions in Medicaid, and more.\n       The forecast is for $8 trillion to $10 trillion more in red \n     ink through 2021. Mr. Obama hinted in a press conference \n     earlier this month that if it weren't for Republicans, he'd \n     want another stimulus. Scary thought: None of this includes \n     the ObamaCare entitlement that will place 30 million more \n     Americans on government health rolls.\n       This is the road to fiscal perdition. The looming debt \n     downgrade only confirms what everyone knows: Congress has \n     made so many promises to so many Americans that there is no \n     conceivable way those promises can be kept. Tax rates might \n     have to rise to 60%, 70%, even 80% to raise the revenues to \n     finance these promises, but that would be economically \n     ruinous.\n       Yet Mr. Obama and most Democrats still oppose any serious \n     reform of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. This \n     insistence on no reform reinforces the notion that our \n     entitlement state is too big to afford but also too big to \n     change politically. This is how a AAA country becomes AA, the \n     first step on the march to Greece.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Then 12\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I rise on the floor today to speak on the \ntremendous issue that has captivated the attention of our country.\n  I do not enjoy or relish the partisan role of attack dog. I never \nfound any fun in that. I don't think it is constructive, and I don't \nintend to become that in the Senate.\n  I have only been here for 7 months, which means I haven't been here \nlong enough to think any of the stuff that is going on is normal. I \ncertainly don't think anything that goes on around here too often is \nnormal. So I think the fact that I have only been here for 7 months has \nserved me well in that regard.\n  One of the things I have noticed this week is that Washington is full \nof--and rightfully so--people from all over the world and our country \nwho have traveled here this week to come and watch\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\ntheir government at work and to see the monuments of the city, and they \nhave found themselves in the middle of this debate.\n  I think it is important to remind people about what we are debating. \nIt is not a complicated issue. It is straightforward, and here is the \nway I describe it. The United States--and these are rough numbers but \naccurate--spends about $300 billion a month. It has $180 billion a \nmonth that comes to the Federal Government through taxes and other \nsources of revenue. That means that in order to meet its bills at the \nend of every month, it needs to borrow $120 billion.\n  For much of the history of this country, there have been increases in \nthe debt limit and the ability to borrow money. But what has happened \nover the last few years is that it is no longer a routine vote because \nthe people who give us our credit rating are saying: Too much of the \nmoney you spend every month is borrowed, and we want you to show us how \nover the next 10 years you are going to borrow less as a percentage of \nwhat you spend. So that is why, for years, where the debt limit was \nroutine, it can no longer be routine.\n  This wasn't just made up in a conservative think tank. The reality is \nthat we cannot continue to borrow 40 to 41 percent of every dollar the \ngovernment spends, which is what brought us to this point. You would \nthink that, seeing that, our government and leaders in both parties \nwould react to that immediately and work on it.\n  I have heard a lot of talk today about delaying tactics and delaying \nvotes. I argue to you that this issue has been delayed at least for the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ years. In the 2 years before I even came here, neither this \nChamber nor the other proposed or passed a budget. It is a startling \nfigure that for the last 2 years this government has operated without a \nbudget. Think about that. Two years have gone by without a budget.\n  The first 2 years President Obama was in office, no budget. Some \npeople would stay: Well, that is because of the partisanship in \nWashington. That is not true. In the 2 years before I got here, the \nHouse and Senate were controlled by members of the Democratic Party, \nthe President's party. In this Chamber, in at least 1 of those 2 years, \nthey had 60 votes; 60 out of the 100 Members here caucused with the \nDemocrats. On Christmas Eve of 2009, they were able to pass a health \ncare bill that was very controversial because they had the 60 votes in \nthe President's party.\n  Do you know how long it has been since this Chamber proposed a \nbudget? It has been 822 days. That is a long time. A lot of things have \nhappened in the last 822 days, but proposing a budget is not one of \nthem. We got here in January. Seven months have passed, and there is \nstill no budget. Again, there has not been a budget passed, proposed, \nor offered, and there is still no budget--822 days and every single day \nI have been here.\n  In the last 7 days on this debt debate, we have finally seen a \nproposal from the Senator from Nevada, the majority leader. You would \nthink he would have brought it to the floor. Not until last night. \nAgain, he offered a proposal over the weekend, and still for 6 days we \nsat around and we did nothing around here. It was never brought to a \nvote.\n  You would think these issues would have been worked on in January, \nFebruary, and March--nothing. This Chamber has done nothing. Talk about \ndelay tactics--they have been delaying for 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  The President doesn't have the luxury of some of these things. By \nlaw, he has to propose a budget. And he did. I will tell you how \nridiculous that budget was. Not a single Member of the Senate voted for \nit, including Democrats. It increased the debt. That is how absurd the \nbudget was.\n  Where is the President's plan? We have not seen it. Here is the \nPresident's plan: a blank sheet of paper. He hasn't offered a plan. \nAgain, if this were a Republican President, I would say the same thing. \nI do not understand how, on an issue of this magnitude, of this \ngenerational importance, the President of the United States has not \noffered a plan. If somebody has seen the President's plan, please send \nit to me because nobody else has seen it. It doesn't exist.\n  This has been their plan all along, by the way. The plan all along \nwas not to take a position, let the days count down until we got to \nthis point, with 72 hours to go, and force a vote on something they \nwanted. I believe that has been the plan the entire time. You can see \nit carrying itself out.\n  Do you want to know why people across America get grossed out by \npolitics? It is by watching this kind of stuff happening. First of all, \ntoday and for much of this time, I have heard attacks and name-calling. \nIf we had $1 billion for every time I hear the words ``tea party \nextremists,'' we could solve the debt problem.\n  Let me read some quotes about the debt limit. I found some pretty \nextreme quotes, and here is one:\n\n       The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's \n     debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. America has a \n     debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve \n     better. I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase \n     America's debt limit.\n\n  That is from a tea party extremist, right? No. This is a quote from \nMarch 16, 2006, from then-Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.\n  I found another extremist quote:\n\n       Because this massive accumulation of debt was predicted, \n     because it was foreseeable, because it was unnecessary, \n     because it was the result of willful and reckless disregard \n     for the warnings that were given and for the fundamentals of \n     economic management, I am voting against the debt limit \n     increase.\n\n  That must be a tea party extremist Member of the House, right? No. \nThis is from March 16, 2006, from Senator Joe Biden of Delaware.\n  Last but not least is a quote from September 27, 2007:\n\n       I find it distasteful and disturbing to increase the debt \n     limit yet again. Clearly, we need to change course. And this \n     debt limit bill is just another reminder of that.\n\n  That is Majority Leader Reid from Nevada on that date in 2007.\n  Yet now these same quotes in this context, where we are talking about \nraising the debt limit more than it has ever been raised in one vote, \nis extremism? This name-calling is absurd, and it sets this process \nback.\n  The other thing I hear: Oh, it is not reasonable. It is a waste of \ntime. This bill cannot pass the Senate--talking about the House bill. \nDoes that disqualify a bill? Well, the Senate bill cannot even pass in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. RUBIO. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator, and I appreciate it.\n  I ask the Senator this: As ironic as it may be that on occasion \npeople in the past have indeed voted against the debt limit--both \nRepublicans and Democrats alike--is it not true that in those \nsituations, those votes did not hold the Nation hostage, did not come \nat a moment of enormous economic fragility, as we are in today, and did \nnot run the risk of default because it was going to pass overwhelmingly \nevery time? Is that not true?\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. I will say two things. First, if the Senator from \nIllinois, Barack Obama, had gotten his way, we would have been in the \nsame position we are in right now. He voted against it. The President \nhas now said he made a mistake and would not have said that were he \nhere today. My point is that the rhetoric 2 years ago was not \nconsidered extremist language.\n  Now, I think it is a myth. There may be a handful of people in the \nHouse and Senate, perhaps, who believe the Nation doesn't have to raise \nthe debt limit, but by and large everybody recognizes that something \nmust be done about it. I speak for myself, not for any other Member of \nthe Chamber.\n  What I have also said is that it would be a terrible mistake to lose \nthis opportunity to do something meaningful about the debt and that the \ndebt limit gives us an opportunity to do something meaningful about the \ndebt because the crisis America faces is not one I have defined but one \ndefined by the ratings houses and agencies that have said: If you do \nnot get spending in order, we don't care whether you raise the debt \nlimit or not, we will downgrade you. What that means is an increase in \ninterest payments for every American.\n  Mr. KERRY. If the Senator will yield, I appreciate what the Senator \nis saying. First of all, everybody understands the danger of the rating \nagencies right now. The problem is, we have to reach across the aisle \nand negotiate.\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\nWe have to come to an agreement. Right now, there is not a lot of \nnegotiating going on.\n  I ask the Senator if he doesn't agree that there is an enormous \ndifference between the--a moment ago, the Senator said ``if he had \ngotten his way.'' The whole point is that everybody knew he wasn't \nabout to get his way. That was a truly symbolic vote. Today, however, \nis it not true that we are on the brink of a default, and the absence \nof negotiation or of a settlement presents us with a far more serious \nconsequence to the unwillingness to raise the debt ceiling today?\n  Mr. RUBIO. I just ask, is it possible to negotiate with someone who \ndoes not have a plan or will not offer a plan or put a plan on the \ntable? The finger-pointing is relevant, but it is not an essential \nissue here.\n  Also, in March of this year--March 30, to be exact--I wrote an op-ed \npiece that ran in the Wall Street Journal which outlined the things I \nwas looking for to be a part of this debate. I was told in March of \nthis year that we didn't have enough time to do all those things, \nalthough later we found that perhaps we did--this grand bargain.\n  I am prepared, as I stand here today, if there is a meeting going on \nafter this, I am prepared to discuss the things I believe we need to \ndo, not just to raise the debt limit--raising the debt limit is the \neasiest thing this country has to do right now. That is one vote away. \nIt is hard to show the world we are serious about putting our spending \nin order so that we can pay our bills down the road.\n  That is a combination of things I have outlined very clearly not just \nin March of this year in the Wall Street Journal but in repeated \nspeeches on this floor.\n  We need to do two things. We need to grow our economy. While the debt \nis the biggest issue in Washington, jobs are the biggest issue facing \nAmerica. If we can get more people back to work, we will have more \npeople paying taxes. If we had more people paying taxes, we would have \nmore revenue for our government. So that is the first thing we need to \ndo, figure out how we can create jobs in America, and I think there is \nbipartisan agreement on what we can do to do that.\n\n  The President himself mentioned regulatory reform as a necessity in \nhis State of the Union. Let's do it. We have all talked about tax \nreform--flattening and simplifying our Tax Code. If there are things in \nthat Tax Code that do not belong there because they are the process of \ngood lobbying instead of good policy, then let's go after those things. \nLet's talk about that.\n  I think we all agree there have to be some changes in discretionary \nspending. But we also agree that doesn't solve the problem. That is a \nsmall piece of our overall budget. We have to save Medicare, because it \ngoes bankrupt if we leave it the way it is. We have to save Medicaid, \nbecause it goes bankrupt if we leave it the way it is.\n  I can tell that you history will back me up on what I am about to \nsay. There is no government--run by conservatives, Republicans, \nDemocrats, put whoever you want there--if given the opportunity, that \nwill not spend more money than it has. It will do it. It will do it \nevery time. That is why I believe there are at least 20 Members of the \nSenate in the other party who have voted for some version of the \nbalanced budget amendment. Yet it is something we cannot get a vote on, \nmuch less discuss here in the Senate.\n  I believe there can be compromise on those outlines. But since I \nbelieve my time is about to expire, let me close with this. Compromise \nis fantastic. I would love nothing more than to leave this building \ntomorrow night having said the Republic still works; I was able to \nstand shoulder to shoulder with people from States far from mine, with \nviews different from mine, but who love their country so much we were \nable to come together and save it when it faced this catastrophe. I \nwould love nothing more than compromise. But I would say to you that \ncompromise that is not a solution is a waste of time. If my house is on \nfire, I can't compromise about which part of the house I am going to \nsave. You save the whole house or it will all burn down. We either save \nthis country or we do not. To save it, we must seek solutions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have arrived at a moment of truth: \nThe American economy and our standing in the world hang in the balance \nas a result of the Republican plan to derail the functioning of our \ncountry and bring about the precarious prospect of a major default in \nour financial condition.\n  Democrats have bent over backward to compromise. Yet the Republicans \ncontinue to put our country in jeopardy. The American people and the \nAmerican economy are determined for a reprieve from this disaster. We \njust heard comments by our colleague from across the aisle about \ngetting our tax structure in order. It reminds me of a condition where \nthere is a fire in a house and people start arguing about the color of \nthe fire engine.\n  What we have in front of us is an imminent disaster that could upset \nthe balance of our functioning as a society and put America, for the \nfirst time, in a position of having less support from around the world; \npreventing people who are hard at work from being able to make ends \nmeet. So we ask: Isn't this a time for our Republican friends to stop \nplaying ``gotcha,'' stop putting politics ahead of the needs of our \nmiddle-class families and, instead, start putting the people before \npolitics?\n  Make no mistake, the people we serve are nervous and concerned. \nPurchasing power has declined while wage increases have been \ninsufficient for family needs. Many in America are working their \nfingers to the bone to get out of this economic squeeze and keep their \nfamilies intact, while all this time the richest among us see \nmonumental gains in their incomes and their wealth.\n  The people who have the burdens of maintaining our infrastructure, \nrunning our military, and defending the very foundation of our \ndemocratic country are struggling daily to stay in their homes, hold on \nto their health care, and get their kids to college. The American \npeople are the ones--the ordinary people, the middle-income people--who \nwill suffer the most if the Republicans force the U.S. Government to \ndefault next week. Fourteen million Americans are already out of work, \nbut more than half a million may join the unemployment line if we don't \nraise the debt limit.\n  That is only the beginning. The default crisis will send interest \nrates skyrocketing, which will be adding even more expense on the \nAmerican middle class, making it harder for them to meet basic family \nneeds. They will be forced to pay higher interest rates for mortgages, \nstudent loans, car loans, and credit cards. That money won't help \ncreate jobs or rebuild our economy. It will be going to the banks and \nto China and to investors who are going to demand higher yields for \nU.S. bond purchases because they will be seen as less reliable in their \nlikelihood of being paid back.\n  We are also likely to see another calamity on Wall Street if the \nUnited States doesn't pay its bills. The stock markets have already \nbeen seeing daily declines in anticipation of a reckless attempt to put \npolitics in the middle of a financial Armageddon. One analysis found \nthat shareholders in U.S. stocks lost more than $400 billion during the \npast week, while House Republicans were fiddling with a scheme they \nknew would never become law. But they do not want to write law, they \nwant to destroy the Obama Presidency. That is what the mission is.\n  The Dow has just had its worst week in a year, and consumers do not \nhave spare dollars for investments because their incomes are consumed \nby spending money on basic necessities, and because they are aware of \nlosses that will occur from the prospect of default.\n  Imagine what it will mean to the 401(k) savings of middle-class \nAmericans--much of it accumulated over years--if faith in our country \nand its value decline sharply as default looms ahead. Their values can \ngo down precipitously.\n  Other retirement savings can also be wiped out--all because of these \npunitive actions by Republican representatives. The pain will be \nexcruciating for the neediest Americans. Seniors living on a fixed \nincome can be forced to go\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\nwithout their Social Security checks and the critical health care they \nreceive through Medicare. We might not be able to deliver promised \nbenefits to veterans or paychecks for the men and women wearing our \ncountry's uniform in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I want to be clear: A default will injure America's reputation \nthroughout the world. It will weaken faith in the world's most \nrespected financial power, leaving our country's credibility, \nstability, and financial leadership in doubt. Simply put, defaulting on \nthe debt could trigger an economic collapse of historic proportion.\n  That is why I plead with our Republican colleagues to join us without \ndelay in adopting Majority Leader Reid's plan. Senator Reid's plan will \nprovide certainty for middle-class Americans and to the markets because \nit will provide stability through 2013, and stability is what we need \nright now.\n\n  This plan isn't perfect. Many of us, including me, believe it should \ninclude revenues. It doesn't. But that is why it is called a \ncompromise. After we adopt this plan and step back from the brink, we \nneed to work on a balanced approach to get our country back on sound \neconomic footing. That means asking the wealthiest among us to pay \ntheir fair share.\n  I am one of those who was very fortunate in my business experience. I \nstarted a company with two other fellows and we have 45,000 employees \ntoday. Why? Because our country was there for me after I served in \nuniform in World War II. I was able to get an education at Columbia \nUniversity, and we started a company called ADP. Now 45,000 people have \ntheir jobs because of ADP.\n  Our Republican colleagues have to abandon their obsession to protect \nthe wealthiest among us at an unaffordable cost to the poor and the \nmiddle class, and recognize the value of our country's human \ninfrastructure. No economy can grow if it doesn't invest in physical \ninfrastructure, such as roads, bridges, railways, and no society can \nprosper if it doesn't invest in education. We need to prop up our human \ninfrastructure to fill the future jobs in technology and science and \nresearch.\n  Let's face it, building houses and other physical facilities are \nnever built from the top down. The work requires a strong foundation to \nguarantee reliability, endurance, and safety, now and for the future. \nMiddle-class families form America's foundation--the pillars of \nstrength, faith in the future, a belief that Americans can survive \nchallenges and catastrophes, and the further belief that no place on \nEarth exists with more freedom and liberty than our blessed country. \nBut all that could evaporate if default is permitted to occur.\n  Over the past half century, the debt ceiling has been raised 75 \ntimes--almost two-thirds of them under Republican Presidents. In fact, \nthe debt ceiling was increased 18 times under President Reagan and 7 \ntimes under President George W. Bush. Our country has never defaulted \non its obligations, and default must be prevented if we love our \ncountry.\n  It is time for the Republicans to abandon their ``my way or the \nhighway'' approach. It is time for the Republicans to stop playing \npolitics with our country's economy. The time for politics is election \nday 2012--not now.\n  Let's do our work, keep our precious ship steady and afloat. Majority \nLeader Reid's plan is our last best hope to avoid a disaster, and we \nneed to act on it without further delay.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and the remainder of any \ntime I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if there is one thing in this long, \ndifficult debate there is no question about, one thing all of us have \nlong known, one simple truth we must get past if we are going to avoid \ndefault, it is that any bill to get us out of this crisis will need \nDemocratic and Republican votes. There is no partisan solution--no \nother path, no magic trick at the eleventh hour. There is just \ncompromise. After all the bluster, all the back and forth, and all the \nposturing, there is just the bill we have before us today. It is a bill \nthat doesn't have everything that all of us want. It is not the bill \nthat any one of us would have crafted, if we had our way. But it is a \nbill that can and should be passed to avoid an economic catastrophe \nthat would leave families in every single one of our States reeling.\n  I understand that compromise has been hard to come by in these \nnegotiations, no matter how hard we try. But with Senator Reid's bill, \nwe have taken the Republicans at their word. We have come to the \nnegotiating table and have put forward a plan that goes to great pains \nto meet every one of the criteria they have called for.\n  They said they wanted cuts that exceed the debt limit raise. This \nbill delivers that. They said they wanted no new tax revenues. This \nbill delivers that. They said they wanted to put in place a process to \nmake even more cuts later. This bill delivers that. They have said they \ntoo want to avoid default. This bill is our way out.\n  I know my Republican colleagues don't want to see us default. I know \nwhile we don't see eye to eye on all issues, we all fight for the \npeople of our States. So I know my Republican friends are hearing the \nsame things from families in their home States that I am hearing from \nmine. I know their offices have been flooded with calls and e-mails \nfrom families trying to figure out what they would do if the support \nthey depend on to stay in their homes or put food on their table is \nsuddenly cut off. I know they are hearing from the same seniors and \nveterans and college students with the same message: Put America first. \nGet it done. Compromise.\n  I got a letter just like that from Anne Phillips, from Tacoma, WA, \nwho, after 18 years working, was laid off during the recession. Anne \ntold me about how she felt she was doing the responsible thing by \ngetting up and dusting herself off and going back to college. But now, \nshe said, she is worried sick because of the fact that the interest \nrates on her student loans, which she relies on to pay for her school, \nwould shoot up if we defaulted. In her letter, Anne made clear who the \nreal victims of this default would be. She said:\n\n       Ultimately people like me, my husband, my family, and all \n     the people I know, who are doing their best every day to make \n     a contribution to society will pay the expense.\n\n  I also heard from a woman named Brenda Starkey and her husband, \nretired Navy veterans from Republic, WA. They told me if we don't meet \nthis challenge, they may not be able to afford Medicare payments or VA \nmedical copayments, not to mention basic necessities such as food or \nelectricity or water. Brenda wrote:\n\n       I was taught in school about Henry Clay and his great \n     compromise. I still believe this is the way our government is \n     supposed to work, with both sides giving some ground until a \n     common position is met. We deserve more from our government.\n\n  I also heard from Social Security recipients such as Alisa Terry from \nBellingham, WA, who told me how important that monthly check is to her \nand just what it would mean if it didn't go out next month. She said, \nsimply:\n\n       Social Security is my lifeline. It stands between me and \n     homelessness.\n\n  This isn't just about politics; it is about these people and millions \nmore who may not even realize their well-being is on the line today. It \nis about average American families whose credit card interest rates \nwould skyrocket. It is about homeowners whose mortgage payments will \nincrease by over $1,000 a year. It is about rising food and utility and \ngas prices and what that would mean for our already cash-strapped \nfamilies, and it is about retirement plans that would plummet.\n  These Americans are looking for real leadership and a real solution \nto this problem. They don't want more games or gimmicks or short-term \npatches. For anyone who believes a short-term extension is a good idea, \nI want everyone to envision what that would mean.\n  Imagine we are right back here on the brink doing the same thing in 5 \nshort months, only now we are 5 or 6 months closer to an election and \nthe battle lines are drawn deeper than they are today, and we are also \nsmack in the middle of one of the most important economic times of the \nwhole year for retailers and consumers, the holiday season. Imagine \nwhat the effect of this crisis and this standstill would feel like \nthen. Imagine holiday shoppers worried that their credit card interest \nrates are going to shoot up or that next month's mortgage payment is \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\nbreak the bank or retailers reluctant to stock their shelves or hire \nbecause they are worried about a major disruption in the economy or \nseniors on Social Security worried their check will not be mailed and \ntheir heating bill will go up, not to mention veterans or college \nstudents or our troops who would, once again, be put in the spiral of \nanxiety and insecurity at the holiday times.\n  They don't want to relive this. America doesn't want to go through \nthis again, and they shouldn't have to--nobody should. That is exactly \nwhy we need to come together now.\n  As I said before, the bill in front of us this evening is not ideal. \nBut it gets us to where we need to get to today to protect our families \nand small businesses across America from market uncertainty and the \nthreat of default. This legislation does make deep and serious cuts to \ngovernment spending. It does protect Medicare and Social Security \nbenefits that we promised to our seniors and it puts the country on a \nmore sustainable fiscal track and allows us to continue working to \nreduce the debt and deficit without the threat of economic calamity \nhanging over our heads again.\n  Democrats have compromised and compromised again and again, and this \nbill that is before us now is the fruit of those compromises. It is \nalso the last and best hope of preventing us from defaulting in a few \nshort days on the full faith and credit of our Nation for the first \ntime in our history. There is no other choice. The markets are waiting \nand watching. Credit rating agencies are waiting and watching. \nCountries around the world are waiting and watching. But, most \nimportant, the American people are waiting and watching. I hope we pass \nthis bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address this issue of the debt \nlimit and how we are going to go forward. I think it is important, \ngiven the conversation I have been hearing this morning, to understand \nsome of the key features that are under discussion.\n  The first is that the plan that came from the House last night, the \nBoehner plan, requires the second half of the debt ceiling to be lifted \nonly if a balanced budget amendment is passed and sent out to the \nStates. In other words, it puts a two-thirds vote of each Chamber \nbasically on the process 6 months from now.\n  What that does is it says to our Nation that we are going to be in \ncontinuous debate over this issue the next 6 months, facing a two-\nthirds vote that is very unlikely to happen. So this crisis is not \ngoing to end, not on August 2, not on August 3, not on August 4 but not \nfor 6 months into the future. Then it is not going to end because we \nare not going to have a two-thirds vote.\n  It sends exactly the wrong message to our business community which is \nwaiting for a sense of stability that we are through this moment. It \nsends the wrong message to the international world that is looking at \nthe question of whether they are going to buy Treasury bills. It sends \nthe wrong message in regard to our reputation in the world.\n  This plan of continuing the crisis for 6 months in order to bring \nthis Nation to its knees just so folks campaign on the fact that they \nwill do better, if you will, does not represent the best of the \nAmerican spirit. We should be coming together to solve problems, not to \nextend problems, not to amplify problems, not to hurt families across \nthe United States of America and hurt small businesses across this \nland.\n  The second thing the proposal did that we faced last night is it took \ndefense spending off the table for 2 years. Why is this important? It \nis important because defense spending has grown by over 300 percent in \nthe last decade. It is important because the recent Secretary of \nDefense, Robert Gates, said there are over $100 billion of defense \nprograms that do not contribute to our national security. We must be \nlooking at programs that do not contribute for their intended purpose \nif we are going to take and address our fiscal situation with the best \npossible path for America.\n  Then the Speaker said: Do you know what. There is going to be a \nsupercommittee, but I, the Speaker, am only going to allow it to \nconsider cuts to direct spending, and I will not appoint anyone who \nwould look at the full range of options that is to include programs \ntucked into the Tax Code.\n  Just a few minutes ago, my colleague from Florida said if there are \ntax programs which are there not because of good policy but because of \ngood lobbying, those need to be on the table. He is absolutely right. \nIt is a situation where every citizen understands that whether we spend \n$10,000 on a grant or spend $10,000 on a tax credit, it is the same \n$10,000.\n  There is a reason the Boehner plan has put tax loopholes and tax \nearmarks and tax programs off the table; that is because inserted into \nthe Tax Code are programs for the wealthy and the well-connected. Why \ndo they want their programs in the Tax Code? Very simply, they avoid \nthe annual authorization process. They avoid the annual appropriations \nprocess. In a way, we can think of them as superprograms because they \ndon't get reviewed regularly. That is where the well-connected and the \nwealthy want to have their programs placed, and they have been very \nsuccessful. It has been over a quarter century since we have had a \nsystematic review of these programs. But here we are in a fiscal \ncrisis. It makes sense to examine the tax loopholes, many of which have \noutlived their use, and many others which may still be very valid--and \nthose are the ones we should keep--but we need to examine all of them.\n\n  I had a colleague come to the floor the other day, a colleague across \nthe aisle, and he made this argument. He said: There are some tax \nprograms that benefit the middle class, and he proceeded to put up all \nthese charts and all these numbers about programs that benefit the \nmiddle class. He concluded that because some of the tax programs \nbenefit the middle class, no tax programs should be discussed as part \nof this issue.\n  Well, let's apply the same logic to our appropriations programs. \nCan't anyone say there are some direct spending programs that benefit \nthe middle class? But then do we turn around and say all these programs \nshould be left unexamined as a result? Of course not. Nor was my \ncolleague across the aisle willing to make that argument. But why did \nhe make such an absurd argument that because some programs are useful, \nwe shouldn't look at any of the programs in the Tax Code? Because he \nwanted to protect the programs for the wealthy and well-connected. I \nwill tell you, today, there is something terribly wrong with coming to \nthis floor to protect the programs for the best off in our society and \ndoing so under the false claim that they are here to fight for working \nfamilies. That is wrong, and that is why we must look at every single \nprogram.\n  There is another problem in the bill that we have; that is, if you \ntake Boehner at his word and he is going to take the $1.5 trillion in \nthe Tax Code under tax expenditures and not allow them to be examined, \nthen the only place we end up going to reach the numbers involved is \nMedicaid and Medicare: Medicaid, health care for the poor; Medicare, \nhealth care for our seniors.\n  It seems there are Members of this Chamber who want to think of \nhealth care as a special privilege for only those who are wealthy in \nour society. Maybe they should come and live in my community, where we \nunderstand that the quality of life is deeply dependent upon one's \nhealth.\n  There was indeed a very interesting experiment in Oregon over the \nlast few years. We did not have enough funds for everyone to \nparticipate in Medicaid, called the Oregon Health Plan, and so there \nwas a lottery. So for the first time anywhere in the Nation, there was \nthe ability to study those who got to sign up against a control group \nof those who didn't. We found out Medicaid made a profound difference \nin people's lives. It shouldn't come as any surprise that health care \nmakes a profound difference, but many people on this floor have \nquestioned whether health care matters. It is always interesting to \nhear people who have access to health care, who have it because they \nare wealthy, who have it because they have a job right here that gives \nthem health care, wondering why we should bother to care about health \ncare for others. These issues are issues we must address as we go \nforward.\n  Let me note then that if we proceed with a plan that is guaranteed to \nparalyze this Chamber over the next 6\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\nmonths, with an impossible hurdle at the end of that period, we will \ndestroy this economy. We are flat right now. We are not gaining ground. \nWe had a bill, small business innovation bill, research bill on the \nfloor, debated it for 6 weeks, a routine bill. My colleagues across the \naisle voted not to end debate so there couldn't be a vote on taking \nthis bill forward.\n  They were deeply determined to prevent bills creating jobs from \ngetting to the President's desk. Indeed, because we have not been able \nto take those key pieces of legislation and go forward, here we are \nwith a flat economy.\n  Now they want to take it to its knees. If we create this uncertainty \nover the next 6 months, the interest rate goes up on the Treasury \nbills, the interest rate goes up on home mortgages, the interest rate \ngoes up on car loans, the interest rate goes up on small businesses, \nand we get greater unemployment. Is that the outcome we want? Interest \nis an empty tax, a tax on every family. The estimate is it would be \nabout $2,000 a year and it buys us nothing, nothing but destruction of \nthe economy. That must not happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator who \npreceded me. We are heading into a territory where we have never been \nbefore.\n  In Washington you get to get your Sunday funnies on Saturday, so I \ntook a little peek at ``Dilbert'' today. I hope everybody will look at \nthat because it emphasizes the problem.\n  ``Dilbert'' says:\n\n       I am preparing for the complete meltdown of our financial \n     system. I've got six months of food and water. I have \n     batteries and flashlights and gold coins.\n\n  The lady with the triangular hair says:\n\n       I'm prepared too. I have your home address and I noticed \n     that your preparations are light on defensive weaponry.\n\n  And she says:\n\n       Could you add some protein bars to the shopping list?\n\n  I want to share with you a letter from a 10-year-old in Wyoming that \nmade our statewide newspaper. He wrote:\n\n       What does the Government think of me?\n       . . . They think I'm not so smart because I'm too young to \n     know what they're doing, like raising the national debt. \n     Don't they know that I owe the country about $45,000. I'm \n     only 10 years old. I could buy a lot with $45,000.\n       . . . That's more than my dad earns. But it wouldn't buy \n     everything.\n       Government shouldn't try to buy everything.\n       It is my job, and the people's job to buy things we need. I \n     don't want the Government to think for me. They don't know \n     I'm a little brother who doesn't like it when my big brothers \n     tell me what to do, because they aren't always responsible \n     for their own things. I don't tell my brothers what to do \n     with their money.\n       I'm smarter than they think I am. They should follow the \n     rules.\n\n  I thank Eric Mitchell, Crowheart, WY, for his sage advice.\n  Mr. President, it is disappointing to be here today addressing the \nU.S. Senate on a topic that we should have dealt with months ago. Our \ncountry is in a financial crisis. Erskine Bowles, the cochairman of the \nDeficit Commission, coined the situation we face as, ``the most \npredictable economic crisis in history,'' and yet there is no clear \npath forward to deal with both the short-term need to raise the debt \nlimit and the long-term need to get spending under control. I am \ndisappointed we have made this discussion about the debt ceiling \ninstead of our ever increasing spending. When you spend beyond your \nmeans, you have to cut back.\n  The plans we are considering at this stage in the debate are plans \nfor the next year to 2 years. While there is merit in making the \nspending cuts these bills make, they are not the ultimate solution.\n  We need more significant action. We need to move forward with \nsomething bold. My Republican colleagues and I have proposed such \nplans. I have proposed a solution that would cut just 1 penny from \nevery dollar we spend for 6 years and then cap spending at the \nhistorical amount of revenue we take in during the 7th year. In the 8th \nyear, we would have a balanced budget.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to \neven debate measures like my penny plan or the Cut, Cap, and Balance \nAct or even the plan put forward by Speaker Boehner. At the same time \nthey refuse to debate these measures, they refuse to put forward their \nown plan for long-term structural changes. They are only willing to \ndebate plans that make changes in the short term, and so we are stuck \nhere debating a plan that is deeply flawed.\n  I think it is important to look at where the debate is today versus \nwhere it was when President Obama was sworn in. It is clear that we \nhave come a long way from where we were when President Obama took \noffice.\n  In 2009, Democrats in Congress passed a so-called economic stimulus \nbill that cost $1 trillion. To pay for it, we borrowed that money, and \nas the unemployment numbers prove, all that borrowing didn't solve our \neconomic problems. Apparently, we spend over $275,000 per job--and none \nof those employees got paid that well. In 2010, President Obama's \nsecond year in office, Democrats in Congress forced through an \nunpopular health care bill which was wrought with budget gimmicks and \nwill ultimately cost our country trillions of dollars. The President's \nattempt at health care reform was so unsuccessful that the largest \nproblem facing our debt and deficit situation is what we will do to \ncontain health care costs. Another trillion dollars borrowed. Another \ntrillion dollars wasted.\n  The American people were fed up with congressional Democrats' \nreckless spending spree and, in November 2010, they voted for real \nchange. Those votes ushered in a new attitude, and 7 months into a \nRepublican-controlled House of Representatives, the debate is entirely \ndifferent. Instead of looking at where we can spend more money, we are \nlooking at what we can cut. Instead of looking at how to borrow more \nmoney, we are looking at how we can change our spending habits so that \nwe have a spending plan that will work in the future. Republicans have \nheard the people's call for smaller government and less spending, and \nare committed to taking action.\n  Earlier this year, Republicans led efforts to cut spending in \nappropriations bills for the first time in years. Now, we need to find \na solution to cut trillions of dollars of spending at the same time we \nallow the President to have some additional borrowing authority to pay \nfor the purchases we have already made. The cuts Republicans have \nproposed are the largest cuts ever seen, but it still isn't enough to \nfix the problem long term.\n  Why aren't we looking at a long-term solution to this problem? Why \nare we forced to look at short-term, piddly spending cuts at the same \ntime we give the President the ability to borrow lots more money? This \nisn't one person or one party's fault.\n  The President does have us in a box. During his State of the Union \nMessage, the President could have explained to the American people the \ndire situation we are facing. The Deficit Commission had already \npainted the picture. The President needed to premiere that picture. He \ncould have explained that we are borrowing more than 40 cents of every \ndollar we spend--much of it from China. He could have explained that we \nare on a spending spree that must be stopped. That was and is the true \nstate of the Union.\n  After the State of the Union, he could have sent us a serious budget \nproposal modeled after his own Deficit Commission. Instead, he used the \nState of the Union to talk about more spending and his budget was such \na ridiculous proposal it didn't receive a single vote--Republican or \nDemocratic--when it was put before the Senate.\n  While the President has failed to lead and deserves a substantial \nportion of the blame, we in Congress have also put ourselves in this \nbox. During the last administration, we should have worked to contain \nspending. While we missed that opportunity, when it was clear that we \nneeded to make a major change this year, Democrats in the Senate should \nhave ignored the President's lack of leadership and put forward a \nbudget proposal in the Senate. The House passed a budget, but rather \nthan taking their proposal seriously, my Democratic colleagues \ndemonized the plan as the end of Medicare. They preferred finding a \ncampaign issue as opposed to actually solving the financial problems we \nface.\n  Unfortunately, we are quickly running out of options. We are at a \ncatch 22. The country can't afford more debt,\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\nbut has to have it. If we don't raise the debt ceiling, we won't be \nable to pay all of our bills and interest rates will go up. On the \nother hand, if we pass a plan that doesn't fundamentally change the way \nwe do business in Washington, we increase the debt limit with no end in \nsight and interest rates go up.\n  The majority in the Senate that brought you banking reform has run up \na huge debt and we have all maxed out the Nation's credit cards. Now \nthey want to increase the amount of the mortgage. Imagine trying to get \na loan when nothing has been paid on the principle of the previous \nloan. Now imagine the lender's reaction when he is told that the \nmortgagee will be back shortly for another loan.\n  Let me put this in concrete terms because it might be easier to \nunderstand. I am trying to keep these numbers proportional to the $14 \ntrillion debt. Imagine that you have a loan on a very large house with \na mortgage of $1.4 million. Since buying the house, you have made \ninterest payments, but not a single payment on the principal. You \ndetermine you need more money to spend, so you go to the lender and \nrequest an additional loan of $230,000. At the same time you do that, \nyou are honest and you warn the lender that you will be back each year \nfor the next 9 years asking for $100,000 more each year. You also let \nthe lender know that you don't want to have to pay off any of the \nprincipal on the loan, just make interest payments each year.\n  I don't think any lender would take you seriously, but if he or she \ndid, they would explain that you would have to obtain a variable rate \nloan. A variable rate loan means that changes in the risk or the \neconomy could drive interest rates much higher and there would be no \nprotection from those higher interest rates. In other words, your loan \nwith an excellent interest rate of 2.5 percent could go to an interest \nrate of 5 percent or 10 percent, or like under President Carter, over \n18 percent a year. A 1 percent increase in interest rates for the U.S. \ndebt would cost another $1.3 trillion over 10 years. That is just a 1 \npercent raise.\n  The lender would point out that the raise in debt plus the rise in \ninterest rates could result in your entire paycheck going to interest--\nand the interest payments would have to come ahead of food, clothing, \nand any social needs--for you, or for your children or your parents or \nyour grandparents. That is what we are talking about here as the future \nfor the United States--interest payments on the debt being the only \nthing we could pay for.\n  If the banker were foolish enough to consider such a loan, he would \nwant to know what spending changes you were going to make. He would \nexpect changes immediately, not piddly changes this year for a promise \nof a big change in the 9th year. He would want some proof that you are \nserious.\n  If we act now and agree to cut 1 percent--the 1 percent solution, \njust 1 penny of each dollar--from all our spending and reduce the cap \nto the new spending by that level for each of the next 7 years, the \nlender ``might'' consider your loan. There is a good chance he would \nexpect 2 percent or 3 percent in cuts for the first year to demonstrate \nthat you are serious about kicking your spending habit.\n  We are in that situation today in Congress. The President is asking \nfor a $2.4 trillion loan increase--the largest loan increase in our \nNation's history. Our lenders will explain to us, if we are worried \nabout the low income, the downtrodden, and the less fortunate today, we \nshould see what will happen to those individuals if we don't cut \nspending. If we reach a situation where all of our revenues are going \nto interest payments on the debt, the future prioritization to pay for \nour debt will be unbearable. We can't go out 18 months. The American \npeople don't trust us. We need to be accountable to the people. We need \nan enforceable, accountable plan with quicker results.\n  Some might argue that the lender would just expect you to bring in \nmore money. My Democratic colleagues suggest just that when they say we \nmust raise taxes. But everyone knows that if you ask your boss for a \nraise because you can't control your spending, you could be fired or \ndemoted and, as a result, you would be bringing in less revenue. I \ndon't need to tell you that our bosses--the American people--don't \nthink much of how we have been working for them, and they don't expect \na tax increase each time Washington gets addicted to giving away money.\n  The plan the majority leader has offered uses budget gimmicks to \navoid real spending cuts and gives the President a debt limit increase \nthat, while politically expedient, fails to put our country on a \nworkable path. It doesn't provide a way to assure any substantial cuts \nwill be made. While it maybe makes some necessary spending cuts today, \nit does not provide us with relief from our long term challenges and \ndoes not put us in a situation where we would be forced to make the \ntough choices.\n  We know that the majority leader's proposal won't pass. Every \nRepublican has made clear that they will oppose the proposal and so it \ndoesn't have the chance to move forward. We have made clear that we \nwill not give the President the single largest debt ceiling increase in \nhistory for double the average time generally allowed since 1940 \nthrough the proposal the majority leader has offered. We have offered \nto vote on his proposal time and time again, and for reasons beyond \ncomprehension, he refuses to allow a vote. He did a vote within 30 \nminutes of the time that the House bill came over here, but he wants to \ndrag out the vote on his bill. I know delay will bring the pressure \nuntil the last minute, but that is not how a reasonable government \nworks. I wish we had taken action earlier to avoid the situation we \nfind ourselves in today. I wish the proposal before us was a serious \neffort to make structural change to how we spend money.\n\n  Instead we all know the plan put forward by the majority leader will \nbe voted down later tonight or tomorrow, and we will be in the same \nplace we are right now--in the box where we need to raise the debt \nlimit, but we also need to make structural changes to get our fiscal \nhouse in order to keep the markets from melting down.\n  We do recognize that we are about to enter territory where our \ncountry has never been. The stock markets are already reacting. Because \nwe are debating short-term solutions, this debate will continue on even \nafter we act on the debt ceiling.\n  I hope we can come together on a debt ceiling increase and a plan for \nreal spending cuts. That is where the emphasis needs to be, and it has \nto have enforcement. I hope the debt ceiling is limited to the amount \nof guaranteed cuts. I hope we can put our country on a sustainable, \nfiscal path.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with my \nRepublican colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, we are in the midst of a debt crisis, I \nthink some of it created by the President because he has refused to \ntake off the table the fact we would default on our debt. I think that \nis irresponsible, and without a doubt the President should come forward \nand say he will pay the interest on the debt.\n  On our side we have been willing to compromise all along. We have \nbeen offering plans. We passed two plans in the House. Now we have a \nplan before us, a Democratic plan, to raise the debt ceiling, and there \nare some of us who would vote for this Democratic plan who might \nrequire some amendments or some compromise. There would have to be some \ninput from our side. Yet even though this bill was introduced yesterday \nand Republicans said they would vote for it, the Democrats are now \nfilibustering their own bill. What is funny is, they filibuster their \nown bill and then point fingers and say we are trying to stop things. \nWe are here today to try to move things forward.\n  In the spirit of trying to reach a compromise before the deadline \ncomes, I would ask unanimous consent that the vote on the pending \ncloture motion occur immediately or as soon as possible, 5 p.m. today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, under the \nfilibuster rules of the Senate, there is a requirement of 60 votes for \ncloture. We have said we are prepared to move to a timely vote on this \npending amendment, a majority vote, the same as Speaker Boehner had in \nthe House. I would object unless the Senator from\n\n[[Page S5112]]\n\nKentucky wants to amend his unanimous consent request to make it clear \nthat this will be a unanimous consent which I have spelled out in \ndetail, if he would like me to present it.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nremind the Senator that there is a difference between the Senate and \nthe House. Our Founding Fathers gave great power and leeway to the \nSenate. We were meant to be a check and a balance against unbridled \nenthusiasm sometimes from one party or another. So I would object to \nthat motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to present an amendment. This amendment would be an amendment \nto the Reid bill. Under this amendment what would happen is, I have at \nleast 10 Republicans who will vote for the Harry Reid bill which would \nallow a compromise, which allows the debt ceiling to rise.\n  I know the President is worried about having campaign time. He is \nworried about getting back out and doing some fundraisers. He does not \nwant to consider the debt ceiling again before his reelection campaign. \nSo this amendment I would offer would allow us to move forward in a \nbipartisan way.\n  All Republicans are asking for is that we balance our budget \ngradually over a 7- to 8-year period. What this amendment would do that \nI am asking unanimous consent to present is an amendment that says we \nwill raise the debt ceiling contingent upon passing a balanced budget \namendment.\n  I would ask unanimous consent I be allowed to present this amendment \nto the Reid bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. PAUL. What I think this illustrates is compromise--the pundits \nsay compromise is the mark of an enlightened person. We are trying to \ncompromise. I just offered to pass the leader's bill. I have offered to \nwork with them. I am from the tea party. They say we will not \ncompromise. I am willing to raise the debt ceiling. In fact, we worked \non a motion that has gotten more votes than any other motion that has \nbeen set forward, and that was cut, cap, and balance that would have \nrequired a balanced budget amendment to be passed but would have raised \nthe debt ceiling.\n  What do we hear from the other side? Intransigence. Who is refusing \ncompromise? It sounds to me like the other side is refusing compromise.\n  I have with me my distinguished colleague from Utah and would like to \nhear his thoughts on where the fault lies and where we could come to if \nwe were to compromise to try to find an agreement.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, a number of us, myself included, have been \narguing since January--ever since we arrived here and were sworn in \nthis very room--that the national debt is a permanent problem. The \nalmost $15 trillion that we now owe as a nation is permanent. It is \ngoing to take a long time to pay off. There are people who are not yet \nold enough to vote. There are people who will be born in a few years \nwho are not even here who will one day have to assist in paying off \nthat debt.\n  The fact that this is a long-term problem means it requires a long-\nterm solution. That is why we have been saying all along that we ought \nnot raise the debt limit yet again--extending our national debt by \nanother $2.5 trillion, more or less, without a permanent solution in \nplace.\n  Herein lies the problem. It is difficult or impossible for one \nCongress to come up with a set of budget numbers that would necessarily \nbind future Congresses. We can come up with a plan to cut $2 trillion \nor $3 trillion over a 10-year or 15-year period, but if future \nCongresses don't want to go along with that, they can find their way \nout of it. This has happened again and again as we have seen with \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings, as we have seen with the pay-go rules. Congress \nbecomes a walking, breathing waiver unto itself. We need a permanent \nsolution. This is why we have settled on the need for a balanced budget \namendment.\n  As my distinguished colleague--the junior Senator from Kentucky--has \njust pointed out, there is no intransigence in our position. Those of \nus who identify with the Republican Party, those of us who identify \nwith the tea party are people who want a solution. We were sent here \nwith a mandate by voters, a mandate that says the Federal Government is \ntoo big and too expensive.\n  Now, resistance to this message from the other side of the aisle, as \nvehement as that resistance may be, is not genuine if what it says is, \nin this instance the insistence for a balanced budget amendment is \nitself reflective of an unwillingness to compromise. There are myriad \nopportunities to compromise within that general framework. We have \noffered that. We have extended that.\n\n  Republicans have now submitted no fewer than two bills that have \npassed the House of Representatives to address the debt limit issue, \nboth of which have been stopped dead in their tracks over here without \nfurther opportunity, most importantly, without a response by the \nDemocratic Party in the Senate or otherwise.\n  If there is either party in this discussion that is refusing to \ncompromise, it is not ours. If there is any group that has failed to \noffer solutions, it cannot be described as the tea party movement.\n  I ask my colleague--the junior Senator from Kentucky--do you see any \nelement within the tea party movement, any element within the \nRepublican Party that is unwilling to compromise or that is wanting to \nblock just for the sake of blocking?\n  Mr. PAUL. No. From going to hundreds of tea party rallies and \ngrassroots rallies with voters across America, what I see is they want \nwhat is best for America. I don't think they particularly care whether \nit is a Republican plan or Democratic plan. They want what is best for \nAmerica. They want a solution.\n  The problem with the debate in Washington is all of the proposals \nseem to want to add more debt. We have $14 trillion worth of debt, and \nboth the Republican and the Democratic proposal will add $7 trillion to \n$8 trillion more in debt.\n  What I think the folks in the tea party want--and those who are \nconcerned about passing on the debt to their kids and grandkids want--\nis to spend less. I think a great contrast and what illustrates the \nproblem is spending is going up 7 percent a year. Nobody is talking \nabout cutting that spending. They are talking about cutting the rate of \ngrowth of that spending.\n  There is a new plan out called the one penny plan. It would have real \ncuts of one penny on every dollar spent. The other side pulls their \nhair and says: Oh, you are so radical.\n  We say: We want to cut one penny out of every dollar of government \nspending. Is that radical?\n  The President has said it is a dysfunctional place. He is right in \nthat sense. I think some of the dysfunction comes from the hypocrisy or \nfrom the other side not really listening.\n  For example, the balanced budget amendment. They say polls show \nroutinely 75 percent of Americans are for it. Routinely, about 14 \npercent of Americans seem to be approving of this body. The question I \nwould have is--maybe it is we are not listening well enough. Maybe we \nare not doing what the people want.\n  Mr. LEE. That certainly appears to be the case. It is a reminder to \nus of the fact that no matter how much we might be tempted at times to \ndemagogue this issue, no matter how tempting it might be for certain \nMembers of this body to cast blame elsewhere, they cannot escape one \nsimple fact, which is the American people are demanding more. They are \ndemanding that we spend less. They are demanding that we stop this \nbarbaric practice of perpetual massive-scale deficit spending. Why? \nBecause it erodes individual liberty. It takes money people have not \nyet made and spends it and obligates them to repay it--in some cases \nbefore they are old enough to vote, in other cases before they are even \nborn. We need a permanent solution.\n  When we put something in the Constitution, it serves as a permanent \nreminder of the fact that we, as a people,\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\nhave made a decision, and we are going to move forward. Not everybody \nwill necessarily agree as to how best we should move forward having \nmade that decision. The American people overwhelmingly, to the tune of \n75 percent, support the idea that we should amend the Constitution to \nrestrict Congress's deficit spending power.\n  Mr. PAUL. When people talk about Washington being dysfunctional, and \nthey are upset with what is going on in Washington, I think one of the \nthings that upsets people is hypocrisy--people who say one thing and do \nanother. That is a sad state of affairs. People run on one idea and \nthen they completely change their ideas.\n  The President was a Senator, and he spoke on the Senate floor. Here \nare his words in 2006.\n\n       The fact that we are here today debating raising America's \n     debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.\n\n  He was sort of pointing fingers. Everybody's pointing fingers. It is \nsomeone else's fault. I call that sort of the empty partisanship. His \nconclusion, then, is voting to raise the debt limit would send a bad \nsignal. It would send a signal to our leaders that they are doing the \nright thing.\n  I have often said there is no objective evidence that Washington or \nCongress is spending our money wisely.\n  The Pentagon says they are too big to be audited. They cannot balance \ntheir books. There was $100 billion unaccounted for in the budget last \nyear. There are $5 billion worth of duplicate programs the GAO found. \nThere are, I believe, 82 different programs to train workers. Could we \nnot deal with one Federal program training workers instead of 82 \ndifferent ones doing the same thing? But this is it. The President said \nraising the debt ceiling would be a mistake. Now that he is President, \nhe has changed his mind. I think the hypocrisy of that is what makes \nAmericans unhappy.\n  The President said the same thing on war. He said no President should \nunilaterally go to war without congressional authority, and here we are \nat war in Libya with no vote in Congress. He said he has a piece of \npaper from the United Nations. We didn't elect the United Nations. We \nhave a Constitution, and it requires those issues be debated in \nCongress.\n  People are unhappy because we are not doing the people's business. We \nhaven't had a budget in 800 days. Do you know what. It is against the \nlaw. It is against the law not to have a budget. We haven't had a \nbudget in 800 days, but the budget law says we should have a budget \nevery year. We are supposed to match our appropriations bills with the \nbudget. We are not doing it.\n\n  The American people are unhappy we are dysfunctional and that we are \nnot doing the people's business. We have also become profligate \nspenders--spending money we don't have. I think we risk great dangers.\n  I ask the question to this Senator from Utah: What is the answer? How \ndo we get out of this when we seem to be so far apart, and even on both \nsides we don't seem to be tackling the issues in a way that would allow \nfor significant cuts in spending?\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have a friend by the name of Ron McMillan, \nwho lives in my hometown of Alpine, UT. He is the author of a number of \nbooks dealing with business negotiations, dealing with trying to figure \nout how compromise can be reached.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senators has expired.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an extension of \n2 minutes to finish our thoughts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't object, as long as this side is given an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. In that series of books, the crucial conversation line of \nthe books, one of the things he encourages people to do is to find \nwhatever common ground they can reach.\n  I think there is common ground among the American people generally \nthat we should balance our budget. Not everyone agrees about how we \nbalance the budget, what should be cut, but they do agree we should \nbalance it. That being the case, that is where we ought to focus our \nefforts. We should focus our efforts on amending that law of laws, that \n224-year-old document that fostered the development of the greatest \ncivilization the world has ever known. We should change it, again, to \nimprove it, to restrict Congress's borrowing power.\n  The plan proposed by the Democrats that is now about to come before \nus puts our budgeting process on autopilot. It doesn't require another \nbudget for 2 years, preserving the ability of ObamaCare to fund itself \nwithout a single additional debate in Congress. This is wrong. This is \nnot the right approach. I object to it. For that reason, I, along with \nsome of my other Republican colleagues, am prepared to vote on this and \nvote no on it right now. We are not the ones delaying this vote.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I would say that what Americans don't like \nis empty partisanship. That is what is going on today. Democrats are \nstanding and beating their chests saying: Republicans will not let us \nhave a vote. It is untrue. I have offered to have the vote. We have \nseen the objection before our own eyes. They would not vote on this.\n  Let's dispense with the empty partisanship. Let's move forward and \nhave a vote. If they would let us have one amendment--an amendment that \nwould gradually balance the budget over 7 to 8 years--I will vote for \ntheir proposal and I will ensure enough votes that it will pass.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I yield to the Senator from North \nCarolina, I wish to note that last night, the two Senators who just \nfinished their colloquy had an opportunity to vote for the Boehner plan \nwhich required a constitutional balanced budget amendment. Both \nSenators Lee and Paul are registered as having voted to table the \nBoehner approach, which includes that requirement for a balanced budget \namendment.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, we are here debating the government's \nfiscal deficit. It is an important topic, one worthy of serious debate. \nOf course, I wish I could characterize the mindless partisanship of the \nlast several months as serious debate, but I fear this do-nothing \ndebate is distracting us from another deficit that is front and center \nin the hearts and minds of the American people; that is, the jobs \ndeficit.\n  Just yesterday, the Department of Commerce reported that the economic \nrecovery has been far slower than previously thought. Our economy grew \nat a rate of less than 1 percent in the first half of 2011. That is not \nnews to the hard-working families of North Carolina where unemployment \nstatewide is almost 10 percent and nearly one-half million people are \nlooking for work. They have been struggling since the housing boom went \nbust 4 years ago. Those people with jobs haven't seen the size of their \npaycheck increase, but their monthly bills have certainly been \nincreased, along with the cost of gasoline. Just getting to your job in \nthe morning, if you are fortunate to still have one, is more expensive. \nYet we spend all our time in Washington bickering, posturing, and name-\ncalling. Our constituents must be watching from home scratching their \nheads and wondering why Washington is debating whether we should avoid \na default that would make this economy even worse.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what is happening in North Carolina. Since \nthe start of the recession in 2007, we have lost over 300,000 jobs in \nmy State. More than two-thirds of the counties--68 out of 100--have \nunemployment rates above 10 percent. In my hometown of Greensboro, the \nunemployment rate is stuck at 10.8 percent--the same level as last \nyear. That is right, no change in 12 months. People are working harder \nwithout getting ahead or looking for work longer without being able to \nfind a job. Yet we continue to spend all our time in Washington \nbickering and posturing and name-calling.\n  The people of North Carolina and the people of this great country are \nfed up with political games. They are telling me enough is enough. What \nthey want is for Members of Congress to come to the table--Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents--and find bipartisan solutions that can \nget our economy growing and put people back to work;\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\nfor example, commonsense legislation such as the America Works Act that \nI introduced to create a nationwide and industry-recognized portable \ncredential system so employers with job openings can find those workers \nwith the right skills, and workers with the right skills can find the \njobs they are qualified for.\n  There is also the bipartisan Hire a Hero Act that my colleague from \nMassachusetts and I introduced to combat the unacceptable trend of \nhigher unemployment among our veterans.\n  Let us not forget we have a program that has been expired since \nFebruary that helps workers who have had their jobs shipped overseas \nfind new work. There is action we could take, but these commonsense \nideas aren't getting their due time because of the partisan shenanigans \ngoing on now.\n  This past month, I went on a budget-listening tour across North \nCarolina, and the messages I kept hearing were that we need to address \nour mounting debt and get our long-term fiscal house in order. We \nborrow 40 cents of every $1 we spend, and it is hurting our ability to \ninvest wisely in the things we need to, such as education, \ninfrastructure and research and development that will ensure a \nprosperous American future.\n  Yesterday, with my office receiving a barrage of calls from concerned \nconstituents, I answered the phones all afternoon. The message I heard \nwas loud and clear: Please stop the partisan posturing and get \nsomething done.\n  Unfortunately, the plan from the House falls far short of those goals \nof bipartisanship and consensus. Instead of aiming for compromise and \ncertainty, it represents just another partisan, short-term patch that \nensures the debate will drag on for another 6 months. After what \nWashington has put our country and the market through, I don't know \nanybody who thinks it is a good idea to do this for the next 6 months.\n  We all need to remember what we were put in office to do. We were not \nsent to fight for the sake of fighting. We were not sent to see who \ncould win the most political points, and we certainly were not sent to \nthrow this country into a default crisis because of our own inability \nto compromise.\n  But we were sent to get the work done. We were sent to work together \non solutions to the most pressing challenges of our time. Most \nimportant, we were sent to rev up the great American economic engine to \nallow businesses to hire and to get the American people back to work.\n  The clock is ticking. The challenges of reducing our debt and our \ndeficit are undoubtedly difficult, but they are not impossible--not if \nWashington takes to heart the message of principled compromise and \nleadership I receive every day from North Carolinians. We must commit \nto a balanced, bipartisan plan that reduces our debt while protecting \nour seniors, students and veterans and makes the critical investments \nin education, infrastructure, and research and development we need for \na prosperous American future. We need to focus on the most important \ngoal of all; that is, jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the Reid amendment and to put \nthis crisis behind us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, we are faced with a difficult challenge, \nand we know the American people watching us over so many days now \nunderstand the basic challenge we face. It is a challenge of reducing \ndeficit and debt and cutting spending but also making sure we have a \nbipartisan agreement to pay our bills and to meet our obligations.\n  I think if I had to boil it down to four words, it is these, in terms \nof what people in Pennsylvania have told me we must do. It is very \nsimple, but I think it encapsulates everything we have to do in the \nnext couple hours--the next couple days--and that is compromise for our \ncountry. That is what people are looking for, people all across the \ncountry.\n  I hear from families in Pennsylvania all the time. These are families \nwho have led lives of struggle and sacrifice, families who have lived \nthrough so much already. Many remember and have lived through the Great \nDepression and World War II and wars after that, economic downturns, \npersonal tragedies, job loss--all kinds of misery and all kinds of \ndifficulty. But throughout our State, and I think throughout the \ncountry, people have figured out a way to work together, to compromise \nin their own lives, even when they don't want to make a compromise, and \nthey have figured out a way to work together, whether it is at a work \nsite or at home.\n  I hear these same messages from people all the time. Let me give a \nsample of some of the feedback I have gotten from Pennsylvanians just \nin the last couple days. We purposefully chose three excerpts from \nthree letters from three parts of our State: southwestern Pennsylvania, \nthe middle of the State, and the eastern side of our State.\n  From Fayette County, way out in western Pennsylvania, here is an \nexcerpt from a letter I just received:\n\n       In order that we do not dip back into recession, it is \n     imperative that responsible people start acting in a \n     responsible manner. Get this issue resolved in a manner that \n     is best for the American people and not what is best for \n     ``political parties.''\n\n  That is part of one letter from southwestern Pennsylvania.\n  Then, I move to the middle of our State, literally called Centre \nCounty:\n\n       Please stop the bickering and work together to get the job \n     done. . . . Do your jobs. Come to a compromise.\n\n  That is what people in the middle of Pennsylvania wrote to me just \nrecently.\n  Then, thirdly, an excerpt from a letter in the eastern part of our \nState, Bucks County, a suburban Philadelphia community. I will read two \nsentences from this letter:\n\n       We must immediately raise the debt ceiling so that we do \n     not default on our debt payments that would negatively impact \n     our Nation. Next we must tighten our belts and develop plans \n     to reduce expenditures and raise revenue which would pay off \n     all debt just like my family's household did.\n\n  There we have it, three parts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \nthree different letters from three different constituents, all \nexpressing some fundamental, basic sentiments they have and I think \nsome very fundamental messages.\n  What are they? I think I can boil them down to four. The first is \nwork together and compromise. That is in almost every letter we see: \nwork together and compromise.\n  The second is they want us to cut spending. They know that in their \nown lives they have had to cut spending. They have had to change their \nspending habits to deal with this economic trauma they have been living \nthrough. Even if they haven't lost a job, even if they haven't lost \ntheir house or their hopes or their dreams, they have had to cut \nspending.\n  The third is to focus on jobs. One of the casualties of week after \nweek of focusing on this question of raising the debt ceiling meant we \nweren't taking action to incentivize the creation of jobs by use of the \nTax Code or other strategies.\n  Fourthly, I think the message they are telling us, obviously, is to \nreduce deficit and debt. They know we may not be able to put in place a \nplan right now to be able to do that, but they expect us to put in \nplace the foundation for that or strategy or a pathway to get to \nsubstantial deficit and debt reduction. So whether it is cutting \nspending or reducing deficit and debt or whether it is telling us to \ncompromise and work together or focus on jobs, I think the message the \npeople of Pennsylvania are giving me--and by extension all of us--is \nvery clear.\n  That is why, when I look at what is in front of us tonight when we \nare debating--we are going to be debating the proposal set forth by the \nmajority leader--some basic elements in here that aren't just sound \npolicy, but they are, in fact, incorporating compromise, already \nsignificant compromise; for example, making sure that if one side said \nwe have to have a dollar-for-dollar reduction in spending to meet the \nchallenge of raising the debt ceiling, the majority leader's plan does \nthat.\n  One side says we should not have any revenue, we should not have any \nadditional revenue as part of this agreement. The majority leader said: \nOK. I will accept that. I will compromise. So there are two significant \nand substantial compromises he has already made in this proposal, and \nhe is open to more, as he has said all day long, and for many days now, \nhe has been open to more compromise.\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\n  The legislation cuts spending significantly. There is almost $2 \ntrillion alone in spending reductions for so-called discretionary \nspending. There are lots of savings in other ways throughout the \nlegislation. It creates a bipartisan committee that will recommend \nadditional deficit reduction to be voted on by the end of this year. \nThen, an important part of what the majority leader has put forward \ntoday--or yesterday, I guess--in his proposal was part of what Senator \nMcConnell put forth, the Republican leader.\n  So by my count, there are three or four major compromises already in \nwhat the majority leader put forth. And he is open to more compromise. \nI think that is what the people of Pennsylvania expect me to do, and I \nthink that is what the people of the United States expect all of us to \ndo.\n  Finally, one of the best parts of this proposal is that it gives us \ncertainty. I hear from businesspeople all the time--big firms, medium-\nsized firms, and small businesses. They tell us over and over that in \naddition to the pressure they feel--the difficulty they have in keeping \ntheir employment levels up, the difficulty they have in making ends \nmeet in the aftermath of a recession--they tell us over and over: We \nare business leaders, and we need certainty or I am running a small \nbusiness in Pennsylvania, and I need certainty. I need to know what my \ntax rates will be. I need to know what the business climate will be \nlike. Please give me certainty.\n  One of the best features of what the majority leader put forth is \nthere is certainty. We are not going to have to debate this and fight \nabout it every 6 months. It provides some certainty into calendar year \n2013. That is why I think a 6-month extension makes no sense at all. \nBut you do not have to take our word for it. The rating agencies have \nmade it very clear--if you do a 6-month extension, you are taking a \nvery dangerous step that could lead to a downgrade in our credit \nrating.\n  So I think the Reid plan already has substantial compromise, and, of \ncourse, we can compromise more. So I think it is very clear what the \npeople of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are telling me. In the midst \nof all the suffering--in our case, 479,000 people still out of work. We \nhave an unemployment rate of 7.6, which some States wish they had. But \nit does not really matter what a percentage is; when you have 479,000 \npeople out of work, even though the number has been going down for the \nlast year, people are hurting. They are still struggling. They are \nstill worried. They are anxious. They are worried about their \nchildren's future. The least they ask of us in this debate, the least \nwe must do for them, is to come together, work together, surrender some \npolitical points of view, surrender some personal disagreements we \nhave, come together, and reach a compromise. I believe what they are \ntelling us over and over is that we need a compromise for our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to give a voice to \nMinnesotans to relay their thoughts on how Congress should resolve this \nimpasse and raise the debt ceiling to avoid a default.\n  On Wednesday, I received an e-mail from a constituent in St. Louis \nPark, my hometown. His e-mail reads:\n\n       Dear Senator. I am a Republican. I am a Minnesotan. I am a \n     small business owner. I am considered to have a high income \n     relative to the average American. . . . Here's my request: \n     Please work together to get this debt limit impasse settled.\n\n  On Thursday, I received this e-mail from a man in Bloomington. He \nwrites:\n\n       I'm a small businessman in the middle of a fund raising \n     effort. The concern over the debt ceiling has caused all the \n     angel investors to put off any discussion of investment until \n     they know what is going to happen. This has stopped my \n     ability to raise funds which will lead to new high quality \n     jobs in Minnesota. I support a simple bill that increases the \n     debt limit to get us through the 2012 elections as has been \n     done hundreds of times before.\n\n  Yesterday, I received an e-mail from a couple in Bemidji:\n\n       We are retired small business owners who are watching our \n     very very conservative retirement account drop and plunge due \n     to the inability of Congress to come up with a plan for the \n     debt ceiling. We trust your judgment as a Senator, but plead \n     with the Congress and the Senate to come up with a solution. \n     We absolutely cannot afford to see our retirement savings \n     sink again like it did in 2008. . . .\n\n  And it is not just individual citizens. I received a letter from \nDakota County's administrator. The letter reads, in part:\n\n       If the federal government does not resolve its fiscal \n     issues in a timely and responsible manner, it will drive up \n     costs to taxpayers here in Dakota County. . . . Being able to \n     borrow at the lowest possible rates has meant that our \n     County's taxpayers have gotten more and better public \n     facilities--from libraries to senior housing to highway \n     interchanges--and saved hundreds of thousands of dollars for \n     both property taxpayers and senior housing residents in the \n     past several years alone.\n\n  The city of Chaska reached out to my office, explaining that they are \nplanning to sell debt in August to fund a street reconstruction program \nand refund their water treatment plant. If Congress fails to act, these \nprojects will come at a much higher cost to residents of Chaska.\n  I received a particularly compelling e-mail yesterday from a woman \nfrom Falcon Heights. She wrote:\n\n       I am writing again to say I support the President and \n     realize a need to compromise. It is scary for a 66 year [old] \n     retired schoolteacher who has Medicare and social security. \n     Scarier is a default and what it would do to the economy.\n\n  That is advice from Sue. Sue gets it. She gets that Congress's \nfailure to act may have a direct impact on her but the impact is really \nfor the whole economy. And Sue is asking for us to compromise.\n  And compromise we have. Let me make one thing clear: Leader Reid's \nplan is a compromise. Let me make another thing clear: House Speaker \nBoehner's plan is a tea party plan.\n  Harry Reid's plan is a true compromise. It contains all spending cuts \nand zero revenues. During these debates, there have been lots of ratios \nfloating around. Senator Conrad, the budget chairman, proposed a \nbalanced and sensible plan that had a 1-to-1 spending cut to revenue \nratio. Personally, I liked that approach. President Obama was \nnegotiating a 4-to-1 or even 5-to-1 spending cut to revenue ratio. In \nthe Reid plan, there is no ratio. It is 100 percent cuts and zero \nrevenue.\n  Secondly, it contains dollar-for-dollar spending cuts to match the \ndebt ceiling increase. This is exactly what the Republicans had been \nasking for. Yet, this morning, I learned that 43 of my Republican \ncolleagues have signed a letter to Leader Reid signaling their \nopposition to his proposal. Why? Well, they say the savings from \nwinding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan do not count. \nSpecifically, they say these savings are ``a widely ridiculed \naccounting gimmick that breeds cynicism.'' Yet all but 3 of the 43 \nSenators who signed this letter voted for the Ryan budget on May 25 of \nthis year. That budget counted the same drawdowns as almost identical \nin savings. So those savings were legitimate enough to secure their \nsupport for the Ryan budget but not legitimate enough to secure their \nsupport for Leader Reid's debt ceiling compromise. Here we are on the \nprecipice, and suddenly they have done a 180-degree turn. Either these \nsavings count or they do not. You cannot have it both ways.\n  So we are proposing exactly what Republicans have been saying they \nwant. Yet, instead of accepting this deal, they are using what precious \ntime we have to push forward with their agenda. And it is not even \ntheir agenda, it is the tea party agenda. Their radical agenda is a \nwolf in sheep's clothing.\n\n  Last night, we voted down Speaker Boehner's plan, which requires the \npassage of a balanced budget constitutional amendment. A balanced \nbudget amendment sounds, on its face, sensible, but in reality, all of \nthe current House proposals for a balanced budget amendment would have \ndisastrous consequences for our Nation.\n  A balanced budget constitutional amendment would do permanent damage \nto our social safety net by slashing spending to 18 percent of GDP. \nThat is what they all propose. We have not had a spending ratio that \nlow since 1966, and today's America is very different than in 1966. We \nhave a much older population. Today, we have a higher percentage of \npeople drawing on Social Security and Medicare benefits--more than ever \nbefore. Health care costs are 50 percent higher. Even during President \nReagan's tenure, spending averaged 21 percent of GDP.\n\n[[Page S5116]]\n\n  What would an 18-percent cap really mean? Well, let's use the \nRepublican Study Committee's budget, proposed in April, as an example. \nA budget such as theirs is roughly what we would expect if we capped \nspending at 18 percent of GDP. Their budget cut nondefense \ndiscretionary funding by 70 percent by 2021. Like the Ryan plan, the \nRepublican Study Committee's budget ended Medicare as we know it, \nchanged it into a voucher program, and raised eligibility to 67, but it \ndid it more quickly. Their budget raised the Social Security retirement \nage to 70. It resulted in important programs such as food stamps and \nMedicaid getting cut by 50 percent.\n  The Republican Study Committee's budget was the Ryan budget on \nsteroids. I would like to remind you of what happened to it on the \nHouse floor--this is an interesting story--because this story shows you \njust how extreme this budget was.\n  Most House Republicans did not actually want such a harmful, \nDraconian budget to be the official House budget, but many of them \nwanted to go on record to brag to their tea party supporters that they \nvoted to slash $9 trillion in Federal spending. So they scheduled a \nvote and just assumed Democrats would vote it down for them. Then they \ncould just blame the Democrats.\n  Well, the minority whip, Steny Hoyer, caught wind of their plan and \nhad an idea. Moments before the vote, he asked Democrats to vote \n``present.'' This would leave the onus squarely on the Republicans to \nvote it up or down. Chaos erupted in the House, as Republican \nleadership realized what was happening. Too many votes had been cast in \nfavor of the radical budget, and it was on the verge of actually \npassing. Frantically, Republican leadership got a number of their \nMembers to switch from ``yes'' to ``no.'' In the end, 119 Republicans \nvoted in favor and 120 against. Crisis averted. That is how bad this \nplan was. And a balanced budget amendment that caps spending at 18 \npercent would essentially do exactly the same thing. This is a perfect \nexample of political posturing.\n  We voted down Speaker Boehner's plan last night for that very reason. \nHis plan was not about finding a real solution; it was all about \npolitical posturing. If it became law, it would subject Americans to a \nvery scary Republican Study Committee reality. House Republicans have \nshown they do not really want that. The American people definitely do \nnot want that. The American people have clearly said they want \ncompromise, they want an honest effort to meet in the middle. Sue from \nFalcon Heights is one of them.\n  Leader Reid has responded to the pleas of the American people by \noffering us a sensible compromise. I urge my colleagues to be statesmen \nfor the sake of the country. Please come to the table. We are trying to \nwork with you for the sake of the country. The clock is ticking.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining in the period \nallotted to Democrats?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. I see Senator Coburn is on the floor. I assume \nhe is the first speaker on the Republican side.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from Minnesota for his comments on our \nbudget situation. For the many who have gathered here and are watching \nthis at home and listening to this debate, this is a historic weekend \nwhere we have an opportunity--in fact, a challenge--to come forward and \ncraft a bipartisan solution which is good for this country and avoids--\navoids--the disaster that would happen Tuesday night if we fail to \nextend our debt ceiling.\n  The United States of America has never failed to extend its debt, not \nonce. In the last 72 years, since we enacted this law, we have had \nrequests from Presidents on both sides of the aisle to extend the debt \nceiling 89 times--55 times by Republicans, 34 times by Democrats. The \nPresident who holds the record for extending a debt ceiling--is \nPresident Ronald Reagan, 18 times in 8 years, tripling the national \ndebt.\n  Not once, not one time, did he face what we are facing here, a threat \nfrom the other side of the aisle that if we do not give in to their \nrequests, we will default on our national debt. That would be a \ncatastrophe. It is one thing to call a bluff. It is another to call a \nbluff with someone else's chips, because the victims--if we default on \nthis debt--will not be Members of Congress. The victims will be \nfamilies and businesses all across the United States.\n  If we watch interest rates go up as we are in the midst of an \neconomic recovery, people will be laid off. More people will be \nunemployed. That is exactly the wrong thing to do. We need to come to \nan agreement. We need to come to our senses. What the American people \nhave told us across the board is we need to reduce spending, we need to \nreduce our deficit, we need to do it in a sensible way, as the Senator \nfrom Minnesota said, to carefully choose these areas of waste and \ninefficiency and unnecessary spending but not to cut the essential \nbenefits that people need.\n  You will hear those come to the floor and say, oh, we are just \nspending more money. Well, the obvious answer is, in some respects we \nare. But keep in mind this one statistic. On January 1 of this year, \n10,000 Americans reached the age of 65. On January 2, another 10,000. \nOn January 3, again. Every day since January 1 and every day for the \nnext 19\\1/2\\ years, the baby boomers are now reaching retirement age. \nHaving paid into Social Security and Medicare for a lifetime, they \nfully expect and deserve the legal benefits they have been promised. \nThat is a new obligation of government, but one that we accepted when \nwe enrolled them in the system. Now we can find ways to make sure those \nbenefits are going to be guaranteed into the future with sensible \nchanges in entitlement programs and with sensible changes in our \nspending.\n  I find it hard to believe that many on the other side are arguing \nthey cannot find 1 penny--1 penny--that can be saved in the Pentagon. I \nthink we can save money there without endangering our security.\n  I find it also difficult to understand the argument that we cannot \nraise 1 penny in taxes on the wealthiest people in America if we are \nasking everyone else across the board to sacrifice. We have got to have \na balanced approach. The Presiding Officer from Virginia was part of a \ngroup of six Senators, three Democrats and three Republicans--we have \nbeen joined in our effort by the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Bennet--\ntrying to find a bipartisan way to deal with this deficit situation.\n  I am heartened to say that some 36 Senators have come forward, on \nboth sides of the aisle, saying we can deal with this as adults. We can \ndeal with it in a comprehensive and balanced way. We can keep our \npromise to people when it comes to the basic programs such as Social \nSecurity and Medicare, and we can do it in a fashion that reduces our \ndeficit and avoids the crisis which we are facing.\n  So I hope that--I see the Senator from Oklahoma here. He was part of \nthat gang. It seems as though we have all gathered here on the floor at \nthis moment--many of us have. I would hope in that spirit we can come \nto a bipartisan agreement to resolve the current crisis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have been listening in my office for the \nlast several hours to the debate. I think there is one thing that has \nnot been brought out in the debate. When Washington says it is going to \ncut spending, it is untruthful with the American public, because both \nthe Boehner bill and the Reid bill increase discretionary spending over \nthe next 10 years by--one of them $830 billion, and the other $832 \nbillion.\n  How is it that we can, with a straight face in this body, talk about \na cut when, in fact, CBO says we are going to actually increase the \nspending in the discretionary accounts over the next 10 years nearly $1 \ntrillion.\n  You have heard the debate in the House, in the Senate, of a spending \ncut. And, of course, that goes to what the heart of the problem is in \nour country; words get twisted around to the advantage of the \npoliticians but to the disadvantage of the American citizens. We are in \ntrouble financially. Most people will agree with that. We have programs \nthat are in difficult straits.\n  As a matter of fact, they are broke, they are not just in difficult \nstraits.\n\n[[Page S5117]]\n\nHere are the ones that are broke. Medicare Part A trust fund. Worst-\ncase scenario this year to 2016. That is the fund that solves and pays \nfor hospitalizations for our seniors.\n  We have heard a lot of statements said about Medicare. The average \nMedicare recipient paid $130,000 into Medicare. The average Medicare \nrecipient takes $350,000 out. How long do we think that can continue? \nHow long can we continue to tell seniors that we can continue a program \nbased on its utilization rates, based on its reimbursement rates, based \non the tax rates, that has a $220,000 difference between what goes out \nin benefits versus what comes in? It is broke.\n  Medicaid is broke. The reason it is broke is because the States are \nbroke trying to take care of it. We mandate what they must do, and yet \nthe States are choking on Medicaid, and we are choking on matching the \namount of dollars. Under the Affordable Care Act, it is now estimated \n25 million more people will go into Medicaid. So it is broke.\n  The Census. It was broke before it started. It cost twice what it did \n10 years ago, $8 billion more than what was estimated.\n  Fannie and Freddie. We know they are broke. They are $190 billion--\nthat you have now committed for, to pay to get them out of hock--\nCongress created that $190 billion. That is where we are today. It is \ngoing to be $300 or $400 billion that we have to pay--we will be \nrequired to pay, citizens of this country.\n  Social Security. People say it is not broke. We have $2.5 trillion \nworth of IOUs. Well, the fact is, that money is gone. Congress stole \nit, spent it on other things. Now we lack the ability to go into \ninternational financial markets to borrow that money to put that trust \nfund whole.\n  So why do we need to reform Social Security? So we can make sure it \nis there in the future. What we do know is in 2032 now, according to \nthe trustees, everybody on Social Security will only get 77 percent of \nwhat they are promised, and every year after that it will decline, so \nthat when my kids are on Social Security, they will get about 40 \npercent of what the average Social Security recipient gets now. We know \nwe can fix it. We know we can fix it and make it sustainable forever. \nBut we will not do that because that is politically difficult.\n  The U.S. Post Office is bleeding every day. Yet we have not fixed it. \nWe are going to do a gimmick to buy some time. But the fact is, we have \nset it up under a system when they negotiate labor contracts under the \narbitration system. They cannot consider the financial health of the \nPost Office. That would be like paying somebody to mow your grass and \nsaying, they will set the price on it and you cannot negotiate what the \nprice is. Yet they are going to lose $8 to $10 billion this year and \nmore every year going forward, and we have not fixed it, not done \nanything.\n  Cash for Clunkers. Absolute--when you look at the dollars--and the \nhome buyer program, the new home buyer program--they actually had a \nnegative effect on the economy. That is what the studies show now. So \nwe blew through all of that money.\n  The highway trust fund--what is used to build highways and roads and \nbridges in our country--is broke. We are looking for $13 billion to try \nto make it whole, and all we did was transfer the last 3 years to that. \nRather than reform it, we did not do anything about it.\n  The new government-run health care program. Here is what we know. The \nnew studies show that over half of the employers in this country will \ndrop their insurance for the people who presently have insurance at \nwork. Hundreds of billions of dollars of additional taxpayer money is \ngoing to be required to subsidize the exchanges those people are going \nto go into, because the penalty for dropping somebody's insurance is \neconomically too low to keep employers from doing that.\n  We have all of these programs that are broke, and we have a \ndiscussion about the debt ceiling, but we are not talking about what is \nthe real problem. This government is twice the size it was 10 years \nago. Twice as big. It would be great if all of it were constitutional, \nit would be great if it were all effective, it would be great if it \nwere all efficient, and it would be great if we could afford it. But \nthe fact is, we are where we are today, with a $1.6 trillion deficit, \nbecause we cannot afford the government we have.\n  So we have not concentrated on the very areas where we can find \nmutual agreement. We have had three bipartisan bills in here where we \nhave cut money, significant money, billion here, $5 billion here, $7 \nbillion here, $3 billion here, go through the Senate with vast majority \nvotes, only to go nowhere, because the allowance for the debate on the \nunderlying bills was stopped. The bills were pulled.\n  So what do we do? Well, the first thing we do is we look at what the \nproblems are. What are the problems? We have 100 different programs \nwith 100 sets of bureaucracies for surface transportation alone. Why do \nwe do that? Why have we not fixed it? That is a question the American \npeople ought to be asking.\n  We have 82 programs to improve the quality of our teachers, run by \nthe Federal Government across 7 different agencies. Only one of them is \nat the Department of Education. Why are we doing that? Where is the \nassessment of how well they work? Where are the metrics to say we \nshould be spending this money in this way because we are getting a \nreturn? Not one of them has a metric on it. Not one of them has ever \nbeen measured on whether it is effective.\n  We have 88 economic development programs in 4 agencies, for which we \nspend $6.8 billion, and we have another 100 economic development \nprograms in 6 other agencies, for which we spend another $4 billion, \nand not one of them has ever been measured to see if it improves \neconomic activity. And if, in fact, it does, why do we have 188 \nseparate agencies to stimulate economic development? I mean, this is \nnot complicated stuff. It is common sense. Every American, other than \nthe Congress, would fix that.\n  We have 56 programs to teach financial literacy to the American \npeople. First of all, I question whether we ought to be teaching \nanybody financial literacy as a government when we run it so poorly. \nBut if, in fact, we do, why do we have 56? And, oh, by the way, not one \nof them has ever been measured to see if it effectively teaches \nsomebody financial literacy.\n  We have 47 job training programs which cost $18 billion a year, 9 \ndifferent agencies, 9 different sets of bureaucracies, and all of them \nbut three overlap with the other. That is according to the Government \nAccountability Office. Why? Why would we do that?\n  We have 18 programs for food for the hungry. That is something we all \nwant to be involved in. Eighteen? Why 18 sets of bureaucracies? How \nwell are they working? Are they effective? Could we do them better? The \nquestion has not even been asked by Congress.\n  We have homeless programs for both prevention and assistance--20, 6 \ndifferent agencies. So you have 20 different sets of bureaucracies that \nare designed to do the same thing.\n  Disaster response and preparedness, inside FEMA alone. Inside FEMA \nalone, we have 17 different programs, inside that one agency, which is \npart of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  I ask the question: Why? Why hasn't it been a priority for us to work \non this?\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it may surprise the Senator--I hope not, \nand I don't think so--but it might surprise people listening to us to \nhear from this side of the aisle that a lot of us have enormous respect \nfor what the Senator has been talking about and fighting for and what \nhe has achieved. I might add he is one of those courageous Senators who \nhas come together in the last months working as part of the so-called \nGang of 6 to try to bridge the gap and see if we cannot find a way \nforward.\n  As I listen to him, there is an enormous amount of common sense in \nthe questions he is asking. These are questions all of us need to join \nin. We need to join into them in a process that allows us to be able to \nwork in a balanced way on the grand bargain, as you call it, the big \nfix. I ask the Senator, because I think a lot of Americans listening to \nthe debate--and I have been listening on the floor and listening some \nback in the office--people have to be saying these guys have been \ntalking\n\n[[Page S5118]]\n\npast each other because we hear things over there that sound reasonable \nand we hear things on this side that sound reasonable. But people are \nasking: What is hanging up this process? Why is the entire country \nbeing held hostage?\n  I ask my colleague if he would help us kind of bear down on what we \nneed to do. I ask him if it is not fair and accurate to say that the \nso-called Gang of 6--a terrible name--maybe we can call them G6 or \nsomething--but they came together with an understanding that we needed \nbalance in the approach to satisfy both sides and build a critical \nmass. That balance requires cuts. We have to put the big items--big \nticket items on the table, and that means fixing Social Security, \nreforming it for the long-term; Medicare and Medicaid, which are \nunsustainable on their current paths; defense, where we have to find a \nhandle on some of the procurement and expenditures. The Senator has \njoined in this. We have to close some tax loopholes and have tax reform \nand find some level of revenue at an appropriate ratio that allows us \nto fix this. That is where the problem has been. There is a group of \nfolks in the House who have insisted no revenue at all.\n  I ask the Senator, isn't it fair to say the Gang of 6 came up with a \nmore balanced approach in which, I believe, the Senate could find a \nground of compromise--what Senator Reid has proposed, I believe, has \ncuts that the Republicans have supported--maybe not quite enough yet \nand maybe we can negotiate that.\n  (Mr. DURBIN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, Let me reclaim my time. There are \nabsolutely no cuts in what either Senator Reid or Speaker Boehner \nproposed in discretionary spending. The spending will rise $832 billion \nover the next 10 years in the discretionary accounts.\n  Only in Washington is that a cut. Quite frankly, I am willing to work \nwith my colleagues. I have been out there. I said we have to move and \neliminate some of these loopholes; we have to reform the Tax Code. I am \nwilling to take heat from my side on that.\n  What I am not willing to take anymore is a Senate that will not work \non the details of the specific problems. What I am trying to do is \noutline where the problems are. Where is the leadership? We didn't do \nit when we were in charge either, I say to Senator Kerry. There has \nbeen a failure of leadership in this country, in this body, to attack \nthese very problems. When we have 47 job training programs and none of \nthem are working well--because that is what we do know, because the \nvery few times they have been looked at, they don't work--and we are \nspending $18 billion a year and we are not fixing them, the American \npeople have to say: What is wrong with you all?\n  What we have to do is evaluate the effectiveness of every program in \nthe Federal Government. We have to limit the overhead cost to Federal \nprograms. We have put ideas out there--and this is $9 trillion worth of \ncuts--not Washington cuts but American cuts--money we are not going to \nspend that is less than what we are spending today, not money we are \nnot going to spend that we would have spent more the next year. These \nare real cuts. Each one of these is in here, backed by the facts, not \nbiased. We could disagree with where we make cuts but not with the \nfacts in here.\n  All the facts come from the Congressional Research Service, the \nGeneral Accounting Office, the OMB, the President's budget, in terms of \nhis recommendations and why, and the CBO. We will not go there.\n  My problem with the Senate is that we will not do our work. We are as \nguilty--and this is not partisan to me. Our country's future is at \nstake. When we have two bills--one last night and one today--that are \nliterally lying to the American people when they say cuts, I think it \nis unconscionable.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator further yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me finish, if I may. I will yield to the Senator in a \nmoment. The fact is, we will not tell the truth to the American people.\n  The first truth is, if we will be honest with them, they will \nunderstand the necessities that will have to be brought forward to be \nable to solve the problem. But denying what the problem is, we will \nnever get consensus in this country and the embrace of the American \npeople to do what everybody in this body knows is eventually going to \nhave to be done.\n  In 5 years, we will not have a Medicare system that is similar to the \nMedicare system we have today. It is absolutely unsustainable. We will \nnever be able to borrow the money to do it. We are going to get a debt \ndowngrade no matter what we do. So rather than continue to be dishonest \nwith the American people about the status of where we are, we ought to \nembrace them and call for the very things that made this country \ngreat--the sacrifice of the citizens to rebuild the potential for our \nfuture, recreate a renewal in our country that embraces the things that \nmade us great--a true free enterprise system, with a limited government \nthat will actually allow people to be rewarded for their hard work and \ntheir blood, sweat, and toil--get that back and have the government \ntake a fair share of that. On the upside, it should be more; on the \ndownside, it should be less. I agree.\n  The question is, Will we do it or will we continue a charade to the \nAmerican people, continuing to tell them we are going to cut $900 \nbillion out of the discretionary budget when, in fact, we are going to \nincrease it 832?\n  There is only a $2 billion difference between Senator Reid's plan and \nSpeaker Boehner's plan on discretionary spending. Both are untruthful \nto the American people. Both of them take the American people as a lap \nand say we can wink and nod at them and tell them something that is not \ntrue and walk out of here saying we spent less money. We are only going \nto spend less than we planned to spend, which was too much in the first \nplace, which was unsustainable.\n  Our deal is that we don't have the courage to actually make the cuts \nlisted in here. We don't have the courage to eliminate the waste, and \nwe don't have the courage to eliminate the duplication. Why? Because \nevery one of these programs has a political backing. We are \npoliticians. Unfortunately, too often, we are that instead of \nstatesmen. It is time for us--both sides--to lead this country, to lead \nthe country in a vision of here is the real truth of our problem.\n  Now let's have a debate about what should be the No. 1 priority. How \nmuch should we spend on defense? Should we continue to allow contracts \nto go way overrun? Should we continue to allow requirement creep in \ncontracts--not just in defense but in homeland security, HHS. The same \nproblems we have in defense we have in all the other big agencies. We \nbuy $64 billion worth of IT every year in this country, and $37 billion \nof it is wasted, totally blown. Why? What have we done about it? Not \none thing. We don't look at the high risk for the GAO on IT. Every year \nthat happens. The Census Bureau spent $600 million on a device that \nnever worked. There was no penalty for the company that did it. We paid \nit anyway. It was a cost-plus contract, and the reason it never worked \nis because we had requirement creep all the way through.\n\n  We don't have any grownups making the purchases for this country--\nnobody with experience. So we are doing the wrong thing at the wrong \ntime. We need to be doing the right things at the right time for the \nright reasons, considering that we make sure we take care of those who \nneed it and demand participation from everybody else.\n  We need to cap the total number of Federal employees--not because we \nwant to but because we don't have any other choice. We don't have to \nlet anybody go; just through attrition we can downsize the Federal \nGovernment.\n  We waste $15 billion every 5 years on managing properties in this \ncountry that we own that are vacant. Yet we are spending that money on \nthem. We cannot get a real property bill through. How valuable to us is \n$15 billion? We have to start paying attention to the pennies, nickels, \nand dimes. We will not do it.\n  Unnecessary government printing--including us. I have been trying to \nget the elimination of this for 3 years. There are millions of dollars \nwe can save by not printing the copies of this every day, which nobody \nlooks at--except I did see my good friend from Illinois looking at a \nvote last night. But he could have gotten it online out of\n\n[[Page S5119]]\n\nhis BlackBerry. We are tearing down trees to print paper we don't need.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on \nthe Republican side.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, again--I am trying to \nhelp us get out of this predicament where we have a couple days before \nthe United States defaults. Everything the Senator has said is worthy \nof inquiry. Isn't it true that if we could get--part of the Reid \nproposal and the Boehner proposal proposes a joint committee that will \nbe structured somewhat like a Base Closing Commission, which will \nrequire the Senate and the House to vote in an expeditious fashion on \nthese kinds of proposals, whatever the joint committee proposes, and if \nthe joint committee doesn't succeed in proposing something, hopefully, \neither the Gang of 6 or the Simpson-Bowles commission will.\n  Isn't the key to resolving this crisis and not defaulting our ability \nto be able to come together on a sufficient trigger or some sufficient \nmechanism that guarantees we are actually going to deal with this in a \nsimilar fashion to what the Senator is raising?\n  Mr. COBURN. I don't disagree that those negotiations are going on as \nwe speak. I am not a party to them. I don't know if the Senator from \nMassachusetts is. I suspect the Presiding Officer is. We are not going \nto decide that. That will come to us for a decision. Look, I worked for \na long number of months with my colleagues from the other side of the \naisle. I put my name on a bill that doesn't fix it, but it was \nsomething to get us moving. It is better than where we are today. I \nagree with the Senator. But that is not good enough. We are not good \nenough yet to be where we need to be if we are actually going to solve \nthe problem.\n  Let me finish going through this. We need to end no-bid contracts in \nthis country. To give a specific example, before he left, Senator \nLeMieux got through on the business bill prescreening of payments on \nMedicare payments, so we don't just pay them and then go chase the \nfraud. We got through a bill that required the Centers for Medicaid \nServices to put in a program to look to see if they ought to pay the \nbill.\n  What they did is signed a cost-plus contract for $77 million with a \nfirm that has never done that before and didn't take a fixed-price \ncontract from firms that have already done it before. Tell me how we \nlet that happen. Yet it happened. When we had testimony in the \ncommittee, they said it was a fixed-price contract, only to write back \nand say it was not a fixed-price contract. We need some common sense in \nour government.\n  We need to disclose the text and cost of legislation prior to \npassage. We need to identify duplicative government programs. We have \ndone that in here. There are hundreds of thousands of them throughout \nthe Federal Government. We need to eliminate them. We need to mandate \ncongressional oversight. That is where our leaders have failed on both \nsides. They have not mandated the committee chairmen to do the \noversight required to solve this problem. We need to freeze the size of \nthis government. We cannot afford the government we have. The debate is \nabout what will happen in the future. What will be the revenue \nincreases and the spending increases?\n  Nobody is talking about decreasing the size of the Federal \nGovernment. We can't afford this government. We can't afford to \ncontinue to spend the money we are spending.\n  I will close with this. If we continue to be less than \nstraightforward with the American people about what we are doing, about \nthe Reid bill--and the reason I wanted to debate the Boehner bill is I \nwanted to make this point on the Boehner bill--when we call something a \ncut of $900 billion, just because the CBO says we are going to spend \n$900 billion less than what we were planning to spend, but it's still \n$832 billion more than what we are spending now, that is not a cut \nanywhere except in Washington. We ought to admit it. If that is the \nbest we can do, the American people need to know that is the best we \ncan do. But we can't play the games anymore.\n\n  I have another colleague, I think, who would like to speak, and with \nthe remaining time, I would yield to her.\n  Is the Senator from Alaska interested in speaking?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. It is my \nunderstanding we were bumping up against the vote at 5:30. Is that \ncorrect, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans have 3 minutes 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I had hoped to be able to speak at \ngreater length than 3 minutes this afternoon, but the message that \nSenator Coburn has been delivering is so incredibly important. I want \nto join Senator Kerry's remarks in thanking him for being one who has \nbeen working to find not a deal but to find a solution to the issues we \nface today.\n  As we have deliberated all day long, there has been a lot of finger-\npointing, a lot of blame. As the Senator from Massachusetts has noted, \na lot of times it seems as if the comments are just going past one \nanother rather than directed in a purposeful way that would actually \nmake a difference to this debate.\n  We started out this morning with messages from the leader arguing \nover who was filibustering. We have all talked about the need to see \ncompromise, and then we go on to say why we can't compromise. What we \nneed to be working toward is a solution to the problem as opposed to \nattempting to cobble together a deal at the last moment that will gain \nthose necessary votes.\n  The one thing I would hope we are all working toward is to avoid the \ndefault we all fear. We have all been listening to our constituents \ncalling us this weekend. As we read our e-mails, as we talk to friends \nand neighbors, the concern is very real. One thing we have managed to \ndo on a bipartisan basis in this Congress over the past few days is to \nincite fear in the American public, to make our constituents angry, \nfrustrated, and mad. Well, misery loves company. We are angry, \nfrustrated, and mad here. But I would like to suggest, as the hours \nwind down, we come together as a body in the Senate and the House to \nfind that compromise.\n  Senator Isakson stood on the floor earlier this afternoon and spoke \nof the contours of a proposal that worked to integrate the good ideas \nof several different Members--of Senator Reid, of Speaker Boehner, and \nof the minority leader, Senator McConnell. We should be working to find \nthose areas where we agree because those areas are, in fact, in place.\n  I am hopeful, Mr. President, as the majority leader comes back in \nfrom his meetings he will have some encouraging news for us as we work \nthrough these last hours.\n  I would like to gain some additional time later on this evening to \nspeak more in detail, but I see the majority leader before us waiting \nto speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll and the \nfollowing Senators entered the Chamber and answered to their names.\n\n                             [Quorum No. 5]\n\n     Brown (MA)\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Coburn\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Johanns\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     McCain\n     Merkley\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Pryor\n     Reid (NV)\n     Schumer\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum is not present.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to instruct the Sergeant at Arms to \nrequest the presence of absent Senators, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S5120]]\n\nSouth Carolina (Mr. DeMint), the Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), \nand the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 75, nays 20, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 121 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--75\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lugar\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Rubio\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--20\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Enzi\n     Grassley\n     Hoeven\n     Isakson\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Lee\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Paul\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Vitter\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     DeMint\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Lieberman\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum is present.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today the Speaker and Republican leader held \na press conference to announce they are in talks with the President and \nthat a bargain to raise the debt ceiling is in the works and is close.\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate, that is not true. I just spent \n2 hours with the President and Vice President and Leader Pelosi. It is \nfair for me to say that the engagement there is not in any meaningful \nway. The Republican leader still refused to negotiate in good faith. \nRevenue is off the calendar--no way we can talk about revenues. \nEntitlements--oh, they are after entitlements: Medicare, Social \nSecurity.\n  The Speaker and Republican leader should know that merely saying we \nhave an agreement in front of television cameras doesn't make it so. \nThe Republican leader at the press event says he is engaged. \nFortunately, Members of his caucus, at least as far as I am concerned, \nand my Members, are more engaged than he is. There are meaningful talks \ngoing on with some of his Members with some of my Senators. While the \nRepublican leader is holding meaningless press conferences, his Members \nare reaching out to me, and other Members, as I have just indicated. \nThey are coming forward with thoughtful ideas to try to move the \nprocess forward. I welcome their ideas and ask all Members to continue \nthese discussions. America is watching us, and they are demanding a \nresult that is balanced.\n  I say to my friend--and he is my friend--the Republican leader, I \nwill come to his office, I will go to the White House with him, I will \ndo anything I can do to try to move this process forward, but I say as \nrespectfully as I can to my friend the senior Senator from Kentucky \nthat the process has not been moved forward during this day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader--the Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the fact is that the only way we are \ngoing to get an agreement before Tuesday is to have an agreement with \nthe President of the United States--the only person in America of the \n307 million of us who can sign something into law. I am more optimistic \nthan my friend the majority leader. We have both talked to the \nPresident today, talked to the Vice President several times. I think we \nhave a chance of getting there.\n  What I think is not helpful is the process we are going through here \non the Senate floor: having show votes over live quorums, having \nreluctance on the part of the majority to have a vote on a measure they \nfavor, which we have been prepared to vote on since last night.\n  Look, we need to be in a position where all of us in the leadership \ncan come back here and say that we think we have reached a framework of \nan agreement we can recommend to our Members and be briefing our \nMembers. The sooner we can do that, the sooner we can reassure the \nAmerican people we are going to get a result on a bipartisan basis. So \nthat is what I am working on, and I am not interested in scoring any \npolitical points. I am interested in getting an outcome for the \nAmerican people, and the only way that can be done is with the \nPresident of the United States, and we are going to continue to work on \nthat, get this problem solved, and let everybody in the country know we \nare not going to default for the first time in our history. That is how \nI am going to spend my time until we get that outcome and I can come up \nhere and recommend it to my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are here today right now for this reason. \nIt is spelled f-i-l-i-b-u-s-t-e-r--filibuster. There are delaying \ntactics proceeding right now. They will not allow us to have a vote, an \nup-or-down vote on our amendment, and this is a filibuster. By any \nother term, it is a filibuster. That is why we are here. I hope the \nnegotiations go on. We are willing to be as fair as we can, but there \nhas to be something that the President and Vice President Biden and the \nrest of us think is a step in the right direction. I guess talking is a \nstep in the right direction, but that is about it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the matter we have before \nus, which is amendment No. 589--that we have an up-or-down vote on \nthat, as we have all the time, of course. There would be no points of \norder, as we do it here all the time. Have a vote on it right now.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, these \nare direct quotes from my friend the majority leader. He says: ``In the \nSenate it has always been the case you need 60 votes.'' ``Always been \nthe case you need 60 votes.'' This is the majority leader of the \nSenate. For him to suggest that a matter of this magnitude, in a body \nthat requires 60 votes for almost everything, is going to be done with \n51 votes makes no sense at all. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, it is unconscionable that the \nRepublicans would filibuster legislation to prevent a default on \nnational obligations. Frankly, it is unprecedented. Since 1962, \nCongress has raised the debt limit 74 times, including 18 times under \nPresident Reagan, and there was never a threat of a filibuster, and it \nwas always by majority vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I might say I actually cut short a \nconversation with the Vice President to come out here for this \nimportant vote on a live quorum. I would like to get back to work so we \ncan hopefully solve this problem.\n  It seems to me it would be a good idea for the majority to decide to \nallow the vote on the proposal they say they are in favor of; \ntherefore, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the pending cloture \nmotion occur at 6:30.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. A filibuster in any other words----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, you can put lipstick on it, a nice suit, \neven a skirt sometimes, it is still a filibuster.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for order in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold for a moment?\n\n[[Page S5121]]\n\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that I may be able to complete my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, later tonight we will vote on the majority \nleader's bill to reduce the deficit and increase the Nation's statutory \ndebt limit. Earlier today the House of Representatives decisively \nrejected the majority leader's proposal. If I got it right, the vote \nwas 246 to 173. Thirteen did not vote, but there were 11 Democrats who \nvoted against the proposal as well. It will be defeated here in the \nSenate later this evening or whenever the majority leader allows it to \nbe voted on. It is fine with me, whatever he decides to do.\n  As a substantive matter, I deeply oppose the efforts of the majority \nleader. His plan does not tackle the task at hand. The President would \nget a $2.7 trillion debt limit increase but less than $1 trillion in \ncuts, and most of those cuts are gimmicks, budgetary gimmicks. They \nassume savings from more spending that the President has not requested \nand that will be unlikely to materialize. It does not include a \nbalanced budget amendment. Most important from my perspective, it \nassumes a massive tax increase in 2013 by allowing the 2001 and 2003 \ntax relief to expire, allowing the AMT to hit the middle-class \ntaxpayers, and allowing for increases in estate taxes.\n  Most important, from my perspective, the majority leader's approach \nassumes a massive tax increase in 2013 by allowing the 2001 and 2003 \ntax relief to expire, allowing the alternative minimum tax to hit \nmiddle-class taxpayers, something we have not allowed, and allowing for \nincreases in estate taxes that are a business and job killer.\n  We are scheduled to vote on this bill late this evening, actually \nearly on Sunday morning. Americans might ask why in the world are we \ndoing this? Republicans were ready to take this vote yesterday evening. \nThis delay in voting does not match with the asserted urgency of \nraising the debt ceiling. Yesterday, the Senate majority leader stated \non the floor that the country defaults on its debt at 12 midnight on \nTuesday.\n  Tuesday is August 2; is this true? What are these claims based on \nthat the majority leader is making? Amazingly, we do not know for a \nfact whether the United States does run short of cash to pay all its \nobligations on August 2. We were told by the Treasury Secretary way \nback in May that August 2 might be a date when Treasury runs out of \nmoney to pay our bills. We have seen estimates of the Treasury's cash \nposition on the floor that came either from a local think tank or from \nWall Street financial firms.\n  The Treasury will not give us updated information. It is outrageous. \nThe last time Treasury informed Congress of its estimates of its cash \nposition was in May when it backed off of a prior guess and extended \ntheir estimate of running dry of cash by 3 weeks. Since that last \nupdate, I made a simple request of members of the Financial Stability \nOversight Council, commonly called FSOC, which is chaired by the \nTreasury Secretary. I asked for an update on Treasury's cash and liquid \nassets to be delivered by close of business on Thursday, and I asked \nfor that as ranking on the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I also asked for contingency plans of Treasury and our financial \nregulators outlining what they will do if the debt limit is not raised \nor if we face a ratings downgrade on our U.S. debt. Treasury has not \nresponded to this request. It is outrageous. They know what they are \ngoing to do.\n  We were told the Nation will fall off a financial cliff on August 2 \nat midnight. That is a lot of precision, down to the hour. Is it true? \nI don't know. The American people don't know. Social Security \nrecipients in Utah don't know and Treasury won't tell us. I might add \nthe rating agencies don't know either. We are being asked to give the \nPresident the largest increase in debt limit in our Nation's history. \nGet that. We are being asked to give the President the largest increase \nin our debt limit in our Nation's history. His last one was the largest \nat that time. We were asked to consider policies that involved \ntrillions of dollars, with no effects that will occur over decades, \nwith no current information about how much money the government has and \nexpects to have over the next few days and weeks.\n  Treasury told me yesterday that they are working on getting me some \ninformation. Yet I still don't know how much money Treasury now has to \npay its bills and neither does anybody else on the floor. We don't know \nhow much it expects to have over the next few days and weeks or whether \nTreasury still believes that midnight August 2 has any particular \nsignificance. The politicians all insist August 2 is the date. I am \nbeginning to have my doubts. If that was the case, wouldn't it make \nsense for the majority leader to schedule votes commensurate with this \nurgency? Why waste more than 24 hours, which is what the majority \nleader did by refusing our offer to vote last night on his bill. It is \nnot going to change the vote.\n  It is not unreasonable to conclude that maybe that August 2 date is \nnot all it is cracked up to be. We can't say for sure because the \nadministration, despite my request more than 48 hours ago, has refused \nto provide Congress with information regarding its cash position. But \nothers seem to think so.\n  Yesterday, Moody's Investors Service stated, clearly:\n\n       It remains our expectation that the government will \n     continue with timely debt service. . . . If the debt limit is \n     not raised before August 2, we believe that the Treasury \n     would give priority to debt service payments and could thus \n     postpone a potential debt default for a number of days.\n\n  Does Moody's know more than our Treasury Secretary and FSOC that has \nbeen set up to help us to understand these things? They have been \nworking on it for months. Why can't they give us the information?\n  This analysis is consistent with everything my colleague and friend \nfrom Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey, has been saying for months.\n  He understood early on that regardless of the rhetoric there would be \nno default on August 2. The administration is fully capable of \nprioritizing payments. There is a much more pressing issue than \nimminent default--a credit downgrade due to the failure of Congress to \nuse this opportunity to take significant deficit reduction measures. \nThat is the real takeaway from Moody's report:\n\n       Reductions of the magnitude now being proposed, if adopted, \n     would likely lead Moody's to adopt a negative outlook on the \n     AAA rating. . . . The chances of a significant improvement in \n     the long-term credit profile of the government coming from \n     deficit reductions of the magnitude proposed in either plan \n     are not high.\n\n  That is Moody's. Our debt has become so unmanageable that we face a \ncredit downgrade with consequent higher interest rates if we do not \nenact a big-time deficit reduction package.\n  This year is our third straight trillion-dollar deficit. Our national \ndebt is $14.5 trillion. The President's budget would add $13 trillion \nin additional debt if he gets his way. I don't know about you, but I \ncannot tolerate that. That is added to already almost a $15 trillion \ndebt today.\n  I have spoken previously about the debt bubble the Nation finds \nitself in, but I wish to reemphasize that point in light of the \nwarnings from ratings agencies that our credit faces a downgrade absent \nreal deficit reduction. Currently, Federal debt held by the public \nequals a modern record of about 69 percent of GDP and it is headed to \n100 percent and we all know it.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reports that current tax and spending \nlaw takes that figure to 76 percent of GDP over the next 10 years, and \nwe all know it is going to hit 100 percent if we keep going with what \nthe President is doing and, unfortunately, with what my friends on the \nother side are doing.\n  To put that number in perspective, at the end of fiscal year 2008, \nthe debt held by the public reached about 41 percent. That is less than \n2\\1/2\\ years ago. That was under the Bush administration. That is 41 \npercent compared to 70 percent today. As bad as the 76-percent figure \nis that we will reach--according to the Budget Office--President \nObama's budget would raise debt held by the public to 87 percent of GDP \nby his own actuaries. I have to tell you they very seldom have been \naccurate or right. They are always low.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, if we continue current \ntax\n\n[[Page S5122]]\n\npolicy and don't raise rates, fix the alternative minimum tax, provide \nestate tax relief, provide for a fix to the physician payment system--\nthat is the SGR--policies supported by clear majorities of Americans by \n2021, debt held by the public will reach no less than 97 percent, which \nis precisely what I have been talking about.\n  Here is the sticky wicket. CBO projects the cost of simply paying the \ninterest on all this debt will rise to $792 billion--that is if CBO is \nright and generally they are on the low side--in other words, 3.3 \npercent of GDP in 2021. What happens if interest rates go up? They are \nlikely to up. Currently, interest rates are very low. The 10-year \nTreasury rates are currently around 3.5 percent.\n  During the past 2 years, this administration has spent recklessly, \nraising the total debt from $10.6 trillion to almost $14.5 trillion \ntoday. Because debt was cheap, the President was able to take on a lot \nof it. The true cost of this debt was hidden by low interest rates.\n  What will happen when interest rates rise? What happens if interest \nrates rise to levels seen during the 1980s or 1990s? Think of my \nsuggestion that these rating agencies of government are always low. \nInterest rates are going to rise and the costs are going to rise too.\n  During the 1980s, rates on 3-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes \nrose to over 8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. During the 1990s, \nrates on 3-month and 10-year notes rose to 5 percent and 6.6 percent, \nrespectively. That cost as laid out by CBO could be astronomical. Under \nPresident Obama's 2012 current budget, the CBO projects deficit rates \nover the next 10 years resulting in an estimated $10 trillion being \nadded to this $14.5 trillion public debt--a 100-percent increase.\n  Under the scenario where interest rates rise to the historical \naverage of the 1990s, the public debt is projected to grow an \nadditional $8 trillion or a 77-percent increase. Under the scenario \nwhere interest rates rise to the historical average of the 1980s, the \npublic debt would grow $14.5 trillion, doubling in size. This is the \nreal impact of Moody's warning.\n  It is bad enough that President Obama has taken on so much debt that \nit may result in a downgrade of our credit, but it is even worse that \nfaced with that downgrade he and his Democratic allies refused to \ndeleverage. Should we get downgraded for failure to enact a serious \ndeficit reduction package, our debt will only grow larger because \nincreased interest rates will increase the cost of borrowing. We all \nknow about budgetary gimmickry around here, and this place is filled \nwith it. This economic debt is filled with it. The arguments about the \nfuture are filled with it.\n  Americans should be less concerned about the August 2 deadline than \nthe fact that over the long term our debt bubble runs the risk of \nbecoming a debt spiral that turns into a death spiral for our economy.\n  Let me close by making two points. First, given the treacherous \nfiscal waters we are in, Congress and the American people need to know \nwhere the U.S. Treasury stands. It is unacceptable that they are being \nasked to make decisions based on a proclaimed August 2 deadline with no \nfacts to back it up.\n  I urge all Americans, all Utahans, and all Social Security recipients \nto get in touch with the Treasury right now and ask them to show us the \nmoney. Call Treasury, send them an e-mail, send out a tweet. Show us \nthe money. We have a right to know cash in the Treasury comes from the \ntaxes that hard-working Americans pay. Government is charged with \nstewardship over use of that cash. Withholding information is a \nshirking of that responsibility, and I do not think anybody on this \nfloor believes that Treasury does not know what they are going to do. I \ndon't believe any Senator believes they should be stopping the \ninformation from coming to us, especially at this time.\n  We should not run Treasury and manage taxpayer resources the way \nBernie Madoff ran his hedge funds, by taking cash and when asked for \ninformation refusing to give it and just saying: Trust me.\n  I have a simple question: Does Treasury expect to run out of cash on \nTuesday, August 2? The President and his Treasury Department must \nanswer this question--which brings me to my second point. It is much \nmore critical that we get a deficit reduction package right than that \nwe adhere to this arbitrary August 2 deadline. There is one bill that \ngets that right from my perspective, and that, of course, is cut, cap, \nand balance. So far, the only bipartisan votes taken by the Congress in \nthis debt ceiling debate are the vote for cut, cap, and balance in the \nHouse and the House vote to defeat the majority leader's bill. Those \nare the only two that are bipartisan.\n\n  This debate is not over yet. I expect Senator Reid's bill to fail \ntonight, but then it is back to the drawing board. My hope is that the \nPresident will then do what he has so far refused to do; that is, to \ntake a leadership role in this debate, to stand up to his base and \nencourage his party to take real steps to reduce the deficit. I am not \ngoing to hold my breath.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, might I inquire how much time is left on \nthe Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Following my colleague from Utah who talked about getting the \nPresident engaged in these discussions, I noticed a large story in \nThursday's New York Times: ``President on Sidelines in Critical Battle \nover Debt Ceiling.'' President on the sidelines.\n  We are at a time where we are facing the largest threat to our \nnational security, and we cannot have the President on the sidelines.\n  When I talk about the single largest threat to our national security, \nI am not talking about a terrorist organization. I am not talking about \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am not talking about natural disasters, \ndisease, epidemics, and not famine. I am talking about our national \ndebt. Our national debt is the threat. It is the greatest threat to our \nnational security.\n  I will tell my colleagues this isn't a problem for one party, the \nother party; it is a problem for all of us as Americans. I am not the \nonly one who is saying that. Actually, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, has said the most significant threat to our \nNation's security is our debt. Let me repeat: The most significant \nthreat to our national security is our debt. My colleagues may notice \nthat Admiral Mullen makes no mention at all of the debt ceiling. He is \nspeaking specifically about the debt. He is doing that because the debt \nceiling isn't the problem; our national debt is the threat.\n  We have $14 trillion of debt, and it continues to grow. We are \nborrowing every day over $4 billion. That is over $2 million every \nminute.\n  We say: Where does the money come from? Well, of the money we spent \nlast year in this country, over 41 cents of every dollar we spent--over \n41 cents of every dollar--is borrowed money, a lot of it from foreign \ncountries, and specifically from China. How do we stay a strong and \nindependent leader of the world if we owe that kind of debt to anyone, \nespecially to another country who may not have our best interests at \nheart?\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff clearly understands this. \nBut it is not just our military leaders who understand this, families \nand business owners all across Wyoming understand it, and the American \npeople understand it. We all know what the American people want. They \nwant cuts to spending now, they want to control spending in the future, \nand they want accountability. They sure don't believe they are getting \nit out of Washington.\n  I received an e-mail this week from a gentleman from my hometown of \nCasper. He looked at this whole thing and he said:\n\n\n[[Page S5123]]\n\n\n       The fact that the debt ceiling needs to be raised is where \n     the problem lies. This is a systemic problem that will either \n     be fixed or it will eventually destroy this Nation. I urge \n     you to stand strong and oppose any spending that exceeds \n     revenue. Using the debt ceiling, we understand, this could be \n     a painful path. It could lead to economic problems. My \n     forefathers put their lives at risk to prevent this kind of \n     idiocy that the Federal Government has become.\n\n  He is talking about a debt of $14 trillion.\n  He said:\n\n       Every one of my family members and neighbors is prepared to \n     weather the storm now to prevent future catastrophe.\n\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle are focused on the debt \nceiling. It seems to me they have lost sight of the real problem, and \nthat problem is the debt. Instead of working toward a higher debt \nceiling, we need to be discussing ways to get our fiscal feet back on \nthe floor, to get our fiscal house in order, and to provide the \naccountability the American people want.\n  I listened to the President's address to the Nation last Monday \nnight. It seemed to be more of a campaign speech than an address about \nthe issues facing this country. There was blaming going on, it seemed \nto me. Scare tactics, class warfare. He used the word ``balanced'' \nabout seven times. He kept talking about a balanced approach.\n  Americans don't want a balanced approach; they want a balanced \nbudget. They want a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. That \nis the way we do it in Wyoming. That is the way many States do it. They \nwant us to live within our means and balance the budget year after year \nafter year.\n  There is a lesson we could learn from so many States around the \ncountry: Live within your means every year.\n  The American people want us to seek a real solution. They want a real \nsolution that provides them with the peace of mind to know they will \nnot be subjected to this sort of activity on a repeated basis. They \nwant the peace of mind as well as the economic security that they \nbelieve as Americans--they believe as Americans--is a basis for this \ngreat country. They are looking for a solution that recognizes the \ncurrent system in Washington is broken, and they are looking for a \nsolution that says we realize we need to take immediate action to fix \nit.\n  Why is it broken? Why do we need immediate action? It is broken \nbecause we have failed to live within our means for so very long. It is \nalso broken because this body, the Senate, has not had a budget for \nover 800 days. For over 800 days there has not been a budget in the \nSenate. One brought forth by the President failed; it got no votes. \nNinety-seven people voted against it. Not one Democrat voted for the \nPresident's budget--not one.\n  It seems to be broken because Washington is more focused on short-\nterm political gain instead of the long-term consequences of our \nactions. We saw that a little earlier with the discussions on the \nSenate floor. I am ready to vote on the proposal on the Senate floor. \nThe minority leader recommended a vote immediately. Yet it was objected \nto by the majority leader.\n  Since the beginning of this entire debate, I have had a very clear \nbottom line. We need to avoid defaulting and implement the spending \ncontrols to get our finances back in order. What is the President's \nbottom line? The President said it:\n\n       The only bottom line I have is that we have to extend this \n     debt ceiling through the next election into 2013.\n\n  The President's only bottom line: Ignore and avoid the biggest threat \nto our national security until after the next election.\n  Contrary to what the President wants, we cannot ignore, we cannot \navoid this issue until after the next election. People all across the \ncountry are worried about their jobs. They are worried about the \neconomy. They are worried about the debt, and they are worried about \nthe spending. The American people want us to take action. They want us \nto cut costs. They want us to control spending. They want us to enforce \naccountability across every branch of the Federal Government. They \nwould like us to put progress ahead of partisanship. They want us to \nput people before politics. The decisions that must be made aren't easy \nfor either party. This isn't about Democrats, Republicans, \nIndependents; it is about America. It is about this country.\n  People all across the country--and I have been in my office since \nearly this morning, and we have been answering the phones. What I am \nhearing is what all of my colleagues should be hearing if they are \nanswering their phones: Enough is enough. That is what the American \npeople are saying.\n  We are now at the eleventh hour, and we must not lose sight of our \ngoal. It is more important to find a real solution than it is to settle \nfor a quick compromise.\n  So I look at some of these letters and calls and e-mails that have \nbeen coming in, and one is from Pinedale, WY. It says:\n\n       It is better to bite a small bullet now than a cannon shell \n     later on.\n\n  That is a Wyoming way of talking. That was from Pinedale, WY.\n  A couple from Casper, a different e-mail:\n\n       This country is in dire financial straits. Since I work for \n     the Federal Government, I have more to lose than most \n     Americans, but I don't want to give this administration a \n     blank check.\n\n  This is someone who works for the Federal Government: I don't want to \ngive the administration a blank check.\n\n       We have to get this country back on track to fiscal \n     responsibility and this is the open debate. I realize my job \n     could be cut just to get there, but the national debt is too \n     large to ignore.\n\n  This is a Wyoming person talking, putting the country in front of \npolitics and putting the country in front of himself.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       We must get it under control or there is more to lose than \n     just our jobs. The economic consequences of not getting this \n     under control will devastate this country years down the \n     road. We have to start now before it is too late.\n\n  Then another from a woman in Casper who said:\n\n       It is time to cut up the Federal Government's credit card. \n     The current debt situation is an insult to all of us who live \n     within our means. People in the country live within their \n     means; States that balance their budget every year live \n     within their means. It is time for Washington to live within \n     its means.\n\n  People are tired of the budget tricks. They are tired of the \naccounting gimmicks. They are tired of the empty promises. That is what \nis affecting the people of this country. They want accountability, and \nit is our responsibility to provide it to them.\n  People are looking for peace of mind, for good judgment, and they \nwant people to listen to them. Yet what I see are people focused on \npolitics on the other side of the aisle at a time when the greatest \nthreat to our Nation--to this great country, to America--is a national \ndebt that is out of control and that is increasing at the rate of over \n$4 billion every year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized to \ncomplete my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Is there a time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes. The Democrats have the next 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask to be informed when I have 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. President, when Harry Truman served in the seat Senator McCaskill \nof Missouri holds today, he used to sit back over there, in back of the \nrow where a lot of the newer Senators sit. He, from that vantage point, \nwould often watch the great debates on the New Deal. He listened long \ninto the night. He used to frequently write home to his wife Bess.\n  One late night after a long debate, he wrote about his experience of \nsitting in the Senate--this was early on--and of the awe he felt \nsitting in this institution and looking across at his colleagues, I \nassume imagining the ghosts of Calhoun and Clay and other great \nSenators.\n\n  He wrote to his wife, and he said: I sit here in the Senate looking \nat this institution and at my colleagues and I pinch myself and I say, \n``How the hell did I get here?''\n  A number of months later, it was very late at night, and he was again \nsitting there, and he wrote to his wife, again watching the debate and \nlooking across at his colleagues, and he wrote to her and said, ``I ask \nmyself, how the hell did they get here?''\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\n  Anyway, I suspect at this moment in America a lot of Americans are \nlooking at the Senate, at the Congress, and they are asking a similar \nquestion, wondering whether we get it.\n  I have enormous respect for this institution. I still believe in the \nphrase ``the world's greatest deliberative body,'' which has, \nunfortunately, become a punch line in these days, but when we are \nbipartisan and serious is still a true description, still possible when \nwe rise to the moment. I have seen the Senate over the course of 26 \nyears in those moments, as have other colleagues here. I have seen it \nwith Ted Kennedy and Bob Dole and so many others. I have seen what can \nbe accomplished here.\n  Regrettably, today, our allies and our enemies abroad and our friends \nhere at home--the American citizen--are watching with either alarm or, \nin the case of our enemies, delight as they question America's \nleadership. Some abroad have even suggested this is a sign, a moment of \nAmerican decline. So even without default, believe me, just the absence \nof decision and the presence of partisan chaos--they are running up a \nhuge cost for this country.\n  The other day, I received a letter from 20 mayors from Massachusetts. \nThe letter states:\n\n       The time to compromise and resolve this issue is now.\n\n  They complained that their communities were under the microscope from \nMoody's because we had not gotten our acts together here in Washington. \nTheir letter was honest and eloquent. And, frankly, it should not be so \ndifficult for their warnings and their example to be heeded in the \nCongress.\n  The mayors' call for compromise, frankly, should not be so difficult. \nThe call for compromise by the American people ought to be listened to \nand acted on and in very short order.\n  I have served in the majority and I have served in the minority since \nI have been here. I have served with Republican Presidents, Democratic \nPresidents, in both situations, when we are in the minority and in the \nmajority. I have cast tough votes in times of divided government, under \nRepublican and Democratic Presidents, from Reagan to Obama, and I have \nnever seen the governing process so broken because one faction of one \nside has made compromise--the essence of democracy and the bedrock of \nour governing system--not just a dirty word but, in their view, a form \nof treason.\n  The warnings of mayors were echoed yesterday by the leaders of our \nfinancial industry. Yesterday, CEOs of major financial institutions \nwrote:\n\n       Our economic recovery remains very fragile. A default on \n     our Nation's obligations, or a downgrade--\n\n  Just a downgrade--\n\n     of America's credit rating, would have an enormous impact on \n     Americans and on investor confidence--raising interest rates \n     for everyone who borrows, undermining the value of the \n     Dollar, and affecting stock and bond markets--and, therefore, \n     dramatically worsening our Nation's already difficult \n     economic circumstances.\n\n  Those are their words. Notwithstanding that, we continue to see our \nown well-being at risk.\n  This is one of those times where it is not cliche and it is not \nhyperbole to say that the whole world is watching, because the whole \nworld has something at stake in what we do or do not do. For the world, \nthere are serious consequences in that. As chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, I have heard from officials all over the \nworld and global business leaders, and the message is always the same. \nThey are watching in amazement, in puzzlement, and horror at what is \ngoing on in Washington. Our friends and allies, whose economic fortunes \nand economies are linked to our own, doubt us, and they are worrying \nabout the impact of our dysfunction on their economies. Our economic \nrivals--believe me, our economic rivals--are laughing all the way to \nthe bank. At a time of global economic uncertainty, we should \nabsolutely not be adding to that uncertainty by failing to resolve our \ndebt crisis. The International Monetary Fund is warning that actions \nstill need to be taken to stave off contagion from Europe's sovereign \ndebt crisis.\n  It is not insignificant that while Harry Reid has been busy trying to \nfind Republicans to join Democrats in a bipartisan solution, Speaker \nBoehner was exclusively negotiating to end the civil war between the \nresponsible and the unreasonable within the Republican Party. The \nSpeaker negotiated with Republicans to make a bad bill worse.\n  I think the distinction between what has happened in the House and \nthe Senate is a very important one in terms of where Americans are \ngoing to find a resolution to this challenge. Here in the Senate, we \nhave been working day and night, talking with Democratic and Republican \ncolleagues across the aisle in order to find a way forward. And for \nmost of us--or at least many of us; certainly, a sufficient number to \nbe able to pass a solution--for them, there are not any preconditions. \nEverything is on the table. But we are still facing the obstinate, \nideological rigidity from House Republicans--House Republicans--who \nhave threatened to take our Nation into default and downgrade the \nNation's credit rating and do even more harm to a fragile economy \nsimply to get their way.\n  So what is it that divides us right now? I think a lot of Americans \nlistening to the debate probably have a serious question about: What is \nthe difference between these folks? What is it that divides them?\n  Well, the Boehner plan, which was sent over here, had three \nfundamental problems in it that Democrats were unwilling to support.\n  First, it would force huge cuts in Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid because of the structure and manner of the cuts they were \ndemanding.\n  Second, it included a constitutional amendment provision which \nrequired that the constitutional amendment actually be passed within 6 \nmonths before the next debt limit could be raised. Because there is no \ncertainty that would happen or could happen, it set up an automatic \ndefault. So the Boehner plan was setting up the U.S. Government to go \nright through this exercise again and have an automatic default.\n  Third, there was a timeframe in the Boehner amendment that required \nus to go back and visit this in February of next year, which would have \nmeant the minute we come back in September, the entire Congress would \nhave been consumed with the very same thing we have been doing now, \nwhich would not give certainty to the marketplace.\n  So it was not politics that prevented us from proceeding forward on \nthe Boehner plan. It was the substance of that plan.\n  The Reid plan, which we are debating right now, which is on the \nfloor, is a plan that because of the Republican insistence on no \nrevenues has no revenues. Many people on our side of the aisle object \nto that. But we have accepted that is the price we need to pay as a \nmatter of our compromise in order to get out of this crisis. So we have \ncompromised on revenues.\n  It has cuts. All the cuts are cuts the Republicans have already voted \nfor that, again, many of our folks do not like. But they have \ncompromised, our folks, and they have provided the cuts that the \nRepublicans asked for. Because it has a timeframe that goes until after \nnext year, that means we will provide certainty to the marketplace and \navoid a downgrade of our credit. The Boehner plan would guarantee a \ndowngrade of our credit. So these are enormous differences.\n  Finally, the Reid plan provides a tight process, a plan that we know \nis familiar around here. Like the way we deal with military bases, we \nrequire votes. The votes have to take place, and we would be required \nwithin a very short number of months to deal with America's long-term \ndebt and budget crisis, and people would have an ability to put their \ncuts on the table.\n  But we would also, we hope, have an opportunity to have revenues. \nThat is the big sticking point here in the Senate. We need to know that \nif there is a trigger that is used in an automatic way in which money \nis going to be held back, that money has to be held back in a fair and \nbalanced way. You do not just cut, you also have to have the \npossibility of revenue. Because if you do not have the possibility of \nrevenue, then the side that only wants to cut can wait for nothing to \nhappen and the cuts take place automatically. There is no threat to \nthem. There is no leverage for them to come to agreement on the other \nthings.\n\n  That is reasonableness, I believe. I think what we are looking for \nhere is\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\nreasonable. It is fair, and it is balanced. The House strategy has been \nessentially not to negotiate, not to negotiate.\n  We also know there are a lot of misstatements out here. Senator Reid \ncorrected one a moment ago about a deal. In addition to that, we keep \nhearing people say that there is no plan, that the President does not \nhave a plan, that nothing has been reduced to writing.\n  Well, as Senator Moynihan used to say here: Anybody is entitled to \ntheir own opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts. The \nfact is, the President put a detailed plan for $4.7 trillion of cuts \nover 10 years with reductions in defense, and Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security, all on the table to find savings in those programs.\n  It is incredible to me to keep hearing people say there is no plan \nwhen there has been plan after plan. Chairman of the Budget Committee \nConrad has been warning us for years about this. He sought to get a \nbipartisan deficit commission created by the Senate. It could not \nhappen because the Republicans blocked it. So what happened? President \nObama appointed one of his own. It reported back. We still have not \ndealt with that.\n  Because the votes aren't there to support a simple increase in the \ndebt limit, we've bent over backwards to find a compromise that links \nthe debt limit to commitments on significant deficit reductions.\n  Back in February, the President offered a budget that included more \nthan $1 trillion in deficit reduction. When Republicans said his budget \ndidn't contain enough cuts, he came out with a new proposal two months \nlater which provided a comprehensive, balanced deficit reduction \nframework to cut spending, bring down our debt and increase confidence \nin our nation's fiscal strength. This framework would have reduced the \ndeficit by $4 trillion in 12 years or less and reductions would have \nbeen phased in over time to protect and strengthen our economic \nrecovery and the recovering labor market. It contained a balanced \napproach to bringing down our deficit, with three dollars of spending \ncuts and interest savings for every one dollar from tax reform that \ncontributes to deficit reduction. It called for $770 billion in non-\nsecurity discretionary spending cuts, $400 billion security spending \ncuts, $489 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings, $360 billion in \nother mandatory savings, and $1 trillion from tax reform. How could I \nrepeat this proposal if it hadn't been written down?\n  After that was rejected, in his negotiations with the Speaker, the \nPresident put an unprecedented $ 4.7 trillion dollars of deficit \nreduction on the table, including painful cuts to programs millions of \nworking Americans depend on, even cuts we Democrats hate as a matter of \nprinciple--and the President offered them along with closing wasteful \ncorporate tax loopholes in order to achieve ``shared sacrifice.'' I \nbelieve it would have had significant support in the Senate--instead, \nHouse Republicans rejected it and walked away from the process.\n  The so-called ``Gang of Six'' in the Senate worked for months to \nstrike a compromise that was balanced as well--it too could have won \nsignificant backing here in the Senate and was applauded by Senators as \nideologically and philosophically different as me and the conservative \nsenator from Oklahoma, Tom Coburn. For House Republicans, this too was \nunacceptable, because they believe there is not a single new revenue or \ntax savings that can be supported in the entire 72,000 page U.S. Tax \nCode.\n  Recognizing both the stakes for our country, the danger to the \neconomy, and House Republican intransigence, Majority Leader Harry Reid \nhas now offered approximately $2.2 trillion in deficit reduction \nwithout additional revenue, composed of cuts Republicans had previously \nsupported. That too was rejected. The leader's proposal would give our \neconomy the certainty it needs to create jobs today, not 6 months from \nnow and it provides a certain process for Congress to do its work for \nthe next 4 months.\n  Time and time again, I hear those absolutists criticizing the \nPresident and majority leader's handling of the situation. They ask \nwhat our plan is? Well, take your pick--we have offered compromise \nafter compromise and every time they have said no.\n  No, the House Republicans would rather spend their time negotiating \nwith themselves and criticizing other proposals than negotiating with \nDemocrats or trying to show that they are willing to compromise.\n  Here in the Senate, Senator McConnell offered a reasonable compromise \nthat would get us past this hurdle. He proposed a path forward in good \nfaith as way to provide stability for our economy and not have this \nsaga continue. What did House Republicans do? They walked away from \neven a Republican proposal to ensure our nation didn't default and our \neconomy wasn't hurt.\n  So what do House Republicans want? They want legislation called the \nCut, Cap and Balance Act. It is so extreme that even Paul Ryan's \ndraconian budget wouldn't fit into its limits.\n  A week ago today, the Senate defeated the bad version--cut, cap and \nbalance. This vote made it extremely clear that cut, cap and balance \ndid not have a path forward, but repeatedly House Republicans push for \nit even though it has already failed in the Senate and the President \nthreatened to veto it.\n  So when the talk of the ``grand bargain'' failed, what did the House \nRepublicans do? They further entrench themselves in an extremist \nposition and turn to a new way of passing cut, cap and balance. Have \nthey tried to find a way forward to reaching a real compromise? No, \nthey continue to negotiate among themselves.\n  And their current refusal to negotiate across party lines flies in \nthe face of the very Republican principles they have espoused.\n  Why do we oppose the Boehner plan? Because the experts have said that \nBoehner's plan could trigger many of the consequences as default \nitself--including a surge in interest rates that will hurt every \nAmerican with a mortgage, a student loan, a car loan, or a credit \ncard--because it would make passage of a balanced budget amendment a \ncondition for increasing the debt ceiling in 6 months. In other words--\nautomatic default if they don't get their way. Since there is not two-\nthirds support in the House and Senate for this amendment, it \nguarantees default.\n  Bruce Bartlett, a former economic adviser to President Reagan said:\n\n       This is quite possibly the stupidest Constitutional \n     amendment that I think I have ever seen. It looks like it was \n     drafted by a couple of interns on the back of a napkin.\n\n  Mr. President, that is President Reagan's adviser.\n  Just the other day, my friend and colleague Senator McCain stated \nthat thinking a balanced budget amendment can pass--``is worse than \nfoolish.'' He went to say:\n\n       That is not fair to the American people to hold out and say \n     we will not agree to raising the debt limit until we pass a \n     balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It is unfair. \n     It is bizarrro.\n\n  We can't do this. We can't keep going down this road. This stalemate \ncannot stand. It is time to for us reach across the aisle. Senator \nReid's plan tries to do that. It doesn't touch the Republican holy \ngrail of revenues. Not a dime. And 100 percent of the spending cuts in \nSenator Reid's deficit reduction plan were supported by Republicans. \nThey were included in proposals from Speaker Boehner's plan, House \nMajority Leader Cantor, and House Budget Committee Chairman Ryan. Just \nlast night, Senator Reid amended his plan to include Senator \nMcConnell's provision to give the President the authority to increase \nthe debt limit in steps. This gives Members of Congress the chance to \nregister disapproval for increases in the debt limit. This is yet \nanother compromise by the Democrats.\n  So I think there has been a great effort by Democrats to make changes \nto deal with the Republican objections. I would ask, what is the single \nRepublican concession? What is it they have given as a matter of \ncompromise? Nobody can tell you that because there has not been one. In \nfairness, in the Gang of 6, a great group of Republicans joined with \nDemocrats, and they did make a concession, and they took political \nrisks. They went out and said: Yes, there have to be cuts, but there \nalso have to be revenues. I applaud those Republicans who joined in \nthat effort. That is what we need to find here now. That is the way we \nare going to make the difference here.\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\n  It is the place to start a compromise but it takes two sides to \ncompromise. And it takes both Houses of Congress to pass a bill. It \nshouldn't be this difficult for Congress to do its most fundamental job \nunder the Constitution and preserve the credit rating and reputation of \nthe most powerful nation on Earth.\n  And it doesn't take an amendment to the Constitution for us to \nbalance the budget either. It takes the courage of our convictions. We \nhave been here before. In the 1990s, our economy was faltering because \ndeficits and debt were freezing capital. We had to send a signal to the \nmarket that we were capable of being fiscally responsible. We did just \nthat and as result we saw the longest economic expansion in history, \ncreated over 22 million jobs, and generated unprecedented wealth in \nAmerica, with every income bracket rising. But we did it by making \ntough choices. We cast tough votes and some Senators even lost their \nseats but they committed the country to a path of discipline that \nhelped unleash the productive potential of the American people. Working \nwith Republicans, we came up with a budget framework that put our \nNation on track to be debt free by 2012 for the first time since Andrew \nJackson's administration. It didn't take a constitutional amendment--it \ntook courage.\n  Mr. President, we can do that again--if we get real. If we get \nserious. There is a bipartisan consensus just waiting to lift our \ncountry and our future if Senators are willing to sit down and forge it \nand make it real. If we are willing to stop talking past each other, to \nstop substituting sound bites for substance. If we are willing finally \nto pull ourselves out of ideological cement that has been mixed over in \nthe House.\n  I believe we can compromise. I think the only place to resolve this \ncrisis is in compromise.\n  I believe I have additional time, but I wanted to know where I am \nwith time. I will wrap up very shortly.\n  As we know, it takes both Houses to pass a bill. It should not be \nthis difficult for Congress to do its most fundamental job under the \nConstitution. It does not take an amendment to the Constitution to \nbalance the budget. How could I say that? Because in the 1990s, we \nbalanced the budget. We created 23 million new jobs. We raised the \nincome of everybody in America. And the fact is we did what was \nnecessary to put us on a track to pay down the debt of our country by \n2012. We sent a signal to the marketplace.\n  We can do this again if we get real, if we get serious. I believe \nthere is a bipartisan consensus here in the Senate waiting to lift our \ncountry and our future, if Senators are willing to sit down and forge \nit and make it real, if we stop talking past each other. The world's \nmost deliberative body could become that again. But the reason it is \nnot viewed as that today is not that the institution itself has failed; \nit is not that it cannot be deliberative. It is because the people in \nit have not yet decided to live in the tradition of those predecessors \nwho earned the reputation for this institution. It is because, unlike \nthe years when I first came here in the 1980s, some have decided to use \nthis institution for a 24/7 365-days-a-year campaign, to make \neverything that happens here the prisoner of ideology and politics \nrather than the instrument of debate and decision.\n  I think it would do us good to remember that until recent history, \nthis institution has been the birthplace of compromise and delivered \nsome of the great legislative achievements that have reshaped our \nNation out of compromise, bipartisan compromises here in the Senate--\nthe passage of the Social Security Act of 1935, the Civil Rights Act of \n1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1969, the creation of Medicare in 1965, \nSocial Security reforms of 1983.\n  We all know that during the Constitutional Convention, Roger Sherman \nand Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut developed a bicameral legislative \nstructure that broke a deadlock, and it created--it is in the \nConstitution. It is why we have a Senate and a House today: compromise.\n  Everyone who remembers the history books remembers the Compromise of \n1850 drafted by Henry Clay that diffused a 4-year confrontation between \nthe slave States of the South and the free States of the North. Even in \nour most difficult moments, we have been able to find a way to \ncompromise.\n  In the end, it is people who define this place. It is we Senators. \nAnd in my conversations with colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nI am convinced there are plenty of people here who are prepared to \nreach across the aisle and prove that the United States and the U.S. \nSenate can live up to this moment. I believe that in the next 48 hours \nthe Senate will prove our ability to live up to our constitutional and \nour personal responsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan.) The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I will take 11 minutes. I ask unanimous \nconsent that when the time comes back on the Democratic side, I be \ngranted an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I would like to remind the American \npeople why we are in the midst of the present crisis, days away from \nwhen the United States of America, the wealthiest Nation in the world, \nwill not be able to pay its bills. Let me be clear. The Senator from \nOklahoma earlier had a chart up saying we are broke, broke, broke. We \nare the wealthiest Nation in the history of the world. We have the \nhighest per capita income of any major nation in the world. If we are \nso rich, why are we so broke?\n  The issue here, despite what some may suggest, is not about new \nborrowing or new spending; it is about paying the bills for what we \nhave already incurred. Yet the Republicans, after running up a huge \ncredit card bill under George Bush, do not want to pay the bills. As \nevery American knows, if you use your credit card, you run up debt, and \nyou have to pay the bills. And throughout American history, whether a \nDemocratic or Republican Congress or a Democratic or Republican \nPresident, that is what we as a nation have done.\n  On this point, it could not be more clear than this letter to Senator \nHoward Baker from President Ronald Reagan:\n\n       The full consequences of a default or even the serious \n     prospect of default by the United States are impossible and \n     awesome to contemplate. Denigration of the full faith and \n     credit of the United States would have substantial effects on \n     the domestic financial markets and on the value of the dollar \n     in exchange markets. The Nation can ill afford to allow such \n     a result.\n\n  President Ronald Reagan, 1983. It can't get much clearer than that. \nHowever, today Ronald Reagan would find himself losing in a Republican \nParty primary because he would not be pure enough for the tea party.\n  Because Republicans in the House are unwilling to do what even Ronald \nReagan said needs to be done, we find ourselves in the midst of a \nmanufactured crisis--a manufactured crisis--one without precedent: one \nHouse of Congress willing to jeopardize the economy of the United \nStates unless the country capitulates and accepts policies that \notherwise do not enjoy majority support, policies that could not pass \nthe Congress, policies that would be vetoed by the President. This is \nsimply unprecedented.\n  I believe this unprecedented action requires an unprecedented \nresponse. As at other critical junctures in our history, the President \nmust act boldly to protect our Constitution and, more important, our \ncountry. The Constitution never envisioned that one House of Congress \nwould willingly destroy the economy of the United States in order to \nobtain policy objectives it could not achieve through the normal \nlegislative process. Yet that is the situation in which our Nation \nfinds itself.\n  The legislative process is hard. It is frustrating. Trust me, there \nare many ideas and proposals I have fought my entire career on to \nbecome law, and they are never the way I envisioned starting out \nbecause you make compromises along the way. Yet rather than engaging in \nthe hard work of persuading the American people, persuading a majority \nof the House, persuading a majority of the Senate, persuading the \nPresident--a task which often takes years and multiple elections--the \nHouse Republicans want to short-circuit the legislative process by \nholding the economy hostage.\n\n[[Page S5127]]\n\n  For example, if the Republicans in the House put forward a bill to \neliminate Medicare, it would not get anywhere. Yet, with their cut, \ncap, and balance budget amendment, it would shrink the government to \nthe size it was prior to Medicare even taking hold, and that would mean \nwe would have to do away with Medicare. However, that could never pass \nhere on its own.\n  Likewise, I read that Speaker Boehner recently suggested to the \nPresident that the House would vote to allow the United States to pay \nits bills if the President would agree to repeal health care reform--in \nother words, take health insurance away from 30 million Americans and \nallow health insurance companies to deny coverage based on preexisting \nconditions.\n  The House could never achieve these policy objectives through the \nnormal process, so they hold the economy hostage. Think about that. \nThis is not just the attitude of the Republican Party with respect to \nthe debt limit. The Republican Party has adopted an entirely new \napproach to democracy that is wholly undemocratic. If they cannot win \nelections or win the court of public opinion, they insist on holding \nthe country hostage.\n  The minority leader has been frank about this approach to governing. \nIn a recent speech about a balanced budget amendment, the minority \nleader of the Senate, the Republican leader, said the following:\n\n       The time has come for a balanced budget amendment that \n     forces Washington to balance its books. . . . The \n     Constitution must be amended to keep the government in check. \n     We've tried persuasion. We've tried negotiations. We've tried \n     elections. Nothing has worked.\n\n  Say again? Say again? We have tried elections, and nothing has \nworked? What is he implying?\n  Furthermore, I would say to the Republican leader, we had surpluses \nin 1998 and 1999 and 2000 and 2001. We had 4 years of surpluses. Yet, \nsomehow, ``We've tried elections. Nothing has worked.'' Is he implying \nthat somehow we need to have another course of action outside of \nelections, outside of persuasion, outside of negotiation?\n  President Bush's former speech writer, David Frum, recently commented \non increasingly absurd and unrealistic demands put forth by House \nRepublicans before they will agree not to destroy the American economy. \nHe noted:\n\n       Why doesn't the new Boehner bill just require Obama to \n     resign in favor of a Republican before the second debt \n     ceiling increase? Tidier.\n\n  Sadly, that is not too far from the truth. In the face of this \nradical--radical and cynical--approach to governing, we are faced with \na manufactured crisis. Indeed, the ramifications for our economy, for \nour middle class, indeed for America's ability to trust and believe in \ntheir government--the stakes could not be higher.\n  In response, in the absence of a balanced approach that could be \nagreed upon broadly in the Senate and the House, I believe the \nPresident must act boldly. He must carry out his constitutional duty to \nhonor the commitments the U.S. Government has made. I believe the \nPresident, under the 14th amendment of the Constitution, must honor the \nobligations of the U.S. Government.\n\n  As the Supreme Court noted in Perry v. United States, Chief Justice \nHughes' opinion:\n\n       The fourteenth amendment, in its fourth section, explicitly \n     declares: The validity of the public debt of the United \n     States, authorized by law, . . . shall not be questioned. \n     While this provision was undoubtedly inspired by the desire \n     to put beyond question the obligations of the government \n     issued during the Civil War, this language indicates a \n     broader connotation.\n\n  Chief Justice Hughes goes on to say:\n\n       The Constitution gives to the Congress the power to borrow \n     money on the credit of the United States, an unqualified \n     power, a power vital to the government, upon which in an \n     extremity its very life may depend. The binding quality of \n     the promise of the United States is of the essence of the \n     credit which is so pledged. Having this power to authorize \n     the issue of definite obligations for the payment of money \n     borrowed--\n\n  Listen to this--\n\n     the Congress has not been vested with authority to alter or \n     destroy those obligations.\n\n  One more time. Congress has unlimited power to borrow, but ``the \nCongress has not been vested with authority to alter or destroy those \nobligations.'' I do not think it could be more clear. It could not be \nmore clear. Congress has not been vested with the authority to alter or \ndestroy the Nation's credit obligations. Of course, that means the \nCongress cannot through its actions repudiate the Nation's debt, but it \nalso means, through its inaction--failing to raise the debt ceiling--it \ncannot repudiate our country's obligations. Thus, rather than somehow \nprohibiting the President from taking action to protect the full faith \nand credit of the United States, as some have suggested, I believe the \nclear reading of the 14th amendment, as supported by Perry v. United \nStates, I believe the President is obligated--obligated--to ensure \nthat, in the words of the 14th amendment, the public debt not be \nquestioned.\n  I know legal scholars have spent some time in recent weeks debating \nthe meaning of the 14th amendment with respect to the debt ceiling. But \nwhere there is debate on the meaning of the Constitution, where there \nis no precedent, where the courts have not weighed in, where under our \nsystem of government we cannot just walk across the street to the \nSupreme Court and ask them for an advisory opinion, I want to remind \nthe President that the Constitution does not belong to law professors, \nit does not belong to political pundits, it does not belong to \ncolumnists; rather, it belongs to the American people. And you, Mr. \nPresident--you, Mr. President--have been entrusted by the American \npeople, in a very clear election, as it says right here in the \nConstitution, ``to faithfully execute the office of the President of \nthe United States and to the best of your ability, preserve, protect \nand defend the Constitution of the United States.''\n  So the 14th amendment makes clear the full faith and credit of the \nUnited States cannot be destroyed. The only case on point ever decided \nby the Supreme Court said the Congress cannot alter or destroy those \nobligations--cannot. So if the Congress, through inaction--through \ninaction or action tries to destroy or alter those obligations, I \nbelieve it is incumbent upon the Chief Executive to exercise his \nauthority--to exercise his authority--to make sure the full faith and \ncredit of the United States is not jeopardized--is not jeopardized.\n  The President should use his authority to do so.\n  I will give you three examples where there is no precedent, where \nthere is no clear authority in the Constitution, but where the \nPresident exercised that kind of authority.\n  Thomas Jefferson purchasing the Louisiana Purchase.\n  In Thomas Jefferson's letter to Senator Breckenridge, he agonized \nover whether he, as President, had the authority under the Constitution \nto consummate the treaty for the purchase of the Louisiana Territory. \nBut in the end--he even said in his letter that perhaps we need a \nconstitutional amendment to go to the Congress and the States and be \nratified before I can do this. But in the end, he realized that would \ntake a long time, it might fall through, and all kinds of bad things \nwould happen. So even one of the Framers of our Constitution, Thomas \nJefferson, took action even though there was no clear authority in the \nConstitution for him to do so. In fact, Members of the House went after \nhim for it. But he decided it was better, as he said, to ensure the \nfuture benefits of the United States rather than some minor violation \nof the Constitution.\n  A second example: President Lincoln signed the Emancipation \nProclamation. There was no authority whatsoever for him to do that, but \nhe did it, even though some people, at that time, went after him \nbecause he didn't have the clear authority in the Constitution to do \nso.\n  A third example: Franklin Roosevelt and the lend-lease program in \nGreat Britain to make sure they could fight off the Nazi invasion of \nGreat Britain, a clear success. Franklin Roosevelt wrote that he didn't \nthink that was probably constitutional, but he instructed his Attorney \nGeneral--he gave his own Attorney General a legal opinion, from the \nPresident, saying that the country needed to have this done. He went \nahead and did it. Again, some people took after him on it, but we all \nrealized it was the right thing to do for the survival of our own \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S5128]]\n\n  Those were just three instances--three big ones--where, again, there \nwas no clear authority by the Constitution but no prohibition in the \nConstitution for the President to do so, and where the vital security \nof the United States was at stake.\n  I will close on this: I believe this is just like those times. The \nsecurity and the future improvement of the United States and future \ngenerations depends upon the President taking this action boldly and \nforthrightly to preserve the integrity and to make sure the obligations \nand the full faith and credit of the United States is not questioned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I wonder if I may ask how much time is \nallocated. We are a little out of kilter with the allocation of time. \nHow much time do I have to speak? I want to make sure my colleagues \nhave sufficient time to speak also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Republicans \ncontrol the next 24 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. I will not begin to use that amount of time. I think I can \nuse 10 minutes or less, and I will leave some time for my colleagues.\n  I can't count how many times I have been here speaking about the same \nsubject, but this subject occupies all of us and it has done so for \nthis entire session of the Congress.\n  Three days are left until we reach that date on which the White House \nand the Treasury has said we will default. Right now, we are debating \non a Saturday night over a bill that has already been defeated in the \nHouse of Representatives by a substantial vote, including with \nDemocratic support. We are debating a bill tonight that we know will \nnot pass here. The irony of being charged with filibustering the \nmajority leader's bill, the Reid bill, is somewhat bizarre given the \nfact that Republicans are willing to give Senator Reid and the \nDemocrats a vote on this bill as soon as they want it. It has been \ngoing on now for many hours. I think everything that can be said for or \nagainst this bill has probably been said. Nevertheless, the majority \nleader himself objected to our offer to stop talking on both sides and \nget to the vote. That is where we are.\n  I have been talking for some time now about the fact that the current \nfiscal crisis the United States faces demands Congress to recognize \nseriously the enormity of the problem and come forward with a bold \nplan. We need a bold plan to begin to address, over a period of time, \nwhat is necessary to assure the financial markets and the American \npeople that we understand the plight we are in; that we have taken not \nonly rational steps but significant steps to address the problem we are \nin; and that we are willing to put comprehensive plans in place to get \nus on the path to fiscal health.\n  Yet here we are, and after months of debate, we are now debating over \njust a small step forward, which, in my opinion, will not begin to \nsatisfy the serious problems we have. A small step will not begin to \nsatisfy all of those who are concerned about whether we truly grasp \nwhat is necessary to be done; whether we truly understand that we need \nto send a signal to the financial world, to the world itself, and to \nthe American people, that we have taken the necessary steps to put our \ncountry on the right fiscal path.\n  Now, it is clear, and it has been said so many times, that our \nspending addiction has become much worse in the last 2\\1/2\\ years. We \nhave seen a 24-percent increase in non-defense discretionary spending \nunder the Obama administration. We have seen a staggering increase in \nthe debt from $10.6 trillion on Inauguration Day to $14.3 trillion \ntoday--a $3.7 trillion increase in just a 2\\1/2\\-year period of time. \nClearly, these attempts by the President to address our economy have \nnot succeeded. The President's stimulus plan cost an additional $862 \nbillion, and we haven't seen an economic stimulus. The latest reports \nare staggering to all of us as we find out that our growth in the first \nquarter of this year was far under what had been projected and had been \ncalculated initially, and unemployment is not going down. People are \nout of work.\n  Clearly, we need to make significant strides forward. I will not go \ninto all of the details of the flaws of the Reid plan. It has been \ntalked about, and it was soundly rejected by the House. We know it will \nnot achieve the necessary number of votes to go forward, but we are \ndebating it.\n  I want to talk about the larger question, which is, are we going to \ntake significant steps to put us on the right track, or are we going to \ncompromise to the point where the rating agencies, the financial world, \nand even the American people look at it and say: Is that it? Is that \nall you can do?\n  What is interesting is that my colleagues on the other side have \ntalked about a compromise. They say we should move to the middle. But \nit is like taking a scale of 10 and reducing it down to 4, and instead \nof a compromise being 5, they have lowered the top line to 4 and said \nwe need to get down to 2 or 1\\1/2\\. And if we are not willing to go \nthat far, then they say we are not willing to compromise. That is \ndistorted logic.\n  More important, it is logic, or illogic, that is driving us to an \nincomplete solution to a very real problem. It doesn't take much to \nunderstand how this is being viewed. Just in the last couple of days, \nthe New York Times ran a headline basically saying ``Recovery Still \nSlow and New Data Show Little Growth Ahead.''\n  The Washington Post has a headline, ``A Stranglehold on our Domestic \nPolicy,'' by Michael Gerson, who used to be one of my staff members.\n  There is another one by Robert Samuelson, ``Why Are We in the Debt \nFix? We Have to Address Healthcare Spending.'' The Wall Street Journal \nreports, ``U.S. GDP Grows just 1.3 percent.'' On and on it goes.\n  My own view of this--which is not because I am a brilliant economist, \nI am not; and not because I am a financial analyst, I am not--but I \nhave talked to dozens of people who don't have political skin in the \ngame but simply have analyzed this in an objective way and indicated \nthat, unless we come forward with something close to--actually \nsomething above a $4 trillion limit in spending reductions over a \ndecade, combined with a path to entitlement programs restructuring and \ncurbing excessive mandatory spending, combined with an overhaul of our \ncomplicated Tax Code to make American businesses more competitive and \nspur economic growth, we will not be addressing the problem.\n  So the problem is that too many people are thinking that if we just \nend up with this compromise, if one side or the other will move just a \nlittle, we will be able to increase or avoid default on the debt limit, \nand we will have addressed the problem.\n  For those who say this is just step 1, and we can address it in step \n2--the balance we weren't able to do here--I don't think the American \npeople have much confidence in that. I don't think the American people \nhave much confidence when we say we will have a group of Senators and \nCongressmen, on a divided basis of Republicans and Democrats, sit down \nand then report something to us and that will solve the problem.\n  The difficulty there is that those are the same people here who have \nnot been able to solve it in 7 months of debate--sometimes with \nDemocrats and Republicans engaging in those debates. I don't think it \nis going to be solved because we may arrive very much at the same \nstalemate that has arisen after these 7 months of debate, partly \nbecause there are two visions in place here. I think what this debate \nis all about is this: what is the proper role of the Federal \nGovernment, and what can the Federal Government afford to do and not \nafford to do?\n  On the one hand, we have people who say government has grown too big. \nRepublicans are saying we cannot afford big government anymore, and it \nis hurting the economy. That is a vision for the future that is very \ndifferent from our colleagues across the aisle, who basically see \ngovernment as much more engaged in the process and don't want to cut \nback on a number of programs and a number of initiatives and policies \nthat have been put into place over the years.\n  It is not quite that clearly divided by this aisle. There are people \non both sides who have shades of one way or shades of the other way. \nBut the reality is, if we look around the world and look at models as \nto what makes economies flourish and what makes governments financially \nstable, we see\n\n[[Page S5129]]\n\nthat an overgrowth of promises--overpromising Parliaments and \nCongresses--finally bridges us to the point where we no longer can \nafford what we have promised people. That is where we are now.\n  Without putting those practices into place, I fear that whatever we \ndo will not be sufficient. We will get the downgrade anyway, and we may \nget a precipitous action that puts us in a far more difficult situation \nthan it would have been had we come forward with something significant \nnow, at a level in which those who are analyzing this say we have it, \nthe U.S. government is serious about it, they have locked it in and \nmade sure it can't be overturned, and injected certainty into the \nfuture. Even though some of that certainty is painful, it will be \nrewarded, I believe, with support because it is sufficient to take the \nnecessary first steps.\n  Knowing we are 3 days away from default, I propose that if we can't \ncome to agreement on something sufficient, we should provide an \nextension, short-term, whether it is 4 weeks, 6 weeks, or 8 weeks, \nguarantee that we will not default with the amount of money on the \nincrease in the debt ceiling, in return for an equivalent amount of \nspending cuts. This would give us some time to come together and do \nwhat I have outlined--or something close to it--so that in the end we \ndo not have an immediate default, and we do have a commitment to go \nforward and put something of substance in place and give it one last \nshot.\n  Maybe I am a starry-eyed optimist. Maybe I am just hoping that \nwhatever we do can be built upon and brought to the point where it will \nbecome effective, rather than fearing that what we do will be relegated \nas a step far too short to address the problem of our time.\n  Madam President, I wish we had done more. I think we still can do \nmore. But decisions have to be made in a very quick matter of time, \nwhatever we do. Even if we end up passing something that is \ninsufficient, I hope we will start work the very next day on addressing \nthe real problems that we face and putting something into place that \nwill restore confidence and ensure that America is not going to become \na second-rate nation; that we are not going to see a devaluation of our \ndollar and a loss of confidence in the American people, investors, and \nthe world. I hope we put something in place that ensures America will \nstill be the place to do business, to live, to prosper, and to have a \nsafe haven for funds.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague from Indiana whom I heard a moment ago. I think he is \nabsolutely right. We have deeper and more important problems we need to \naddress, along with the important decisions we make over the next 24 \nhours on the debt limit. It is necessary to extend the debt limit, but \nit is not sufficient. We also have to deal with these underlying fiscal \nproblems, and I think my colleague from Indiana stated that well.\n  I rise to talk about the debt limit proposal and how we can provide a \npathway forward on a bipartisan basis--again, not just to solve this \nimmediate problem that confronts us but also to deal with these deeper \nand very serious problems we have with our fiscal deficits and a weak \neconomy. It may be good to start by asking why we are here. We are here \nbecause we have a law that says the U.S. Government can borrow only so \nmuch. The law says the U.S. Government can borrow only up to $14.3 \ntrillion.\n  That is a lot of money--$14.3 trillion. It is approximately 95 \npercent of our economy. This is unprecedented, of course. We have never \nhad debts at this level before. Many economists look at this and \nbelieve it is already having a very negative impact on our economy to \nhave this huge debt out there because it affects the private sector. \nBut we have come to this $14.3 trillion limit, and now, in order for \ngovernment to continue to provide everyday government services, \nbenefits to our troops, veterans, Social Security, and so on, the limit \nneeds to be raised.\n  The Federal Government now borrows more than 40 cents of every $1 \nthat is spent. It seems to me only common sense that when we have maxed \nour credit card, which is what the Federal Government has done, and \nwhen we have this deep underlying problem of these huge deficits--$1.4 \ntrillion this year, a record level also--and mounting debt, we should \ndeal with the underlying problem before we extend the credit card \nlimit. So that is why we are here.\n  I think it is an appropriate debate. I wish it could have been \nresolved sooner. I think it can be resolved over the next day or so, \nbut I think it is an important discussion we have to have. The \nPresident has made it clear he would like the debt limit increased, and \nhe would like it increased high enough to last through the 2012 \nelection. Interesting, because election day is not part of the economic \ncalendar. It is not the end of a fiscal year. It is not the end of a \ncalendar year. It is the political calendar. It is unfortunate during \nthis time of such budgetary uncertainty, we seem focused on political \ndeadlines.\n  Meeting this request the President has made--that it be extended \nuntil beyond the election--would be the largest debt increase that has \never been approved by the Congress. It would be over $2 trillion. So, \nagain, I think it is appropriate we have this discussion before we \nagree to the largest debt limit increase in the history of our country. \nWe have never raised the debt limit that much at one time before.\n  The President also says we need to do this because the markets want \nthe certainty that a long-term debt limit increase will provide. I \nthink there is something to that, in the sense of market certainty. If \nthere could be a longer debt limit increase, I suppose it would add to \nmarket certainty. But markets don't just want a solution to this debt \nlimit issue. In fact, I would argue what they want even more is a \nsolution to the soaring debt itself, and this is not based on \nconjecture, it is based on looking at what those who are analyzing our \neconomy say.\n  We have all heard about Fitch, Moody's, and Standard & Poor's. These \nare the credit agencies a lot of people have been talking about. They \nare the ones threatening to downgrade our debt. They say we should \nextend the debt limit, but they also say that is just the first step; \nthat we also have to deal with the underlying fiscal problems in our \ncountry or the downgrade will occur. They want a serious commitment to \nreining in the spending spree that has buried us in debt in the first \nplace. So this has to be dealt with.\n  A friend of mine, Keith Hennessey, sent me an e-mail tonight, and he \nhad an interesting way to put it, for people who follow the financial \nmarkets. He said: We face both a liquidity crisis right now--which is \nthat the Federal Government can't borrow to meet its needs--but we also \nface a solvency crisis--which is that the accumulation of the Federal \nGovernment deficits into the debt are at historic levels, and already \nharming the economy in very significant ways. So we need to deal with \nboth.\n  One way to show this commitment to the solvency problem--to the debt \nproblem--is to be sure we guarantee $1 in spending cuts for every $1 we \nraise the debt limit. There is a formula that was laid out several \nmonths ago by Speaker Boehner, and I think it has been widely agreed \nto. We will see it in what Majority Leader Reid has proposed. As we \nwill talk about in a minute, unfortunately, some of the budget savings \nhe thought were there, based upon the Congressional Budget Office \nanalysis, are not real cuts, but that was the formula he used. The \nPresident has also talked about this formula, and I think it is widely \nagreed we need to be sure we are only extending the debt limit to the \nextent that we are reducing spending. So if it is going to be over $2 \ntrillion of debt limit extension, we need to find $2 trillion in \nspending reductions over time.\n  It is interesting. As I have analyzed how this formula would work \nover time, it actually makes sense for our economy. If we raise the \ndebt limit $1 but also cut $1 in spending, it not only helps us in the \nshort term but over a 10-year period, what the CBO tells us in terms of \nwhat the debt is likely to be, just about at the 10th year we would \nactually balance the Federal budget. We will not get rid of the debt--\nthe debt will continue to grow all during that time period, \nunfortunately--but there would actually be, at the end of that process, \nan annual balanced budget by repeatedly applying that formula\n\n[[Page S5130]]\n\nevery time we need to raise the debt limit.\n  I don't think that necessarily was the intent when the formula was \nderived, but it is interesting that it is a formula that makes sense to \nget us to, at least over 10 years, the point where we are not spending \nmore than we are taking in. Given that the President and the majority \nleader would like to see a debt increase of over $2 trillion, and \nRepublicans--and even many Democrats--want to be sure there is an equal \nsize spending cut, it seems to me there is an obvious way forward.\n  We can raise the debt limit for this extended period of time, but we \nhave to require equal spending cuts, and they have to be real. If they \nare not meaningful and credible spending cuts, then we will have the \nsame negative economic consequences we have been talking about tonight: \nThe credit agencies will downgrade our debt and we will have higher \ninterest rates, which will affect every American family--student loans, \ncredit card loans, certainly our mortgages. It will affect small \nbusinesses trying to get credit and that are trying to hire people. If \nyou have a car loan, it will affect you. It affects the entire economy. \nSo we have to deal with this issue in a real way, in a way that is \ncredible and meaningful.\n  Unfortunately, the proposal that Majority Leader Reid put forward, \nwhich was intended to meet this formula we have talked about--$1 \nspending cuts for every $1 in increases--has some spending cuts that do \nnot meet that standard of being credible and meaningful. The biggest \none is about $1 trillion in what is called the global war on terrorism \nspending reduction.\n  A little background on this. When we are writing the budget baseline, \nthe Congressional Budget Office says we have to assume all the \ndiscretionary spending that is happening now will continue into the \nfuture. So they assume, for the next 10 years, we will spend about $150 \nbillion a year on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But nobody believes \nor hopes that will happen. It has not been requested by the President. \nNo one intends to spend that money. In fact, the President's own budget \nassumes that instead of the $1.7 trillion that would be spent over the \nnext decade, we will spend about $600 billion. That is what the \nPresident's budget says. That is what people assume. This means Senator \nReid's proposal to take credit for cutting an additional $1.1 trillion \nthat is not going to be spent anyway is not going to be viewed as a \ncredible proposal. Why? Because it is money that is not planning to be \nspent.\n  It is a little akin to a family saying: Let's assume we are going to \ntake a vacation we are never going to take, and it is going to cost us \n$10,000 and then saying: We saved $10,000 on our budget.\n  I wish it weren't so. I wish the $1.1 trillion was a credible \nspending reduction we could rely on. But the Washington Post, the Wall \nStreet Journal, and many other observers have looked at this and said: \nFrankly, it is not a meaningful reduction in spending. So there are \nsome meaningful reductions in spending in the proposal of the majority \nleader, but this particular one, unfortunately, is a big part of what \nhe has proposed. Out of his $2.7 trillion in cuts, about $1.1 trillion \nis this proposal on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. We might hear it \nreferred to on the floor as the OCO spending--overseas contingency \noperations.\n  I think one thing we should do as a Congress is make sure these cuts \nare meaningful and credible, and we can do that.\n  Second, let's expand this initial round of spending cuts. Right now, \nif we take out the war spending we just talked about and then look at \nthe Congressional Budget Office's score of the majority leader's \nproposal, the cuts are just under $1 trillion. It is still a \nsubstantial, and I think a credible, proposal of just under $1 \ntrillion, but that is all that is guaranteed. However, Washington is \nscheduled to spend about $46 trillion over that same period--the next \ndecade. Think about that: $46 trillion and increase spending, by the \nway, by about 57 percent during that time period.\n  I think we can do a lot better than just cutting $1 trillion over the \nnext 10 years, and I think we can do it in a bipartisan fashion. I say \nthat because I have identified $2.8 trillion in spending reductions \nthat have been agreed to by some bipartisan process.\n  The Biden talks, the Gang of 6, the President's fiscal commission, \nand some of the President's own discussions specifically came up with \nsome spending reductions in addition to this $1 trillion. So my hope \nis, we can take some of these spending cuts that have been agreed to \nthrough some bipartisan process and apply them to this initial package.\n  Finally, Majority Leader Reid and Speaker Boehner's proposals both \nhave this deficit reduction committee. It is an approach which makes \nsense, to be sure we get at the longer range problem, which is our \nunsustainable--very important but unsustainable--entitlement programs; \ntax reform, which will help stimulate more economic growth; and budget \nreform, which is clearly needed.\n  I have been here 6 months. We have done nothing on a budget. In fact, \nthe Senate hasn't done a budget in 2 years. It sounds like we are in \nneed of some reforms to make this place work. So this committee makes \nsense.\n  The majority leader calls for the committee to reduce the budget \ndeficit to 3 percent of GDP. I think that is an interesting proposal. I \nthink we need to be sure we know how long it would take to reach that \nlevel and how long we should maintain it, because there is no timeframe \nin his proposal.\n  So 3 percent of GDP, does that mean we would wait until a certain \ntime period and, say, if it is a 10-year proposal, the ninth year or \ntenth year and suddenly make those reductions? If so, the reductions \nwould not be nearly as significant.\n  Instead, we should put a timeframe in place, 5 years or 10 years--I \nwould prefer 5--and say that there will be reductions starting in the \nfirst fiscal year to meet the 3-percent target. If you don't do that, \nthen over that period of time, 5 years or 10 years, we will not see the \nkinds of reductions in spending that I think Majority Leader Reid \nwishes to see and I know that many of us here on this side of the aisle \nbelieve are necessary.\n  Eventually, we have got to balance the budget, as we talked about \nearlier, and it needs to be something within the 3-percent committee \nthat leads us to that.\n  Also, under the majority leader's bill, there is no requirement to \nactually enact any of the deficit reduction committee's reforms. I \nthink he has a very interesting proposal in terms of having an \nexpedited process on the floor, an up-or-down vote, no amendments. I \nthink that is smart. But if the deficit reduction committee deadlocks \nor if the deficit reduction committee fails to get the votes here on \nthe floor of the Senate, there needs to be some mechanism, a fail-safe \nmechanism or so-called trigger for accomplishing dollar-for-dollar \ncuts.\n  The House plan responsibly makes much of this debt limit increase \ncontingent on the cuts being actually approved and signed into law. If \nthe President and Majority Leader Reid want the entire debt limit \nincrease now, we would need some guarantee that this deficit reduction \nwould actually take place. A commonsense compromise would be to add \nsequestration language, meaning you sequester across the board all \nspending, if the deficit reduction doesn't work, deadlocks, or doesn't \npass on the floor even under these procedures. I would say you could \nlimit that sequestration to the size of the debt limit increase, not \neven the size that Speaker Boehner has, which was $1.8 trillion, or \nLeader Reid I think assumes, which is even higher than that for his \ndebt reduction committee, but just be sure it meets this formula of $1 \nspending cuts for every $1 of extension for the debt limit. That seems \nto be the kind of proposal that, at this late hour, could be agreed to \nand certainly should be.\n  Sequestration, by the way, is not a new concept. It has enforced \nnearly every budget reform law of the past 20 years in the Congress. It \ncan guarantee that, one way or another, we will receive the deficit \nreduction equal to the debt limit increase, which is, again, the intent \nby Majority Leader Reid, Speaker Boehner, and others.\n  Finally, I think we need to allow the Senate to vote on a balanced \nbudget amendment. Let's have a vote. Leader Reid has talked about that, \nSpeaker Boehner has talked about that. I think it is important to \nprovide the representatives of the American people\n\n[[Page S5131]]\n\nthe opportunity to have an up-or-down vote on a balanced budget, or in \nmany forms of a balanced budget, because there are different iterations \nof a balanced budget.\n  It seems this path forward should be able to satisfy both sides. The \nPresident and the majority leader would get the larger debt increase \nlimit they want; there would be guaranteed deficit reduction necessary \nto begin fixing the budget and assuring financial markets that we are \nup to the task.\n  I think when you look at the various options we have before us, there \nis a way forward here. There is a way forward that says, Let's ensure \nthat we have this upfront spending; let's remove the global war on \nsavings gimmick; let's strengthen the initial savings, provide \nguarantees that this deficit reduction committee will actually work; \nand then let's have a vote on the balanced budget amendment.\n  Finally, I have heard the President talk about the importance of \nhaving a debt limit increase because of the market uncertainty in the \neconomy. I agree that we need to do everything we can to stimulate this \neconomy right now. We had bad news this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous consent for 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. However, again getting back to our earlier discussion, \nif we simply extend the debt limit and don't deal with the underlying \nissue of our fiscal problems, what we called earlier the solvency \ncrisis, we will have these same negative economic consequences.\n  With low growth in this quarter and, unfortunately, high unemployment \nover 9 percent, we need to do everything we can to encourage pro-growth \neconomic policies, including tax reform, as we talked about, as well as \nusing the energy resources we have in this country, regulatory relief, \nand, yes, dealing with our debt and deficit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak on the Reid amendment.\n  First of all, I am sorry we are engaged in a filibuster. We are using \nparliamentary procedure in a way that only delays us taking votes. We \nare days away from default. We are days away from our bond rating being \ndowngraded. If we fail to raise the debt limit, the United States of \nAmerica will be irrevocably fractured. We cannot fail and we cannot \nfalter. We must act, and we must act tonight.\n  Last night, the Senate rejected the Boehner plan because it wasn't a \nsolution. It would lead us over the cliff because it did not meet \ncertain tests. If the Republicans force us into default or downgrade, \nit will be the biggest tax increase on Americans. When interest rates \ngo sky high, it will be a tax on Americans.\n  We know that we have to agree to additional spending cuts, but it has \ngot to be long term. We have to have a path forward for eliminating tax \nearmarks and entitlement reform that does not lead to a stampede to \nshrink Social Security benefits or to raise the Medicare age.\n  Mr. Boehner took it upon himself last week to come up with a \nsolution. He told the President he--Mr. Boehner--was the guy to do it. \nWell, he didn't succeed. His proposal was failed leadership and failed \neconomics because it did not meet the threat to our economy from \ndefault and downgrade. Mr. Boehner insisted that there be a vote in \nDecember to raise the debt ceiling; that the House and Senate must pass \na balanced constitutional amendment. That is false. In America we can \nguarantee a vote, but we can't guarantee an outcome.\n  Here are the facts: We will be downgraded if we don't take action or \nif action is not taken seriously. So we must have serious policy, we \nmust have a pragmatic process to reform taxes, and also the way to deal \nwith entitlements. Those who rate our credit, such as Moody's, said a \nshort-term extension would lead to downgrade in credit. Under the \nBoehner proposal we would be downgraded immediately because of his \ncriteria.\n  The Republicans' refusal to say yes to the $2 trillion spending cut \nthat is proposed in the Reid resolution is mind boggling. We are \nagreeing to $2 trillion worth of cuts.\n  As a Democrat, as a New Deal Democrat, as a Fair Deal Democrat, I \nhave now agreed to more cuts than I would ever do under any other \ncircumstances. I have compromised. Other Democrats of my political \npersuasion have compromised. Where is the compromise on the other side? \nWe need compromise, first of all, to get a vote, and then to get it \ndone. I am scared that if we go into a default, interest rates will \nskyrocket. But the President is going to have to set priorities. \nBenefits will be affected.\n  Today I have a Marine Corps pin on. Why did I wear a Marine Corps \npin? First of all, because of their words ``Semper Fi,'' always \nfaithful. How about us? Why can't we be as good as the military we send \ninto war? Those men and women are willing to put their lives on the \nline to fight and defend for democracy. Why can't we be willing to put \nour political careers on the line to fight and defend for democracy? I \nam willing to make the tough choices. I have already made a tough \nchoice to support the significant and Draconian cuts in domestic \nspending with very little coming out of defense, but more should come. \nI wanted to get rid of sacred cows such as the ethanol subsidy, such as \nthe oil and gas subsidy, those sacred cows that slurp it up and milk \nthe public trough. But, oh, no. We couldn't go to revenues, we just had \nto go to cuts.\n  So guess what. Democrats have compromised. We have gone 80 percent of \nthe way. Why can't they come the other 20 percent and say yes to Reid? \nReid gives us a deadline through 2013, which provides the certainty \nthat the credit ratings would like. We make a significant downpayment \non reducing the debt, and we have a political process--and I am willing \nto put more teeth in it--a political process to get rid of tax \nearmarks. And that is what they are; make no mistake, they are tax \nearmarks for the pampered and the prosperous. I am ready to reform that \nand then take a look at entitlement reform.\n  I think the Reid proposal is the path forward. But I say, as we wrap \nup, could we put politics aside? Could we put partisan sniping aside? \nCould we not come together? We on this side of the aisle have made 80 \npercent of a compromise. We look to the other side to give us the other \n20 percent. It will not be giving the Democrats that; it will be \nensuring the solvency and security of the United States of America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the alternating \nblocks continue until 9 p.m. in the following manner: the majority \ncontrolling the time until 8:20 p.m.; Republicans controlling the next \n30 minutes; and the majority controlling the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, the tea party Members in the House have \nachieved a remarkable feat. As the New York Times put today:\n\n       The scope of their victory in reshaping the debt ceiling \n     bill to reflect the fiscal hawkishness of the most \n     conservative House Members cannot be overstated.\n\n  In other words, despite Democratic control over the White House, \ndespite Democratic control over the Senate, despite overwhelming \nopposition from the American people, a small minority of the Members of \nthe Republican-controlled House have successfully pushed an extreme \nrightwing agenda onto the American political landscape. This rightwing \nideology is a set of beliefs which represents the interests of the \nwealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations. It is \nan ideology which ultimately wants to destroy Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid, and make devastating cuts in education, Head \nStart, environmental protection, nutrition, infrastructure, and every \nother program which protects the interests of working families and the \nmiddle class.\n  It is an ideology which believes that despite the fact that the rich \nare getting richer, the middle class is shrinking, and poverty is \nincreasing, all of the burden for deficit reduction should rest on \nworking people, despite the fact that in the last 25 years the top 1 \npercent has achieved 80 percent of all new income. But this rightwing \nideology says we have got to cut back on education, we have got to cut \nback on\n\n[[Page S5132]]\n\nhealth care, we have got to cut back on Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, and every other program a middle class and a working class, \nhurting desperately in the midst of this recession, depend upon.\n  In my view, this is an ideology which is grotesquely immoral and it \nis also bad economic policy. It has failed time after time, most \nrecently during the Bush administration when, during his 8 years in \noffice, we lost 500,000 private sector jobs, the worst job performance \nrecord in modern American history. It is an ideology which, in poll \nafter poll, has been rejected by the American people.\n  For example, a few days ago a Washington Post poll came out, and 72 \npercent of the American people--and this is similar to every other poll \nI have seen--said that if we are going to be effective in dealing with \ndeficit reduction, the most preferred way is to ask those people making \nmore than $250,000 a year to pay more in taxes--72 percent of the \nAmerican people.\n  The Republicans, on the other hand, have fought time and time again \nto say that the wealthy and the largest corporations, some of which \nmake billions in profit, pay nothing in taxes. They are not to be asked \nfor 1 cent of sacrifice in deficit reduction; just working families, \njust children, just the elderly, just the sick.\n  It seems to me in this very late date of this debate we face four \noptions, none of which is particularly good.\n  The first option is what some of the rightwing extremists have wanted \nall along: Let us default. It is not a problem. So what if millions of \nSocial Security recipients don't get their check. So what if veterans \ndon't get the check they were promised. So what, if sick people who \nwere dependent upon Medicare and Medicaid cannot get the medical help \nthey need? No problem, let's default. Clearly, most of us understand \nthat scenario would be a disaster for this country, for our economy, \nand, in fact, for the entire global economy.\n\n  The second option we are looking at is a bill that was passed Friday \nin the Republican House, the so-called Boehner bill. This bill would \nrequire massive cuts right now to a wide variety of programs and, most \nimportantly, it would bring this congressional circus back into action \nimmediately because within 6 months we would have to go over this \ndebate once again. That is an absurd proposal. And included in that \nproposal, because they want huge amounts of cuts 6 months from now, no \nquestion, massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid--that is \nwhat the Boehner proposal is about.\n  The third option is the Reid bill. This bill, while by no means as \ndestructive as the Boehner bill, is also bad news for working families. \nBecause of the Republican commitment to the wealthiest people in this \ncountry and the largest corporations, it also would make heavy cuts on \nworking families and not one penny of revenue coming from the rich and \nlarge corporations.\n  Let me discuss the one remaining option that seems to me to make at \nleast some sense. It is not a great option but the best available. That \nhas already been spoken about by my good friend Tom Harkin. It seems to \nme that the least onerous option available to us today is for the \nPresident of the United States to exercise his authority under the 14th \namendment to the Constitution to pay the debts incurred by the United \nStates. The Constitution is very clear in saying that the debts of the \nUnited States ``shall not be questioned.''\n  The President swears an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, \nand many constitutional scholars believe the 14th amendment gives the \nPresident the authority and responsibility to pay our debts regardless \nof the dysfunctionality of the U.S. Congress. I think that is just what \nhe should do if he is left with no other way to protect the full faith \nand credit of the United States.\n  I believe former President Bill Clinton is absolutely right in saying \nthat if he were still in the White House, that is what he would do. \nClinton said, and I agree with him:\n\n       I think the Constitution is clear and I think this idea \n     that the Congress gets to vote twice on whether to pay for \n     expenditures it has appropriated is crazy.\n\n  Let me be clear about what exactly this means and why it is so \nimportant that the President use this amendment now, at this particular \nmoment in history. Let's remember that the debt ceiling was raised 18 \ntimes under Ronald Reagan and 7 times under George W. Bush, when the \nnational debt increased by some $5 trillion. If we concede to the \nrightwing Republicans and if we make all of these cuts right now \nbecause they refuse to raise the debt ceiling, this sets a horrendous \nprecedent for the future of congressional action. What this would mean \nis that no matter what legislation and appropriations were passed by \nthe future Congress, the new Congress could simply say: We refuse to \npay those bills. This would cause massive uncertainty in the financial \nmarket, drive interest rates up, and cloud the entire legislative \nprocess of the U.S. Congress. That is wrong and must not happen.\n  I understand there are those who disagree with this option, and I \nrespect that. But I think we have an obligation to our senior citizens \nand our veterans to say: Yes, you are going to get the Social Security \nchecks and the other benefits you have been promised. We have an \nobligation to our children and to the sick that, yes, you are going to \nget the Medicare and Medicaid benefits you have been promised. \nIncredibly, we have an obligation to the men and women in our Armed \nForces who are putting their lives on the line. We have an obligation \nto them to make sure they get paid.\n  If Republican recalcitrance prevents us from reaching an agreement, \nthen the President of the United States must do what is best for our \npeople and for the future of this country.

Madam President, how much time do I have under the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nDemocratic side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/30/senate-section/article/S5132-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5132-S5133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL VETERANS WHEELCHAIR GAMES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to consideration of S. Res. 246, which was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 246) recognizing and commending the \n     2011 National Veterans Wheelchair Games, to be held in \n     Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, August 1 through August 6, 2011.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise today in favor of this resolution \nto recognize the importance of the National Veterans Wheelchair games \nwhich will be held in Pittsburgh, PA, starting August 1. This \nresolution recognizes the great contributions that this event makes \ntowards improving the lives of disabled veterans and commends the \norganizers of this event.\n  I am proud to welcome veterans from across the country to Pittsburgh, \nPA, this year as they participate in the 31st annual National Veterans \nWheelchair Games. The games offer veterans with disabilities an \nopportunity to foster improved health through competition. Veterans can \nparticipate in 17 different events which include swimming, rugby, \nbowling, soccer and track and field events. These games have allowed \nfor veterans, including those who have served in Operation Enduring \nFreedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom a chance to meet with other \nwheelchair athletes and to continue to use their athletic skills in \ncompetition.\n  Participants come from almost every State in the United States, from \nPuerto Rico and from the United Kingdom. They range from world class \nathletes to first time competitors. A quarter of the athletes will be \nparticipating for the first time.\n  As a Senator representing the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, home to \nover 1 million veterans, the care and treatment of veterans is one of \nmy highest priorities. I firmly believe that this country must be \ngrateful for the safe homecoming of every single man and woman who has \nserved in harm's way. Our joy at their return must be reflected in our \ncommitment to helping all those who have served, especially those who \nare coping with devastating physical injuries and illnesses.\n\n[[Page S5133]]\n\n  During my time in the U.S. Senate, I have sponsored and supported \nlegislation to help our Nation's veterans. I strongly believe that \ntreatment and rehabilitation of our Nation's veterans should be among \nour highest priorities. These games offer our Nation's veterans an \nopportunity to overcome adversity and work towards rehabilitation. As \nsuch the games deserve our support and attention.\n  It is with great pride that I offer this resolution to recognize the \ncontribution that this event makes towards improving the lives of \ndisabled veterans and commend the organizers and volunteers of this \nevent. I thank Senator Toomey for joining me in sponsoring this and I \nurge all of my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I further ask that the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 246) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 246\n\n       Whereas the National Veterans Wheelchair Games are a multi-\n     event sports and rehabilitation program for veterans who use \n     wheelchairs for sports competition due to spinal cord \n     injuries, amputations, or neurological problems;\n       Whereas the National Veterans Wheelchair Games is the \n     largest annual wheelchair sporting event in the world, \n     attracting roughly 600 athletes annually;\n       Whereas in 2011, the National Veterans Wheelchair Games \n     will be held August 1 through August 6, in Pittsburgh, \n     Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas competitive events at the National Veterans \n     Wheelchair Games include table tennis, archery, swimming, \n     quad rugby, weightlifting, air guns, nine-ball, basketball, \n     softball, bowling, handcycling, power soccer, trapshooting, \n     Super ``6'' slalom, a motorized wheelchair rally, and track \n     and field events;\n       Whereas the National Veterans Wheelchair Games provide \n     veterans with disabilities the opportunity to enhance their \n     quality of life and promote better health through sports \n     competition; and\n       Whereas past National Veterans Wheelchair Games have \n     produced national and world-class champions and given newly \n     disabled veterans, including veterans who have served in \n     Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, a \n     chance to participate in events with other wheelchair \n     athletes and to continue to use their athletic skills in \n     competition: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the significant contribution that the \n     National Veterans Wheelchair Games make to the lives of \n     disabled veterans who have selflessly served the United \n     States; and\n       (2) commends the organizers and volunteers of and the \n     participants in the 2011 National Veterans Wheelchair Games \n     for their efforts in service of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/30/senate-section/article/S5133-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5133-S5144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ESTABLISHING THE COMMISSION ON FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT PROCESSING \n                           DELAYS--Continued\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to say that I listened very \ncarefully to the remarks of the senior Senator from Maryland about \nwhere we find ourselves. I want to associate myself with her remarks on \nwhat a dire situation we are in at this moment. We really stand tonight \non the edge of an economic calamity. Why is that? America is at the \nbrink of being unable to pay our bills, bills we already voted to pay \nway in the past. When you raise the debt ceiling, it is not about \nfuture spending, it is about meeting your obligations.\n  How did we get to this debt? How did we get to this debt? For many \nyears, we ran deficits, and they added up.\n  But I remember that when Bill Clinton was President--Madam President, \nI know you remember this--we balanced the budget. We didn't have a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution; we balanced the budget \nby sitting down and figuring out what was wasteful spending, what were \nimportant investments. We had economic growth, 23 million new jobs, and \nall the revenues that came with them. We had surpluses.\n  When George W. Bush became President, he said about this surplus: I \nhave to give this back to the people. And he gave it back to the \nmillionaires and the billionaires. He put two wars on the credit card. \nPoof--there went the surplus. Then he had a prescription drug benefit, \nbut he didn't pay for it, and there went the surplus. Two wars on the \ncredit card, prescription drug benefit on the credit card, and tax \nbreaks for millionaires and billionaires on the credit card, and all of \na sudden, we started to see the debt rise.\n  My Republican friends who have suddenly discovered this debt never \nsaid a word when George Bush was President and we raised the debt \nceiling nine times. Did you see the Democrats out here on the floor \nthreatening to hold up the whole country? Did you see the Democrats \nsaying: We won't give George Bush an increase in the debt ceiling \nunless he does whatever we want. We didn't do that. We should not ever \ndo that. That is what is going on here. Republicans, led by the far \nextreme of their party, are holding this country hostage, and they are \nsaying that unless they get their way, they will not relent.\n  I pray and I hope--and I am talking to my Republican friends in these \nhours--we will be able to come to some agreement. But I will say this: \nWe are now facing a filibuster by my Republican friends. They will not \nallow us to vote on the Reid amendment with just a majority vote. They \nare demanding a supermajority. What I find interesting is they did not \ndemand a supermajority vote over in the House on the Boehner proposal. \nThat was done by a simple majority. Now they say we need a \nsupermajority to vote on the Reid proposal.\n  Harry Reid has his door wide open; you know that as well as I. He has \ninvited Mitch McConnell--all the Republicans: Come on in. I am here. I \nam ready to negotiate. What is it that you need?\n  So far, we know there are conversations going on among Members. We do \nnot see that leadership coming from Leader McConnell. I hope he is \nrethinking this because the whole world is watching. They see a \nfilibuster tonight. They understand which side is trying to resolve it.\n  How did we really get here? I explained how we got to the debt. How \ndid we get to this moment? The debt ceiling needed to be raised, and \nour Republican friends said to our President: We are not going to give \nyou a clean debt ceiling increase. We want to sit down and work on some \ncuts to the budget.\n  Guess what. The President said: I don't know, but we will do it. Come \non in, we will do it.\n  Then the President said: You know what. Let's get a really big deal. \nLet's get a $4 trillion deal. Let's get out of this budgetary crisis.\n  The President gave and gave, and what was the reward? First Eric \nCantor stalked out of the talks. He stalked out. ``I don't want to be \npart of this.'' He took his little blanky and went home.\n  Then John Boehner--he is in the talks, and he walks out of the talks \nnot once but twice. He said: Well, I am done with this. I am going to \nwork with the people on Capitol Hill. I am going to go talk to the \nbipartisan leadership here.\n  We said: Fine. We will try to work with you.\n  But they want everything their way: My way or the highway. If you \never looked up what ``compromise'' means, it means everybody gives a \nlittle.\n  We didn't want to attach this to the debt ceiling increase, but we \nsaid: OK, we will do it. You feel strongly about it. We will do it.\n  They said: OK. We don't want any new revenues.\n  They don't want to touch millionaires and billionaires. God forbid \nthey should pay $5 more a year to help us.\n  We said: You know what, we think it is wrong, but if that is what you \nare saying, we will just do cuts.\n  That was not happy. Harry Reid did more cuts than the Republicans--\ntwice as many. That still was not good enough for them. It is always \nmore of what they want.\n  I raised a family, and I know sometimes it is tough. This is the \nAmerican family. If you have an argument between two kids in your \nfamily--I had two children. Now I have four grandchildren. They argue, \nand you have to say: Let's listen to each other first. I will give up \nsomething, and you give up something. Let's meet in the middle.\n  Oh, no. Then you think: Wait a minute, why do they think they deserve \nevery single thing they want?\n\n[[Page S5134]]\n\nWhat are they thinking? Do they run the Senate? No. The Democrats do.\n  Madam President, you and I just won reelection. You are the longest \nserving woman ever in this Senate. I am so proud to know you. You have \nhad some hard races in your life. I had the toughest race in my life \ncoming back here, but I came back here. Leader Reid came back here. \nPatty Murray came back here. Michael Bennet came back here. And we run \nthe Senate. President Obama is the President. He happens to be a \nDemocrat. And in the House, the Republicans won a huge victory--a huge \nvictory. The Republicans run the House, the Democrats run the Senate, \nand the President is a Democrat. Let's see, that is three branches, \ntwo-thirds run by the Democrats. The Republicans want it all. If one of \nmy kids did that, if they were arguing with the other one, I would say \nthat is not right. I am not even asking for two-thirds. As Senator \nMikulski said, we have come a long way from where we want to come. \nWhere have they come? They have not come toward us. Now the plan the \nRepublicans want is to revisit this debt crisis in 3 months, 4 months, \n5 months from now. Imagine roiling the markets.\n\n  I used to be a stockbroker a very long time ago. In those years when \nthe President got a cold, the market went down, everyone was worried. \nWe never had a crisis like this. Do you know we have raised the debt \nlimit 89 times in our history? No political party--no Republican Party, \nno Democratic Party--has ever held the debt ceiling increase hostage to \ntheir desires, hopes, and dreams.\n  What does the other side want? They will be honest--not all of them. \nThey want cuts in Social Security, Medicare. They even had a proposal \nover in the House to end Medicare as we know it. We are not going \nthere. We will not go there. We will not be revisiting this every 3 or \n4 months. It is a recipe for a downgrade in our bonds. It is a recipe \nfor turmoil in the marketplace. It is a recipe for higher mortgage \nrates. It is a recipe for more unemployment. It is a recipe for chaos.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I was on the phone today listening to people call \nin from Ohio, taking calls. I heard so many people very afraid of the \nBoehner legislation and what might come out of a further compromise. \nSenator Reid, as the Senator said, has offered a good many cuts and \ndoing this in a way that is bipartisan.\n  Is the Senator hearing that in her State there is a real fear that \nthe Republicans in the House are insisting on Social Security and \nMedicare cuts and what that would mean to people in her State?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. We are the largest State in the Union with 38 \nmillion people. We have more people on Social Security and Medicare \nthan any other State. They know what the stakes are. They are smart. If \nwe look at the polls, 70 percent of the people say: Tax millionaires \nand billionaires; they should pay their fair share. Spare Social \nSecurity, Medicare, education and the things that we need.\n  We are here in a manmade crisis. This is unnecessary. This has never \nbeen done before, and I think the people have to understand that. Never \never has this been done before. We raised the debt ceiling 18 times \nwhen Ronald Reagan was President. I happened to be in the House of \nRepresentatives. Yes, a few people here and there voted no once in a \nwhile, but no one ever thought of bringing down that vote. We cannot \nhave the greatest country in the world defaulting on our bonds. We \ncannot have us defaulting on our contracts.\n  Small businesses are calling me--I say to my friend from Ohio and my \nfriend from Maryland and my friend from Alaska--and they are saying \nthey cannot get credit now. The banks are fearful. They are only \ngetting overnight credit. What are we doing in this manmade crisis? We \nhave a long history of working together at times such as this.\n  Leader Reid's office is open. The door is open. This is the time to \nwork together. We have until 1 in the morning when we hope we can get \nan up-or-down vote on Leader Reid's proposal. I know there are talks \ngoing on. I have been talking to my Republican friends. They want to \nfind a way out of this. But you know what. We have to pledge allegiance \nto the flag, not to Grover Norquist. We have to do what is right for \nthe country. I pray and I hope that we do.\n  I will say this: If we fail, I hope the President will invoke the \n14th amendment. Everyone should read it. It says the debt of the United \nStates shall not be questioned. If we cannot get together, the \nPresident will have to take responsibility. I hope we can and show the \nworld that we can still work together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gentlelady from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I follow my friend from California, \nand I agree wholeheartedly with her that the United States of America \ncannot default on its debts and obligations. I would like to think that \nall 100 of us in this body would concur and agree that we must, using \nevery tool that we have at our disposal, using all of our relationships \nand what we have built as Members in this body and in the House of \nRepresentatives, that we use our best efforts to ensure we do not \ndefault as a nation but that we go further, that we go further and we \noffer the people of this country a solution to the problems that have \nled us to the point that we are today.\n  We have heard a great deal over the course of these past few days \nabout the Boehner plan and whether it is good, bad, or indifferent, and \nnow the Reid plan and whether it is good, bad, or indifferent. We \nassumably know what the Republicans want and what the Democrats want.\n  What about what the people of this country want right now? I don't \nknow what all of the people of America want, but I can give you some \nideas about what I am hearing from the people of Alaska and what they \nare concerned about and what they want from the Senate, from the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, and from the President of this country. They \nwant us to fix it. Odd that it should be so easy. Just fix it. They \nexpect us to do just that. They expect us to fix this problem. That is \nwhy they have entrusted us with their confidence by allowing us the \nprivilege to come and represent them in this body to help resolve these \nissues.\n  They don't expect that I, as a Republican, am going to resolve it \nwith just the Republicans. They expect that we, as Members of the \nSenate, will resolve this--Republicans and Democrats alike. They \nbelieve we will achieve a compromise built on the good ideas that come \nfrom the Republicans and the good ideas that come from the Democrats; \nthat we will come together to solve the problems that affect the people \nin the great State of Maryland and the people in the great State of \nAlaska, and all the places in between.\n  In our effort to fix this, they expect us to compromise. Compromise \nshould not be a negative or a nasty term. It should be what we all work \nto achieve jointly.\n  I would suggest that the other thing the people are looking for is \nhonesty. They are listening to this debate. We have received phone \ncalls in my office all day. We have been receiving them all week. I \nthink so many of us have picked up the phones ourselves to hear what \npeople are saying when they are calling. They are saying: Wait a \nminute. You guys are throwing numbers around. First of all, Speaker \nBoehner puts out a plan, and, well, it doesn't achieve the 1-to-1 ratio \nthat he thought, so he pulls it back and so we have another set. Now \nSenator Reid has his proposal on the floor, but people are talking \nabout this $1 trillion that is going for the war effort in Afghanistan \nand Iraq that we know is not really real and these are phantom numbers.\n  They are saying: Who are we to believe? Why are you not honest with \nus about the proposals that are out there? Does it cut? Would you \nexpect that it will cut if, in fact, we are going to be focused on \nentitlements, Social Security? If we are going to be talking about tax \nrevenues and how we might deal with tax reform? Can you not be honest \nwith us, the American people, your constituents, the people you \nrepresent? They want a level of honesty in this discourse. We owe that \nto them.\n\n  People are also looking for certainty. There were some of my \ncolleagues who spoke earlier in the day, and they were speaking from \nthe perspective of small\n\n[[Page S5135]]\n\nbusinesses and how--as a small businessman or large businessperson for \nthat matter--it is imperative that in order for a person to make those \nbusiness judgment decisions in terms of whether they are going to \nexpand, whether they are going to bring on additional employees, they \nneed to have a level of certainty in terms of what is going to go on.\n  What is going to happen with tax policy? What is the future of the \neconomy going to be? What is the jobs picture like? It is not like we \nall have a crystal shiny ball out there that we can predict with great \nprecision. We don't. What we ought not be doing is injecting greater \nuncertainty, and that is what is happening right now.\n  All throughout this summer we have kind of strung people along. We \nall knew that August 2 was coming. We all knew the revenue was coming \nin and the outlays going out were not going to be measuring up, and we \nwere going to be dealing with the potential for a default; we were \ngoing to be dealing with the potential for a downgrade in our credit \nrating. This is no surprise to anybody. That is where our crystal ball \nactually was pretty transparent. Yet we are not able to pull it \ntogether.\n  We managed to take a recess last week even though we were all \npromised we were going to be here working around the clock because we \nhad important business to do. I was here with a colleague on Friday \nmorning after the vote, looked around and realized I was perhaps the \nlast Senator left here in Washington, DC. I got on a plane at 2:30 that \nafternoon to go to Alaska for crying out loud. We should have been here \nlast weekend doing this instead of mere hours before we are up against \nour default deadline.\n  What does this do to the certainty or uncertainty in the economic \nclimate, to the investment climate? I hesitate to be one that would \nsuggest that we need to be making market decisions because we can't \nfigure out what is going on here. I can tell you because I am hearing \nit in the halls. People are saying: I don't know about you, but I am \nlooking at my investment fund or my retirement fund, and I am moving \nthings. That is the kind of confidence they have in our ability to \nfigure it out.\n  We are seeing it translate in the numbers. We saw that at the end of \nthe week with the markets. We know tomorrow evening when the Asian \nmarkets open, everybody in the world from the financial community--this \nis not just the people in Washington, DC--will be looking to see \nwhether we, as a Congress, have figured it out and if we have fixed it. \nIf we don't, that continued uncertainty just continues this spiral.\n  We can do a lot in the Senate. We can do a lot in the Congress. We \ncan pass bills and the President can sign them into law. One of the \nthings we cannot legislate is we cannot tell the markets to shape up. \nWe cannot tell the markets to pull it back in, everything is going to \nbe OK. They are picking up on signals, and the signals right now are a \nlevel of uncertainty that is rattling.\n  The other thing that I think the people of this country are hoping \nfor, are asking for, is a level of civility and respect within this \nbody to our President, to those in the other body. We all come from \ndifferent persuasions. Alaska is different from Maryland. My politics \nare different from your politics, Madam President, but I have great \nrespect for you. We can argue and we can disagree, but we don't need to \npoke fingers in one another's eyes to get our point across.\n  I think what the people have seen, as we have engaged in this debate, \nis something that does not do justice to the integrity of this \ninstitution. We need to get back to that point where we can engage in \ngood debate and disagree heartily and make our arguments without being \ndisrespectful of one another and the perspectives we, as individuals \nrepresenting our constituencies and our States, bring to the table.\n  The hour is late. We will have a vote at 1 o'clock in the morning. \nHow dignified. What body comes together at the darkest hour to cast a \nvote?\n  Last evening, my brother and sister-in-law were in town. They were \npassing through very quickly. They were actually able to be here and \nwatch for about an hour and a half while we were engaged in the vote on \nthe floor. My brother and sister-in-law are pretty educated people. \nThey follow the news. They follow the politicians. They were fascinated \nby what was going on in this body and trying to understand what it was \nthat was going on. I was trying to convey it to them, and I realized, \nif it is this difficult for me as a Member of this body to explain to \nsomebody who is pretty plugged into what is going on, what is happening \nhere, imagine the confusion of the person who just occasionally tunes \nin to C-SPAN, who reads the news or watches the evening news but isn't \nfollowing the day-to-day. What we have managed to do is, on a \nbipartisan basis, confuse the American public, anger them, frustrate \nthem, and cause them to be fearful about the future of our country. \nThat is not leadership.\n  We have an opportunity in these next very short days ahead to regain \nsome of this. We have some ideas that are out there. As the Senator \nfrom California has mentioned, and many others have mentioned, there \nare a great number of talks that are going on. There are talks at the \nleadership level. There are talks going on with those of us who are not \npart of leadership. That is important. But we need to recognize it is \nabsolutely critical for the future of our country--not the future of \nour political well-being but the future of our country--that we be \ncoming together to resolve the issues, not necessarily just to broker a \ndeal but to find a solution that puts the interests of our country \nabove our own political interests. That is where we need to be.\n  I am an optimist. I am a person who has the glass always half full. I \nremain committed to working with all Members of good will who will \nstand together to work through these difficult details. It is not easy, \nbut they never promised us it was going to be.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. Before she begins, I \nwould advise her, her side has 16 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I rise to speak about the August 2 debt ceiling deadline and the \nproposal that will be before us very soon, developed by Majority Leader \nReid.\n  Here we are again debating legislation that demonstrates our \nfundamental differences in how we should run our government. I wish to \nquote from a recent article by Charles Krauthammer that appeared in the \nNational Review. I think it says something I have been saying several \ntimes in the last week, which is that this is more than a debt ceiling \ndebate; it is a debate about our views of government that are so \ndifferent between the parties in our country. Here is what Charles \nKrauthammer said:\n\n       We're in the midst of a great four-year national debate on \n     the size and reach of government, the future of the welfare \n     state, indeed, the nature of the social contract between \n     citizen and state. The distinctive visions of the two \n     parties--social-Democratic versus limited-government--have \n     underlain every debate on every issue since Barack Obama's \n     inauguration: the stimulus, the auto bailouts, health-care \n     reform, financial regulation, deficit spending. Everything. \n     The debt ceiling is but the latest focus of this fundamental \n     divide.\n       The sausage-making may be unsightly--\n\n  No argument there--\n\n     but the problem is not that Washington is broken--\n\n  As he describes it--\n\n     that ridiculous, ubiquitous cliche. The problem is that these \n     two visions are in competition, and the definitive popular \n     verdict has not yet been rendered.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       We're only at the midpoint. Obama won a great victory in \n     2008 that he took as a mandate to transform America toward \n     European-style social democracy. The subsequent \n     counterrevolution delivered to that project a staggering \n     rebuke in November of 2010.\n\n  I think that puts a perspective on the debates we have been having \nduring the last 2 years and the debate we are seeing now in the last \nfew weeks.\n  I do know that none of us wants our country to go into default. Both \nsides can agree on that. All of us are troubled with the delay in \nresolving this issue. Uncertainty is not good for our economy, but a \nbad agreement is worse because it will have lasting impacts. It is my \nopinion it will also affect our debtors with a message that we are not \nserious about a $14 trillion debt and we are not going to do anything \nthat would try to bring it down or bring\n\n[[Page S5136]]\n\ndown the deficits or change the entitlement programs that are a major \npart--more than half--of our budget.\n  I support Speaker Boehner's bill, and I support the Cut, Cap, and \nBalance Act. Both of these plans, in my opinion, contain the right \napproach to our budget challenges. I believe the Reid plan is the wrong \napproach. The Reid plan contains what they say is a $2.4 trillion debt \nlimit increase which, if enacted, would result in the single largest \nincrease in the debt ceiling in the history of America.\n  In addition to this unprecedented increase, the Reid plan fails to \naddress our current fiscal imbalance. It doesn't do anything to address \nthe fundamental problems. It lacks any adequate enforcement, and it \ndoesn't ensure that long-term spending cuts are carried out. There is \nno guarantee at all. So we raise the debt limit and we don't have \nanything but a promise, and that is not good enough. It is not good \nenough for the elected leaders of our country, and it is certainly not \ngood enough for the American public.\n  The debt ceiling increase in the Reid plan is not paid for. Many of \nthe cuts outlined in his plan are illusory or hopeful. Hope is not a \nstrategy. We can hope to do away with waste, fraud, and abuse, but we \ncan't promise right now because we don't have it before us. If we had a \nbill that cuts certain amounts from certain agencies because of waste, \nfraud, and abuse, that would be a commitment we could uphold. But what \nwe have is a promise that we will look at it. How many times have we \nlooked at waste, fraud, and abuse in our government programs? Yes, we \nought to do it, but we should not make it the basis of lifting a debt \nceiling that is crushing the economy in our country.\n  To label $1 trillion of cuts as savings from leaving Afghanistan and \nIraq, which Senator Reid's proposal does, is not credible. For one \nthing, we don't know what the future obstacles in Afghanistan and Iraq \nare. We have to retain a certain level of stability on the ground in \nAfghanistan. I have met with Afghan leaders and women just in the last \ncouple weeks, and they also agree that if America leaves precipitously \nwithout knowing what the stability on the ground is--and we certainly \nhaven't seen stability lately with the assassinations of mayors and \nleaders, including the half brother of the leader of Afghanistan--that \nis not stability. It doesn't say they are ready yet. So having $1 \ntrillion of cuts could undermine our national security. I hope we can \nleave with the right circumstances on the ground, but that is the only \ncriteria we should use and not cutting a budget that we know is a \npromise and not a commitment we are assured we can keep.\n  Most disturbing of all in the Reid plan: The only possible \njustification for a $2.4 trillion increase in borrowing authority is to \navoid doing this again before the 2012 election. That is not a reason \nto make public policy. Yes, none of us would want to go through this \nagain in the next year. It has been painful--painful for all sides--but \njust saying: We are going to do it with promises and hope for the \nfuture is certainly not a way to address a major policy issue, and it \nis not going to have the credibility with the American people.\n  I believe it would be irresponsible to give the President this \nunprecedented additional borrowing authority without requiring the \nenactment of significant spending reductions and reforms. To do so \nwould send a worse signal to the markets across the world that are \nshaky right now, looking at this debate. But they are also looking at \nwhat the result is going to be and who is going to win the battle about \nhow we run our government. Can we imagine a $16 trillion debt ceiling \nwith no commitment to actually make the cuts that would start getting \nus on the right path? That is not enough. That is why we are here at a \nquarter of 9 on Saturday night debating this issue, because we are not \ngoing to give up on our principles of making sure the fiscal \nresponsibility of our country will be worthy of a AAA rating, will be \nworthy of the assuredness that if you buy a bond or a Treasury note or \ninvest in the United States of America, that it is a golden commitment, \nthat you can count on it, that you can take it to the bank. That is \nwhat we are fighting for right now.\n  I hope so much we can come to an agreement because we all agree that \ndefaulting on our debt would not be a good signal to the markets, but \nraising the debt ceiling without the assured cuts, without caps on \nfuture years' spending is unconscionable.\n  I hope going forward we would have a balanced budget amendment that \nwould go to the States because most States have a balanced budget \namendment in their constitutions and they have mostly sound fiscal \npolicies. If we had to live with those same constraints, I believe we \nwould not get into this kind of a situation again. Eventually, I hope \nwe will have a balanced budget amendment that we could get a two-thirds \nvote for and send to the States and see if that isn't a worthy \namendment to our great Constitution. But in the meantime, cut and cap \nis what we can do, and I hope we will.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I feel compelled to come to the floor this \nevening to refute some of the arguments that have been made by some of \nmy colleagues, points that are important for the American people to \nunderstand, points that, if not clarified, could lead to a \nmisunderstanding, lead to resentment which is misplaced.\n  One of the points I have heard made this evening by one of my \ncolleagues is that the debt limit issue has never been held hostage \nquite like it has now. I am not quite sure what was meant by this, but \nI do want to clarify this point.\n  If someone had held this hostage before on any of the dozens and \ndozens of times the debt limit has been raised over the course of many \nyears, maybe it would have been a good thing. Maybe it would be a good \nthing for us not to be dealing with right now a national debt that has \nalmost reached $15 trillion.\n  Maybe we should consider the fact that those who are being held \nhostage are those who will one day have to repay this debt, considering \nthat some of those people are not yet here because they have yet to be \nborn, and in some instances, their parents have yet to meet. We have to \nask the question whether they are being held hostage themselves--held \nhostage to a government that always demands more money so it can \nexercise more power over us. And as it acquires more power, exercises \nmore of that over us--thus restricting our liberty--it demands more \nmoney. As it acquires more money, it exercises more power, and the \nprocess perpetuates itself. This is how we get to the point where we \nare almost $15 trillion in debt. This is how we get to the point where \nthe American people are being held hostage. So if this process has not \nbeen held up in the past, then shame on those who could have held it up \nbut did not.\n  It is incumbent upon us who serve here and now to represent those who \nare sometimes underrepresented to represent those most vulnerable \nmembers of society who are not yet old enough to vote or not yet born. \nThis is a multigenerational problem. It is a multigenerational \nobligation we are taking upon our entire country in connection with \nthis debate.\n  So if my colleague who made this point just about half an hour ago \nmeant that we should never have vigorous, aggressive debate and \ndiscussion over whether it is a good idea to take on $2.5 trillion in \nnew debt in one fell swoop, perhaps we should revisit that assumption; \nperhaps we ought to second-guess ourselves just a little bit more than \nwe have in recent decades lest we hold hostage an entire generation.\n  Another point that was made by that same colleague is that \nRepublicans have put forward plans to challenge, to undermine, to bring \nabout immediate cuts to Social Security and Medicare. This simply is \nnot true. Quite to the contrary. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act--of \nwhich I was the lead sponsor in the Senate before it was introduced in \nthe House by my friend Jason Chaffetz, where it was later passed--Cut, \nCap, and Balance Act actually protected Social Security and Medicare. \nIt bolstered, it strengthened those programs. So it is utterly false \nand, I believe, disingenuous for anyone to argue that proposal--or any \nother that I am aware of, for that matter--would bring about cuts to \nSocial Security and Medicare. This is not the point of this \nlegislation. Quite to the contrary. The point of this legislation is to\n\n[[Page S5137]]\n\nprotect what we need to do through the U.S. Government.\n  Whether you are someone who would describe himself as a conservative \nand perhaps most concerned about national defense or whether you are \nperhaps more liberal and you are most concerned about protecting our \nentitlement programs, you ought to agree with the principles underlying \nthe cut, cap, and balance approach, with the fact that we need a \nbalanced budget amendment, because if we do not put these measures in \nplace now, if we do not agree now that we need to restrict our \nborrowing authority, every one of those programs will be jeopardized as \nwe reach the mathematical, the economic borrowing capacity of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  The more we borrow, the more we run into the risk that those who lend \nus money, those who buy our U.S. Treasurys, will one day be unwilling \nto lend us more money, at least not without additional interest \npayments. We could very quickly go from spending about $250 billion a \nyear in interest, as we now are, to spending something much closer to \n$1 trillion a year in interest based on just a few interest rate \npoints. As that goes up, our ability to fund everything goes down.\n  In closing, it is important to point out that what is being requested \nhere is the largest debt limit increase in American history--about $2.5 \ntrillion. Unprecedented. The idea here is to give the U.S. Congress \nenough borrowing power to take us almost 2 years down the road. Two \nyears, by the way, is roughly the amount of time that has elapsed since \nthe Democrats in the Senate even introduced a budget.\n  One has to ask, why extend the debt limit for such a long period of \ntime? The President gave us the answer the other day. He wants to \ninsulate himself from the political process. He wants to make it not a \npolitical issue. Political issues are themselves things the voters are \nconcerned about--as well they should be--because voters pay taxes, \nvoters are affected by decisions we make. We need to have voters \nconnected, not disconnected from this process.\n  We need to act now, but we need to act responsibly. The only way to \ndo that is to raise the debt limit only after we pass the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe alternating blocks of time continue until 9:50 p.m., with the \nmajority controlling the time until 9:20 p.m., the Republican side \ncontrolling the time until 9:50 p.m., and then the majority leader or \ndesignee be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise tonight, as I have for \nmany weeks now, to call for a bipartisan solution to our deficits and \ndebt, for us to bridge--to use a term we utilize in Colorado--the \nmountainous divide in order to avoid defaulting on our obligations.\n  Bipartisanship is a familiar theme in my home State of Colorado, and \nI know Coloradans agree with me that is the only way forward. My \nconstituents have been flooding my office with calls of frustration \nurging me to keep fighting for a solution to this impending debt limit \ncrisis we face. They know the stakes are high, and they know we have to \ncompromise to get something done.\n  As I have traveled my State over these summer months, I have not \nfound one single person in Colorado who has demanded more partisanship \nand more dysfunction. But here we are, seemingly, on a Saturday night \nwith just that. My constituents--Coloradans--are searching for answers \nand solutions. Yet all we seem to have here are more questions.\n  For the life of me, I just do not understand why, when our economy is \nstill fragile, we are so close, it seems, to sentencing it to \nadditional turmoil.\n  Those who know me know I am not quick to anger or to express \nfrustration, but I just cannot help but join Coloradans in looking at \nthe situation we are in with disbelief. We have hard-working and well-\nintentioned Members from both parties who are willing to do the right \nthing for our country, but partisan bickering is seemingly continuing \nto artificially push our economy closer and closer, literally, to the \nbrink.\n  It is easy to chalk this up to a broken Washington, to say Congress \nsimply is unable to agree, but that ignores the truth. That truth is \nthat a small minority of folks is bent on throwing sand in the gears of \nour legislative machinery. We extend a hand in the hopes of reaching an \nagreement, and then over and over this group rejects the idea of \ngoverning together and instead reaches for another handful of sand. The \nmajority of us here do not agree with that. The majority of us in both \nparties do not want to default on our debt obligations.\n  It seems to me our country's economic situation is like a patient who \nis just literally coming off life support: We are nursing our economy \nback to health, and the last thing we need is a self-induced heart \nattack. But that will happen in 3 days. In 3 days, our Nation is set to \ndefault on its debt. That is like an American family who would decide \nnot to pay their bills or to quit making mortgage payments. I know it \nis a natural inclination, perhaps, to not want to pay those bills, but \nAmericans know there are consequences to default and that it is \nirresponsible to turn a blind eye on bills that come due.\n  It is important to note that these are bills we already have \nincurred, that previous Congresses--in fact, this Congress, you could \nargue, has already voted for and therefore has incurred.\n  We have been here before. President Reagan raised the debt limit 18 \ntimes in order to enable the Treasury to pay our debts as they came \ndue. They were routine. They were often voice votes, and when they were \nrecorded votes, they were overwhelmingly in support of raising the debt \nlimit so we could meet previous obligations. President George W. Bush \nraised it seven times. There were no conditions put on the raising of \nour debt ceiling.\n  Let me take a second and be clear. Raising the debt ceiling is not \nsomething I want to do and I am sure anybody in the Senate is not all \nthat keen to do it, but we do have those obligations.\n  A year ago--a year and a half ago, I should say, more accurately--I \nagreed with Republicans and fellow Democrats that we should take \nadvantage of a discussion we had at the end of 2009 about raising the \ndebt ceiling, and we should take advantage of that by putting in place \nreal measures to reduce our debt. I held out my vote at that time to \nraise the debt limit as a way to compel the White House to create a \nfiscal commission to address our long-term deficits and debt.\n  I was really pleased when President Obama created such a commission. \nHe nominated two great Americans--Al Simpson, who was a Senator in this \nvery body, and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles--to \nhead up the effort. I think, as we knew at the time--and we know even \nmore now--these two men are patriots. They brought people together from \nboth parties, and they came up with a $4 trillion plan--it was \ncommonsensical--to bring in and rein in our debt problems. We applauded \ntheir efforts. Coloradans did; Americans all over the country did. They \nbrought a commonsense approach, just as we would in our own personal \nfinances.\n  So when we approached our current debt limit this year and faced the \npossibility of defaulting on our debt, I joined Members of both parties \nin urging us here in the Congress to do two things: first, to address \nour debt limit problem to prevent a first-ever and completely avoidable \ndefault so America could and would pay its bills and secondly, enact a \ncomprehensive and bipartisan $4 trillion plan based on the Simpson-\nBowles deficit reduction recommendations so we would get our fiscal \nhouse in order, I should say for generations of Americans to come but \nfor those of us here today as well.\n  Now, if you look back on this, this in some ways was unpopular. Folks \non the far right and the far left began to sow seeds of division in \norder to prevent compromise. People in our party objected to spending \ncuts and entitlement reforms, while Republican purists, such as Grover \nNorquist, complained about increased revenues.\n  That brings us to the events of the last several weeks. Those of us \nwho support a commonsense middle ground and who believe our country's \nbiggest\n\n[[Page S5138]]\n\nnational security threat is our growing national debt know that both \nsides need to compromise and that we need a long-term, comprehensive \nbipartisan--bipartisan--plan to truly heal the fiscal illnesses that \nhave beset us.\n  This is obvious just looking at the numbers, but it became even \nclearer when our creditors and U.S. rating agencies began to question \nwhether America was a creditworthy nation. Can you imagine that? They \nbegan to ask: Will America pay its bills? Will we be able to pay our \nbills or will we go the way of an Ireland or a Greece and other \nfinancially destabilized nations?\n  To me, the answer is clear: A broke nation is a weak nation. If \nAmerica is not only going to lead the global economic race but win that \nrace, as we know we can, as we have done throughout history, we need to \nimplement the Bowles-Simpson recommendations.\n  With that knowledge, a smart group of people from both parties began \nworking out a way to do so. But there was one huge impediment: \nHundreds, literally hundreds of Members of Congress signed a pledge \npromising not to touch the Tax Code, putting tax purity ahead of fiscal \nresponsibility and deficit reduction. Even though the United States \nbrought in a record-low amount of revenue last year, what they insist \nwe do would--whether intentionally or unintentionally--balance the \nbudget on the backs of the middle class, the elderly, and the \ndisenfranchised alone.\n  Even though the Bowles-Simpson commission recommended a blending of \n75-percent spending cuts and 25-percent revenue increases, they \nseemingly, this small minority here in the Capitol, cannot embrace any \nplan that includes additional revenue. Even though our Tax Code is \nlittered with literally thousands of special interest tax breaks and \ncorporate giveaways that do nothing to create jobs, they cannot \nembrace, it seems, tax reform. Even though a bipartisan plan would send \na message to the markets that America is ready to lead, and that \nCongress is capable of independent thinking and problem solving, they \nhave rejected a bipartisan way forward, a way in which we govern \ntogether. So that plan sits idly. It sits to the side. All sides have \ntried other efforts, but they faced the same problems. Speaker Boehner \nand President Obama sought to strike an alternative grand bargain as a \nway to address our structural deficits and debt to avoid default. That \nlooked pretty promising. But it appears to me that when the going got \ntough, the Speaker did not stay at the table. And when it became \napparent that the corporations and the wealthy would have to bear the \nresponsibility for balancing the books, the House Speaker walked away. \nAnother chapter unfolded.\n  Things looked promising when the Vice President and the House \nmajority leader tried to reach an agreement on a deficit reduction \nplan. But then, when it became clear again that revenues had to be a \npart of the picture if we truly wanted to do something big and good for \nour country, they walked away from the table. Tax purity was more \nimportant than deficit reduction. Knowing that economists, market \nanalysts, business leaders, credit rating agencies, world leaders, and \nthe American people were imploring us, imploring us, to find an \nagreement to avoid default on our debt obligations, Democrats relented.\n  We are now debating what the Republicans said they wanted, a \nspending-cut-only plan. I cannot tell you the depth of my \ndisappointment that we could not pursue a truly comprehensive approach \nto reducing our deficits and debt, one that would set the stage to \ncontinue growing our economy and creating jobs. But in the name of \ncompromise, I agreed that something versus nothing is better than \ndefault and further economic turmoil. But now it appears, on a Saturday \nnight, a few hours from midnight, that even that is not enough. After \nputting together a plan that includes 100 percent of the Republican-\nendorsed spending cuts to avoid default, we are at an impasse again. We \nhave got a plan here on the floor of the Senate that cuts $2.47 \ntrillion from the Federal budget, without any revenue, not a single tax \nloophole is closed, and yet we still cannot get our House colleagues to \nhelp us prevent a first-ever default of the Federal Government.\n  I have learned to not question the motivations of my colleagues. But \nI have to ask myself what is it they want now in the House of \nRepresentatives? And they want exactly, it seems to me, what the Bank \nof America, Standard & Poors, JPMorgan Chase, Moody's, and other \neconomic experts have warned us we can least afford: that is, constant \nturmoil and dysfunction. They literally--whether they understand this \nor not--want us to walk our economy, America's economy, the biggest \neconomy in the world, right up to the cliff edge of default over and \nover again. The markets and business leaders have told us they want to \nincrease investment, they want to create more jobs, they want to get \nour economy back on track, but what they need is certainty. But it \nseems as though there are those in the Capitol, in our Congress, who \nhave decided it is in their interest--political interest--to create \nuncertainty, exactly the opposite of what our markets and our business \ncommunities are telling us--the same Members of Congress, the same \nindividuals who ironically complained that our President has not done \nenough to create jobs or spur economic growth. Yet we are perilously \nclose, and they are perilously close, to cutting off the economic \ngrowth we need to create jobs. In the interests of being direct, if we \ndefault, this would be an economic catastrophe of our own making. It is \nnot something beyond our control such as a hurricane, an earthquake, a \ntornado, a drought. We can avoid the impending chaos and the job loss \nand the downgrading of our retirement savings that is coming our way. \nIf we do not, it will be because some Members of Congress were \nunwilling to take yes for an answer. Some Members of Congress right now \nare unwilling to take yes for an answer.\n  But let me begin to close my remarks on a little more optimistic \nnote. I want to be very clear. There are Members in both parties who \nare willing to be responsible. I was pleased to hear that Senator \nAlexander, the third ranking Republican in the Senate, say what would \nbe best, instead of having a Republican plan competing with a \nDemocratic plan, would be to have Speaker Boehner, Senator Reid, and \nSenator McConnell recommend to us a single plan.\n  Senator Thune said yesterday: I think if you look at the basic \nframework, it wouldn't be that hard to figure out something we could \nperhaps agree upon.\n  I listened to Senator Isakson and Senator Murkowski express similar \nthoughts earlier today. So I think there is a real kernel here of \noptimism and a way forward. But for the life of me, I cannot understand \nwhy we cannot keep our focus on job creation and the global economic \nrace. The rest of the world is not waiting for us. They are on the \nmarch.\n  I am an old mountain climber, in more ways than one, and I can tell \nyou, I have learned that there are some similarities between attempting \nsome of the world's highest peaks and working here in Washington, DC. \nBut the difference, I found, is that when the going gets tough here on \nCapitol Hill, it always seems as though not only do we face the \nchallenges the mountain presents, but there is a team of saboteurs who \nare trying to push and pull you off the mountain.\n  I have to say that I believe if all of us would turn away and frankly \nignore the partisan campaign machines that are out there always \nchurning, we could get something meaningful done here. The people of \nColorado, from whom I take my instructions, and to whom I listen, have \nlet it be known to me these last few days--and I think the rest of the \nNation--they do not care who wins politically. Frankly, I do not care \nwho wins politically either. What I care about is passing legislation--\nmeaningful legislation, long-term legislation--that will stave off a \ngovernment default and a downgrade in our Nation's credit rating. \nNeither of those outcomes is not acceptable. At this point, the only \nplan, the only comprehensive plan, the only long-term plan that gets \nthat done is the Reid plan. So let's focus on the Reid plan. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the vote we are going to have--the historic vote \nwe will have later this evening. Let's get it done. Let's get our \ncountry back on track. Let's win the global economic race.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I would first like to commend and\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\nthank Senator Reid for his tireless and relentless hard work, and my \nDemocratic colleagues, but also some of my Republican colleagues--\nSenator Johnny Isakson, for example--who have demonstrated their \ndetermination to work together to reach an agreement.\n  You know I am new to Washington. I haven't been here for long, but I \nunderstand more than ever why Americans are so frustrated and often \nappalled about what goes on here.\n  This situation is outrageous. We have an impending crisis--self-\ncreated--and devastating possible wounds--self-inflicted--and \nWashington is deadlocked. Washington is gridlocked and straightjacketed \nby self-imposed dysfunction, unable to take action to protect its \ncitizens from a financial catastrophe.\n  Our Nation is at a crossroads, and we need to rein in spending, cut \nthe debt and the deficit, and make the tough choices necessary to get \nour fiscal house in order. And we need to do it now.\n  The latest economic news provides all the more reason for the tough \nchoices and solutions we need now. It shows our economic recovery is \nanemic and fragile.\n  Uncertainty is the enemy. It is the enemy for businesses that are \ndeciding whether to hire; for banks wanting to loan money to those \nbusinesses; for larger corporations sitting on mountains of cash \nwaiting to invest and create jobs.\n  Jobs and our economy are the main reasons to make tough choices now.\n  We cannot keep kicking cans down the road: the time has come to act.\n  Families in Connecticut and across the country make tough choices \nevery day--and they rightfully expect nothing less from us. Tough \nchoices are necessary to help us get our debt and deficit under \ncontrol.\n  I have heard from hundreds of Connecticut residents in the last few \ndays who are frustrated--appalled--at what is going on in Washington, \nDC.\n  Like Bernice from Tolland, CT. She can't believe that we don't have \nan agreement yet because she is worried that she won't receive her \nSocial Security check next month.\n  And Jane from West Hartford. She is wondering why we are protecting \nsweetheart deals instead of ensuring Social Security is protected and \nstrengthened.\n  And Rod from New Milford. He just wants us to compromise and to get \nsomething done and end this nightmare.\n  I agree with them--and hundreds more--and I thank them for calling or \nwriting.\n  I agree that the immediate solution is not only to raise the debt \nceiling but also to cut spending dollar for dollar to match that \nincrease, without tax increases, and without any cuts--none--to Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  The markets need a real solution--not a short-term fix--to \ndemonstrate that we are committed to achieving real results in cutting \nspending.\n  Anne from Hamden, CT makes this point powerfully. She just called \ntoday to say a short-term plan would not provide the certainty the \nmarkets are desperately seeking. I agree. It risks a credit-rating \ndowngrade and ensures that we would be right back here in another 6 \nmonths.\n  Credit ratings and downgrades seem abstract, intangible, but they are \nhugely consequential.\n  A downgrade in our credit rating would likely cause an automatic tax \nincrease in the form of higher interests for every American with a \nmortgage, car loan, student loan or credit card. The American people \ndeserve better.\n  Coming together to compromise is essential now. Majority Leader Reid \nhas proposed a solution that meets all of the criteria that House \nRepublicans have demanded for weeks: It does not raise taxes or other \nrevenues. It includes enough spending cuts to meet the amount of debt-\nceiling increase, dollar for dollar.\n  These spending cuts are the same as our Republican colleagues have \npreviously voted for and supported.\n  Most importantly, Senator Reid's plan makes tough spending cuts, but \ndoesn't balance our budget on the backs of seniors--it protects vital \nprograms and does not make cuts in benefits to Medicare or Social \nSecurity.\n  Time and time again, Democrats have shown that we are willing to \ncompromise to avert a catastrophic default. Unfortunately, at every \nturn, Republicans in the House--and now in the Senate--have blocked any \nchance for progress, and continue to put us on an increasingly \ndangerous path as the deadline for raising the debt limit approaches.\n  And now, Senate Republicans are willing to filibuster our Nation into \ndefault.\n  Today's filibuster of our efforts to prevent a default is \nunprecedented.\n  Since March 1962, Congress has raised the debt limit 74 times--18 \ntimes under President Reagan alone.\n  During George W. Bush's administration, Congress passed five stand-\nalone debt limit increases, without filibuster or delay.\n  Until today, debt limit increases were routine, usually passed by a \nsimple 51-vote majority, without the procedural hurdles my Republican \ncolleagues are using today.\n  They need to come to the table and work with us to find a compromise \nthat works--for the good of the country and for the good of our \neconomic recovery.\n  So I hope that my Republican colleagues will join us in ensuring \nstability for our markets and for our fragile economic recovery in \norder to avoid harm for millions of Connecticut families--and keep our \neconomy moving in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, there are no easy answers to our current \ndilemma. The majority leader's proposal is the best option we have to \novercome the bipartisan impasse. Failure to increase the debt limit is \nnot an option. Working families cannot afford the increased costs \nassociated with default, and seniors cannot afford not to have their \nSocial Security payments.\n  In my time as a mayor, as a State legislator, as a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, and now as a Senator, I have learned there \nare times when one needs to stand and fight, and there are other times \nwhen one needs to reach a compromise. I am not excited about the \ndecisions we are being forced to make, but I think the majority leader \nhas crafted a proposal that can bring the two parties together and \navoid economic disaster without destroying Medicare, Social Security, \nand other priorities of working families.\n  If you compare that to Speaker Boehner's proposal, that is just more \nof the partisan gamesmanship, and the path we have to take becomes \nclear. So I rise today in favor of the majority leader's plan in the \nhope that reason will prevail on the other side, and that our \nRepublican colleagues will finally agree to help govern and not make \nirrational demands that drive us down the road to default.\n  Having said that, these debt negotiations have left America longing \nfor a better time and a better government, a time when public service \nwas, as Robert Kennedy said, a noble profession, when public servants \nserved the public's interests, when they came together and found common \nground and respected the opinions of those on the other side.\n  My generation has always viewed public service as a noble profession \nand the fight for what we believe is right as a noble cause. But none \nof us should expect to win every battle. None of us should dismiss the \nvalid beliefs of those whose politics we oppose but who have been duly \nelected and sworn in to represent their State or their district.\n  The tea party Republicans in the House seem to have forgotten that we \nlive in a democracy, and in a democracy people hold different views, \ncontrary but equally valid opinions. They approach problems \ndifferently, from a different perspective, a different background, a \ndifferent political view, and have differing views on the best \nsolution.\n  The art of governing is bridging those differences. Governing is \nfinding common ground. Governing is what Ronald Reagan talked about in \nhis autobiography, ``An American Life,''\n\n[[Page S5140]]\n\nwhen he spoke about the importance of political compromise. He \nunderstood that in a representative democracy each of us has a right to \nour opinion but not a right to our own way.\n  President Reagan said:\n\n       When I began entering into the give and take of the \n     legislative bargaining--\n\n  This is in Sacramento. This is when he was Governor--\n\n     a lot of the most radical conservatives who had supported me \n     during the election did not like it.\n       Compromise was a dirty word to them, and they wouldn't face \n     the fact that we couldn't get all of what we wanted today. \n     They wanted all or nothing, and they wanted it all at once. \n     If you don't get it all, some said don't take anything.\n\n  Sound familiar? It should. It is the view of today's radical tea \nparty--the same view Ronald Reagan confronted.\n  Reagan went on to say:\n\n       I learned while negotiating union contracts that you seldom \n     get everything you asked for. And I agreed with FDR, who \n     said, in 1933, ``I have no expectations of making a hit every \n     time I come to bat. What I seek is the highest possible \n     batting average.''\n       If you got seventy-five or eighty percent of what you were \n     asking for, I say, you take it and fight for the rest later, \n     and that's what I told these radical conservatives who never \n     got used to it.\n\n  Ronald Reagan in his own words--a lesson from a conservative hero for \nthose modern-day radical conservatives who have watched us walk 90 \nyards down the field, but would rather move the goal posts than meet us \nat the 10-yard line. Ronald Reagan would tell them to grow up, step up \nand govern. But they have reiterated the mantra of the radical \nconservatives Reagan faced: ``If you don't get it all, don't take \nanything.''\n  Edmund Burke, another conservative icon, once said something today's \nHouse Republicans today would label as ``weakness'' or ``too liberal.'' \nHe said:\n\n       Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing \n     because he could only do a little.\n\n  House Republicans have chosen to do nothing. Edmund Burke understood \nthe art of governing and the art of compromise. Ronald Reagan knew how \nradical conservatives think, how they negotiate, and now we are seeing \nhow they stand in the way of governance and governing to maintain the \npurity of their ideology.\n  Clearly, Democrats have offered much. We have offered the other side \nan opportunity to govern, and they have rejected it on ideological \ngrounds. We have lived up to our duty to govern. They have lived up to \nRonald Reagan's own view of radical conservative tactics and \nphilosophy.\n  I say to my friends, it is time to compromise and time to govern.\n  I was shocked to witness the audacity of the House Republicans who \nstepped to the microphone this week, one by one, each claiming that, if \nthis Nation defaults on its obligations, it will be the President's \nfault. It will be the Democrats who caused us to default.\n  Democrats have come a long way and the Republicans know it--they just \nwon't accept it, and they can't sell it to the American people because \nthe American people know the truth.\n  Everyone knows the House tea party Republicans have rejected every \nproposal. They have even rejected the Republican Speaker's original \nproposal. They claim to love democracy and freedom of speech only when \nit is their speech, only when it expresses their ideas and their \nbeliefs.\n  They claim to love our system of government, but clearly are at war \nwith the idea of governing, and with all those on this side who--I \nwould respectfully remind them--have also been elected to serve, just \nas they have.\n  They claim to embrace constitutional notions of tolerance and \nmajority rule, but clearly see such notions as an inconvenient obstacle \nto getting their own way. They have the audacity to blame us for \noffering them what they want, and then to claim we haven't offered \nenough--that we are the problem.\n  The fact is, with the plan the majority leader has put forth, \nDemocrats are now offering exactly what the Republicans have asked for, \nand yet they still will not take yes for an answer.\n  They even claim that they are willing to compromise as long as it is \nwithin their framework--the framework of their original demands--that \nthey will compromise on the kind of a balanced budget amendment we \npass. They will only compromise on how deep the cuts to entitlements \nare, but they will not compromise on subsidies to big oil companies or \nbillionaire tax cuts that wealthy Americans have, themselves, told us \nthey don't need.\n\n  In effect their only compromise is getting their own way and calling \nit compromise. Well there is a difference between compromise and total \ncapitulation. There must be a common ground that simply doesn't call \nfor surrender. There's an Old Scottish proverb that says: ``Better bend \nthan break.''\n  I say to my colleagues: We have done all the bending. Now it is time \nto govern.\n  I say to my colleagues: ``Better bend than break,'' because in this \ncase it is our economic integrity that stands to break.\n  It is time for the truth.\n  It is time we look at the real impact on real people's lives if \nRepublicans continue to stand firm--unwilling to bend, unwilling to \ncompromise, unwilling to govern--but clearly willing to take America \ndown the road to default.\n  According to Secretary Geithner, the consequences for the Nation--and \nfor millions in my State of New Jersey--would be deep and far-reaching.\n  Failure to raise the debt limit--failure to allow Treasury to meet \nthe obligations of the United States that we have already incurred--\nwould be the ultimate tax increase on every American.\n  As such, surely it would violate the radical right's pledge to Grover \nNorquist. And, make no mistake, it would be a tax increase.\n  The no-compromise-Republican tax-increase would come in the form of \nincreased interest rates--driving up the costs for every American \nfamily: the cost of mortgage payments would increase over $1,000 \nannually; equity prices and home values would decline which, in turn, \nwould reduce retirement savings and affect the long-term and short-term \neconomic security of every American.\n  There would be reductions in spending and investments, jobs would be \nlost, businesses would fail, credit card interest would increase by \nabout $250 annually, families would be paying $100 more for gas, $182 \nfor utilities, and $318 more for groceries.\n  Based on J.P. Morgan's financial analysis during the debt ceiling and \ngovernment shutdown debate in 1995 and the crisis in 2008, interest \nrates on Treasury bonds could conceivably rise 75 or even 100 basis \npoints.\n  Between mortgages and credit cards alone, an increase of 75 basis \npoints would translate into an additional $10 billion in consumer \nborrowing costs every year at a time when middle class families can ill \nafford any increase at all in expenditures.\n  From an international perspective, default would have prolonged and \ndisastrous negative consequences on the safe-haven status of Treasuries \nand the dollar's dominant role in the international financial system.\n  It would reduce the willingness of investors here and abroad to \ninvest in the United States.\n  In my State of New Jersey, the impact of default would be immediate \nand all too real. Payments on a broad range of benefits--on other \nobligations--would be either postponed, limited, or discontinued.\n  That includes military salaries and retirement benefits for 1,219 \ntroops currently deployed from New Jersey, both active and reservists \nand almost 500,000 veterans; benefits for almost 1.5 million Social \nSecurity beneficiaries and 1.3 million Medicare enrollees would be \ninterrupted; student loan payments; Medicaid payments to States for \nseniors and the disabled in nursing homes, and payments needed to keep \ngovernment facilities operating and providing the services people need. \nThe total for all these expenditures for New Jersey alone is $80 \nbillion.\n  That averages out to be about $26,000 per household in my State, \nputting a significant portion of the Federal Government's investment in \nNew Jersey and its people at risk.\n  And yet the Republicans in the House and many in this Chamber will \nnot bend, will not compromise, refuse to step up and govern. Their \nideology demands that they protect entitlements for the most entitled \nAmericans--big\n\n[[Page S5141]]\n\noil, corporate jet owners, and those who hold a majority of the wealth \nin this Nation.\n  In my view, in my life, in my work, I have come to understand how \nwrong they are.\n  When the 400 richest Americans at the top hold more wealth than the \n150 million Americans at the bottom, we cannot simply put the burden on \nthose who can afford it the least and need our help the most.\n  Let's be clear. The Republican protection of the entitled class has \nnothing to do with balancing the budget or reducing the deficit, \nnothing to do with values, nothing to do with faith or cultural \nconservatism, nothing to do with community responsibility, and \neverything to do with an extreme antigovernment political agenda that \nis, in fact, anticommunity.\n  I believe we can do better for families, better for every American if \nwe live and govern by the values we preach.\n  During this process, those of us on this side of the aisle have held \nto what the sociologist Max Weber once called the ``ethic of \nresponsibility.''\n  House Republicans are pursuing what he called the ``ethic of ultimate \nends.''\n  George Packer in a recent New Yorker article said:\n\n       These ethics are tragically opposed, but the true calling \n     of politics requires a union of the two.\n\n  We, on this side, believe in ethical responsibility, in doing what is \nright for the Nation.\n  Republicans have shown that they believe in one thing and one thing \nonly--achieving their ultimate political end and, in this case, \nachieving that end means standing in the way of any compromise--even if \nit threatens to paralyze this Nation's economy, even if it means \nrejecting the wisdom of their own hero who understood the importance of \ncompromise in the art of governance.\n  I repeat what Reagan said:\n\n       Compromise was a dirty word to them, and they wouldn't face \n     the fact that we couldn't get all of what we wanted today. \n     They wanted all or nothing and they wanted it all at once. If \n     you don't get it all, some said don't take anything.\n\n  Well, it is time to realize that governing is not about getting it \nall, it's about getting it right for the American people.\n  Let America understand that Reagan himself stood against those \nradical conservatives whose rigid adherence to ideology at the expense \nof reason is now taking us down the road to default.\n  It is on them, and it is up to them to grow up, step up, and \ncompromise.\n  As the American people have said in every poll, they want a balanced \napproach. That means a combination of significant spending cuts but \nalso revenues. If they accepted that, we could govern.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask to be yielded 10 minutes. I \nunderstand there is no objection on the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, whatever one's position is on the best way \nto cut the deficit, we all should be able to agree on this: We must \nraise the debt ceiling. We must pay our bills. Failing to do so is to \ninvite economic catastrophe. The American people have had their fill of \ncatastrophe and near-catastrophe.\n  Recently in Afghanistan, Admiral Mullen, Chairman of our Joint \nChiefs, was asked by troops if they will be paid next month. His answer \nwas:\n\n       I honestly can't answer that question.\n\n  He added:\n\n       I'd like to give you a better answer than that right now; I \n     just honestly don't know.\n\n  It is inconceivable to me that we will leave our troops in limbo by \ndriving our country over the cliff of default. Our Nation's economic \nlife is in peril. I don't remember ever in the 32 years I have been \nhere when the Nation has been more in need of deliberation, \nstatesmanship, and compromise.\n  New York Times columnist David Brooks, who is a conservative \ncolumnist, recently wrote that too many Republicans seem to have joined \na ``movement''--his word--in which ``the members do not accept the \nlogic of compromise, no matter what the terms.'' I hope that some of \nour Republican colleagues will prove Mr. Brooks wrong on this matter \nbecause of its huge significance.\n  The time for ignoring hard truths is over. Blind resistance to \ncompromise may play well with some, but it is no way to solve hard \nproblems or to govern. Drawing lines in the sand and issuing ultimatums \nmay make for ringing sound bites, but no press release ever sent a \nchild to college or gave a working family hope for a good job.\n  If our Republican colleagues cannot bring themselves to support the \nmajority leader's proposal or at least to propose modifications to it, \nthey can vote ``no.'' But it is unthinkable to filibuster against \nallowing the Senate an opportunity to vote on the Reid measure itself, \nas this clock approaches midnight. It is one thing to vote against the \nReid measure, it is quite another to deny the Senate by filibustering \nthe opportunity to vote on the Reid measure when the issue is of such \nenormous importance.\n  Last evening, and again today, the Republican leader said they would \ninsist on 60 votes to pass the Reid amendment. That is the definition \nof a filibuster threat. It is the very definition. You must have 60 \nvotes. That is based on a threat to filibuster. Hopefully, some of our \nRepublican colleagues will support Senator Reid's proposal. It has no \nnew revenue. Its spending cuts match the size of the debt limit \nincrease. Its cuts have been approved by leaders of both parties. But \nif our Republican colleagues don't seek to modify the Reid plan and \nwon't vote for the plan, they at least should allow the Senate to vote \non it and not filibuster. Whether Senators vote for or against the Reid \nlegislation, the American people will not forgive a filibuster that \nprevents us from even voting on vital legislation as we rapidly \napproach a cliff. In the critically important matter now before us, \nthere is going to be a very strong public reaction against those who, \nwith economic calamity looming before us, deny the Senate, through a \nthreat of a filibuster and the filibuster itself, an opportunity to \nvote on the Reid motion to concur.\n\n  Compromise does not come easy with an issue such as this, but the \npeople of this country did not elect us to do easy things. They elected \nus to seek practical solutions. They elected us to lead. The test of \nleadership in the Senate on the matter before us is allowing us to vote \nnot just on cloture, which is what the Republican leader suggests is a \nvote on the Reid motion--it is not--but on the Reid motion itself. The \ntest of leadership in this Senate is not to filibuster the Senate so we \ncan't vote on the important Reid motion but to allow us to proceed when \nthat cloture motion is voted on.\n  So I call on Senate Republicans to offer changes to the Reid proposal \nor vote against it, if they will, but not thwart the Senate majority \nfrom voting to adopt it, should they choose. When the cloture motion is \nvoted on, if cloture is not invoked, and the Senate is prevented from \nvoting up or down on the Reid proposal, under our rules, debate on the \nReid proposal will continue.\n  I want to read from the petition we are going to vote on so everybody \nunderstands what we are voting on. We are not voting on the Reid motion \nto concur. We are voting on whether--and these are the words of the \nmotion--we will bring to a close the debate on that motion; will we \nbring to a close the debate so we can vote on the Reid motion to concur \nin the House amendment.\n  So voting against bringing debate to a close, thereby denying the \nmajority the opportunity to act, does not defeat the majority leader's \nmotion. It stalls it. It stymies the Senate from acting. If an end is \nnot brought to debate when this cloture motion is voted on, the Reid \nmotion is still the pending matter.\n  If the Republicans, then, are determined to filibuster against it and \nnot allow us to vote on it, they, I believe, will see the wrath of this \ncountry brought down upon them.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to make sure the people listening to the Senator--\nbecause he is such an expert on what goes on around here--understand \nthis and make sure I understand it too.\n  The Senator is saying that when 1 a.m. this morning comes, we will \nhave\n\n[[Page S5142]]\n\na vote to determine whether we can stop debating the Reid amendment and \nactually vote on it. But if we don't get the 60 votes to do that, what \nwill have happened is they will have stalled us, but the Reid amendment \nis still pending. We can't get a vote on that if the Republicans \nfilibuster it and keep talking and talking and don't let us get to a \nvote; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from California is exactly correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague because I think it is important for \nthe people to understand. I would hope Senator Reid will keep his \namendment on the floor. It is the last vehicle standing to avert a \ndefault, and I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from California for reinforcing that \npoint.\n  I heard one of our colleagues tonight say the Republicans are willing \nto give us a vote on this bill. No, they are not. The Republicans are \nwilling to have a cloture vote brought up earlier. They then will vote \nagainst cloture. But that will do nothing in terms of bringing us \ncloser to a vote on the Reid amendment because if they will not end \ndebate by voting yes for cloture, if they are going to filibuster--\nwhich, apparently, they are going to do because they are determined to \nfilibuster this bill--all that happens, if we don't get the 60 votes \nthe first time that cloture is voted on, is it will be voted on again \nand again because they are filibustering. The Republicans would then be \nfilibustering against our being able to vote on this bill.\n  Everyone should be very clear. I hope the public will understand what \nis happening. The Republicans are not willing to give us a vote on the \nReid motion. They are not willing to do that. We would be happy to have \na vote on the Reid motion immediately, but they insist that we get a \nsupermajority to vote. They want to succeed in a filibuster without \neven filibustering. That is something which is not only not in the \nSenate rules, it is also inconsistent with making progress on resolving \nthis problem.\n  The American people want us to compromise, and the refusal to \ncompromise by a few Members of this body and by a number of Members of \nthe other body is what is stymying this resolution. We cannot tolerate \nthat. I think what we must do is continue to offer to compromise.\n  The majority leader is in his office, as he has been all day, waiting \nto hear from the Republican leader with any suggestions he wishes to \nmake and amendments to the majority leader's motion. It has been a long \nwait. It has been a fruitless wait--waiting for the Republican leader \nto suggest modifications.\n  It is not enough that the Reid motion already accepts the Republican \narguments of no revenue and that cuts have to equal the amount of the \nincrease in the debt limit. Those are key demands of the Republicans.\n  I have a great deal of trouble not including revenues. I think it is \nan outrage there is not shared sacrifice in this bill; that the \nwealthiest among us are still paying the reduced tax rate, for \ninstance, that President Bush proposed; that we have loopholes in the \nlaw which give incentives to businesses to move jobs overseas; that we \nhave hedge fund managers actually paying a lower tax rate on their very \nlarge incomes than their own employees pay on lesser incomes because of \na loophole in the law.\n  The American people want us to close these loopholes. So I have great \ntrouble there is no shared sacrifice in the proposal before us, but \nthat is the way it is. It only has spending cuts. So the Republicans \nhave gotten that--only spending cuts. They have gotten their argument \nalso that the amount of any increase in the debt limit be matched by \nspending cuts. It is now time to say yes or to propose an alternative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think it has become very clear that \nour Democratic colleagues want to raise taxes. They use the phrase \nrevenues--revenues--and we need a shared sacrifice. That means people \nneed to pay more taxes, as if that doesn't have an impact on the \neconomy.\n  We have had a recent study by one of the international groups which \nfound the United States has the most progressive tax system in the \nworld--among the developed nations. This is all the European nations. \nThe wealthy pay more in the United States than in those countries, \naccording to an independent, international study. We have heard the \nnumbers. A substantial percentage of the income taxes are paid by the \ntop 10 percent in America. How much more do you do this?\n  I thought we had an agreement last December with the President in \nwhich we agreed that raising taxes at a time of economic danger is not \nthe right thing to do. Not doing something to fix this debt limit now \nis not a good thing. We need to raise the debt limit. I don't know what \nwould happen if we don't. I don't think it would be good. I think we \nrun a risk. But the real danger we have is not the debt limit; the real \ndanger we have is the extraordinary surging debt this Nation has, which \nis unlike anything we have ever had before.\n  It is systemic. It is part of the structure of the American economy \nright now that we are spending 42 percent more than we take in. We \ncannot keep doing that. The projections for the future are not better. \nSo it is a very dangerous trend, and we have to get off of it.\n  We had a talk about that in the last election. The American people \nwere engaged in that. They weren't happy with their Congress. They \ndidn't think Congress was managing their affairs very well. They \nbelieved they weren't listening to them when they were asking questions \nsuch as: How can you keep doing this? You are putting our grandchildren \nin the poorhouse. You are risking the economy of the United States. All \nyou want to do is spend money, buy votes, and say you are spreading the \nwealth around and that is going to make things better.\n  So we had an election, and it was a shellacking for the big spenders. \nWasn't that what it was all about? Was there a single candidate I know \nof who won last time--at least a new candidate who was elected for the \nfirst time--who didn't talk about the need to constrain spending in \nWashington? That was the theme throughout the election. That was the \nmeaning of the election.\n  So now my colleagues are saying: Oh, we can't. Oh, you want to cut \nspending? Oh, they say, they have these extremists in the House. Oh, \nthey do not want to play ball. They haven't served in the Congress long \nenough. They do not know better. They think we can actually cut \nspending. Of course, we can't cut spending. Oh, that is not the way you \ndo it. No, you just reduce growth a little bit and spending and say you \nare cutting spending, even though it is still going up. That is what \nhas been going on here. That is why we are increasing the debt at the \nmost extraordinary rate and over a systemic period of time to the \ndegree that every economist who has appeared before the Budget \nCommittee--and I am the ranking Republican on that committee--has \ntestified that we have to stop; that this is unsustainable--\nunsustainable. They have said: You cannot keep doing this.\n  Do you know, colleagues, that in the last 2 years, when the \nDemocratic majority in this Senate had 60 votes, that spending for \nnondefense discretionary spending, not counting the stimulus, just the \nbasic budgetary spending on all our accounts--nonwar, nondefense, \nnonSocial Security--went up 24 percent? This at a time when we are \nrunning the biggest deficits in history; 24 percent increases? We can't \ncut spending?\n  There was an article in the Washington Times yesterday or the day \nbefore where my colleague, Senator Shelby from Alabama, asked the \nSecretary of Education how he could explain that the Secretary of \nEducation and the President were proposing the Department of Education \nget a 13\\1/2\\-percent increase for the next fiscal year, beginning \nOctober 1--13\\1/2\\ percent. But he defended that. He said it was \njustified; that it was an investment.\n  But when you don't have money, you have to change business. You can't \ncontinue to be in denial and pretend this is normal; that we can just \ncontinue to increase the Education Department by 13.5 percent.\n  By the way, the Department of Energy, the President, and their \nSecretary of Defense proposes a 9.5-percent increase for the Department \nof Energy,\n\n[[Page S5143]]\n\nwhich does more to restrict the production of energy than produce the \nsource of energy in America; the Department of State, 10.5 percent. I \nam talking about their proposal for next year, beginning October 1 of \nthis year, the fiscal year. Sixty percent they propose for \ntransportation, and they propose a tax for that but will not say what \nit is. When I asked, they will not say it is a gas tax because that is \nnot popular.\n  So I asked Secretary LaHood. So it is a not-gas-tax tax. Is that \nright, Mr. Secretary? Well, we will talk with Congress about what that \ntax is. But I can just tell you, Mr. LaHood, Congress is not going to \npass a big fat tax so you can increase spending on your budget 60 \npercent because we don't have that kind of money. We don't need to be \nhammering this fragile economy with another big tax increase. Besides, \nwhat we need to do first and foremost is rein in this surging spending \nspree we have been on. That is what we need to do. That is just a fact. \nThat is what the American people understand.\n  I am offended, frankly, by the suggestion that the people in the \nHouse, who swept out a lot of the buddies of the big spenders in the \nSenate--a lot of the big spenders in the House are back home \nfiguratively pushing up daisies because they were held to account, \nfinally, many of them, after many years in the Congress. They were \nvoted out of office. So the people who beat them are extremists, you \nsee. That is what they like to say: They will not negotiate. They will \nnot deal. They are irresponsible. They actually think they can come up \nhere and change the trajectory of debt in this country.\n  So they passed a budget in the House of Representatives. A brilliant, \nfine, young Congressman, Paul Ryan, chairman of the Budget Committee in \nthe House, the Republican majority in the House passed a budget that \ncut spending $5 trillion, and it would change the debt trajectory of \nAmerica. It didn't quite pass, even at 10 years that I would like to \nhave seen, but we are in such a hole it is hard to get out, and it \nwould have made a big change in the way we are going and put us on the \nright path.\n  Senator Reid called it up, mocked it, had his members all vote \nagainst it.\n  So we said: What about your budget, Mr. Reid?\n  Well, we don't have one.\n  Well, what about your budget? You have the majority in the Senate. \nYou can pass a budget with just 50 votes. Why don't you pass a budget?\n  It is foolish to pass a budget, he said. Foolish to pass a budget.\n  At a time when this country has never, ever, ever been in a more \nserious financial condition than we are today, we are borrowing 42 \ncents out of every dollar we spend. That is a deep hole, and it is not \nthe war. We spent $150 billion-plus on the war this year. Next year it \nwill be $118 billion. The deficit this year will be $1,500 billion. It \nis about 10 percent.\n  If we put every bit of the war costs as part of our debt, it is only \n10 percent. It is other spending that is putting us in this hole.\n  We do have long-term problems with our entitlement programs. \nShouldn't we talk about them or should we do as the President did: \nbring Congressman Ryan over to the White House for a speech, sit him \nright down there in front of him and then launch into an attack on what \nhe and his Members of the House have tried to do to make America a \nbetter place.\n  So they say: Those new guys and women over there who were elected, \nthey are not reasonable enough. They will not work with us. Well, let \nme tell you. They proposed a $6 trillion reduction. Even that didn't \nbalance it in 10 years, but it sure was a big step forward.\n  Do you know what they have done now. The House passed a bill at the \ninsistence of the Senate and the President to try to pass a bill--and \nthey passed it--that would raise the debt ceiling and cut spending only \n$1 trillion. Is that an extremist thing to do? They sent it over here, \nmuch of it very similar to what Senator Reid has proposed, and they \ncalled it up within minutes and tabled it--without debate, without \ndiscussion.\n  Then they continued to say, as if nothing happened: These are \nextremists over there. They won't listen to reason. These tea party \npeople are not good for America.\n  Well, I am going to tell you one thing. The tea party people \nunderstand an important fact. This Congress is spending too much money. \nThey are exactly correct in that regard.\n  No Member of the United States Congress can, with a clear conscience, \nlook their constituents in the eye and say we have managed their money \nwisely. We are in such a shape we can't even see when we will balance \nthe budget because we have mismanaged their economy so badly. The only \nidea that anybody seems to have around here is, spend more money and \nstimulate the economy. If we spend more money, where does it come from? \nIt is borrowed. We are already in debt, and every new dime we spend is \nborrowed.\n  There is only one way to move out of this; that is, to reduce \nspending. It just is. The American people understand that.\n  I recently had the honor to be in Estonia near Russia, one of the \nBaltic nations that is so proud to be free and independent. When the \nrecession hit, they suffered more than we. They had a 15-percent \nreduction in their economy. Do you know what they did. The Cabinet \nmembers took a 40-percent pay cut. Every employee in Estonia took a 10- \nto 20-percent pay cut.\n  One of the members told me: I will tell you who is really mad is my \nwife. She is a doctor, and the medical system got cut.\n  Do you know what. They had 5 percent growth the first quarter, and \ntheir debt-to-GDP is 7 percent. Our debt-to-GDP is 95 percent. They are \ngoing to come out of this, and they are not going to have a debt so \nheavy that it pulls down the economy.\n  Mr. President, I don't know what the agreement timewise is at this \npoint. Can the Chair advise me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I see my colleague from California, and I will yield. I \nwould just note that the idea that the Republicans don't want to vote \nis not correct. We are prepared to vote. We are prepared to vote on the \nstandard procedural manner in the Senate of 60 votes that is done on \nevery significant matter around here, and that is perfectly normal. I \nam rather amazed, surprised, and almost amused that my colleagues would \nfeign such great pain and anguish that this would occur. They would do \nexactly the same. That is the way the Senate operates. That is the way \nthey have operated when they were in the minority, and that is the way \nwe operate today. On matters of significance it takes 60 votes.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak and \nraise some political points. We have been jousting politically, some of \nwhich is good and some of which is not. I do say we need to reach an \nagreement soon and pass legislation that will raise the debt limit and \nwill reduce our spending trajectory so we can get this country on a \nsound path.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my friend, Senator Sessions, has said \nRepublicans are prepared to vote on the Reid proposal. Actually, they \nare not. They want to vote on whether to allow a vote on the Reid \nproposal. That is what a cloture vote is, and they don't want to vote \non the Reid proposal.\n  We have offered that and said that a majority should rule. Just as \nthe Boehner proposal passed in the House with a simple majority, we \nwant a chance to pass the Reid proposal with a simple majority.\n  My friend says that is laughable. Why is it laughable? We went back \nand looked at the Record, and every vote we could find on increasing \nthe debt was always done by a simple majority--always.\n  So if we want to follow tradition, cut out the filibuster. Let's \nvote, and we will pass the Reid proposal tonight and we can find a way \nto resolve these problems.\n  My colleague also said Democrats want to raise taxes. Let me just say \nsomething. Democrats want to reduce taxes on the middle class. But we \ndo believe multinational corporations, people who earn over $1 billion \na year and $1 million a year should pay their fair share. We do believe \nthat.\n  Senator Sanders researched and found out that the richest 400 \nfamilies\n\n[[Page S5144]]\n\nin America make more than one-half of America. Can you imagine? The \nrichest 400 families make more than half of America. So those at the \ntop are doing just fine.\n  So let's be clear. We want an up-or-down vote on the Reid amendment. \nWe think it is fair. We think it is just. We march toward the \nRepublicans. We didn't want to give up on revenues, but we did. We \nwanted a clean debt ceiling, not holding it hostage to any \nmachinations. We gave that up. We are willing to talk. We are willing \nto work. Senator Reid's office--I was just in there. The door is wide \nopen waiting for Republicans to come in and work with us.\n  So we hoped at this point we would have an agreement and we could \nclimb down off this manmade crisis. There is no crisis. Eighty-nine \ntimes we have raised the debt; no crisis whatsoever. I think it is \nimportant that we recognize this is no crisis. We have a challenge to \nreduce deficits and debt. We did it with Bill Clinton, we balanced the \nbudget, we created surpluses. We know how to do it. We will work with \nyou and do it. But we don't need a manmade crisis to pull this entire \neconomy down, to lower the full faith and credit of the United States.\n  Imagine holding the full faith and credit of the United States \nhostage until you get every single thing you want. That is not \ncompromise. That is absolutely irresponsible.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank you for your leadership in pointing \nout what is happening on the Senate floor; that there is a filibuster \nto stop us from voting on the Reid amendment and that we are not going \nto give up. If, in fact, they decide they want to continue to debate \nthe Reid amendment and they don't give us 60 votes to go to a vote on \nthe Reid amendment, we are going to keep going because the Reid \namendment is a fair amendment. It was pulled from both sides of the \naisle. It will get us out of this mess that we are in and get us \nconcentrating on the long-term challenges we face: job creation, \ndeficits, and debt reduction.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate everyone's \npatience. It is one of the most difficult times we find in the history \nof our country. There are negotiations going on at the White House now \non a solution that will avert the catastrophic default on the Nation's \ndebt. There are many elements to be finalized, and there is still a \ndistance to go before any arrangement can be completed, but I believe \nwe should give everyone as much room as possible to do their work. I \nhave spoken to the White House quite a few times this evening, and they \nhave asked me to give everyone as much time as possible to reach an \nagreement if one can be reached. For that reason, we will hold over the \nvote until tomorrow to give them more time to talk. In fact, we will \ncome in at noon and have the vote at 1 o'clock.\n  I am glad to see this move toward cooperation and compromise. I hope \nit bears fruit. I am confident that a final agreement that will adopt \nthe Senate's long-term approach, rather than the short-term bandaid \nproposed by the House of Representatives, will move forward. There can \nbe no short-term agreement, and I am optimistic there will be no short-\nterm arrangement whatsoever.\n  I am also confident that reasonable people from both parties should \nbe able to reach an agreement, and I believe we should give them time \nto do so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on the \nReid motion to concur in the House amendment to S. 627, with amendment \nNo. 589, occur tomorrow, Sunday, July 31, at 1 p.m.; further, that the \nmandatory quorum call under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/30/senate-section/article/S5144-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THANKING SENATOR LEVIN\n\n  Mr. REID.
