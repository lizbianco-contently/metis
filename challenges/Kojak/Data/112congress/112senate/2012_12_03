Mr. President, before I came to Congress I was a lawyer. I \ntried lots of cases, more than 100 cases to juries. My greatest \nvictories, though, weren't the cases that we spent in a courtroom and \nworked on in a courtroom. My greatest victories were the cases that \nnever saw the inside of a courtroom.\n  As English poet George Herbert said, ``A lean compromise is better \nthan a fat lawsuit,'' and that is true. It is always better to settle \nthan to fight. I have done my fair share over the years of negotiating, \nboth as a lawyer and as a Senator and as a Member of the House. I have \na bit of negotiating advice for Republican leaders: You are doing it \nwrong. Generally during a negotiation, each side brings an offer or \ndemand to the table. That is how it has always worked. Then the two \nsides sit down and find middle ground. It is not always easy and it is \nrarely fun. True compromise means no one gets everything they want, but \nunless both sides come to the negotiating table with an offer, you \ncan't even begin the negotiation. In fact, unless both sides come to \nthe table with an offer, there is no negotiation.\n  Over the last week, Republican leaders from both Chambers have \ncomplained that Democrats put forward a proposal for resolving the \nfiscal cliff that reflected our priorities--our priorities. What did \nthey expect?\n  Our proposal is simple. We want to end unnecessary tax breaks for the \nrichest of the rich and provide security for everyone making less than \n$250,000 a year. No one should be surprised at President Obama's offer. \nIt is exactly what he has said he supports time and time again. For \nmonths now, it is what I have said I support. I have said it time and \ntime again. It is what Democratic Senators campaigned on across the \ncountry this election cycle. This plan would protect 98 percent of \nAmerican families and 97 percent of small\n\n[[Page S7312]]\n\nbusinesses from tax increases. It also passed the Senate 4 months ago, \nand it has the support of the American people. The vast majority of \nAmericans--Independents, Democrats, and even more than 40 percent of \nRepublicans--supports this.\n  I wish I could share with you the details of the Republicans' \nanswering proposal, but there hasn't been one. They haven't produced a \nsingle proposal.\n  We are not doing their homework for them. It is the Republicans' \nresponsibility to respond with a counteroffer--not a hint dropped \nduring, perhaps, an interview with the Washington Post, the New York \nTimes or even the Wall Street Journal or a Sunday talk show but a real \nmodified offer. President Obama has told Republicans and the world \nwhere he stands. The sooner the Republicans make a legitimate offer, \nthe sooner we can all start working to find middle ground.\n  So let me remind my Republican colleagues that as we work toward a \nfinal agreement, millions of middle-class families are nervously \nwatching and waiting. For 4 months Republicans have held them hostage \nto protect the richest 2 percent of taxpayers. Reasonable rank-and-file \nRepublicans are urging their leadership to stop delaying Senate-passed \nlegislation that would give millions of middle-class families making \nless than $250,000 the certainty that their taxes won't go up by about \n$2,200 on January 1.\n  It will be hard for Speaker Boehner to pass our bill--no, it wouldn't \nbe hard at all; it would be so easy. Every Democrat in the House will \nvote for it--every Democrat in the House. To reach 218 votes, which is \nhalf plus 1 in the House, it takes only 26 reasonable Republicans \nwilling to put the needs of the middle-class demands ahead of Grover \nNorquist. That is so simple.\n\n  So when my friend, the Speaker, says he can't pass it, that is simply \nwithout foundation or fact, and it is not true.\n  As my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Missouri, Claire \nMcCaskill, said on a Sunday talk show yesterday, John Boehner has a \ndecision to make. This is what she said: ``He's got to decide, is his \nspeakership more important or is the country more important.'' That is \na pretty easy question to answer for everyone. It should be an easy \nquestion to answer for Speaker Boehner.\n  As we continue to hope for a balanced agreement that will safeguard \nthe economy, I hope Speaker Boehner ends the suspense for millions of \nAmerican families and does it soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/03/senate-section/article/S7312-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 3254, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3254) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2013 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Kyl modified amendment No. 3123, to require briefings on \n     dialogue between the United States and the Russian Federation \n     on nuclear arms, missile defense, and long-range conventional \n     strike systems.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank the majority leader \nwhile he is still here on the floor for the support he has given to \nSenator McCain and myself and all of us who are working so hard to get \na Defense authorization bill passed for the 52nd straight time, I \nbelieve. We haven't missed a year in 51, and I think this will be the \n51st and 52nd.\n  I want to thank Senator McCain and his staff and all of my staff for \nthe extraordinarily hard work they have put in on the bill, both in \ncommittee and here on the floor. I thank all of my colleagues for the \ncooperation which has been shown to allow us to dispose of somewhere \nnow in the area of 100 amendments.\n  There will be even more amendments that can be cleared this \nafternoon. We, I believe, have a package that is ready, or almost \nready, of amendments. I believe that after that, this afternoon there \ncould be a second package of amendments which has been cleared for \naction by the body.\n  We will be here this afternoon. I haven't had a chance to talk yet \nwith Senator McCain today, but I am sure it is his plan, as it is mine, \nto be here with our staffs this afternoon to work with colleagues to \nsee if we can't clear additional amendments.\n  The cloture vote is scheduled. There has been more than adequate \ntime. I want to thank the leader, again, for giving this time. We are \nnow into our fourth day where we are able to address the issues on this \nbill.\n  I hope cloture will pass this afternoon when the vote is taken, and \nthat early tomorrow, since I am hopeful there won't be a need for \npostcloture time, we can perhaps adopt even a third package of cleared \namendments tomorrow morning at some point, and then move to final \npassage at some time as determined by the leader, of course.\n  I want to again urge colleagues who have amendments that we have been \nworking on to keep working with our staffs so we can hopefully clear as \nmany amendments as possible prior to cloture. I think that would be \nbeneficial to all of us. We have worked together well as a body.\n  There have been a number of accommodations which have been made by \nmany of our colleagues to each other and to us as managers which has \nmade it possible for us to have a smooth passage at least until this \npoint.\n  With that, again, I give thanks to my ranking member.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to thank Senator Levin and also the majority \nleader for giving us this time. Also I am in agreement that the time \nhas come for cloture to be invoked, unfortunately. The total time of \ndebate for this bill up to now has been 27 hours of debate and 371 \namendments have been filed. We have disposed of 94 amendments, some by \nvoice vote, some by rollcall vote.\n  Of those amendments, many of them were offered by members of the \ncommittee, but a majority of them were offered by nonmembers of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. So I think we have had a very \ninclusive and interesting debate and voting.\n  I tell my friend Senator Levin, I have just been informed that the \nSenator from Kentucky has objected, voiced an objection to taking up \nany further unanimous consent agreements or votes. That means that \nthere will be many amendments which have been approved by both sides \nwhich will now not be allowed to be offered or acted upon. It also \nmeans that if cloture is invoked, and I anticipate that cloture will be \ninvoked--I understand that will be the second vote we have today--a \nnumber of those amendments that are nongermane, which we have cleared \nand would have been passed, will now be put aside.\n  I will have a reading of a number of those amendments. There are 15 \nto 16 amendments that we would be ready shortly to approve. I am not \nexactly sure how many of them are nongermane in nature, which will fall \nwhen cloture is invoked.\n  All I can say to my friend the chairman is that, again, I find it \ndisappointing that one Member of the Senate feels his particular agenda \nis so important that it affects the lives, the readiness, and the \ncapabilities of the men and women who are serving in the military and \nour ability to defend this Nation. I think it is hard to answer to the \nmen and women in the military with this kind of behavior, but I will \nleave that up to the Senator from Kentucky to do so.\n  In the meantime, I guess postcloture, we will continue with the \nlegislation and try to get it completed. I have some guarded optimism \nthat we may be able to do so.\n  Mr. Chairman, I again apologize for what seems to have happened. Much \nto my dismay, it lends some credence to the argument that maybe we \nought not to do business the way we are doing here in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S7313]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first of all, let me tell my dear friend \nfrom Arizona that I am sorry to hear about that objection that \napparently is going to be placed against the unanimous consent \nagreement to adopt amendments which had been cleared by both sides. But \nperhaps during the afternoon we could hear from the Senator from \nKentucky. Perhaps he can come over and talk to us about what the \nproblem is. But in the meantime, we are going to continue to try to \nline up cleared amendments in the chance he will relent from his \nposition.\n  Sometimes with these packages, when they are put together and someone \nsays they object at the last minute, that objection can be addressed in \nsome way or another. So I hope our staffs will continue to try to find \nways to clear amendments--subject, of course, to there being an \nobjection. If there is an objection, then that, of course, given the \nfact that we are late in the day here now and having a cloture vote \nlate this afternoon, would be able to thwart the will of the rest of \nthe body.\n  But I hope the Senator from Kentucky can personally come over and let \nus know what the problem is. Perhaps my friend from Arizona knows what \nit is, but I don't. I would like to get involved in it.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In the meantime, I would ask my friend if he agrees that \ncolleagues with amendments they would like to debate or wish to come \nand talk about them--we are certainly open to that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The floor is open.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will proceed under my leader time.\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             Rules Changes\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have been discussing the plans of \nthe Democratic majority to repudiate its clear commitment to respect \nthe rights of the minority, which is a hallmark of the Senate, and \ninstead to break the rules to change the rules. That is how my friend \nfrom Nevada repeatedly described it when Republicans were considering \ndoing something similar several years ago. Of course, Republicans never \ndid break the rules to change the rules, but Democrats are \ncontemplating doing so in the name of ``efficiency.''\n  Last week I noted how my Democratic colleagues seek to minimize this \nmajor change in how the Senate governs itself by calling this \nheavyhanded power play ``tiny'' and a ``minor change'' and adjusting \nthe Senate rules just ``a little bit.'' But this eleventh-hour rhetoric \nstands in stark contrast to what they have previously said and what \nthey have systematically done.\n  My friend the majority leader told one of my new Members, in essence, \nthat even if this new so-called ``tiny'' rules change removed all \nchance that this new Member would have any recourse to get an amendment \nto a bill, that new Member could simply ``vote against the bill.'' And \nmy friend told Senator McCain this fall that ``the amendment days are \nover'' in the Senate. That was the majority leader to Senator McCain \nearlier this year.\n  But, of course, it is much more than what has been said that is at \nissue, it is what the Democratic leadership has systematically done to \nmarginalize the voice of the minority. As I noted, it has used, to an \nunprecedented extent, Senate rule XIV. This rule allows the majority to \nbypass committees and write bills behind closed doors--doing so, of \ncourse, to deprive all of us, Republicans and Democrats, of the chance \nto have their committee work matter.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the majority has \nused this rule to bypass committees nearly 70 times. When Republicans \nwere last in the majority under Senator Frist, we used that rule less \nthan half as often--only 30 times. And when a bill that has bypassed \ncommittee goes straight to the floor, under the current majority there \noften isn't an opportunity to participate there either. Again, \naccording to the Congressional Research Service, the current Democratic \nleadership has blocked Senators from both sides of the aisle from \noffering amendments on the floor 68 times--68 times. No amendments at \nall. This is 70 percent greater than the number of times the six prior \nmajority leaders combined--combined--shut their colleagues out of the \namendment process.\n  Now, the majority leader dismissed this unprecedented practice, \nsaying it ``has no bearing on what is going on around here.'' Well, \nmaybe it doesn't to him, but he is the only one who, under this \nunprecedented amendment blockage, is picking amendments. It is a little \nbit bigger deal to the other 99 of us who are shut out from \nrepresenting our constituents by having our ability to offer any \namendments on their behalf blocked.\n  By the way, that is not how the majority leader viewed this practice \nwhen he was in the minority. When Senator Frist, as majority leader, \nblocked his colleagues from offering amendments a relatively modest 15 \ntimes in 4 years--15 times in 4 years--my friend from Nevada said it \nwas ``a bad way to run the Senate'' and a ``very bad practice'' and it \nran ``against the basic nature of the Senate.'' That is when Senator \nFrist did it 15 times over 4 years. This majority leader has done it \nnearly 70 times in his tenure. What would be a fair way to describe \nthat record?\n  But the current Democratic leadership hasn't been content to stop \nthere in marginalizing the minority. They have prevented the minority \nfrom offering amendments in committee, they have prevented them from \noffering amendments on the floor before cloture, and then they changed \nSenate procedure with a heavyhanded majoritarian motion to stop the \nminority from offering motions after cloture was invoked. Since such \nmotions to suspend the rules require 67 votes to be successful, I \ngather that having even to deal with such motions interfered with \n``efficiency,'' as did allowing bills to be marked up in committee, as \ndid allowing Senators of both parties to have amendments on the floor. \nSo our Democratic colleagues have shut out the minority there too.\n  But even that is not enough. Now the same Democratic leadership wants \nto take away the right to extend a debate on motions to proceed to a \nmeasure. Throughout its history, the unique role of the Senate has been \nto protect the voice of the minority, expressed through the equal \nrights of all Senators to debate and amend legislation. This has stood \nin contrast with the House of Representatives, where a simple majority \nrules. So it should be startling--literally startling--to every Senator \nand to the people who elected us to represent them to look at the \nfacts.\n\n  How does the Senate compare with the House of Representatives? This \nis something we have not discussed before in this debate. How does the \nSenate compare with the House of Representatives? At the same time the \ncurrent Senate majority is finding every way it can to marginalize the \nminority, the majority in the House is moving in the opposite \ndirection--in exactly the opposite direction.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported last year that the majority in the \nHouse was ``giving lawmakers more opportunity to amend bills on the \nfloor'' and that ``even some Democrats acknowledged that the GOP \nleaders have done a better job than their predecessors.'' According to \nthe article, last year the House held more votes on amendments on the \nfloor than the two previous years combined when congressional Democrats \nwere in the majority. How does that compare to the Senate? According to \nthe Congressional Research Service, this year the majority in the House \nhas given the minority in the House 214 occasions to affect legislation \non the House floor through amendments and motions to commit or \nrecommit. That is what they have done in the House this year. By \ncontrast, the majority in the Senate has only allowed the minority in \nthe Senate 67 occasions to affect legislation on the Senate floor in \nthe same way.\n  So listen to this, Mr. President. This is astonishing. The minority \nin the House has had more than three times\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\nthe opportunity to express its views and to represent its constituents \nthan the minority in the Senate. The minority in the House has had more \nthan three times as many opportunities to record its views than the \nminority in the Senate. It appears that in terms of respect for \nminority rights and the constituents the minority represents, the House \nis becoming more like the Senate and, unfortunately, the Senate is \nbecoming more like the House.\n  Now, it doesn't have to be this way in the Senate, of course. \nSenators Levin and McCain are reminding those of us who have been here \na while and showing those who haven't that it is possible for the \nSenate to actually legislate. We are in the process of doing that right \nnow.\n  Despite the fact that the Senate has devoted much less floor time to \nthe Defense authorization bill than is historically the practice and \nmany fewer amendments than are historically the practice, the majority \nis allowing amendments to receive votes and the minority, for our part, \nis not insisting that we get to vote on every single amendment we want. \nWe need to get back to conducting business that way again, and the \nmajority leader and I need to discuss how to achieve that.\n  But what the Democratic majority must not do is change the Senate by \nusing a bare majority to ram through a rules change as if this were the \nHouse. Such a rules change will not do them any good in the short \nterm--the House is in the hands of the Republicans. But it will do the \ninstitution irreparable damage in the long term and will establish \nprecedent in the Senate for breaking the rules to change the rules that \nour Democratic colleagues will have to endure when they are in the \nminority again, which will certainly happen.\n  We should work together, instead, to resolve our differences. As I \nsaid last week, that is what the Standing Rules of the Senate \nanticipate and that has been how changes to the Senate rules have \noccurred in our history.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Chair please let me know when 5 minutes \nremains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Certainly.

Mr. President, I want to speak this afternoon about \nthe Senate as an institution; about its majority leader, Senator Reid, \nwho is my friend; about various conversations we have been having in \nthe Senate and discussions about what the majority leader has said \nabout how the Senate should operate. I know the majority leader cares \nabout this institution. I believe it. He has said it. He shows it. He \nhas one of the most difficult jobs anybody could possibly have.\n  One time he told me: My job is to make everybody mad. In many ways it \nis, when you have a body of 100 that operates by unanimous consent and \nevery one of us is equal. It is a very difficult job to be the minority \nleader, which the Republican leader is today. It is a more difficult \njob to be the majority leader.\n  I emphasize this because I know Senator Reid cares about this \ninstitution, and I know Senator Reid does not want to go down in \nhistory as the man who ended the Senate. But if he persists in doing \nwhat he says he will do--which is to break the rules of the Senate to \nchange the filibuster rules--that will be his legacy. He will go down \nin history as the Senator who ended the Senate.\n  You might say: Senator Alexander, that is a very serious charge to \nmake about a majority leader whom you know and respect and who you just \nsaid cares about this institution. It is a serious charge to make. The \nonly reason I would say it is because Senator Reid said it himself.\n  Shortly after I came to the Senate, in 2005, we Republicans, \nincluding this Senator, were very upset about what we believed were \nunfair efforts by Democrats to keep President Bush from securing an up-\nor-down vote on his judicial nominees. We were in the majority, we \nRepublicans. We had a Republican President of the United States. We \nbelieved that attacks on the President's nominees were extraordinarily \nunfair, and the other side was using the rules of the Senate to prevent \nan up-or-down vote. They were filibustering President Bush's nominees.\n  We could not change their minds, so a number of Senators persuaded \nSenator Frist, my colleague from Tennessee who was then the majority \nleader, that we should then change the filibuster rules in order to get \nan up-or-down vote on the judges. We knew our goal was right, so we \nwere going to, if we had to, break the rules to change the rules.\n  As you might guess, the minority, the Democrats at the time, erupted \nin indignation. They said this has not been done in the 240 or 250 \nyears of the Senate. They pointed out the differences between the \nSenate and the House of Representatives. Almost every distinguished \nMember of the Democratic side of the Senate--the majority leader; \nSenator Biden, now the Vice President of the United States; Senator \nObama, now the President of the United States; Senator Clinton, now the \nSecretary of State of the United States--denounced this evil Republican \nplan to change the rules of the Senate, to in effect break the rules of \nthe Senate--because the rule says we can only change the rules with 67 \nvotes--in order to change the filibuster rule.\n  Here is what the majority leader said in his book, ``The Good \nFight.''\n\n       The storm had been gathering all year and word from \n     conservative columnists and in conservative circles was that \n     Senator Frist of Tennessee, who was the majority leader, had \n     decided to pursue a rules change that would kill the \n     filibuster for judicial nominations. And once you opened that \n     Pandora's box it was just a matter of time before a Senate \n     leader who couldn't get his way on something moved to \n     eliminate the filibuster for regular business as well. And \n     that, simply put, would be the end of the United States \n     Senate.\n\n  That is Senator Reid when he was the minority leader of the Senate.\n  Today another storm is gathering, and the shoes are reversed. The \nmajority leader is the one who wants to invoke what he then called the \nnuclear option. That was the Democrats' name for what the Republicans \nwere trying to do, and we are the ones who are saying: Please don't do \nthat; stop and think about this; this is not what you want to do to the \nSenate.\n  People who are listening might say: Wait a minute. This filibuster \nbusiness has gotten out of hand. What is wrong with having a majority \nvote in the Senate? Don't we learn in the first grade--at least we did \nin Maryville, TN--if we have an election for the class president \neveryone raises their hands and whoever gets the majority wins. That is \nthe American way.\n  That is the American way except it is not the way of the Senate from \nthe beginning of our country. We had a Frenchman who wandered through \nthis country in the 1830s, a young man called de Tocqueville. He wrote \na book called ``Democracy In America,'' which is still the finest \nexposition of our democracy that we have because it was an outsider's \nlook at us. He saw two great dangers to the United States at the time. \nOne was Russia. He was prescient about that. But the second was what he \ncalled the tyranny of the majority--that in a great, big, complicated \ncountry like this that somehow the majority, in its passions and \nsuddenness and enthusiasm, would run over the minorities. Somehow he \nmust have known we would be a nation filled with minorities; that we \nwould be almost a minority nation, and somehow those minorities needed \nprotection.\n  What has happened over all those years is that the Senate has stood, \nas Senator Byrd used to say, as the necessary fence that protected \nminorities in America from the tyranny of the majority. That is why we \nhave a Senate, so if a freight train runs through the House it cannot \nrun through here.\n\n[[Page S7315]]\n\nIt has to slow down and stop and we have to think about it.\n  That is why we have a tradition in the Senate of unlimited amendment \nand unlimited debate on any subject until 60 of us decide that is \nenough--which is what we are about to do with the Defense authorization \nbill. We have had, under the leadership of Senator McCain and Senator \nLevin, the chairman--and I give Senator Reid great credit for this as \nwell--I think it is 90 amendments that have been dealt with. We will \nhave a cloture vote tomorrow. It will probably pass. I will vote for \nit. That means it is time to end the debate, time to limit the \ndiscussion and come to a conclusion. That is the way the Senate is \nsupposed to work.\n  Here is an image of the difference between the House and the Senate. \nMost of us know of the work of Robert Caro, who has written the book on \nLyndon Johnson. When I first came to the Senate 10 years ago I read \nthat first chapter in Caro's book, the chapter called ``The Desks Of \nThe Senate.'' I imagine the Presiding Officer has had a chance to read \nthat as well. I still say to new Senators or anybody else interested in \nthis body, if they really want to understand the Senate, read Robert \nCaro's chapter ``The Desks Of The Senate.''\n  He talked about all these desks and how after an election--just as \nthey will this time--they move two from over here to over there because \nDemocrats won a couple of seats, and that is the way this works. This \nis the image of the Senate where everybody is equal, and it takes 60 to \nget a result. The idea is unlimited debate and consideration to protect \nthe minority. It also reminds us that the people who are out of the \nmajority right now may not be out tomorrow.\n  What is the image of the House? The image of the House is that all \nlegislation goes to the House Rules Committee. I have been there. David \nDreier took me there. He is the chairman of the House Rules Committee. \nIt is an ornate office. Every piece of legislation in the House has to \ngo through the Rules Committee. Republicans have a narrow majority in \nthe House of Representatives but, guess what, the composition of the \nRules Committee is eight Republicans, four Democrats. What if the \nDemocrats gained a one-vote majority in the House? Eight Democrats and \nfour Republicans.\n  What would happen is any piece of legislation the majority wants to \npush would run through the House like a freight train. That is not what \nthe U.S. Senate is about. That is why Senator Dodd, in his farewell \naddress, said to those who have never been the minority in the Senate, \nplease be careful before changing these filibuster rules.\n\n  In January, we will have 30 Democratic Members of the U.S. Senate who \nhave never been in the minority. They have not had a chance to \nexperience what some of us have had a chance to experience. While I \nhave not been in the Senate all that long by Senate standards--I have \nbeen here 10 years--I have watched the Senate for a long time. I first \ncame here in 1967 as a legislative aide to Howard Baker. Everett \nDirksen was the Republican leader and Mike Mansfield was the Democratic \nleader. The Senate has never worked perfectly. Every majority and \nminority leader will say that.\n  In the 1960s it was Senator Williams from Delaware who would object \nand slow down things. In the 1970s it was Senator Allen from Alabama. \nHe would tie up the Senate in complete knots. Because of the individual \nrights a Senator has, it was just one Senator. In the 1980s it was \nSenator Metzenbaum. He held up my own nomination to be U.S. Education \nSecretary for 3 or 4 months, and there was nothing I could do about it. \nI thought that was very unfair, but it was part of this process whereby \na Senator can slow down things.\n  How do leaders respond to that? Well, in 2005 I was as angry as \nanyone about the Bush judges who were not getting an up-or-down vote, \nbut I did not think it was right to break or change the rules of the \nU.S. Senate. I didn't want to turn the Senate into the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I made two speeches on the floor and suggested what became, in \neffect, the Gang of 14. I didn't participate in the gang because my \ncolleague Senator Frist was the Republican leader, and out of respect \nto him I didn't want to undermine him. Fourteen Senators, including \nSenator Pryor and Senator McCain on this side, got together and said we \ncannot let this happen. They met and worked and agreed they would not \nchange the rules and would not filibuster. So when that happened, that \nmeant there could not be a change of the rules by the Republicans and \nthere could not be a filibuster by the Democrats if these 14 Senators \nagreed with one another. They then created a compromise solution which \nis where we are today.\n  There have been other ways that leaders have responded. During the \nPanama Canal debates in 1978 and 1979, I believe Senator Byrd and \nSenator Baker were the leaders. I believe Senator Byrd was the majority \nleader. The opponents of the Panama Canal--and this was a time when the \nPanama Canal was very unpopular with a lot of people. According to \nSenator Byrd, opponents centered their efforts of winning approval of \nkiller amendments. We all know what those are. I believe one of the \nmain reasons the majority leader does not like bills to come to the \nfloor is because he thinks some of the amendments offered by the \nminority are going to be unpleasant for Democrats, or even Republicans, \nto vote for. Well, my feeling about that is: Why would you join the \nGrand Ole Opry if you don't want to sing? We come here to debate, \namend, and vote.\n  Here is what Senator Byrd said: Opponents centered their efforts on \nwinning approval of killer amendments. I made it clear that only the \nleadership amendments and certain clarifying reservations and \nunderstandings would be acceptable. Opponents attempted to circumvent \nthis strategy by offering amendments that were phrased in such a way \nthat Senators would find them difficult to turn down.\n  At first glance many of the amendments seemed innocuous and pro-\nAmerican. Had they succeeded, however, they would have effectively \nkilled the treaty--this is Senator Byrd. In all 145 amendments, 26 \nreservations, 18 understandings, 3 declarations--for a total of 192 \nchanges--were proposed. 88 of these were voted on. In the final \nanalysis, nothing passed that was not acceptable to the joint \nleadership.\n  In other words, the joint leadership sat up there, let everybody \nvote, let them ventilate, have their say, do their job, and then they \ndefeated them. They either tabled their amendment or they beat them. \nThat is what they were able to do. That is very different from way we \nare operating today, and that is the way I respectfully suggest we \nshould operate.\n  In the 1980s--and I mentioned it was never perfect--during the Byrd-\nBaker era, basically the leaders would put a bill on the floor. If it \nwas a bill like the one we are currently considering--the Defense \nauthorization bill--and it had the support of the chairman and ranking \nminority member, they would simply open the bill for amendments. They \nmight get 300 amendments. They would then ask for unanimous consent to \nclose off amendments and, of course, they would get it because if \nanybody objected, they would tell them to throw their amendment in \nthere and then they would start voting.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. For example, during the Panama Canal debate, they \nwould table a lot and vote a lot. They would stay up on Monday, \nTuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights. Pretty soon Senators would be \nthinking about going home or seeing their grandchildren or maybe their \namendment was not so important and their bill would either be passed or \ndefeated, but everybody went home thinking: I have had a chance to be a \nU.S. Senator. I may be in the minority, I may be in the majority, but I \nhave given voice to the feelings of the people of my State which is \nwhat I was elected to do.\n  So is the filibuster rule a problem? No, the filibuster rule is not \nthe problem. The problem is if I come down to the floor with an \namendment, the majority leader uses a procedural motion to cut me off \nand I don't get to vote on it. I don't get to talk about it and I don't \nget to vote on it.\n  To his great credit, he is not doing that with the Defense \nauthorization bill. He did not do that with the postal reform bill. \nThere have been a number of other bills this year that proved the \nSenate can work. There is even an\n\n[[Page S7316]]\n\namendment by the Senator from Kentucky that Members of both sides did \nnot want to vote on. It had to do with cutting off aid to three Middle \nEastern countries. The administration did not want to vote, but we \nfinally voted and what happened? We had a huge, great debate. Many \nSenators spoke their feelings, and in the end the vote was 81-10 and \nthe amendment failed. It did not do any damage to anybody. In fact, it \nmade the Senate look more like what it should be.\n  The filibuster is and has been democracy's greatest show: the right \nto talk your head off. We need to get back to the situation where we \nhave committee bills like the Defense authorization bill where we bring \nthem to the floor and the majority leader asks for amendments. Let us \nall put our amendments in and let us start voting. Let's get back to \nthe time where the majority leader and the minority leader, or the \ncommittee chairman and the ranking member, have a product they are \ninvested in and they work together to keep it intact. If they do that, \nthey usually defeat Republican amendments or Democratic amendments, or \noccasionally an amendment will come along that has so much support that \nit seems like an improvement to the bill, and it is adopted.\n  My purpose today is not to make a hard job harder. I said at the \nbeginning the majority leader has the toughest job in town and maybe \none of the toughest in the country. My hope is that maybe if he has a \nfew minutes tonight, he would go back home and reread his own book. He \nand I agreed at that time that that would be a bad result. And remember \nthe words he said in 2005 about the value of the filibuster, the value \nof having a body that protected the minority rights and how damaging it \nwould be to make the Senate like the House.\n\n  I hope the majority leader and the Republican leader could quietly \nmeet and talk this through. Senator Schumer and I and many others spent \na lot of time on this 2 years ago. It took 6 months and we thought we \nhad an agreement, but somehow it broke down. There is no reason it \nshould break down. We can operate the Senate under the rules we have. \nWe can get bills through committee. We can get them to the floor. We \ncan let anybody have an amendment and we can talk about it, vote on it, \nand pass it or defeat it. That is what we should be doing.\n  I know the majority leader cares about this institution. I know he \ncares about it deeply. He spent his life here devoted to it. I know he \nis responding to a variety of suggestions from Members of his caucus as \nto what is best to do. I think it is the responsibility of the leaders \nof both sides and people who have seen this body for a while to remind \neveryone, particularly those who have never been in the minority, that \nthis is a body to protect the minority. Any of us can be in the \nminority at some time. I know he does not want to destroy the U.S. \nSenate, but in his words: If we change the filibuster rule, it would be \nthe end of the United States Senate. I don't want that to happen. I \ndon't want that to be the majority leader's legacy, and I don't believe \nhe wants that. I, as one Senator, am willing to encourage the \nRepublican leader and the majority leader to work together, solve this \nproblem, and get our attention focused back on the big problem facing \nour country, which is how to get a budget agreement that gets our \neconomy moving again.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to put into the Record a few \narticles: a excerpt from the majority leader's book, an article from \nThe Hill by Martin Paone--who used to work here and makes the points I \nhave been making--an article by Richard Arenberg, who worked on Senate \nand House staffs for 30 or 40 years. We find that people who have \nworked in the Senate and leave it, whether they are Republicans or \nDemocrats, seem to have the same view.\n  I wish also to put in Senator Byrd's statement which he made during \nhis last appearance before the Senate Rules Committee before he died. I \nwas there and he urged us not to break down this fence. His comments go \nhand in hand with those of Senator Chris Dodd's final address to the \nSenate on November 30, 2010. And finally, I include a copy of an \naddress I gave at the Heritage Foundation on this subject 2 years ago.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           The Nuclear Option\n\n       Peaceable and productive are not two words I would use to \n     describe Washington in 2005.\n       I just couldn't believe that Bill Frist was going to do \n     this.\n       The storm had been gathering all year and word from \n     conservative columnists and in conservative circles was that \n     Senator Frist of Tennessee, who was the Majority Leader, bad \n     decided to pursue a rules change that would kill the \n     filibuster for judicial nominations. And once you opened that \n     Pandora's box, it was just a matter of time before a Senate \n     leader who couldn't get his way on something moved to \n     eliminate the filibuster for regular business as well. And \n     that, simply put, would be the end of the United States \n     Senate.\n       It is the genius of the founders that they conceived the \n     Senate as a solution to the small state/big state problem. \n     And central to that solution was the protection of the rights \n     of the minority. A filibuster is the minority's way of not \n     allowing the majority to shut off debate, and without robust \n     debate, the Senate is crippled. Such a move would transform \n     the body into an institution that looked just like the House \n     of Representatives, where everything passes with a simple \n     majority. And it would tamper dangerously with the Senate's \n     advise-and-consent function as enshrined in the Constitution. \n     If even the most controversial nominee could simply be \n     rubber-stamped by a simple majority, advise-and-consent would \n     be gutted. Trent Lott of Mississippi knew what he was talking \n     about when he coined a name for what they were doing: the \n     nuclear option.\n       And that was their point. They knew--Lott knew--if they \n     trifled with the basic framework of the Senate like that it \n     would be nuclear. They knew that it would be a very radical \n     thing to do, They knew that it would shut the Senate down. \n     United States senators can be a self-regarding bunch \n     sometimes, and I include myself in that description, but \n     there will come a time when we will all be gone, and the \n     institutions that we now serve will be run by men and women \n     not yet living, and those institutions will either function \n     well because we've taken care with them, or they will be in \n     disarray and someone else's problem to solve. Well, because \n     the Republicans couldn't get their way getting some radical \n     judges confirmed to the federal bench, they were threatening \n     to change the Senate so fundamentally that it would never be \n     the same again. In a fit of partisan fury they were trying to \n     blow up the Senate. Senate rules can only be changed by a \n     two-thirds vote of the Senate, or sixty-seven senators. The \n     Republicans were going to do it illegally with a simple \n     majority, or fifty-one, Vice President Cheney was prepared to \n     overrule the Senate parliamentarian. Future generations be \n     damned.\n       Given that the filibuster is a perfectly reasonable tool to \n     effect, compromise, we had been resorting to the filibuster \n     on a few judges. And that's just the way it was. For 230 \n     years, the U.S. Senate had been known as the world's greatest \n     deliberative body--not always efficient, but ultimately \n     effective.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From The Hill, May 14, 2012]\n\n                   Senate Rule Changes Come With Risk\n\n                          (By Martin P. Paone)\n\n       It's an election year, and the Senate can't agree on how to \n     keep the student loan interest rate from doubling on July 1 \n     from 3.4 percent to 6.8. While both sides agree that it \n     should be done, how to pay for it is the stumbling block. A \n     party-line cloture vote failure has once again brought calls \n     for changing the Senate's rules by majority vote at the \n     beginning of the next Congress, bypassing the two-thirds \n     cloture requirement if there's opposition.\n       The Senate's membership has changed considerably in the \n     last decade, but the Senate rules, with the exception of some \n     changes that were enacted in the Ethics in Government Act, \n     have not undergone any major changes since the Senate went on \n     TV in 1986. While the House has its Rules Committee, which \n     allows the majority to exert its will and control the flow of \n     legislation, the Senate has a tradition of protecting the \n     rights of the minority and of unfettered debate. Its own \n     website describes ``[t]he legislative process on the Senate \n     floor [as] a balance between the rights guaranteed to \n     Senators under the standing rules and the need for senators \n     to forgo some of these rights in order to expedite \n     business.''\n       The Senate has for centuries functioned by this compact of \n     selectively forgoing one's rights, but now that compact, to \n     some, seems to have broken down--hence the call to enact \n     rules changes at the beginning of the next Congress by \n     majority vote. These calls have come from Democrats, but they \n     are quick to admit that it should apply regardless of who is \n     in the majority at the time.\n       Such changes can certainly quicken the process and allow \n     for the majority to pass legislation and confirm presidential \n     nominees with little hindrance. While the initial rules \n     reforms will probably be limited to restricting debate on a \n     motion to proceed and other less dramatic changes, eventually \n     such majority rules changes at the beginning of a Congress \n     will result in a majority-controlled body similar to the \n     House. Once the Pandora's Box of granting the majority the \n     unfettered ability to change the rules every\n\n[[Page S7317]]\n\n     two years has been opened, having seen how the current \n     situation has escalated, tit for tat over the last 30 years, \n     it is difficult to believe that strict majority rule would \n     not be the ultimate result. Thereafter, a member of the \n     minority in the Senate will be just as impotent as his or her \n     House counterparts.\n       Filibusters and the forcing of a cloture vote have been \n     repeatedly used to stop legislation and nominations and to \n     waste time. This is why the number of successful cloture \n     votes, many on noncontroversial nominations and on motions to \n     proceed to bills, has gone up dramatically in recent years. \n     By requiring the cloture vote and then voting for it, the \n     minority has been able to waste considerable time and thus \n     reduce the amount of time available to act on other items of \n     the president's agenda.\n       The call for changing the Senate's rules by majority vote \n     at the beginning of a Congress is not new; it was attempted \n     without success in 1953 and 1957 and in 1959. When faced with \n     such an effort, then-Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson \n     negotiated a cloture change back down two-thirds of those \n     present and voting, but as part of the compromise he had to \n     add Paragraph 2 to Senate Rule V, which states ``The rules of \n     the Senate shall continue from one Congress to the next \n     Congress unless they are changed as provided in these \n     rules.''\n       So is it time to ignore the existing rules and change them \n     at the beginning of the next Congress by a majority vote? \n     Perhaps it is time--so many other changes have occurred in \n     our lives in the recent past, why shouldn't the Senate change \n     the way it does business? However, should that occur, one \n     must be prepared to live with the eventual outcome of a \n     Senate where the majority rules and the rights of the \n     minority have been severely curtailed.\n       While I can sympathize with those demanding such changes, \n     it's the manner of their implementation that keeps reminding \n     me of the exchange between Sir Thomas Moore and his son-in-\n     law, William Roper, in the movie ``A Man For All Seasons'':\n       Roper: ``So, now you give the devil the benefit of law!''\n       Moore: ``Yes! What would you do? Cut a great road through \n     the law to get after the devil?'' Roper: ``Yes, I'd cut down \n     every law in England to do that!''\n       Moore: ``Oh? And when the last law was down, and the devil \n     turned `round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws \n     all being flat? . . . Yes, I'd give the devil benefit of law, \n     for my own safety's sake!''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 14, 2012]\n\n             Filibuster Reform: Avoid the `Nuclear Option'\n\n                        (By Richard A. Arenberg)\n\n       Richard A. Arenberg, who worked on Senate and House staffs \n     for 34 years, is co-author of ``Defending the Filibuster: The \n     Soul of the Senate.'' He is an adjunct professor at Brown \n     University, Northeastern University and Suffolk University.\n       Majority Leader Harry Reid, frustrated by abuse of the \n     filibuster, has vowed to change the Senate's rule on the \n     first day of the new Congress.\n       If he chooses to invoke the ``constitutional option''--the \n     assertion that the Senate can, on the first day of a session, \n     change its rules by a majority vote--he will be heading down \n     a slippery slope that the current president of the Senate, \n     Vice President Biden, once excoriated as an abuse of power by \n     a majority party.\n       The argument over the constitutional option is more than \n     200 years old. The Senate has consistently held that it is a \n     continuing body since at least two-thirds of its members are \n     always in office. That's why it uses a rule book written in \n     1789 by the first Senate and does not adopt rules on the \n     first day of a new Congress, as the House of Representatives \n     does. To underscore the point, the Senate adopted in 1965 \n     Rule V, which states, ``The rules of the Senate shall \n     continue from one Congress to the next Congress unless they \n     are changed as provided in these rules.''\n       Senate Rule XXII requires a two-thirds vote to end a \n     filibuster against a rules change. This means that changing \n     Senate rules must be a bipartisan matter. The danger is that \n     the majority party will attempt to use the ``constitutional \n     option'' and ignore the Senate's rules. Republicans \n     threatened this in 2005 when Democrats were filibustering 10 \n     of President George W. Bush's judicial nominations. Because \n     Democrats vowed to respond by bringing the Senate to a near-\n     halt, the tactic was widely referred to as the ``nuclear \n     option.''\n       The ``constitutional option'' could be accomplished in \n     January (or, really, any time) if the Senate's presiding \n     officer decides to ignore the rules and the advice of the \n     parliamentarian--which presiding officers usually rely upon--\n     and declares that debate can be ended by majority vote. \n     Republicans would appeal, but if 51 Democrats hold the line \n     they can table the appeal, which would allow the ruling to \n     stand as the new precedent of the Senate.\n       No one should be fooled. Once the majority can change the \n     rules by majority vote, the Senate will soon be like the \n     House, where the majority doesn't consult the minority but \n     simply controls the process. Gone would be the Senate's \n     historic protection of the minority's right to speak and \n     amend. In the House, the majority tightly controls which \n     bills will be considered; what amendments, if any, will be in \n     order; how much time is allotted for debate; and when and \n     under what rules votes occur. Often, no amendments are \n     permitted.\n       Since the Senate's presiding officer is likely to be the \n     vice president, it is instructive to remember what Biden said \n     about this ploy from the floor of the Senate in 2005:\n       ``This nuclear option is ultimately an example of the \n     arrogance of power. It is a fundamental power grab by the \n     majority party . . . to eliminate one of the procedural \n     mechanisms designed for the express purpose of guaranteeing \n     individual rights and they also, as a consequence, would \n     undermine the protections of the minority point of view. . . \n     .\n       ``[Q]uite frankly it's the ultimate act of unfairness to \n     alter the unique responsibility of the United States Senate \n     and to do so by breaking the very rules of the United States \n     Senate. . . . But the Senate is not meant to be a place of \n     pure majoritarianism. . . . At its core, . . . the filibuster \n     is not about stopping a nominee or a bill. It's about \n     compromise and moderation.''\n       He went on to call the constitutional option ``a lie about \n     the rule.''\n       Reid said at the time, ``If there were ever an example of \n     an abuse of power, this is it. The filibuster is the last \n     check we have against the abuse of power in Washington.''\n       In 2005, crisis was averted by the bipartisan ``Gang of \n     14'' senators who forged a compromise. Perhaps it's time for \n     a new gang. Five of the original 14 will be in the 113th \n     Congress. They would no doubt be joined by others of both \n     parties. A critical mass of senators who revere the \n     institution can arrive at a bipartisan approach, reshaping \n     the filibuster rule while retaining it as a protection for \n     minority rights.\n       In recent days President Obama and the leaders of the House \n     and Senate have called for bipartisan cooperation. Imposing \n     rules changes by partisan fiat would be just the opposite and \n     would destroy the fabric of the Senate. Now is a good time \n     for a new gang of senators to rise above partisan bickering \n     and negotiate changes based on what's best for the Senate and \n     our democracy, not just what's best for the majority.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Statement of Senator Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), Senate Rules and \n                 Administration Committee, May 19, 2010\n\n\n                ``the filibuster and its consequences''\n\n       On September 30, 1788, Pennsylvania became the first state \n     to elect its United States senators, one of whom was William \n     Maclay. In his 1789 journal Senator Maclay wrote, ``I gave my \n     opinion in plain language that the confidence of the people \n     was departing from us, owing to our unreasonable delays. The \n     design of the Virginians and of the South Carolina gentlemen \n     was to talk away the time, so that we could not get the bill \n     passed.''\n       Our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be a continuing \n     body that allows for open and unlimited debate and the \n     protection of minority rights. Senators have understood this \n     since the Senate first convened.\n       In his notes of the Constitutional Convention on June 26, \n     1787, James Madison recorded that the ends to be served by \n     the Senate were ``first, to protect the people against their \n     rulers, secondly, to protect the people against the transient \n     impressions into which they themselves might be led. . . They \n     themselves, as well as a numerous body of Representatives, \n     were liable to err also, from fickleness and passion. A \n     necessary fence against this danger would be to select a \n     portion of enlightened citizens, whose limited number, and \n     firmness might seasonably interpose against impetuous \n     councils.'' That ``fence'' was the United States Senate.\n       The right to filibuster anchors this necessary fence. But \n     it is not a right intended to be abused.\n       During this 111th Congress in particular the minority has \n     threatened to filibuster almost every matter proposed for \n     Senate consideration. I find this tactic contrary to each \n     Senator's duty to act in good faith.\n       I share the profound frustration of my constituents and \n     colleagues as we confront this situation. The challenges \n     before our nation are far too grave, and too numerous, for \n     the Senate to be rendered impotent to address them, and yet \n     be derided for inaction by those causing the delay.\n       There are many suggestions as to what we should do. I know \n     what we must not do.\n       We must never, ever, tear down the only wall--the necessary \n     fence--this nation has against the excesses of the Executive \n     Branch and the resultant haste and tyranny of the majority.\n       The path to solving our problem lies in our thoroughly \n     understanding it. Does the difficulty reside in the construct \n     of our rules or in the ease of circumventing them?\n       A true filibuster is a fight, not a threat or a bluff. For \n     most of the Senate's history, Senators motivated to extend \n     debate had to hold the floor as long as they were physically \n     able. The Senate was either persuaded by the strength of \n     their arguments or unconvinced by either their commitment or \n     their stamina. True filibusters were therefore less frequent, \n     and more commonly discouraged, due to every Senator's \n     understanding that such undertakings required grueling \n     personal sacrifice, exhausting preparation, and a willingness \n     to be criticized for disrupting the nation's business.\n       Now, unbelievably, just the whisper of opposition brings \n     the ``world's greatest deliberative body'' to a grinding \n     halt. Why?\n       Because this once highly respected institution has become \n     overwhelmingly consumed by a fixation with money and media.\n       Gone are the days when Senators Richard Russell and Lyndon \n     Johnson, and Speaker\n\n[[Page S7318]]\n\n     Sam Rayburn gathered routinely for working weekends and \n     couldn't wait to get back to their chambers on Monday \n     morning.\n       Now every Senator spends hours every day, throughout the \n     year and every year, raising funds for re-election and \n     appearing before cameras and microphones. Now the Senate \n     often works three-day weeks, with frequent and extended \n     recess periods, so Senators can rush home to fundraisers \n     scheduled months in advance.\n       Forceful confrontation to a threat to filibuster is \n     undoubtedly the antidote to the malady. Most recently, Senate \n     Majority Leader Reid announced that the Senate would stay in \n     session around-the-clock and take all procedural steps \n     necessary to bring financial reform legislation before the \n     Senate. As preparations were made and cots rolled out, a deal \n     was struck within hours and the threat of filibuster was \n     withdrawn.\n       I heartily commend the Majority Leader for this progress, \n     and I strongly caution my colleagues as some propose to alter \n     the rules to severely limit the ability of a minority to \n     conduct a filibuster. I know what it is to be Majority \n     Leader, and wake up on a Wednesday morning in November, and \n     find yourself a Minority Leader.\n       I also know that current Senate Rules provide the means to \n     break a filibuster. I employed them in 1977 to end the post-\n     cloture filibuster of natural gas deregulation legislation. \n     This was the roughest filibuster I have experienced during my \n     fifty-plus years in the Senate, and it produced the most-\n     bitter feelings. Yet some important new precedents were \n     established in dealing with post-cloture obstruction. In \n     1987, I successfully used Rules 7 and 8 to make a non-\n     debatable motion to proceed during the morning hour. No \n     leader has attempted this technique since, but this procedure \n     could be and should be used.\n       Over the years, I have proposed a variety of improvements \n     to Senate Rules to achieve a more sensible balance allowing \n     the majority to function while still protecting minority \n     rights. For example, I have supported eliminating debate on \n     the motion to proceed to a matter (except for changes to \n     Senate rules), or limiting debate to a reasonable time on \n     such motions, with Senators retaining the right to unlimited \n     debate on the matter once before the Senate. I have authored \n     several other proposals in the past, and I look forward to \n     our committee work ahead as we carefully examine other \n     suggested changes. The Committee must, however, jealously \n     guard against efforts to change or reinterpret the Senate \n     rules by a simple majority, circumventing Rule XXII where a \n     two-thirds majority is required.\n       As I have said before, the Senate has been the last \n     fortress of minority rights and freedom of speech in this \n     Republic for more than two centuries. I pray that Senators \n     will pause and reflect before ignoring that history and \n     tradition in favor of the political priority of the moment.\n                                  ____\n\n\nThe Filibuster: ``Democracy's Finest Show . . . The Right To Talk Your \n                               Head Off''\n\n(Address by Senator Lamar Alexander, Heritage Foundation, Jan. 4, 2011)\n\n       Voters who turned out in November are going to be pretty \n     disappointed when they learn the first thing some Democrats \n     want to do is cut off the right of the people they elected to \n     make their voices heard on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n       In the November elections, voters showed that they remember \n     the passage of the health care law on Christmas Eve, 2009: \n     midnight sessions, voting in the midst of a snow storm, back \n     room deals, little time to read, amend or debate the bill, \n     passage by a straight party line vote.\n       It was how it was done as much as what was done that \n     angered the American people. Minority voices were silenced. \n     Those who didn't like it were told, ``You can read it after \n     you pass it.'' The majority's attitude was, ``We won the \n     election. We'll write the bill. We don't need your votes.''\n       And of course the result was a law that a majority of \n     voters consider to be an historic mistake and the beginning \n     of an immediate effort to repeal and replace it.\n       Voters remembered all this in November, but only 6 weeks \n     later Democratic senators seemed to have forgotten it. I say \n     this because on December 18, every returning Democratic \n     senator sent Senator Reid a letter asking him to ``take steps \n     to bring [Republican] abuses of our rules to an end.''\n       When the United States Senate convenes tomorrow, some have \n     threatened to try to change the rules so it would be easier \n     to do with every piece of legislation what they did with the \n     health care bill: ram it through on a partisan vote, with \n     little debate, amendment, or committee consideration, and \n     without listening to minority voices.\n       The brazenness of this proposed action is that Democrats \n     are proposing to use the very tactics that in the past almost \n     every Democratic leader has denounced, including President \n     Obama and Vice President Biden, who has said that it is ``a \n     naked power grab'' and destructive of the Senate as a \n     protector of minority rights.\n       The Democratic proposal would allow the Senate to change \n     its rules with only 51 votes, ending the historical practice \n     of allowing any senator at any time to offer any amendment \n     until sixty senators decide it is time to end debate.\n       As Investor's Business Daily wrote, ``The Senate Majority \n     Leader has a plan to deal with Republican electoral success. \n     When you lose the game, you simply change the rules. When you \n     only have 53 votes, you lower the bar to 51.'' This is called \n     election nullification.\n       Now there is no doubt the Senate has been reduced to a \n     shadow of itself as the world's greatest deliberative body, a \n     place which, as Sen. Arlen Specter said in his farewell \n     address, has been distinctive because of ``the ability of any \n     Senator to offer virtually any amendment at any time.''\n       But the demise of the Senate is not because Republicans \n     seek to filibuster. The real obstructionists have been the \n     Democratic majority which, for an unprecedented number of \n     times, used their majority advantage to limit debate, not to \n     allow amendments and to bypass the normal committee \n     consideration of legislation.\n       To be specific, according to the Congressional Research \n     Service:\n       1. the majority leader has used his power to cut off all \n     amendments and debate 44 times--more than the last six \n     majority leaders combined;\n       2. the majority leader has moved to shut down debate the \n     same day measures are considered (same-day cloture) nearly \n     three times more, on average, than the last six majority \n     leaders;\n       3. the majority leader has set the record for bypassing the \n     committee process, bringing a measure directly to the floor \n     43 times during the 110th and 111th Congresses.\n       Let's be clear what we mean when we say the word \n     ``filibuster.'' Let's say the majority leader brings up the \n     health care bill. I go down to the floor to offer an \n     amendment and speak on it. The majority leader says ``no'' \n     and cuts off my amendment. I object. He calls what I tried to \n     do a filibuster. I call what he did cutting off my right to \n     speak and amend which is what I was elected to do. So the \n     problem is not a record number of filibusters; the problem is \n     a record number of attempts to cut off amendments and debate \n     so that minority voices across America cannot be heard on the \n     floor of the Senate.\n       So the real ``party of no'' is the majority party that has \n     been saying ``no'' to debate, and ``no'' to voting on \n     amendments that minority members believe improve legislation \n     and express the voices of the people they represent. In fact, \n     the reason the majority leader can claim there have been so \n     many filibusters is because he actually is counting as \n     filibusters the number of times he filed cloture--or moved to \n     cut off debate.\n       Instead of this power grab, as the new Congress begins, the \n     goal should be to restore the Senate to its historic role \n     where the voices of the people can be heard, rather than \n     silenced, where their ideas can be offered as amendments, \n     rather than suppressed, and where those amendments can be \n     debated and voted upon rather than cut off.\n       To accomplish this, the Senate needs to change its \n     behavior, not to change its rules. The majority and minority \n     leaders have been in discussion on steps that might help \n     accomplish this. I would like to discuss this afternoon why \n     it is essential to our country that cooler heads prevail \n     tomorrow when the Senate convenes.\n       One good example Democrats might follow is the one \n     established by Republicans who gained control of both the \n     Senate and House of Representatives in 1995. On the first day \n     of the new Republican majority, Sen. Harkin proposed a rule \n     change diluting the filibuster. Every single Republican \n     senator voted against the change even though supporting it \n     clearly would have provided at least a temporary advantage to \n     the Republican agenda.\n       Here is why Republicans who were in the majority then, and \n     Democrats who are in the majority today, should reject a \n     similar rules change:\n       First, the proposal diminishes the rights of the minority. \n     In his classic Democracy in America, Alexis de Tocqueville \n     wrote that one of his two greatest fears for our young \n     democracy was the ``tyranny of the majority,'' the \n     possibility that a runaway majority might trample minority \n     voices.\n       Second, diluting the right to debate and vote on amendments \n     deprives the nation of a valuable forum for achieving \n     consensus on difficult issues. The founders knew what they \n     were doing when they created two very different houses in \n     Congress. Senators have six-year terms, one-third elected \n     every two years. The Senate operates largely by unanimous \n     consent. There is the opportunity, unparalleled in any other \n     legislative body in the world, to debate and amend until a \n     consensus finally is reached. This procedure takes longer, \n     but it usually produces a better result--and a result the \n     country is more likely to accept. For example, after the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted, by a bipartisan \n     majority over a filibuster led by Sen. Russell of Georgia, \n     Sen. Russell went home to Georgia and said that, though he \n     had fought the legislation with everything he had, ``As long \n     as it is there, it must be obeyed.'' Compare that to the \n     instant repeal effort that was the result of jamming the \n     health care law through in a partisan vote.\n       Third, such a brazen power grab by Democrats this year will \n     surely guarantee a similar action by Republicans in two years \n     if Republicans gain control of the Senate as many believe is \n     likely to happen. We have seen this happen with Senate \n     consideration of judges. Democrats began the practice of \n     filibustering President Bush's judges even though they were \n     well-qualified; now Democrats are unhappy because many \n     Republicans regard that as a precedent and have threatened to \n     do the same to President Obama's nominees. Those who want to \n     create a freight train\n\n[[Page S7319]]\n\n     running through the Senate today, as it does in the House, \n     might think about whether they will want that freight train \n     in two years if it is the Tea Party Express.\n       Finally, it is hard to see what partisan advantage \n     Democrats gain from destroying the Senate as a forum for \n     consensus and protection of minority rights since any \n     legislation they jam through without bipartisan support will \n     undoubtedly die in the Republican-controlled House during the \n     next two years.\n       The reform the Senate needs is a change in its behavior, \n     not a change in its rules. I have talked with many senators, \n     on both sides of the aisle, and I believe most of us want the \n     same thing: a Senate where most bills are considered by \n     committee, come to the floor as a result of bipartisan \n     cooperation, are debated and amended and then voted upon.\n       It was not so long ago that this was the standard operating \n     procedure. I have seen the Senate off and on for more than \n     forty years, from the days in 1967 when I came to the Senate \n     as Sen. Howard Baker's legislative assistant. That was when \n     each senator had only one legislative assistant. I came back \n     to help Sen. Baker set up his leadership office in 1977 and \n     watched the way that Sen. Baker and Sen. Byrd led the Senate \n     from 1977 to 1985, when Democrats were in the majority for \n     the first four years and Republicans were the second four \n     years.\n       Then, most pieces of legislation that came to the floor had \n     started in committee. Then that legislation was open for \n     amendment. There might be 300 amendments filed and, after a \n     while, the majority would ask for unanimous consent to cut \n     off amendments. Then voting would begin. And voting would \n     continue.\n       The leaders would work to persuade senators to limit their \n     amendments but that didn't always work. So the leaders kept \n     the Senate in session during the evening, during Fridays, and \n     even into the weekend. Senators got their amendments \n     considered and the legislation was fully vetted, debated and \n     finally passed or voted down.\n       Sen. Byrd knew the rules. I recall that when Republicans \n     won the majority in 1981, Sen. Baker went to see Sen. Byrd \n     and said, ``Bob I know you know the rules better than I ever \n     will. I'll make a deal with you. You don't surprise me and I \n     won't surprise you.''\n       Sen. Byrd said, ``Let me think about it.''\n       And the next day Sen. Byrd said yes and the two leaders \n     managed the Senate effectively together for eight years.\n       What would it take to restore today's Senate to the Senate \n     of the Baker-Byrd era?\n       Well, we have the answer from the master of the Senate \n     rules himself, Sen. Byrd, who in his last appearance before \n     the Rules Committee on May 19, 2010 said: ``Forceful \n     confrontation to a threat to filibuster is undoubtedly the \n     antidote to the malady [abuse of the filibuster ]. Most \n     recently, Senate Majority Leader Reid announced that the \n     Senate would stay in session around-the-clock and take all \n     procedural steps necessary to bring financial reform \n     legislation before the Senate. As preparations were made and \n     cots rolled out, a deal was struck within hours and the \n     threat of filibuster was withdrawn . . . I also know that \n     current Senate Rules provide the means to break a \n     filibuster.''\n       Sen. Byrd also went on to argue strenuously in that last \n     speech that ``our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be \n     a continuing body that allows for open and unlimited debate \n     and the protection of minority rights. Senators,'' he said, \n     ``have understood this since the Senate first convened.''\n       Sen. Byrd then went on: ``In his notes of the \n     Constitutional Convention on June 26, 1787, James Madison \n     recorded that the ends to be served by the Senate were \n     `first, to protect the people against their rulers, secondly, \n     to protect the people against the transient impressions into \n     which they themselves might be led. . . . They themselves, as \n     well as a numerous body of Representatives, were liable to \n     err also, from fickleness and passion. A necessary fence \n     against this danger would be to select a portion of \n     enlightened citizens, whose limited number, and firmness \n     might seasonably interpose against impetuous councils. ``That \n     fence,'' Sen. Byrd said in that last appearance, ``was the \n     United States Senate. The right to filibuster anchors this \n     necessary fence. But it is not a right intended to be \n     abused.''\n       ``There are many suggestions as to what we should do. I \n     know what we must not do. We must never, ever, ever, ever \n     tear down the only wall--the necessary fence--this nation has \n     against the excess of the Executive Branch and the resultant \n     haste and tyranny of the majority.''\n       What would it take to restore the years of Sens. Baker and \n     Byrd, when most bills that came to the floor were first \n     considered in committee, when more amendments were \n     considered, debated and voted upon?\n       1. Recognize that there has to be bipartisan cooperation \n     and consensus on important issues. The day of ``we won the \n     election, we jam the bill through'' will have to be over. \n     Sen. Baker would not bring a bill to the floor when \n     Republicans were in the majority unless it had the support of \n     the ranking Democratic committee member.\n       2. Recognize that senators are going to have to vote. This \n     may sound ridiculous to say to an outsider, but every Senate \n     insider knows that a major reason why the majority cuts off \n     amendments and debate is because Democratic members don't \n     want to vote on controversial issues. That's like \n     volunteering to be on the Grand Ole Opry but then claiming \n     you don't want to sing. We should say, if you don't want to \n     vote, then don't run for the Senate.\n       3. Finally, according to Sen. Byrd, it will be the end of \n     the three-day work week. The Senate convenes on most Mondays \n     for a so-called bed-check vote at 5:30. The Senate during \n     2010 did not vote on one single Friday. It is not possible \n     either for the minority to have the opportunity to offer, \n     debate and vote on amendments or for the majority to \n     forcefully confront a filibuster if every senator knows there \n     will never be a vote on Friday.\n       There are some other steps that can be taken to help the \n     Senate function better without impairing minority rights.\n       One bipartisan suggestion has been to end the practice of \n     secret holds. It seems reasonable to expect a senator who \n     intends to hold up a bill or a nomination to allow his \n     colleagues and the world know who he or she is so that the \n     merits of the hold can be evaluated and debated.\n       Second, there is a crying need to make it easier for any \n     President to staff his government with key officials within a \n     reasonable period of time. One reason for the current delay \n     is the President's own fault, taking an inordinately long \n     time to vet his nominees. Another is a shared responsibility: \n     the maze of conflicting forms, FBI investigations, IRS \n     audits, ethics requirements and financial disclosures \n     required both by the Senate and the President of nominees. I \n     spoke on the Senate floor on this, titling my speech \n     ``Innocent until Nominated.'' The third obstacle is the \n     excessive number of executive branch appointments requiring \n     Senate confirmation. There have been bipartisan efforts to \n     reduce these obstacles. With the support the majority and \n     minority leaders, we might achieve some success.\n       Of course, even if all of these efforts succeed there still \n     will be delayed nominations, bills that are killed before \n     they come to the floor and amendments that never see the \n     light of day. But this is nothing new. I can well remember \n     when Sen. Metzenbaum of Ohio put a secret hold on my \n     nomination when President George H.W. Bush appointed me \n     education secretary. He held up my nomination for three \n     months, never really saying why.\n       I asked Sen. Rudman of New Hampshire what I could do about \n     Sen. Metzenbaum, and he said, ``Nothing.'' And then he told \n     me how President Ford had appointed him to the Federal \n     Communications Commission when he, Rudman, was Attorney \n     General of New Hampshire. The Democratic senator from New \n     Hampshire filibustered Rudman's appointment until Rudman \n     finally asked the president to withdraw his name.\n       ``Is that the end of the story?'' I asked Rudman.\n       ``No,'' he said. ``I ran against the [so-and -so] and won, \n     and that's how I got into the Senate.''\n       During his time here Sen. Metzenbaum would sit at a desk at \n     the front of the Senate and hold up almost every bill going \n     through until its sponsor obtained his approval. Sen. Allen \n     of Alabama did the same before Metzenbaum. And Sen. John \n     Williams of Delaware during the 1960's was on the floor \n     regularly objecting to federal spending when I first came \n     here forty years ago.\n       I have done my best to make the argument that the Senate \n     and the country will be served best if cooler heads prevail \n     and Democrats don't make their power grab tomorrow to make \n     the Senate like the House, to permit them to do with any \n     legislation what they did with the health care law. I have \n     said that to do so will destroy minority rights, destroy the \n     essential forum for consensus that the Senate now provides \n     for difficult issues, and surely guarantee that Republicans \n     will try to do the same to Democrats in two years. More than \n     that, it is hard to see how Democrats can gain any partisan \n     advantage from this destruction of the Senate and invitation \n     for retribution since any bill they force through the Senate \n     in a purely partisan way during the next two years will \n     surely be stopped by the Republican-controlled House of \n     Representatives.\n       But I am not the most persuasive voice against the wisdom \n     of tomorrow's proposed action. Other voices are. And I have \n     collected some of them, mostly Democratic leaders who wisely \n     argued against changing the institution of the Senate in a \n     way that would deprive minority voices in America of their \n     right to be heard:\n\n\n          Quotes from Members and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\n\n       Senator Robert Byrd: We must never, ever, ever, ever, tear \n     down the only wall, the necessary fence, that this nation has \n     against the excesses of the Executive Branch.\n       Sen. Byrd: That's why we have a Senate, is to amend and \n     debate freely.\n\n\n             Congressional Record, January 4, 1995, S40-41\n\n       The filibuster has become a target for rebuke in this \n     efficiency-obsessed age in which we live. We have instant \n     coffee, instant potatoes to mix, instant this and instant \n     that. So everything must be done in an instant; must be done \n     in a hurry. . . .\n       Anyhow, everything has to be done in a hurry. We have to \n     bring efficiency to this Senate. That was not what the \n     Framers had in mind.\n       Recently, much of the talk of abolishing filibusters was \n     coming from the other body, but apparently the criticism has \n     begun to seep in the Senate Chamber, as well.\n       The filibuster is one of the easier targets in this town. \n     It does not take much imagination to decry long-winded \n     speeches and to deplore delay by a small number of determined\n\n[[Page S7320]]\n\n     zealots as getting in the way of the greater good.\n       It does, however, take more than a little thought to \n     understand the true purpose of the tactic known as \n     filibustering and to appreciate its historic importance in \n     protecting the viewpoint of the minority.\n       In many ways, the filibuster is the single most important \n     device ever employed to ensure that the Senate remains truly \n     the unique protector of the rights of the people that it has \n     been throughout our history.\n\n\n  Byrd did voice support for limiting debate on the motion to proceed \n                                 though\n\n       So we have had unlimited debate in the Senate now for 200 \n     years, and surely with 200 years of trial and testing, we \n     should know by now it is something to be prized beyond \n     measure.\n       And so it is not a matter of pride and prerogative and \n     privilege and power with this Senator. It is a matter not \n     only of protecting this institution, it is a matter of \n     protecting the liberties of free men under our Constitution. \n     And as long as I can stand on this floor and speak, I can \n     protect the liberties of my people. If I abuse the power by \n     threatening to filibuster on motions to proceed, take away \n     that power of mine to abuse. Let us change the rule and allow \n     a motion to proceed under a debate limitation of 2 hours, 1 \n     hour, or whatever, except on motions to proceed to a rules \n     change. I am for that.\n\n       Sen. Dodd: I'm totally opposed to the idea of changing the \n     filibuster rules. I think that's foolish in my view.\n       Sen. Dodd: I can understand the temptation to change the \n     rules that make the Senate so unique and simultaneously so \n     terribly frustrating. But whether such temptation is \n     motivated by a noble desire to speed up the legislative \n     process or by pure political expediency, I believe such \n     changes would be unwise.\n       Sen. Dodd: Therefore to my fellow Senators, who have never \n     served a day in the minority, I urge you to pause in your \n     enthusiasm to change Senate rules.\n\n       Sen. Reid: The Filibuster is far from A `Procedural \n     Gimmick.' It's part of the fabric of this institution that we \n     call the Senate. For 200 years we've had the right to extend \n     the debate. It's not procedural gimmick. Some in this chamber \n     want to throw out 214 years of Senate history in the quest \n     for absolute power. They want to do away with Mr. Smith, as \n     depicted in that great movie, being able to come to \n     Washington. They want to do away with the filibuster. They \n     think they're wiser than our Founding Fathers, I doubt that's \n     true.\n       SEN Reid: In a fit of partisan fury, they were trying to \n     blow up the Senate. Senate rules can only be changed by a \n     two-thirds vote of the Senate, or sixty-seven senators. The \n     Republicans were going to do it illegally with a simple \n     majority, or fifty-one. Vice President Cheney was prepared to \n     overrule the Senate parliamentarian. Future generations be \n     damned.\n       Sen. Reid: Given that the filibuster is a perfectly \n     reasonable tool to effect compromise, we had been resorting \n     to the filibuster on a few judges. And that's just the way it \n     was. For 230 years, the U.S. Senate had been known as the \n     world's greatest deliberative body--not always efficient, but \n     ultimately effective.\n\n       Former Sen. Obama: Then if the Majority chooses to end the \n     filibuster, if they choose to change the rules and put an end \n     to Democratic debate, then the fighting and the bitterness \n     and the gridlock will only get worse.\n\n       Former Sen. Clinton: You've got majority rule. Then you've \n     got the Senate over here where people can slow things down \n     where they can debate where they have something called the \n     filibuster. You know it seems like it's a little less than \n     efficient, well that's right, it is. And deliberately \n     designed to be so.\n\n       Sen. Chuck Schumer: The checks and balances which have been \n     at the core of this Republic are about to be evaporated. The \n     checks and balances which say that if you get 51% of the \n     vote, you don't get your way 100% of the time.\n\n       Sen. Gregg: You just can't have good governance if you \n     don't have discussion and different ideas brought forward.\n\n       Sen. Roberts: The Senate is the only place in government \n     where the rights of a numerical minority are so protected. A \n     minority can be right, and minority views can certainly \n     improve legislation.\n\n\n                   From Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\n\n       Jimmy Stewart: Wild horses aren't going to drag me off this \n     floor until those people have heard everything I've got to \n     say, even if it takes all winter.\n       Reporter: H.V. Kaltenborn speaking, half of official \n     Washington is here to see democracy's finest show. The \n     filibuster--the right to talk your head off.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          U.S.-CUBA RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I recently had an opportunity to visit \nCuba for the first time. I have been frustrated for many years about \nthe impasse between the United States and Cuba. I believed, and \ncontinue to believe, that the best way to change the Castro regime in \nCuba is to open Cuba. As we learned in Eastern Europe, once those who \nhave lived under a controlled economy and autocratic rule are exposed \nto the real world and the opportunities of that world, they start \npushing for change.\n  I went to Cuba hoping that with the transitional leadership from \nFidel Castro to his brother Raul, there might be an opportunity to turn \na new page. President Raul Castro has taken a number of small but \nnotable steps to opening his country's economy. He has also released a \nnumber of political prisoners, albeit forcing many of them to leave \nCuba if they wish to be released.\n  Yet a genuine start to turning the page with the United States would \nalso have to include the release of a detained U.S. citizen, Alan \nGross, a man with whom the Presiding Officer and I have met. Today \nmarks the third full year in prison in Cuba for Alan Gross. What was \nAlan Gross's crime? He provided Internet equipment to some of the Cuban \npopulation. That is right, Internet equipment.\n\n  The Presiding Officer may have read that in war-torn Syria under the \nruthless dictator Bashar al Assad, the Internet was recently turned off \nfor a few days but was restored. In fact, Internet access in Cuba is \nbetween 1 percent to 3 percent, making it among the lowest rates in the \nworld. The Cubans have tried to exclude news from the outside world to \nthose living on the island.\n  In 2011, the Cuban and Venezuelan Governments--two governments not \nknown for political freedoms--launched a much ballyhooed project to lay \nan undersea fiber optic cable between the two countries to help improve \nCuba's phone and Internet services.\n  The $70 million project was expected to be in operation for the \nentire Nation by the summer of 2011, but as of May 2012 reports \nindicate that use has been restricted to only Cuban and Venezuelan \nGovernment entities, and Internet access by the general public still \nremains slow and very expensive. It is no wonder that trying to use the \nInternet in Cuba can land a person in jail, but 15 years in jail for \nAmerican Alan Gross?\n  I have come to this floor many times to plead for his freedom, and I \nwill continue to do so. Gross's incarceration is a tragic reminder of \nthe stale and tired policies from another era. It is difficult to \nimagine how relationships between the United States and Cuba can \nimprove while Alan Gross continues to be held as a hostage to the \ncontrived grievances of the Cuban Government.\n  Today, December 3, marks the third anniversary of Alan's detention--3 \nlong, painful, and damaging years--3 years. However, that is only a \nsmall fraction of his 15-year sentence. Alan is a 63-year-old man from \nMaryland who simply wanted to give basic communication tools--just a \nshadow of what average Americans enjoy every day--to the Cuban people.\n  When he arrived in Cuba, he went through their customs with all of \nhis equipment and handed over everything he brought in, which they \ndutifully inspected. They proceeded to allow him to leave with the \nequipment and then turned around and arrested him for being a spy \ntrying to sneak something into the country. He fully disclosed \neverything he brought in. He didn't believe he was violating the law. \nIt is a mere technicality that has him sitting in prison today.\n  Now he is fighting for his life, trying to sustain his emotional and \nphysical health, and that is a growing concern. When I met with Alan \nGross, he explained to me his daily routine. It is the only thing that \nkeeps him sane. He gets up and marches around his room, pacing off the \nfeet as he goes, trying to make sure he walks a certain distance\n\n[[Page S7321]]\n\neach day. They let him outside in the sunlight for a little while each \nday, and he tries to do exercises outside to maintain his physical \ncondition.\n  Recently, they found a mass on his shoulders. The Cuban doctors \ndiagnosed it as hematoma and said it would go away, but it hasn't. It \nis a source of growing concern. His family is worried that it may be \nworse than a hematoma--perhaps even a tumor--and Alan Gross repeatedly \nhas asked for a doctor of his own to examine him, but Cuba has refused.\n  Facing outside pressure, Cuban doctors recently took another biopsy \nof the mass and made a big effort to publicly announce last week that \ntheir tests concluded it wasn't cancerous, but Alan and his doctor in \nthe United States are not satisfied with the methods the Cubans used \nand don't trust the results.\n  Just last week, Judy Gross, Alan's wife, came to see me again. She \nhas been in before. She talked about her worry and the worry of her \nfamily about her husband's condition. Who can blame them. Alan's \ndaughter and mother are both battling cancer. He has reason to fear \nthat he could have it too. Alan deserves a medical evaluation from a \ndoctor he knows and believes in. Cuba should at least give him that. \nFurthermore, they should allow the examination to take place in the \nUnited States so he can visit his ailing mother and daughter.\n  I have pleaded with them to give him a chance to come home. One of \nthe Cuban Five, a group of five Cubans who were arrested for espionage, \nwas given that opportunity to return to Cuba so they could visit a sick \nbrother. During my visit to Cuba, I had the privilege of meeting with \nAlan in person, and I thank the Cuban Government for that visit. I was \nmoved by our conversation and impressed by the sincerity of Alan's \naffection for the Cuban people.\n  This is a picture that was taken during the course of my visit with \nAlan. Alan Gross is not a threat to the sovereignty of the Cuban \nGovernment as they claim. He is a good man with good intentions, an \nhonest man who just wants to come home to his family. Instead, he is \ntrapped in Cuba, now for 3 years, being used by a regime as a pawn in a \nstandoff with the United States. Holding Alan Gross as a political \nhostage is the wrong way to solve any problem between our countries.\n  I am no fan of this Cuban regime. Its disregard for human rights and \nbasic freedoms trouble me greatly. The recent suspicious death of Cuban \ndemocracy leader Owaldo Paya and continued harassment of blogger Yoani \nSanchez are deeply troubling, but I believe in the Cuban people and in \ntheir right for economic and political expression. I am inspired by the \npassionate and courageous activists on the island--those who follow the \nexample of Paya and Sanchez--and I am hopeful they will break through \nthe repression and bring real change to that country.\n  Today Senators Cardin and Moran submitted a resolution calling for \nthe immediate and unconditional release of Alan Gross. I support it and \njoin them as a cosponsor, and I call on my colleagues to do the same.\n  Last week when I met with Alan's wife Judy, it almost broke my heart. \nShe has fought tirelessly for her husband's release and her pain is \npalpable. As is Alan, she is frustrated, but she continues to fight for \nhis freedom and works hard to ensure he is not forgotten.\n  Judy Gross, I assure you, Alan is not forgotten. I hope the Cuban \nGovernment takes note of the same. Alan Gross deserves to come home, \nand we will continue to fight for him until he does.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                       Sergeant Joseph Richardson\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, the men and women who wear our Nation's \nuniform are selfless heroes who embody the American spirit, courage, \nhonor, and patriotism. We must always remember to honor those who risk \ntheir lives to protect our country because our troops have given the \ngreatest sacrifice in defense of our freedoms.\n  Today I am here to pay my respects to Army SGT Joseph A. Richardson, \nan Arkansas soldier who sacrificed his life for his country while in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  As a student at Booneville High School in Booneville, AR, Sergeant \nRichardson took an interest in the military. His guidance counselor \ntold Arkansas media outlets that during his sophomore year he became \ninterested in military service and was anxious to take the necessary \nentrance exams even before he could qualify. His counselor said, ``He \nfelt like it was going to be an honor to serve his country.'' In 2008, \nhe joined the Army.\n  His passion for his service to his country remained constant. \nSergeant Richardson's family said he loved his job, he loved fighting \nfor his country and our freedom. He liked it so much he recently \nreenlisted for 6 more years of service in the Army.\n  While Sergeant Richardson's desire to serve his country was well \nknown, so was his enthusiasm for life. His family and friends describe \nSergeant Richardson as a kind-hearted man who always put others first \nand made those around him laugh.\n  As a member of A Company, 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, \nFirst Infantry Division, Fort Riley, Kansas, 23-year-old Sergeant \nRichardson gave his life for his country on November 16, 2012, while on \npatrol in Afghanistan.\n  SGT Joseph Richardson is a true American hero who paid the ultimate \nsacrifice. I ask my colleagues to keep his wife Ashley and the rest of \nhis family and friends in their thoughts and prayers during this very \ndifficult time. On behalf of a grateful nation, I humbly offer my \nsincerest gratitude for his patriotism and selfless service.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Medicare and Medicaid\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, America faces no greater threat \nto its growth and prosperity than our uncontrolled national debt. \nCurrently, the country's debt exceeds $16 trillion. We are passing this \namount of money on to our children and grandchildren to pay off. It is \nsimply far too large a burden to be placing on them.\n  As we move forward, it is clear that we must discuss spending.\n  I know that President Obama is hyper-focused on increasing taxes as \npart of a deficit-reduction proposal. However, if we are serious about \nreducing our debt, we must talk about spending--not sometime next year, \nnot only after we talk about taxes. We must talk about our spending \nNow.\n  We need to have a thoughtful conversation that focuses on where our \nFederal spending most calls for control and containment.\n  I would like to begin by drawing your attention to this chart I have \nin the Chamber.\n  This chart from the Congressional Budget Office details noninterest \nspending as a percentage of GDP.\n  We already know the significant role health care spending plays in \nour budget.\n  Over the next decade, the Federal Government will spend over $7 \ntrillion on Medicare and $4.5 trillion on Medicaid. Together these two \nprograms account for one-quarter of the entire Federal Government's \nspending throughout the next 10 years. But look closely at the even \nlonger term projections of our spending.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this middle graph--\nSocial Security, as a percentage of GDP--will remain relatively stable \nover the next 25 years.\n\n[[Page S7322]]\n\n  Noninterest spending, the bottom graph, as a percentage of GDP will \nalso remain relatively stable over the same period.\n  Now, look at this top graph. Over the next 25 years, spending on \nhealth care entitlements will basically double as a percentage of GDP.\n  Unless we take a serious look at health care spending, we aren't \ngenuinely acting to reduce our country's debt.\n  Twenty-five years is not a lot of time. We need to be talking about \nhealth care spending now--not sometime next year, not just once we have \ndiscussed taxes; now.\n  In Washington, we can get all wrapped up over semantic terms. Do we \nneed Medicare and Medicaid reform? Should we call it restructuring, \nreorganization, improving and strengthening?\n  To me, the terms are irrelevant and the conclusion is undeniable. We \nmust gain control of health care spending.\n  As we move forward in debt talks, I know a lot of attention will be \ndevoted to taxes and revenue. Those conversations are important and \nshould conclude with tax policy that fosters economic growth. But \nconversations about the health care entitlements should not be \npostponed or relegated to second-tier status, and they certainly should \nnot be confined to cost reduction exercises that ignore the fundamental \ncost drivers.\n  I have read reports of the savings in Medicare and Medicaid that \nPresident Obama has proposed. In my mind, they do little more than take \ncash out of the system without making fundamental changes necessary to \nbend the growth curve. Let's take a look at a few of those in the \nPresident's 2013 budget.\n  There is increasing income-relating of Medicare premiums. That one \ntakes more money from rich seniors. There is increasing copays for home \nhealth. That will increase costs for all seniors. There is getting \nbigger rebates from drug companies, even if it harms Part D. That one \ntakes money from drug companies. There is cutting provider taxes in \nMedicaid. That one will take money from States at a time when the \nadministration is encouraging them to expand Medicaid to cover \nchildless adults. As an aside, I notice that the Washington Post had a \nbanner editorial last Friday supporting a reduction in Medicaid \nprovider taxes. I wish that the Post had been so helpful in 2006 when \nthe Bush administration made a similar proposal.\n\n  There is also something called a ``blended rate'' for State \nreimbursement under Medicaid.\n  That breaks the promise to pay for 100 percent of the costs of those \nmade eligible under Obamacare.\n  These proposals will certainly reduce the Federal outlay in Medicare \nand Medicaid. However, these proposals will not solve the larger \nproblem of health care spending growth. Instead, we should also focus \non where our spending really is.\n  I am fully aware that there is significant opposition from Democrats \nto Republican ideas like premium support for Medicare and block grants \nfor Medicaid. I am not here promoting either of those ideas. But \nopposition to those ideas should not allow Democrats to walk away from \nthe issue. We must address the growth of health care entitlements.\n  I believe our Medicare and Medicaid spending problems can be \nexplained in three straightforward charts. This chart I have in the \nChamber is the first one.\n  Here we look at the Federal Medicare and Federal and State Medicaid \nspending divided into three groups.\n  On the left is spending by the Federal Government for people who are \neligible only for Medicare.\n  On the right is Federal and State spending for people only eligible \nfor Medicaid.\n  In the middle is Federal and State spending for people eligible for \nboth Medicare and Medicaid, also known as dual eligibles or duals.\n  This middle group, the duals, accounts for just over 10 percent of \nthe entire Medicare and Medicaid population. However, there is more \nspending on duals than on the Medicare-only beneficiaries or the \nMedicaid-only beneficiaries.\n  When we talk about the need to find ways to control spending on \nduals, it is for good reason. We must find ways to realign the \ndisparate incentives of the federally run Medicare Program and the \nState-run Medicaid Programs.\n  However, focusing on solutions exclusive to duals misses the fullness \nof the problem. For one, the duals are not a homogeneous population. \nWhile most people consider people on Medicare to be typically elderly, \nfully 38 percent of the duals are nonelderly. Also, while many of the \nduals are clearly high-cost, there are a large number of duals who \nutilize very few services.\n  So while improvements to the care model that we use for duals are \nnecessary, they are far from sufficient in reducing the totality of the \ngrowth driving health care costs.\n  Consider this next chart, I have in the Chamber.\n  In this chart, we see the most expensive individuals in the Medicare \nprogram. This is a population who has two to three chronic conditions \nand functional impairments. Among the most expensive Medicare \nbeneficiaries, more than half--57 percent--qualify only for Medicare.\n  Providing better coordinated care and reducing costs for high-cost \nbeneficiaries is critical for the future of Medicare and Medicaid. I \nhave strong reservations about splitting these two groups based solely \non individuals' income.\n  Proposals that give the States greater control of acute care services \nfor the 43 percent who are duals, essentially, divide two similarly \nsituated, expensive individuals between one Federal model and 50 States \nmodels based solely on their income. That makes no sense to me. A \nMedicare-only beneficiary may exhaust income and assets and become \ndually eligible. The separation between the two populations is \narbitrary and artificial.\n  Whatever we do to find a better model to coordinate care and reduce \ncosts for high-cost beneficiaries, it needs to address all \nbeneficiaries, not just duals.\n  To find rational solutions to our health care spending, we must first \naccurately target the populations who incur the most significant \nexpenditures. This includes individuals who are not only the duals but \nalso those Medicare-only seniors with multiple chronic conditions and \nfunctional impairments.\n  Finally I would like to draw attention to this chart I have in the \nChamber.\n  This final chart details spending on long-term services and supports \nin 2010. Two years ago, a total of $208 billion--8 percent of all U.S. \npersonal health care spending--was spent on long-term services and \nsupports. Among this spending, Medicaid, the single largest payer of \nsuch services, picked up 62.2 percent of the cost, while the private \nmarket paid for just over a third of it.\n  With 80 million baby boomers entering retirement age, and 7 out of \nevery 10 seniors needing long-term care at a certain point in their \nlives, the demand for those services will only increase and further \ndrive health care spending if we don't take action. We must find ways \nto increase private spending and decrease public spending on long-term \nservices and supports.\n  If we are going to argue that we are reducing the growth of health \ncare costs, we must actually do it.\n  In closing, we have an opportunity before us. We can either make real \nchanges to our health care entitlements that will impact the growth \ncurve for years to come, or we can simply take cash out of the system \nand call it reform. We have to be willing to re-examine the \neffectiveness of our current overall Medicare and Medicaid structure. \nWe should not be afraid to ask tough questions.\n  Should Medicare and Medicaid be structured in a way that provides \nbenefits to individuals in the most efficient and effective way \npossible?\n  Are Medicare and Medicaid, in fact, structured in a way that \nguarantees we will spend Federal and State dollars inefficiently or \nineffectively?\n  When you look at the spending on duals, the spending on high-cost \nbeneficiaries and the spending on long-term supports and services, I \nbelieve the answer to both questions is yes.\n  Medicare and Medicaid proposals must address these three areas.\n  President Obama hasn't come to the table yet. I know there are people \ntelling us we shouldn't talk about health care entitlements now. We \ndon't have a choice. Look at the numbers. Look at\n\n[[Page S7323]]\n\nthe spending. We only make the problem worse by putting it off. We can \nsave Federal dollars by extracting more from beneficiaries, providers, \nand States, but that won't bend the long-term growth curve. We have to \ntalk about solutions to actually lower the growth curve now.\n  We are $16 trillion in debt. One of every four dollars we will spend \nin this next decade will be on Medicare and Medicaid. We will see \nhealth care entitlements double as a percentage of GDP in the next 25 \nyears. If we want Medicare and Medicaid to not only survive but also \nthrive for the next generation, we need to be willing to ask \nfundamental questions and seek solutions that can affect the growth \ncurve.\n  I sincerely hope we are willing to look for solutions that can make a \nreal difference.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee--and I appreciate your leadership in that role as well on \nthat committee--I would like to speak for a few minutes on the National \nDefense Authorization Act.\n  In the midst of an ongoing war, with our brave sons and daughters, \nhusbands and wives fighting in Afghanistan, our country continues to \nface a very serious threat from radical Islamist terrorists and other \nchallenges and threats throughout the world. With increased threats \nposed by rogue states such as Iran and North Korea, it is so important \nthat we pass the Defense Authorization Act.\n  I would like to take a minute to thank Chairman Levin and Ranking \nMember McCain for their leadership and for the hard work and dedication \nthey have shown in bringing us together around this Defense \nauthorization. In a place where we typically have seen many times that \nthings have come down on party lines, I can tell you that the Senate \nArmed Services Committee is a welcome exception to the gridlock and \npartisanship in Washington, and both of them have brought us together. \nIn fact, the Defense authorization bill passed out of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee unanimously. It reflects the committee's bipartisan \ncommitment to making sure our troops and their families have what they \nneed to ensure our Nation is protected.\n  As the ranking member of the readiness subcommittee, I have had the \npleasure of working with Chairman McCaskill to ensure that our men and \nwomen in uniform have the resources they need to protect themselves and \nour country. At the same time, the readiness subcommittee has also \nworked very hard to achieve significant reforms that save taxpayer \ndollars without endangering our military readiness. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with the chairman to seek additional efficiencies \nwithin the Department of Defense budget, while guarding against \nirresponsible cuts that would leave our troops and our Nation less \nprepared for future contingencies and increase the likelihood of \nconflict.\n  I also wish to recognize the work I have had the opportunity to do \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that further supports our \ntroops, our veterans, and their families. I am proud to have worked \nwith my colleagues across the aisle to include several very important \nprovisions in this year's Defense Authorization Act.\n  During the markup, Senator Begich, Senator McCain, Senator Shaheen, \nSenator Vitter, and Senator Udall joined me--three Republicans and \nthree Democrats working together--to introduce and successfully \nincorporate an amendment to the Defense authorization that would save \n$400 million by cutting off funding to the over-cost and behind-\nschedule Medium Extended Air Defense System, or MEADS. This is a \nweapons program that the Pentagon has said it will never procure, it \nwill never happen. Yet we continue to put taxpayer dollars into this \nweapons system. I know that in the President's comments about the bill, \nhe has expressed concern about this--his administration has--but at a \ntime when we are facing grave fiscal challenges in this country, we \ncannot afford to spend $400 million on a weapons system that will never \ncome to be when there are so many other needs that need to be \naddressed.\n  In another bipartisan effort, more than a dozen of my colleagues \njoined Senator Begich and me in ensuring that veterans buried at the \nClark Veterans Cemetery in the Philippines will have the dignified and \nfinal resting place they deserve. There is still more work we have to \ndo on this issue.\n  What this comes down to is when the Air Force abandoned Clark Air \nForce Base in 1991 in the wake of a volcanic eruption, Clark Veterans \nCemetery was abandoned and the tombstones and the remains of 8,300 U.S. \nservicemembers and their dependents were left buried in ash and \novergrown weeds. That is completely unacceptable for those who have \nserved our Nation, that we would not ensure that this cemetery would be \nkept in a way that is dignified and consistent with the respect they \ndeserve, having served our Nation.\n  To prevent this from ever happening again, I am pleased that the \nDefense authorization includes my provision, which would require the \nSecretary of Defense to provide Congress a plan to ensure that an \nappropriate Federal or private agency assumes responsibility for the \ncontinued maintenance and oversight of cemeteries located on overseas \nmilitary bases after they close.\n  What happened here is that we left, and there was nothing in place to \nensure that we would take responsibility to make sure this cemetery was \nmaintained with dignity and respect. This provision will make sure that \nif we are in that position again, this will not happen.\n  Additionally, Senator Jack Reed and I worked together to include a \nprovision aimed at enhancing the Department's research, treatment, \neducation, and outreach initiatives focused on addressing the mental \nhealth needs of members of the National Guard and Reserve.\n  In addition to the provisions I have just mentioned which we have \nbeen able to put in this bill on a bipartisan basis, I would also like \nto talk about some additional amendments that have already been \nincluded in the Defense authorization. Here are some of the provisions \nor reporting requirements that are included within this bill:\n  First, requiring the Pentagon to complete a full statement of budget \nresources by 2014 to improve financial stewardship at the Pentagon.\n  This has been an issue we have been working on for too long. It is \ntime that the Pentagon is able to undergo an audit, and this \nrequirement that is contained within the Defense Authorization Act is \nconsistent with what Secretary Panetta has said he is seeking to do, to \nmake sure the Pentagon can complete a full statement of budget \nresources by 2014.\n  When we are at a time when we are $16 trillion in debt, the fact that \nwe are not able to audit the Pentagon, aren't able to really take that \ninformation and make critical decisions on what we need versus what we \nwould want to do and what we can afford to do, this is very important, \nthat the Pentagon get to a position where it can be audited. This \nprovision ensures that this critical step is in this bill, and I am \nhopeful it will get passed.\n  Additional provisions that will save millions of dollars in \nacquisitions by prohibiting the Department of Defense from using cost-\ntype contracts for the production of major defense acquisition programs \nare in this bill.\n  We can't afford the years where we are paying much more for weapons \nsystems than we can afford and it takes much longer to produce them. We \ncan improve our acquisition systems, and by prohibiting the Department \nof Defense from using cost-type contracts for the production of major \ndefense acquisition programs, this is a very important step.\n  There are also provisions in this bill to ensure that our nuclear \ndeterrent remains strong as we modernize our nuclear arsenal.\n  Without a nuclear deterrent, if you look at what is happening around \nthe world, with Iran trying to acquire the\n\n[[Page S7324]]\n\ncapability of having a nuclear weapon, with North Korea having that \ncapability, it is very important that we have that deterrent in our \ncountry and that it remains modern and able if, God forbid--we hope we \nwill never have to use that, but it is a very strong deterrent to rogue \nactors around the world that are seeking this capability.\n  In addition, there are provisions that increase oversight of the \nDepartment of Defense's proposed reduction in the number of soldiers \nand marines and looks at the issue of minimizing involuntary \nseparations.\n  This is one of the things we are facing right now. With the defense \ncuts, some of our men and women in uniform who have served multiple \ntours on our behalf are now in a position where they may receive a pink \nslip. We owe it to them to make sure we minimize the situation where \nthey come home, they are given a pink slip, and then they are put in a \nsituation where they are looking for a job. We need to make sure we do \nthis in a way that they can assimilate into the civilian society \nwithout being left unemployed, given the sacrifices they have made for \nour country.\n  There are other provisions I would like to highlight briefly. There \nis a provision to ensure that military amputees have access to top-\nquality prostheses and prosthetic sockets. Whether servicemembers who \nrequire prosthesis choose to leave the military or continue to serve, \nthey deserve the best, top-quality prostheses and prosthetic sockets, \nand included in this mark is a provision that will ensure there are \nstandards to make certain they receive the best. They deserve it.\n\n  In addition, there is a provision that will require that the Navy let \nus know what our current military capabilities require in terms of the \nnumber of ships and submarines that are in our fleet. The Chief of \nNaval Operations testified last year the Navy needs 313 ships and \nsubmarines to meet its strategic requirements. Right now we only have \n285. If sequestration goes forward, we are going to have dramatically \nless. Right now, we can only meet 61 percent of attack submarine \nrequirements set by our combatant commanders. The administration has \nsaid we are going to shift to the Asia Pacific region given the rise in \ninvestments China is making in its navy, so I am simply asking that the \nNavy tell us what they need to make sure our country is protected.\n  We have conflicting information, and it is important that we have a \nstrong and robust Navy to make sure America is protected from the \nthreats we face around the world.\n  In conclusion, I want to just thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member \nMcCain for all their hard work and leadership on the Armed Services \nCommittee. This is a bill of which we can be proud. I am pleased that \nlast week the Senate adopted my amendment to ban terrorists who are \nbeing held at Guantanamo Bay from being transferred to U.S. soil. I \nknow that is something the American people feel strongly about.\n  I know the bill, overall, will continue to have debate on a number of \namendments, but it is a bill that is very important to our \nservicemembers--the men and women in uniform who serve us--and their \nfamilies. They deserve the very best. They deserve to know we will pass \nthis bill to make sure they have the equipment and the support they \nneed given the sacrifices they have made for our country.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain for all their \nhard work.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I \ndid not speak before the amendment was agreed to, but I think it is \nimportant to highlight it, particularly in light of things that \nhappened just last week in Afghanistan.\n  The amendment that was agreed to is an amendment that would focus on \nwomen and girls in Afghanistan and their plight. Sadly, the day before \nSenator Casey and I filed our amendment--with many wonderful cosponsors \nfrom the Senate--to help address the plight of women and girls, a \ntragedy was reported in the newspaper. A 14-year-old girl from a \nvillage in Afghanistan was beheaded by two men. The justification for \nbeheading this child--who was going to fetch water--was that she, with \nthe support of her family, had declined to marry one of the men.\n  Gasitina was a student--a brave act in itself for a girl in \nAfghanistan--and she was butchered while fetching water because she \nwould not, at the age of 14, marry one of the men.\n  In October, another young woman's throat was slashed because she \nrefused to work as a prostitute. Honestly, some of the women who are \nforced into prostitution are killed because of what they do.\n  In September, three young women, two of them sisters, were attacked \nby six men because they were television actors and the six \nfundamentalists believed their dress was immodest. The sisters barely \nsurvived, but their friend bled to death from horrific stab wounds \noutside a mosque.\n  This is life in a situation that has improved for women since the \nfall of the Taliban rule. Clearly, there are still entrenched cultural \nand societal ills that will take much more work to cure. Despite the \nstrides that have been made, Afghanistan is still ranked as the most \ndangerous country for women in the world. Afghanistan falls behind the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan, and Somalia.\n  Women and girls are constantly under attack, particularly if they try \nto go to school in some areas where there are still police who do not \nbelieve girls should be able to do so. If they teach others, there is a \nprice to pay, and if they want to participate or speak out, there is \nanother price to pay.\n  Women are frequently incarcerated for moral crimes--such as leaving \nhome. It is estimated that half the country's imprisoned women and \ngirls are incarcerated for such offenses.\n  The life of many women in Afghanistan is, of course, incomprehensible \nto us. Here are a few statistics: An estimated 70 to 80 percent of \nmarriages are forced; 87 percent of women face at least one form of \nphysical, sexual or psychological violence or forced marriages in their \nlifetimes; women in Afghanistan have a 1 in 11 chance of dying in child \nbirth and roughly 87 percent of women are illiterate.\n  The Afghan Women and Girls Security Promotion Act--which Senator \nCasey and I cosponsored, along with many others in this body--will help \nimprove the lives of these women and make Afghanistan a safer place, \nwhere our goal and their goal would be that they could freely \nparticipate in public life, get an education, raise their families \nwithout fear of retaliation for fully realizing their full potential \nand making their own life choices.\n  Here is what the bill does. It requires the Department of Defense to \nproduce a three-part plan to support the security of women and girls \nduring and after the transition process. It is monitoring and \nresponding to changes in women's security during and after the \ntransition. If it appears there is a deterioration in women's security, \nthe bill would require the DOD and our partners that will remain there \nto take concrete action to support the women in these situations.\n  It also will improve their opportunities and treatment by the Afghan \nNational Security Forces personnel, and it would increase the \nrecruitment and retention of women in the Afghan National Security \nForces.\n  Last week, I read in the Washington Post about a 17-year-old Afghan \ngirl who had dreamed of becoming a doctor. If she had been in America, \nwe would have been speaking about her now as an example of success. \nInstead, I am speaking of a child so desperate to escape an arranged \nmarriage that she had been promised to since she was 9 years old she \njumped off the roof of her house. Killing herself was the outlet she \ncould see. She survived this suicide attempt, though she is now \nparalyzed. While her story is tragic in every way, there is a glimmer \nof hope because, in fact, her family has backed her, now petitioned to \nannul her engagement. Her family stood with her after she took such a \nbold step. Even that would never have happened under Taliban rule.\n  We know change will be slow, but if it is encouraged and if progress \nis protected it can come.\n  I wish to say Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, when she was a \nSenator, and myself, were the honorary co-chairs of Vital Voices, which \nis an organization that looked for the women in Third World countries \nwho are so mistreated yet still looked for things to celebrate in those \ncountries. We have honored the women who have stood up in those \ncountries and achieved great success, either in economics or in humane \ntreatment for women in those countries. I think we have begun to raise \nthe awareness in many areas.\n  Our former First Lady Laura Bush, also reading of this amendment that \nwas adopted last week, reached out to say what a great thing we are \ndoing. I know Secretary of State Clinton also will be supportive of \nkeeping this amendment in conference.\n  I am very pleased we have been able to have the agreement of the \nmanagers who are on the floor to unanimously accept the Casey-Hutchison \namendment. I am going to implore them or twist their arms to assure \nthat this amendment stays in conference so there will be clear support \nand that the women and girls of Afghanistan will know they do not have \nto do such drastic things as try to kill themselves or be in harm's way \nsuch that a rejected suitor would actually murder his 14-year-old \nintended because she said she would not marry him. This is a human \nrights issue if there ever was one.\n  I am very proud to cosponsor the amendment with Senator Casey, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Feinstein, Senator Gillibrand, Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Snowe, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Cardin, Senator \nBoxer and Senator Franken. We must keep this as one of the things we \nwish to achieve\n\n[[Page S7332]]\n\nfor the Afghan people as we exit militarily. We must keep the \ntransition force to assure that all the lives of our brave military \nthat have been lost in Afghanistan will not have been in vain.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent a vote on or in relation to the \nKyl-Kerry amendment No. 3123, as modified, which has been cleared by \nboth managers, will occur at a time to be determined by the managers in \nconsultation with the leaders following the vote on cloture on the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, the \namendments are pending en bloc.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I know of no further debate on the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3291\n\n   (Purpose: To require, as a condition on the receipt by a State of \n  certain funds for veterans employment and training, that the State \n  ensures that training received by a veteran while on active duty is \n taken into consideration in granting certain State certifications or \n                               licenses)\n\n       At the end of subtitle of subtitle H of title X, add the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1084.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3292\n\n  Senator Reed's amendment, amendment No. 3292, to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, seeks to further address the problem of predatory \nlenders taking advantage of members of our Armed Forces. Predatory \nlending practices are a serious problem for members of the Armed \nServices throughout the country, and I know it has impacted Vermonters \nserving in our Nation's military.\n  This amendment further strengthens the Military Lending Act by \nextending enforcement authority to certain Federal Agencies. Senator \nReed's amendment seeks to expand the universe of parties who can bring \nenforcement actions against predatory lenders, and therefore provide \nadditional protections to the members of our Armed Services. Allowing \nadditional Federal Agencies to bring enforcement actions helps ensure \nthat fewer instances of predatory lending in the Armed Services \ncommunity go unprosecuted. It is important to me, as it is to Senator \nReed, that members of our Armed Services be free from harmful and \ndeceptive lending practices.\n  I am glad Senator Reed reached out to me on this amendment regarding \nthe expansion of enforcement authority, and I thank him for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/03/senate-section/article/S7332-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7332-S7336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF PAUL WILLIAM GRIMM TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                        THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Paul William\n\n[[Page S7333]]\n\nGrimm, of Maryland, to be United States District Judge for the District \nof Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate, equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, after months of unjustifiable delays, the \nSenate will finally be allowed to vote on one of President Obama's \nqualified, consensus judicial nominees. The nomination of Paul William \nGrimm to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland \nwas reported by the Judiciary Committee nearly-unanimously 6 months \nago. Judge Grimm and the people of Maryland have been forced to wait 6 \nmonths for this day for no good reason. He is one of the 19 judicial \nnominees who should have been confirmed before the August recess.\n  Since 1997 Judge Grimm has served as a United States Magistrate Judge \nand since 2007 as Chief Magistrate Judge on the United States District \nCourt for the District of Maryland. Prior to joining the bench, Judge \nGrimm had wide legal experience as a lawyer in Maryland State \ngovernment, private practice, and as a Judge Advocate General. The ABA \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him \n``well qualified'' to serve on the U.S. District Court, its highest \npossible rating. He has the strong support of his home State Senators, \nSenator Mikulski and Senator Cardin. There was no opposition on the \nmerits to his confirmation when he was considered by the Republican and \nDemocratic Senators on the Judiciary Committee.\n  This is another judicial nominee whose service has been stalled by \nunnecessary, partisan obstruction. In her recent comments at Huffington \nPost, Jen Bendery correctly noted:\n\n       The pattern throughout the president's tenure has been \n     uncontroversial judicial nominees clearing the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee but going nowhere [on] the Senate floor. \n     Then, after months of opposition, GOP leaders agree to clear \n     some of the backlog and long-stalled nominees sail through \n     virtually unopposed. . . . [W]hat has changed is the degree \n     to which obstruction has become standard operating procedure \n     since Obama took office. After four years, Obama has seen \n     about 75 percent of his nominees confirmed. By contrast, the \n     Senate confirmed . . . 88.7 percent of Bush's nominees by \n     this point in [his] presidency.\n       Two months ago, the Senate went into recess without taking \n     action on 19 judicial nominees, nearly all of whom have \n     support from both parties.\n\n  Regrettably, the Senate has not been allowed to make real progress \nfor the American people by reducing the number of judicial vacancies. \nThere were more than 80 vacancies when the year began. There were more \nthan 80 vacancies this past March when the Majority Leader was forced \nto take the extraordinary step of filing cloture petitions on 17 \ndistrict court nominations. There are now more than 80 vacancies once \nagain.\n  In stark contrast, there were only 29 vacancies at this point in \nPresident George W. Bush's first term and we had lowered vacancies \nduring those four years to 28, not the 83 at which they stand today. \nWhen George W. Bush was President, we routinely considered four to six \njudges per week. In 2002, we confirmed 18 judges in 1 day. That is what \nit takes to make real progress. The Senate should proceed to consider \nand confirm all 19 judicial nominations ready for a final vote without \nfurther delay.\n  There is no justification for holding up final Senate action on the \n19 judicial nominations that have been approved by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and are pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. President \nObama has consistently reached across the aisle, consulted with home \nState Senators from both parties and appointed moderate, well-qualified \njudicial nominees. Seven of the 19 nominees currently waiting for final \nSenate consideration are supported by Republican home State Senators. \nSeventeen of these nominees received bipartisan support in the \nJudiciary Committee. The Senate should be learning the lesson of the \nrecent elections and working in a bipartisan manner to consider and \nvote on these nominees. It is time for the obstruction to end and for \nthe Senate to complete action on these nominees so that they may serve \nthe American people. Delay for delay's sake is wrong and should end.\n  Whatever justification Senate Republicans contended they had by \nresort to their misapplication of the Thurmond Rule to stall judicial \nnominations before the election is gone. The American people have voted \nand chosen to reelect President Obama. The President is not a lame \nduck. He is the President elected and reelected by the American people. \nIt is time for the Senate to vote on his judicial nominees.\n  From 1980 until this year, when a lame duck session followed a \npresidential election, every single judicial nominee reported with \nbipartisan Judiciary Committee support has been confirmed. According to \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, no consensus nominee \nreported prior to the August recess has ever been denied a vote--before \nnow. That is something Senate Democrats have not done in any lame duck \nsession, whether after a presidential or midterm election.\n  Senate Democrats allowed votes on 20 of President George W. Bush's \njudicial nominees, including one very controversial circuit court \nnominee, in the lame duck session after the elections in 2002. I \nremember, I was the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee who moved \nforward with those votes. The Senate proceeded to confirm judicial \nnominees in lame duck sessions after the elections in 2004 and 2006, \nand proceeded to confirm 19 judicial nominees in the lame duck session \nafter the elections in 2010, as well. The reason that I am not listing \nconfirmations for the lame duck session at the end of 2008 is because \nthat year we had proceeded to confirm the last 10 judicial nominees \napproved by the Judiciary Committee in September.\n  That is our history and recent precedent. Those across the aisle who \ncontend that judicial confirmations votes during lame duck sessions do \nnot take place are wrong. It is they with their obstruction who are \ncreating a wrongheaded precedent. The Senators from Kentucky, \nTennessee, Utah, Iowa, Arizona, Texas, Alabama, South Carolina and \nMississippi should all remember the judicial nominees from their home \nStates Democrats moved forward to confirm in lame duck sessions in \n2002, 2004 and 2010.\n  If the Senate will be allowed to vote on these 19 judicial nominees, \nwe can help fill nearly one-quarter of our Nation's Federal judicial \nvacancies. We can fill almost one-third of all judicial emergency \nvacancies. Most importantly, we can help hardworking Americans to have \nbetter access to justice.\n  I congratulate Judge Grimm and his family as well as the Senators \nfrom Maryland who have continued to press for this day. There is no \nreason the Senate should not be allowed to vote on the other 18 long-\npending judicial nominations. The American people deserve no less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, for only the fourth time in over \n70 years, we will confirm a Federal judge during a lame-duck session in \na Presidential election year. According to the Congressional Research \nService, the Senate has confirmed judicial nominees during a lame-duck \nsession in a Presidential election year on only three occasions since \n1940. It occurred in 1944, 1980, and 2004. So for those who say we are \ntreating this President differently, I would say we have treated him \nfar better than most Presidents have been.\n  This year we have already confirmed 31 District Judges and five \ncircuit judges. That meets or exceeds the confirmations for \nPresidential election years in recent memory.\n  That is more confirmations than we did in 2008; it exceeds the \ndistrict confirmations in 2004 and ties the circuit confirmations for \nthat year. It is the same number of district confirmations in 2000, and \nit is considerably more than we confirmed in 1996. So for the past five \nPresidential election years, this year stands near the top for judicial \nconfirmations.\n  Yet, despite that record, and despite the fact that we are about to \nconfirm yet another district court nominee, all we hear from the other \nside are complaints. I must say, it makes it quite difficult to work \ncooperatively with the other side when, no matter what you do, all you \nhear are complaints.\n  Lately we have heard the other side argue that since the President \nwon reelection, we should not follow past\n\n[[Page S7334]]\n\npractice, but rather we should confirm a large number of nominations \nduring this lame duck session.\n  The last time a President was reelected--President Bush in 2004--we \nheard a different tune from Democrats. That year the other side was in \nno hurry to confirm President Bush's nominees. In fact, only 3 judicial \nnominees were confirmed after the November 2004 election. That year, \nfollowing President Bush's reelection, 23 judicial nominations that \nwere pending either on the Senate Executive Calendar or in the \nJudiciary Committee were returned to the President when the Congress \nadjourned in December.\n  Recently one of my colleagues on the other side stated, ``From 1980 \nuntil this year, when a lame duck session followed a presidential \nelection, every single judicial nominee reported with bipartisan \nJudiciary Committee support has been confirmed.''\n  I suppose this is meant to imply there is some long record of routine \nconfirmations following a Presidential election. But that is simply not \nthe case.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what that means: One Circuit confirmation \nin 1980 and 3 District confirmations in 2004. That's it. From 1980 \nthrough 2008, those four nominations represent the entire list. There \nwere no such confirmations in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, or 2008.\n  Furthermore, limiting this list to ``reported with bipartisan \ncommittee support'' fails to take into account that many judicial \nnominees in the past administration were subjected to a ``pocket \nfilibuster.'' That means, of course, that they never had a hearing or \nopportunity to be reported out of Committee. So it is somewhat \nmisleading to suggest the Senate routinely confirms nominees during \nPresidential lame-duck sessions of Congress.\n  Again, the last time a President was reelected, only three of his \nnominees were confirmed following the election. Today we will add to \nthat exclusive list, and the Senate has a time agreement for a vote on \na second District nominee before we adjourn.\n  This afternoon, we are considering the nomination of Paul William \nGrimm to be United States District Judge for the District of Maryland. \nWith his confirmation, the Senate will have confirmed 159 of President \nObama's nominees to the District and Circuit Courts.\n  During the last Presidential election year, 2008, the Senate \nconfirmed a total of 28 judges, 24 district and four circuit. This \nPresidential election year we have exceeded those numbers. We have \nconfirmed five circuit nominees, and Judge Grimm will be the 32nd \ndistrict judge confirmed. That is a total of 37 judges this year versus \n28 in the last Presidential election year.\n  So once again, I want to set the record straight, and I hope I have \ndone so. Republicans have been more than fair to this President and his \njudicial nominees.\n  Judge Grimm received his J.D. degree in 1976, graduating magna cum \nlaude from the University of New Mexico School of Law. He began his \nlegal career serving in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General, JAG, \nCorps. After resigning his active duty commission in 1979, he \nestablished a general practice law partnership of Daniels and Grimm. In \n1980, Grimm left the firm to serve as a prosecutor in the Baltimore \nCounty state's attorney's office. In this position, he handled both \nmisdemeanor and felony cases. From 1981 to 1984, Judge Grimm served in \nthe Maryland attorney general's office as the chief of litigation and \nadministration for the Department of Licensing Regulation.\n  Judge Grimm had his first prolonged stint in private practice serving \nas an attorney for the firm of Niles, Barton and Wilmer from 1984-1987. \nHe was initially hired as an associate, but was promoted to partner in \n1985. At Niles, Barton and Wilmer, he handled products liability cases, \nfidelity and surety cases, general tort cases, professional malpractice \ncases, and construction cases. In 1987, he joined Jordan, Coyne, Savits \nand Lopata as the managing partner of the Baltimore Branch. In 1991, he \nreturned to Niles, Barton and Wilmer when Jordan, Coyne closed its \nBaltimore office.\n  Throughout his time in private practice, his typical clients included \ngovernment agencies, insurance companies, private corporations, \npartnerships, law firms, accounting firms, and individuals.\n  In 1997, the U.S. District Judges for the District of Maryland \nappointed Judge Grimm to be a United States Magistrate Judge. In 2006, \nhe was elevated to Chief United States Magistrate Judge.\n  Judge Grimm has served as an Adjunct Professor of law at the \nUniversity of Maryland, Francis King Carey School of Law, 1990-present, \nand at the University of Baltimore School of Law, 1997-present. The \nAmerican Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nhas rated him unanimous well qualified.\n  I support this nomination and congratulate Judge Grimm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Mikulski \nin recommending to the Senate the confirmation of Judge Paul William \nGrimm of Maryland to be a U.S. district judge for the District of \nMaryland.\n  I am very proud of the process Senator Mikulski has instituted for \nmaking recommendations to the President to fill judicial appointments. \nI believe that under this process, we are able to get the very best to \nrecommend to the President and then to our colleagues for confirmation. \nJudge Grimm clearly falls within this line.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported Judge Grimm's \nnomination by a voice vote on June 7 of this year. Judge Grimm was \nnominated to fill the vacancy that was created in Maryland when U.S. \nDistrict Judge Benson E. Legg took senior status in June.\n  Judge Grimm brings a wealth of experience to this position. Early in \nhis career he served in the military in the Judge Advocate General's \nCorps, handled commercial litigation in private practice, and served as \nan assistant attorney general in Maryland. He also sat as a Federal \nmagistrate judge in Maryland for 15 years.\n  Judge Grimm was born in Japan and received his undergraduate degree \nfrom the University of California in 1973, and graduated from the \nUniversity of New Mexico School of Law in 1976. Judge Grimm was \nadmitted to the Maryland bar in 1977.\n  He has strong roots, legal experience, and community involvement in \nthe State of Maryland. Judge Grimm lives with his family in Towson, MD.\n  After graduating law school, Judge Grimm began his legal career in \nMaryland as a captain in the United States Army Judge Advocate \nGeneral's Corps at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. He then worked in the \nPentagon before heading back to the Baltimore region, alternating \nbetween working in private practice and working in the State attorney \ngeneral's office, while continuing to serve as a U.S. Army JAG Corps \nofficer with occasional stints in the Pentagon.\n  In 1997 Judge Grimm was selected as a magistrate judge by the judges \nof the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. In 2006, Judge \nGrimm became the chief U.S. magistrate judge in Baltimore.\n  In 2009, Chief Justice John Roberts appointed Judge Grimm to serve as \na member of the Advisory Committee for the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. In 2010 he was designated as chair of the Civil Rules \nCommittee's Discovery Subcommittee.\n  I mention that because it is evident from the Chief Judge's \nappointment that Judge Grimm is a nationally recognized expert on \ncutting-edge issues of law and technology. He has written numerous \nauthoritative opinions, books, and articles on the subject of evidence, \ncivil procedure, and trial advocacy. He also continues to inspire the \nnext generation of lawyers by teaching classes at both of our law \nschools. On several occasions Professor Grimm has been awarded the \ntitle of outstanding adjunct faculty member. As a magistrate judge, \nJudge Grimm has found time not only to teach but to be an outstanding \nprofessor. He has shown his commitment in so many ways to public \nservice.\n  As a magistrate judge, Judge Grimm is responsible for handling \ncriminal matters such as issuing search warrants, conducting \npreliminary criminal proceedings, and presiding over misdemeanor \ncriminal cases.\n  Judge Grimm is also responsible for handling civil cases and has \npresided\n\n[[Page S7335]]\n\nover bench and jury trials with the consent of the parties. Judge Grimm \nhas conducted settlement conferences, resolved discovery disputes, and \nhandled other nondispositive matters at the referral of the U.S. \ndistrict judges.\n  Judge Grimm has estimated that in his 15 years as a magistrate judge \nhe presided over approximately 50 civil trials, 150 criminal \nmisdemeanor trials, including jury and bench trials. He is well \nqualified and has the experience necessary to serve on our district \ncourt. He received a unanimous rating of well qualified, the highest \npossible rating for a judicial nominee from the American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. As I \npreviously mentioned, he received a voice vote of confidence from the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  I am absolutely confident that Judge Grimm possesses the \nqualifications, temperament, and passion for justice to make him an \noutstanding United States District Court judge for the District of \nMaryland.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for his confirmation here on the Senate \nfloor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the pending \nnomination of Judge Paul Grimm on which we will vote shortly.\n  I am so proud to be here to support the nomination of Judge Paul \nGrimm. He is a stellar Marylander, he has an outstanding legal mind, \nand he has been nominated to serve on the District Court of Maryland.\n  Senator Cardin and I recommended Judge Grimm to President Obama with \nthe utmost confidence in his abilities, talent, and competence for the \njob. The ABA agreed with us and gave him the highest rating of \n``unanimously well qualified.'' I wish to thank Senators Reid and \nMcConnell for breaking the logjam so that we could bring this to \neveryone's attention, and I commend Senator Leahy for the swift \nmovement through the committee process.\n  I have had an opportunity to recommend several judicial nominees and \nI take my advise-and-consent responsibility very seriously. I have four \ncriteria. My nominee must have absolute integrity, judicial competence \nand temperament, a commitment to core constitutional principles, and a \nhistory of civic engagement in Maryland, so the nominee is familiar \nwith the life and times of the people they will adjudicate over. I \nmention these standards often because I mean it.\n  Judge Grimm does exactly that. He brings the right hard-working \nvalues to the bench, and the necessary experience, having sharpened his \nlegal skills for many years as a litigator, a Judge Advocate General, a \nlawyer, a JAG officer, an indispensable asset to the District Court of \nMaryland, and as a chief magistrate judge.\n  Judge Grimm knows what it means to be of service to the legal \nprofession, to Maryland, and to the country. He is a public servant \nfirst and foremost. His father was in the military. Judge Grimm started \nvery early prosecuting courts martial while attending law school on an \nROTC scholarship. He then served in the JAG Corps for 3 years beginning \nat Aberdeen Proving Ground and later at the Pentagon. But it didn't end \nthere. He went on to serve as a Reserve JAG officer for 22 years, \nultimately retiring as a decorated lieutenant colonel.\n  His life and resume are a display of civic engagement, from his \nservice on numerous bar associations in Maryland, professional \norganizations, and, at the same time, he was a Boy Scout leader. He \nalso helped young students in high school learn how to do a mock court.\n  Let's go, though, to his being a good lawyer. Judge Grimm is known as \na trailblazer in the Maryland community. He is well respected not only \nfor his extensive writing and teaching but his commitment to the \nimprovement of the practice of law and the administration of justice. \nHe has spent his entire legal career in Maryland, and he is absolutely \nprepared for service on the court and for the court. He has already \nserved 16 years as a magistrate judge in the District Court of \nMaryland, and for 6 of those years he has been the chief magistrate.\n  Prior to taking the bench, Judge Grimm served 13 years as a litigator \nin private practice and handled primarily civil cases. He was an \nassistant attorney general for Maryland and a prosecutor in Baltimore \nCounty. Also, as my colleagues can see, his experience and service are \nunparalleled. Most recently, he served on the advisory committee for \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure since 2009 and was later \ndesignated as the chair of the Discovery Subcommittee.\n  He has been honored by the ABA, the Maryland Daily Record, which is a \nkind of legal paper in Maryland, and he has been twice recognized by \nthe University of Maryland Law School. By every index of what makes a \ngreat judge--absolute integrity, judicial temperament, legal \nexperience, well regarded by peers and all who appear before him--I \nthink this is a nominee we want to maintain a constitutional imperative \nof an independent judiciary, where judges come from the best background \nand have the best values. It is critical that we have judges who are \nable to do that, and I hope my colleagues join me in voting for Judge \nPaul Grimm.\n  I also hope with the other 19 nominees on the calendar, many of whom \nhave been voice-voted through the committee, we also confirm those \nduring this lameduck session.\n  Mr. President, I have completed my presentation on the outstanding \nqualifications of Judge Paul Grimm. I now yield the floor and note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield back all time on this side.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back all time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Paul William Grimm, of Maryland, to be United States District Judge \nfor the District of Maryland?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress find the following:\n       (1) Because of the great respect in which military service \n     and military awards are rightfully held by the public, false \n     claims of receiving such medals or serving in the military \n     are especially likely to be harmful and material to \n     employers, voters in deciding to whom paid elective positions \n     should be entrusted, and in the award of contracts.\n       (2) Military service and military awards are held in such \n     great respect that public and private decisions are correctly \n     influenced by claims of heroism.\n       (3) False claims of military service or military heroism \n     are an especially noxious means of obtaining something of \n     value because they are particularly likely to cause tangible \n     harm to victims of fraud.\n       (4) False claims of military service or the receipt of \n     military awards, if believed, are especially likely to \n     dispose people favorably toward the speaker.\n       (5) False claims of military service or the receipt of \n     military awards are particularly likely to be material and \n     cause people to part with money or property. Even if such \n     claims are unsuccessful in bringing about this result, they \n     still constitute attempted fraud.\n       (6) False claims of military service or the receipt of \n     military awards that are made to secure appointment to the \n     board of an organization are likely to cause harm to such \n     organization through their obtaining the services of an \n     individual who does not bring to that organization what he or \n     she claims, and whose falsehood, if discovered, would cause \n     the organization's donors concern that the organization's \n     board might not manage money honestly.\n       (7) The easily verifiable nature of false claims regarding \n     military service or the receipt of military awards, the \n     relative infrequency of such claims, and the fact that false \n     claims of having served in the military or received such \n     awards are rightfully condemned across the political \n     spectrum, it is especially likely that any law prohibiting \n     such false claims would not be enforced selectively.\n       (8) Congress may make criminal the false claim of military \n     service or the receipt of military awards based on its powers \n     under article I, section 8, clause 2 of the Constitution of \n     the United States, to raise and support armies, and article \n     I, section 8, clause 18 of the Constitution of the United \n     States, to enact necessary and proper measures to carry into \n     execution that power.\n\n     SEC. 5003.

I yield the floor and thank all our colleagues for their \ncooperation. We will continue until vote on final passage, which we \nexpect tomorrow, to clear additional amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, we continue, after a few hours' pause \ntoday because of the objection of one Senator by long distance. But I \nam very confident, with the cooperation of our colleagues, we can \nfinish this amendment process tomorrow, and I hope we can have the \ncooperation of all our colleagues.\n  We have tried very hard to make sure every amendment gets \nconsideration and is brought up. We have now approved well over 100 \namendments, and I think most Members have had at least one amendment \napproved so far. So I hope we can continue the cooperation and we can \nfinish this bill tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Tomorrow, a vote is scheduled on the Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities, and I would like to take a few \nminutes to talk about the upcoming vote.\n  The first thing I think we ought to understand is this is not \nanybody's treaty. It is not President Obama's treaty. It is not John \nKerry's treaty. It is not even Bob Dole's treaty, although he certainly \nis the person who has been deeply involved.\n  The vote on the treaty is the right thing to do on its merits. It is \nimportant to note a list of veterans groups in support.\n  I have not forgotten that 36 Republicans signed a letter opposing \nconsideration of any treaty during the lameduck, but there is no reason \nwe shouldn't have a vote. The letter says they would oppose \nconsideration, but we did have the motion to proceed. Some may be \nworried about passing a treaty in the lameduck session. The argument \nhas no basis in the Constitution or Senate practice. Since the 1970s \nalone, the Senate has approved treaties during lameduck sessions a \ntotal of 19 times. There is nothing special or different about lameduck \nsessions. So I would like to address a few of the misconceptions about \nthe treaty that I keep hearing.\n  It is true that the treaty establishes a committee, but that \ncommittee has exceedingly limited powers. It can review reports \nsubmitted by countries on the steps they have taken to implement the \nconvention, and it can make nonbinding recommendations for additional \nsteps, and that is it, nothing else. It can't require our Federal or \nState governments or courts to take any action. There is no threat to \nthe United States or our sovereignty from the committee.\n  With respect to abortion, this is a disabilities treaty. It has \nnothing to do with abortion and doesn't change our law on abortion in \nany way. Trying to turn this into an abortion debate is wrong on \nsubstance and bad politics.\n  I have heard people say that ratifying the disabilities convention \nwould take decisions out of parents' hands and let the U.N. or the \nFederal Government decide what is best for our children. That is just \nwrong. The treaty doesn't give the Federal Government or any State \ngovernment new powers with regard to children with disabilities. The \ntreaty cannot be used as a basis for a lawsuit in State or Federal \ncourt.\n  Former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh made this crystal clear in \nhis testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and in \nevery conversation that I have had with him. I wouldn't support the \ntreaty if it were any other way.\n  So let's take a step back and look at how this looks if America \nrejects this treaty. China has joined. Russia has joined. We are the \ncountry that set the standards on rights of the disabled. We want \neverybody to play by international rules. We lose credibility if we \nturn around and refuse to participate\n\n[[Page S7341]]\n\nin a treaty that merely asks other nations to live up to our standards \nand our rules.\n  We received a letter from the blind Chinese dissident Chen Cuangcheng \ntalking about the plight of the disabled around the world and what a \nstrong message it would send if the United States ratified this treaty. \nThere is no reason we can't say we lived up to our obligations. We need \nto step up and do the right thing--for Bob Dole and our veterans \nthroughout the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a \nletter from the internationally known blind Chinese dissident who, \nthank God, miraculously recently left China through the efforts of our \nState Department and our government.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n                                                November 26, 2012.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Chair, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Lugar,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators, I am writing you to personally ask for your \n     support for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \n     Disabilities (CRPD). As you know, my work on civil rights \n     began with trying to ensure that people with disabilities in \n     my home country of China were afforded the same rights as \n     everyone else. The CRPD is making this idea real in \n     significant ways around the world today. Worldwide, there are \n     over 1 billion people with disabilities--and 80% of them live \n     in developing countries. Disability rights is an issue that \n     the world cannot afford to overlook.\n       When the United States enacted the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act over twenty years ago, the idea of true \n     equality for people with disabilities became a reality. Many \n     nations have followed in America's footsteps and now are \n     coming together under shared principles of equality, respect \n     and dignity for people with disabilities as entailed in the \n     CRPD. The U.S.--which was instrumental in negotiating the \n     CRPD--can continue to advance both its principles and issues \n     of practical accessibility for its citizens and all people \n     around the world, and by ratifying the treaty, so take its \n     rightful place of leadership in the arena of human rights.\n       As I continue my studies in the United States, it is a \n     great pleasure to now learn firsthand how the U.S. developed \n     such a comprehensive and strong system of protection for its \n     citizens with disabilities. I am so hopeful that you will \n     support ratification and allow others to benefit from these \n     triumphs. Thank you for your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Chen Guangcheng.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will read from his letter:\n\n       When the United States enacted the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act over twenty years ago, the idea of true \n     equality for people with disabilities became a reality. Many \n     nations have followed in America's footsteps and now are \n     coming together under shared principles of equality, respect, \n     and dignity for people with disabilities as entailed in the \n     CRPD.

I am so hopeful that you will \n     support ratification and allow others to benefit from these \n     triumphs. Thank you for your leadership.\n\n  I couldn't say it with any more passion nor any more authority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I rise to address an issue that \nconcerns families and children and veterans and so many children in \nNorth Carolina and Ohio and around the country and around the world. I \nrise for millions of Americans, family members friends, loved ones, and \ncolleagues who experience some level of disability.\n  People living with disabilities have long been isolated, pushed to \nthe margins of society. An example of that is America's deaf community. \nThe deaf community strongly supports this treaty. Gallaudet University \nis a university founded in 1864 by an act of Congress, the charter \nsigned by President Lincoln. The university shows that people with \ndisabilities are capable of doing so much more to enrich our culture. I \nsit on the board, the only Senator in this body who sits on the board \nof Gallaudet, this great university. It is the only one of its kind in \nthe world. It is close to 150 years old. We know how important it is.\n  Many students at Gallaudet from other countries want to be able to go \nhome to the same kinds of accessibility they have experienced while \nstudying in the United States, but they do not have it in far too many \nplaces. A recent State Department report found that people with \ndisabilities remain one of the groups most at risk of being trafficked. \nThat should spur all of us to do what we can to ensure that every human \nbeing has the chance to reach her or his God-given potential.\n  Yet too many people with disabilities around the world and Americans \nabroad lack this protection. This includes being forced into low-wage \nemployment, being forced to beg for meals, being less likely to have \naccess to transportation and the justice system in whatever country \nthey happen to be located.\n  In America, we fought to pass the Americans With Disabilities Act, \nand we lead the world in services and accessibility for disabled \npeople. We passed it because democracy is only as vibrant as it is open \nto the participation of all citizens. That is why I was proud to \ncosponsor critical amendments to the ADA, the Americans With \nDisabilities Act, to make the definition of disability more inclusive. \nWe fought hard for the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 because access to a \ngood-paying job, to public transportation, to public accommodation \nshould be universal.\n  Some detractors say Americans are taken care of here at home; why \nshould we worry about discrimination that disabled people in other \ncountries might suffer? Dr. King wrote in ``Letter from the Birmingham \nJail'' that:\n\n       Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\n\n  He explained that:\n\n       We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied \n     in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one \n     directly, affects all indirectly.\n\n  If we are to maintain our global leadership, if we believe in \nAmerican exceptionalism, and if we are to strengthen our moral \nleadership, then surely we must ratify treaty No. 112-7 in support of \nthe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n  This is not a liberal or conservative issue. It is not a Republican \nor Democrat issue. This is a cause for people who fight for what is \nright. That is why some 300 organizations support ratification, \nincluding the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the \nWounded Warrior Project, the Hindu American Foundation, the Islamic \nSociety of North America, the Jewish Federation of North America, the \nNational Catholic Social Justice Lobby, the African Methodist Episcopal \nChurch, and Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n  Let me share a couple letters. Bernard from Franklin County, in the \ncenter of my State, wrote:\n\n       I am concerned about recent grumblings . . . I have a lot \n     of regard for the ADA and a keen awareness of discrimination \n     against people with disabilities.\n       When will the Senate take up this U.N. Resolution? What can \n     I do to help convince oppositional Senators that this is an \n     important and necessary resolution for people with \n     disabilities, especially our Nation's veterans?\n\n  Bernard, my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Senator McCain, \nformer majority leader Bob Dole, both of whom served our country \nhonorably in the Armed Forces, and 21 veterans organizations agree with \nyou. Senator McCain wrote: ``Ratifying this treaty affirms our \nleadership on disability rights and shows the rest of the world our \nleadership commitment continues.''\n  This should be an opportunity for all Americans to come together and \nshow the world we are committed to ensuring the basic dignity of every \nhuman being.\n\n[[Page S7342]]\n\n  An advocate for people with disabilities, Deborah Kendrick of \nCincinnati, recently wrote that supporting the U.N. Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities is ``the good old-fashioned right \nthing to do.''\n  She is absolutely right. The CRPD is an antidiscrimination treaty, a \ncivil rights issue, a human rights issue. It embraces the values of our \nown Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  It will not affect U.S. law and does not infringe upon U.S. \nsovereignty. Ratifying this treaty does allow us to reassert our \nleadership globally on disability rights. It will give us a seat at the \ntable as parties to the convention grapple with how best to implement \nit. This treaty is important for Americans with disabilities, including \nsoldiers and veterans when they work abroad, study abroad or simply \ntravel abroad. That is why I urge my colleagues to join in ratifying \nthis treaty, to stand up for people with disabilities in Ohio, \nthroughout America, and around the world.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/03/senate-section/article/S7342-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

They are great \nColoradans in their own right, and their mission to bring our Northern \nColorado veterans to Washington, D.C. is truly commendable.

Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring Larry Hagman, who passed away\n\n[[Page S7343]]\n\nlast week in Dallas at the age of 81. Like most Americans and millions \naround the world, I knew Larry Hagman as J.R. Ewing, the best loved \nvillain in television history. But I was also fortunate to know Larry \nas a passionate advocate and friend, and I will miss him.\n  J.R. was larger than life, but Larry Hagman's life was much more than \nhis most famous character. He was a devoted family man, a true friend, \nand an active citizen who worked with me to ensure that our families \nare protected from pollution and toxins. He also worked for years to \nfight lung cancer and promote alternative energy. His tireless \ncommitment to improving his community and country continued until the \nvery end of his extraordinary life. Just last month he launched the \nLarry Hagman Foundation to promote the educational benefits of theater, \nvisual arts, music and dance and to fund organizations providing these \ninstructional programs for low-income children.\n  Born in Fort Worth, Larry was brought up by his maternal grandmother \nin Los Angeles. After attending a series of boarding schools, he moved \nback to Texas to live with his father, attorney Benjamin Hagman, whose \nclients later helped shape the character of J.R. Ewing. In 1951, \nLarry's mother--the great stage actress Mary Martin--got him a small \nrole in the London production of South Pacific. A year later, Larry \njoined the Air Force and stayed in Europe as a director of USO \ntheatrical shows.\n  After working in New York theater and television, Larry Hagman became \na TV star in the 1960s as Major Tony Nelson in the popular comedy \nseries ``I Dream of Jeannie.'' In the 1970s, he appeared in numerous \nmovies and television shows before landing the role of a lifetime on \nthe primetime soap opera ``Dallas.''\n  As the charming and conniving businessman J.R. Ewing, Larry Hagman \nwas the best-known television actor on earth. In 1980, between two \nseasons of ``Dallas,'' hundreds of millions of fans in 57 countries \nanxiously awaited the answer to the most famous question in TV history: \n``Who Shot J.R.?'' Last year, Larry returned to television to begin a \nnew series of ``Dallas,'' which became a hit on the TNT network; he was \nat work on the new season when he died.\n  On behalf of the people of California and Larry's millions of fans \nand admirers, I send my appreciation and condolences to his wife, Maj; \nhis children, Preston and Kristina; and his five granddaughters. I know \nthat they--and all of us--will miss this marvelous man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/03/senate-section/article/S7343-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  STOCKTON GURDWARA 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating the 100th anniversary of the Stockton Gurdwara, the first \nSikh temple in the United States.\n  In the 1890s, the first Sikh immigrants, mostly from Punjab in \nnorthwestern India, arrived at Angel Island Immigration Station. These \npioneering immigrants had crossed the vast Pacific and came to the \nshores of California in hopes of a better and freer life.\n  The San Joaquin Valley of California, with its Mediterranean climate \nand abundance of fertile soil and arable land reminded the new \nimmigrants of their native Punjab, and became a place where many of \nthem settled to raise crops that were native to Punjab.\n  A tight-knit community, the Sikh residents of the San Joaquin Valley \nformed a committee to raise money for a temple. In September 1912, a \nplot of land was purchased on South Grant Street in Stockton to build \nthe first Sikh temple in the United States. When the temple was \nconsecrated on November 22, 1915, the Stockton Record reported that it \nwas celebrated with impressive ceremonies. The Stockton Gurdwara became \nthe birthplace of Sikhism in America.\n  Over the past century, the Stockton Gurdwara has been a site of both \nreligious and historical significance. It was home to America's first \nPunjabi-language newspaper and to the Ghadar Party, which supported \nIndian independence for decades before it was achieved. Bhagat Singh \nThind, a civil rights advocate and the first Sikh to serve in the \nUnited States Army during World War I, and Dalip Singh Saund, the first \nAsian American elected to Congress, were members of the Stockton \nGurdwara.\n  Today, the Stockton Gurdwara remains the spiritual home to \ngenerations of Sikh Americans in the San Joaquin Valley. It also stands \nas a testament to the rich history, invaluable contributions, and \nprogress of the Sikh community in America.\n  I congratulate the Stockton Gurdwara on its 100th anniversary and \nwish its members continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/03/senate-section/article/S7343-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 6429.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing the \n     Congress of the United States to provide funding to the \n     United States Army Corps of Engineers for dredging harbors of \n     refuge and repairing and maintaining seawalls of harbors of \n     refuge in Michigan; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 325\n\n       Whereas, Regular dredging and maintenance and repair of \n     breakwater seawalls is needed to keep recreational harbors \n     open to boaters in Michigan and the other Great Lakes states. \n     Natural shoaling exacerbated by continued low lake levels has \n     left many recreational harbors too shallow for boaters to \n     enter safely, which is jeopardizing charter fishing \n     operations, local communities, and other businesses that \n     depend on boating. Portage Lake Harbor, Leland Harbor, and \n     Arcadia Harbor are just a few of the fifteen Great Lakes \n     harbors of concern that are dangerously shallow for boaters; \n     and\n       Whereas, Not only is dredging and maintenance and repair of \n     breakwater seawalls needed to accommodate recreational \n     boaters, but also to provide safe harbor to all types of \n     boaters, including commercial shippers. Maintaining harbors \n     of refuge is a requirement to ensure that our obligation of \n     providing safe shipping lanes for trade is met. With Portage \n     Lake Harbor being one of the four Michigan harbors of refuge \n     along the western side of the state and one of the thirteen \n     statewide, it is a necessity that it be maintained and \n     dredged to a proper depth; and\n       Whereas, The federal budget did not include funding for \n     dredging harbors of refuge and maintenance and repair of \n     breakwater seawalls of harbors of refuge maintained in the \n     past by the United States Army Corp of Engineers. This lack \n     of funding will cripple the Great Lakes recreational boating \n     and charter fishing industry, impacting millions of boaters, \n     businesses, and communities that they support. Because no \n     funding has been provided, local Great Lakes communities have \n     had to acquire private funding to be able to keep tourism \n     alive during the boating season; and\n       Whereas, The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers never completed a \n     replacement seawall at Portage Lake Harbor begun in 2003. The \n     seawall is now undermined, further narrowing the shipping \n     channel. The Army Corps has designated the seawall as facing \n     ``imminent failure''; and\n       Whereas, It is necessary, for the safety of commercial \n     shippers and all other Great Lakes traffic, to maintain \n     harbors of refuge and, therefore, it should be deemed worthy \n     to appropriate funds from the federal Harbor Maintenance \n     Trust Fund, which holds surplus funds in excess of $8 \n     billion, to Great Lakes harbors. The relatively small federal \n     investment needed to maintain these harbors is insignificant \n     compared to the billions of dollars and thousands of jobs \n     generated; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to provide \n     funding to the United States Army Corps of Engineers for \n     dredging harbors of refuge and repairing and maintaining \n     seawalls of harbors of refuge in Michigan, particularly \n     Portage Lake Harbor located in Onekama, MI; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we call on Congress to include funding for \n     the United States Army Corps of Engineers to rebuild and \n     complete the Portage Lake Harbor seawall; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-134. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Rhode Island urging Congress to pass and send to the states a \n     constitutional amendment permitting state and federal \n     regulation and restriction of independent political \n     expenditures; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        Joint Resolution S. 2656\n\n        Whereas, The growing influence of large independent \n     political expenditures by corporations and wealthy \n     individuals is a great and growing concern to the people of \n     the United States and the State of Rhode Island; and\n        Whereas, In a democracy the assurance of a fair and \n     uncorrupted election process is of the utmost importance, and \n     the Rhode Island General Assembly believes that it is a \n     legitimate and vital role of government to regulate \n     independent political expenditures by corporations, unions, \n     and wealthy individuals; and\n\n[[Page S7345]]\n\n        Whereas, In fulfillment of this important role the \n     government of the United States and a majority of states have \n     regulated and restricted independent political expenditures \n     by corporations; and\n        Whereas, In 2010, the Supreme Court of the United States \n     decided by a bare majority in Citizens United v. Federal \n     Elections Commission that the First Amendment of the \n     Constitution of the United States prohibits restrictions on \n     the use of corporate and union treasury funds for \n     electioneering; and\n        Whereas, Citizens United was a dramatic reversal of \n     established Supreme Court precedent, and overturned decades \n     of statutes enacted by Congress and numerous state \n     legislatures; and\n        Whereas, Citizens United has served as precedent for \n     further legal decisions harming our democratic system of \n     government, including SpecchNow.org v. FEC, which allows \n     wealthy individuals to anonymously channel unlimited \n     political expenditures through Super PACs; and\n        Whereas, In the wake of Citizens United there has been an \n     exponential increase in large independent political \n     expenditures by corporations and wealthy individuals which \n     threatens the integrity of the election process, corrupts our \n     candidates, dilutes the power of individual voters and \n     distort the public discourse; and\n        Whereas, Article V of the United States Constitution \n     empowers and obligates the people of the United States of \n     America to use the constitutional amendment process to amend \n     their constitution; now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That this General Assembly of the State of Rhode \n     Island and Providence Plantations respectfully urges the \n     Congress of the United States to pass and send to the states \n     for ratification an amendment to the constitution to \n     effectively overturn the holding of Citizens United and it's \n     progeny and to permit the governments of the United States \n     and the several states to regulate and restrict independent \n     political expenditures by corporations and wealthy \n     individuals; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be and he hereby is \n     authorized and directed to transmit duly certified copies of \n     this resolution to the President and Vice President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Minority \n     Leader of the United States Senate, and to each Senator and \n     Representative from Rhode Island in the Congress of the \n     United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-135.

Traditional sources for vessel names customarily \n     encompassed such categories as geographic locations in the \n     United States; historic sites, battles, and ships; naval and \n     military heroes and leaders; and noted individuals who made \n     distinguished contributions to United States national \n     security.\n       (3) These customs and traditions provide appropriate and \n     necessary standards for the naming of vessels of the Navy.\n       (b) Notice to Congress.--Section 7292 of title 10, United \n     States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(d)(1) The Secretary of the Navy may not announce or \n     implement any proposal to name a vessel of the Navy until 30 \n     days after the date on which the Secretary submits to the \n     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives a report setting forth such proposal.\n       ``(2) Each report under this subsection shall describe the \n     justification for the proposal covered by such report in \n     accordance with the standards referred to in section 1024(a) \n     of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2013.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--This section and the amendment made by \n     this section shall go into effect on the date that is 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3294.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamps \n     (commonly known as ``duck stamps'') were created in 1934 as \n     Federal licenses required for hunting migratory waterfowl;\n       (2)(A) duck stamps are a vital tool for wetland \n     conservation;\n       (B) 98 percent of the receipts from duck stamp sales are \n     used to acquire important migratory bird breeding, migration, \n     and wintering habitat, which are added to the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System; and\n       (C) those benefits extend to all wildlife, not just ducks;\n       (3) since its inception, the Federal duck stamp program \n     has--\n       (A) generated more than $500,000,000;\n       (B) preserved more than 5,000,000 acres of wetland and \n     wildlife habitat; and\n       (C) been called one of the most successful conservation \n     programs ever initiated;\n       (4)(A) since 1934, when duck stamps cost $1, the price has \n     been increased 7 times to the price in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act of $15, which took effect in 1991; and\n       (B) the price of the duck stamp has not increased since \n     1991, the longest single period without an increase in \n     program history; and\n       (5)(A) with the price unchanged during the 20-year period \n     preceding the date of enactment of this Act, duck stamps have \n     lost 40 percent of their value based on the consumer price \n     index, while the United States Fish and Wildlife Service \n     reports the price of land in targeted wetland areas has \n     tripled from an average of $306 to $1,091 per acre; and\n       (B) a duck stamp would need to cost more than $24 as of the \n     date of enactment of this Act just to maintain the earlier \n     buying power of the stamp.\n\n     SEC. 3662.
