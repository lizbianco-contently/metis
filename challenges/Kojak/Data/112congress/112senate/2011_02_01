Mr. President, a lot of people are talking this morning \nabout a judge in Florida regarding his opinion on the health reform \nlaw. I wish to talk about the law very briefly and then talk about the \neffort to take away the rights that are in the law that are now \nprevalent in the land.\n  The health reform bill has already saved lives and saved lots of \nmoney. It is saving lives because children are not getting their \ninsurance taken away, as happened before we passed this law. They can \nstay on their parents' health insurance plans until they are 26, and \neven younger kids can't get kicked off their plans because they have a \npre-existing condition such as asthma or diabetes. Older Americans are \nhealthier because we are starting to close the coverage gap on \nMedicare, which means they can have a wellness check for nothing--it \ndoesn't cost anything--which means, as far as the Medicare doughnut \nhole, seniors can finally afford the prescription drugs they had to \nskip or split before we passed this law.\n  Saving money. Last week, we saw how much this law is helping cut down \nfraud in the health insurance industry.\n\n[[Page S372]]\n\nWe have recovered more than $4 billion so far, and the law will keep \ncracking down on those who are taking advantage of the vulnerable. As \nsmall businesses in Nevada and across the country have discovered, we \nare cutting taxes for businesses that give their employees health care.\n  These consequences of the health reform law--I have mentioned only a \nfew of them: save lives, save money, and save Medicare as we promised--\nare just the tip of the iceberg. As more parts of the law go into \neffect, it will do even more good; even more lives and more money will \nbe saved. It is important to remember this context when we talk about \nthe opinion handed down yesterday in Florida.\n  Two Federal judges have ruled in favor of the law, two have ruled \nagainst it. Lawsuits and lawmakers' efforts to repeal this bill are \nnothing more than attempts to raise taxes on small businesses, add more \nthan $1.5 trillion to the deficit, force seniors to pay more for their \nprescriptions, and let insurance companies once again stand in the way \nof a child and the medical care he or she needs.\n  Health care reform is complex, but this debate is very simple. We put \npatients in control of their health care. Repeal would be insurance \ncompanies back in charge. We cannot afford it, not with our wallets and \ncertainly not with our lives and health.\n  Let me spend just a minute on jobs. The health reform bill is about \njobs. I was visiting with someone from George Washington University, \nthe medical department. As I walked in, she said: You know, because of \nthe health care bill, we are going to hire 500 new physicians. I went \nback and told my staff, and they said: Oh, no, that couldn't be true. I \nhad my staff go back and check with the woman who told me that, and it \nis true. That is just one facility.\n  Also about jobs, we need to look to the future. Democrats are working \nto create jobs and strengthen the middle class, and we are starting \ntoday with the first jobs bill of this Congress. This bill, which will \nmodernize Americans' air travel, creates and protects more than 280,000 \njobs. We are improving the infrastructure and reducing costly passenger \ndelays. We are going to have a passengers' bill of rights. This is the \nkind of commonsense solution that creates jobs while making our economy \nmore efficient and America more competitive. This is a bipartisan bill. \nWe need to stop refighting yesterday's fights and start strengthening \nour future. We are ready to work, to get the American people back to \nwork, and I am hopeful and confident our Republican colleagues will \njoin us in starting with this jobs bill on the floor today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S372-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is no secret that most Americans \nopposed the health care bill that Democrats jammed through Congress \nlast March. It is also no secret that Democrats would like to move past \nit. But the fact is, the more Americans learn about this bill the less \nthey like it, and the more urgent it becomes for those who pledged to \nrepeal and replace it to follow through.\n  Opposition to the bill continues to build. And when two Federal \ncourts in a row rule that this bill is unconstitutional and we learn \nevery day of some other way it is not only making health care worse but \nalso hurting jobs and the economy, it is no wonder more Americans \nsupport repeal than oppose it, and that the percentage of those who say \nthey support full repeal is higher now than ever. Americans are \noutraged that the promises they were made about this bill have turned \nout to be empty. And court rulings like the one out of Florida \nyesterday only add to the urgency of scrapping this bill and starting \nover.\n  Leave aside for a moment all the broken promises. The first \nrequirement of this law or any law is that it at least be \nconstitutional. This bill fails to meet that basic test.\n  And, as yesterday's ruling concluded, it can't be fixed.\n  This entire bill hinges on its core requirement that every citizen \npurchase health insurance. If that is unconstitutional, and two Federal \ncourts now say it is, then the whole thing needs to be scrapped.\n  But of course we knew that already, based on all the other chaos this \nbill has wrought.\n  Let's review.\n  The President said as recently as last week that this law would slow \nrising health care costs--that it would bend the cost-curve down. Yet \njust 2 days later, his own actuary at the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services said that Federal health spending would rise by \nhundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years as a result of \nthis bill.\n  The President said again and again that Americans would be able to \nkeep the plans they had. Yet since the bill's passage, business after \nbusiness has announced that it would rather pay a fine to the \ngovernment than cover the health insurance costs of employees that \nwould grow under the new mandates and regulations, and millions of \nseniors are now expected to lose access to the Medicare Advantage plans \nthey know and like.\n  As recently as last week, the President said: ``This Law Will Lower \nPremiums.'' Yet since its passage we continually hear the opposite: \ninsurers across the country are raising premiums to cover the cost of \nall the new mandates they will have to comply with. One insurer in \nCalifornia recently stunned policyholders by announcing it would be \nincreasing rates by as much as 59 percent for tens of thousands of \ncustomers starting next month. Hikes are also expected in Iowa, \nVermont, and Connecticut. In Washington State, one father of five was \nrecently told his $532 monthly premium could nearly triple next year. \nHe said that when he heard the news he just sat back and said: ``You've \ngot to be kidding me.''\n  It is a good way to sum up how many Americans have felt about this \nbill all along.\n  And that is to say nothing of the effect this bill has had on the \neconomy and jobs. Despite the empty promises we have heard from \npoliticians about this bill being a job-creator, we continue to hear \njust the opposite from the businesses themselves. Job creators are \ntelling us that all of the bill's new mandates and fees are stifling \nbusinesses and making it even harder for them to start hiring again.\n  The National Federation of Independent Business says that if this \nbill stays intact it will ``stifle the ability [of businesses] to hire, \ngrow and invest. . . .'' ``Simply put,'' the NFIB said in a recent \nletter, ``Congress must repeal [this bill] immediately.'' To take just \none example, Abbott Laboratories said last week it plans to cut nearly \n2,000 jobs in response to changes in the health care industry, \nincluding this bill.\n  As I said, yesterday's ruling out of Florida, only adds to the \nurgency of repeal. As if it weren't enough that this bill increases \nhealth care costs, increases insurance premiums, and is leading people \nto lose coverage they already have and like, it is also \nunconstitutional--something many opponents of the bill, including me, \nhave been arguing all along. The state can no more compel Americans to \nbuy health insurance under the Constitution than it can compel them to \nbuy vitamins, even if it concluded they would be good for our health. \nWhile Congress may have the power to regulate commercial activity, no \ncourt in our nation's history has ever interpreted that to mean that \nCongress can regulate commercial inactivity as well, which is precisely \nwhat the health care bill would do.\n  Most Americans have opposed this bill from the start because they \nwere skeptical of all the claims that were being made about what it \nwould do. The process that was used to jam it through made it even less \npopular. But the reality has been even worse than people feared. It \nviolates the Constitution--which is reason enough to repeal it--it is \ndriving up premiums, increasing costs, and driving people off the plans \nthey have. And Americans are just as outraged by the special waivers \nthe administration is giving out to select groups as it was by the \nspecial deals. The special deals are reminiscent of the deals it gave \nout to lawmakers who agreed to vote for it. In other words, the \nimplementation of this bill is no better than the process used to pass \nit.\n  At this point, it would be a dereliction of duty if Republicans \ndidn't fight\n\n[[Page S373]]\n\nfor repeal. We made a promise to our constituents that we would vote to \nrepeal this bill on their behalf and that is just what we intend to do.\n  The importance of a repeal vote becomes more evident every day. \nAmericans view it as an important decision point--a marker that shows \nwe are serious about a return to limited government. On that point, it \nshould be clear where Republicans stand. Every one of us voted against \nthe bill. Every one of us voted for repeal after that. And this week, \nevery Republican reaffirmed his or her commitment to doing it again.\n  Democrats made a lot of promises about this bill. Virtually every one \nhas proved to be empty. Republicans have made one promise: that we \nwould work to repeal it and replace it with common-sense reforms that \nlower costs, protect job creation and that people actually want. It is \na promise we will keep.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S373-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AFGHANISTAN VISIT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have entered our tenth year of \nfighting in Afghanistan, and we can never express our gratitude enough \nto the heroic men and women of our Armed Forces who continue the battle \nthere. Many of them--nearly one-fifth of all U.S. forces in that \ncountry--are from units based in Kentucky: Fort Campbell, Fort Knox, \nthe Kentucky National Guard, the Marine Corps and the Reserves.\n  I recently led a Congressional delegation to the region and spent \nsome time in Afghanistan to see up close the progress our forces are \nmaking there in clearing out the Taliban and creating the opportunity \nfor Afghan security forces to assume greater responsibility. During my \nvisit, I had the honor of meeting many of the servicemembers from \nKentucky. I told them that we are proud of them, we support them, we \nthank them for their service, and we pray for their safe return.\n  Forces in Afghanistan from Kentucky units number more than 18,000 \nstrong. They have seen much military success--but in the process, many \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.\n  The 101st Airborne Division, based out of Fort Campbell and known as \nthe Screaming Eagles, endured a particularly hard year, losing more \nthan 100 soldiers since last March. In fact, nearly one out of five \nAmerican lives lost in Afghanistan in the past year has been lost from \nthe 101st. The men and women who stood beside them honor their \nsacrifice by continuing the fight.\n  After a long deployment, many of the soldiers from the 101st are due \nto return home over the next few months, just as their brothers-in-arms \nfrom Fort Knox are deploying. About 3,500 soldiers from the 3rd Brigade \nCombat Team, 1st Infantry Division and the 703rd Explosive Ordnance \nDisposal Detachment will arrive in Afghanistan in the next few weeks or \nare already there. It is the biggest deployment from Fort Knox since \nWorld War II.\n  Hundreds of servicemembers from the Kentucky Air and Army National \nGuard are performing critical missions in Afghanistan as well. The \n123rd Airlift Wing, the 2123rd Transportation Company, the 20th Special \nForces Group and a Kentucky Guard Agricultural Development Team have \nall recently sent men and women to the fight, some who have served as \nmany as six tours.\n  It was my honor to meet some of these brave warriors in person this \nmonth when I visited the headquarters of the 101st Airborne Division at \nBagram Air Base in Afghanistan and also during my stop at Camp \nLeatherneck in the southern part of that country, the outpost for a \nnumber of Kentucky Marines.\n  These extraordinary men and women leave their loved ones thousands of \nmiles behind and put on their country's uniform every day, with their \nlives in the balance. They have seen their friends and fellow soldiers \nand Marines make the ultimate sacrifice, and yet they fight on to \naccomplish a difficult mission. And they continue to make their \ncountry, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and this Senator very proud.\n  When we honor our servicemembers, we also honor their families, who \nendure the long months with a loved one gone and in harm's way. This \ncountry would not have the finest fighting force in the world without \ntheir sacrifice and support as well.\n  It is brave servicemembers like the ones I got to meet who keep this \ncountry free. When both the Senate and the House of Representatives met \nin joint session recently to hear the President deliver his State of \nthe Union address, we did so under the cloak of freedom that these \nheroes provide. America is grateful for their service and their \nsacrifice.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S373-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have come a long way in 1 year.\n  On December 24, 2009--1 day before Christmas--this body passed a \nradical overhaul of our Nation's health care system. That is right. The \nmajority passed ObamaCare on Christmas Eve.\n  It was not this body's finest moment. It was not the administration's \nfinest moment. And I expect that this debate will go down in history \nfor its persistent lack of attention to the considered views of \nordinary Americans--Americans who rejected ObamaCare's giant new \nentitlement expansions and the job-killing taxes haphazardly cobbled \ntogether to pay for them.\n  It did not have to be this way. In the midst of the greatest fiscal \ncollapse since the Great Depression, Americans wanted Democrats, who \ncontrolled all of the levers of power in Washington, to focus on job \ncreation. Instead, like teenagers set loose when mom and dad leave \ntown, they did what they wanted to, and focused on a government \ntakeover of the Nation's health care system.\n  Surprising only the most ideologically driven, support for ObamaCare \ncratered during the townhall meetings of August 2009. The message was \nloud and clear. Our health care system, and in particular the \ngovernment policies that contribute to unsustainable inflation in the \nhealth care sector, might be in need of reform. But the solution to our \nproblems is not additional government regulation and control of health \ncare delivery by Washington bureaucrats. And the solution is most \ndefinitely not to be found in the billions of dollars in new taxes, \nmost of which will be passed through to American families in the form \nof higher premiums.\n  For those who did not deliberately put on blinders, the wishes of \ntheir constituents were obvious.\n  Stop the push for ObamaCare and move onto fixing the economy.\n  But the Senate did not listen.\n  Instead, prodded ahead by an administration that saw the great \nliberal dream of government-run health care slipping, the long march \ncontinued.\n  First, the Democratic majority cut short the Finance Committee's \nbipartisan negotiations.\n  Then, heads down, the majority plowed forward on the floor, allowing \nvirtually no meaningful amendments.\n  And before going home for Christmas, it passed the most sweeping \nreform of the Nation's economy in over 70 years without a single \nRepublican vote.\n  Every Democratic senator supported the bill.\n  Not one Republican did.\n  When ObamaCare passed the Senate, its proponents assumed it was on \nthe\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\nglidepath to enactment. But the American people had a different idea.\n  Our national unemployment rate was 10.2 percent--the highest in 26 \nyears.\n  The American people understood that at a moment of historic economic \nchallenges, the last thing the country needed was another budget-\nbusting entitlement and sky-high taxes.\n  And just about 1 month later, this message was delivered again. In a \nnew shot heard across the world, our colleague, the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts, Scott Brown, was elected in a very clear referendum on \nthe Democrats' health care bill.\n  The verdict of the American people, if the previous summer's \ntownhalls left any doubt, was now crystal clear.\n  The push for ObamaCare must end.\n  Yet, the administration refused to yield.\n  They thought the people would eventually come to embrace the elegance \nof ObamaCare. If only the messaging was better, Americans would \nappreciate all of the good things that Washington politicians and \nbureaucrats had to offer them.\n  So after taking time to regroup and weigh their options, Democrats \ndecided to defy the American people yet again.\n  A little over a year ago, the President hosted a summit at the White \nHouse and began his final push for his federalizing of American health \ncare.\n  The resulting display was ugly. Americans, already revolted by the \ndeals cut in this Chamber to secure the bare number of votes needed to \npass the bill, now witnessed historic arm twisting and desperate \nefforts in the House to deny the obvious--that ObamaCare represented an \nunprecedented intrusion of the Federal government into the lives of \ncitizens and clearly was a massive burden on taxpayers.\n  And so it passed.\n  And ObamaCare became law.\n  And the administration set about writing the thousands of pages of \nregulations that would govern how American businesses provide health \nbenefits to their employees.\n  Fast forward to November of 2010.\n  The American people did not forget their snubbing by self-proclaimed \nprogressive Democrats who in fact ignored the will of the people at \nevery opportunity during the ObamaCare debate.\n  At voting booths across the country, they made clear to those \ncongressmen and Senators who provided the votes for this job-destroying \nhealth care bill that such high-handed, illiberal behavior was not \nacceptable in a democratic republic.\n  Fast forward one more time.\n  Yesterday, barely 13 months after ObamaCare passed the Senate, and \nless than one year since it became law, the entire scheme was struck \ndown in Federal court.\n  In a triumph for both personal liberty and the American Constitution, \nthe individual mandate was found unconstitutional and ObamaCare was \nstruck down.\n  Not part of ObamaCare.\n  All of ObamaCare.\n  Not surprisingly, the administration and its special interest allies \nresponded with the same derision toward ordinary American citizens that \nhas been on display throughout this debate. Instead of acknowledging \nthe obvious--that ObamaCare represents a massive departure from any \ntraditional understanding of limited government--White House officials \nwent on the attack, calling the decision outside of the mainstream and \nridiculing its reasoning.\n  Really?\n  Millions and millions of Americans believe that provisions essential \nto the operation of ObamaCare are unconstitutional intrusions on \npersonal liberty that vastly expand the power of the Federal \ngovernment.\n  They understand that the justification for the individual mandate by \nObamaCare's proponents essentially removes any limits on the power of \nthe Federal government to regulate personal and economic decisions.\n  Twenty-six states participated in this challenge to ObamaCare.\n  Thirty-two Members of this body, including myself, signed an amicus \nbrief challenging the constitutionality of ObamaCare.\n  But, according to the administration's narrative, we are the ones who \nare out of the mainstream.\n  This administration came into office buoyed by the good will of the \nAmerican people and carrying banners of bipartisanship.\n  Two years later, after the politically disastrous decision to \noverhaul one-seventh of the Nation's economy with virtually no \nRepublican support, they are blaming the victim.\n  After a Federal judge looked at this tough issue and determined that \nkey elements of ObamaCare represented an unprecedented and \nunconstitutional expansion of the national government, the problem \nremains--as it always is for liberals--the people.\n  Their views are just not sophisticated enough to grasp ObamaCare's \nconsistency with a government of limited and enumerated powers.\n  The Democrats continue to think that if only they focus group \nObamaCare better, they will get the messaging right.\n  The American people will learn to love it.\n  I don't think so.\n  The American people get it. I know my constituents in Utah do.\n  In an article yesterday in ``Politico'', Patrick Caddell and Douglas \nSchoen highlighted the reasons for the public's deepening disdain for \nObamaCare. According to them, it is possible that no major piece of \nlegislation ``has created the continued, vehement public opposition \nthat health care has provoked since the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854.''\n  In their view, ``[t]here is one big underlying factor that continues \nto cause many Americans to oppose the health care bill: Its passage was \nanti-democratic. If the Republicans' campaign slogan of 1854 was the \nCrime Against Kansas, in 2010 it would be the Crime Against \nDemocracy.''\n  Americans know that the Senate bill was 2,074 pages long.\n  They know it authorized 70 government programs.\n  They know it delegated regulatory power to the Obama administration \n1,697 times.\n  They know it cut $465 billion from Medicare at a time when it already \nfaced a $38 trillion unfunded liability.\n  They know the bill took from one already unsustainable entitlement to \npay for a brand new entitlement.\n  They know it raised taxes by over $550 billion, repeatedly violating \nthe President's pledge not to raise taxes on middle class families.\n  They know ObamaCare will destroy 695,000 American jobs at a time when \nmillions of Americans are looking for work.\n  They know the Medicaid expansions threaten to bankrupt the States, \nwith CBO estimating that the Medicaid expansion will cost American \ntaxpayers $435 billion over 10 years.\n  They know the total cost of ObamaCare is $2.6 trillion.\n  And they know we can not afford it.\n  To borrow from Justice Scalia, the American people despise ObamaCare \nbecause the American people love democracy and the American people are \nnot fools. They know that this law was enacted in a totally partisan \nmanner, and over the loud opposition of a majority of Americans.\n  And they know that the partisans promoting ObamaCare were not, and \nare not, forthright when they say it is budget neutral.\n  ObamaCare cuts $155 billion from hospitals.\n  It cuts $202 billion from 11 million seniors on Medicare Advantage.\n  It cuts nearly $15 billion from nursing homes.\n  It cuts nearly $40 billion from home health agencies.\n  It cuts nearly $7 billion from hospices.\n  But these cuts don't go toward strengthening Medicare, a program with \ncatastrophic unfunded liabilities. Rather, Democrats poured the savings \nfrom these cuts back into a brand new entitlement program.\n  Furthermore, so-called comprehensive health care reform managed to \nneglect the pressing need for a permanent doc fix. Yet, CBO's most \nrecent estimate is that a long-term doc fix freezing Medicare payment \nrates at 2011 levels would raise the deficit by $249 billion, not \ncounting an additional $53 billion in debt service obligations.\n  Not surprisingly, an Associated Press fact check of the President's \nState of the Union address concluded: ``the idea that Obama's health \ncare law saves money for the government is based on some arguable \nassumptions.''\n\n[[Page S375]]\n\n  That might qualify for the understatement of the year so far.\n  The likelihood that ObamaCare will not, as its advocates claimed, \nsave the government money was confirmed again at a hearing last week by \nthe CMS Chief Actuary Richard Foster. He testified that the law will \nnot likely hold costs down, and that contrary to the President's \nmantra, everyone will not be able to keep their insurance coverage if \nthey like it.\n  In response, the White House political operation attacked the \nAdministration's own nonpartisan professional expert, stating in a blog \npost: ``Once again, we disagree . . . History shows that it is possible \nto implement measures that will save money for Medicare and the Federal \ngovernment.''\n  Who are you going to believe?\n  The chief actuary at CMS or a White House political operative?\n  The average American citizen might not have a Ph.D. in economics. But \nAmericans do understand that massive new entitlement programs do not \nsave money. In their guts, they know that former CBO director Doug \nHoltz-Eakin is right when he concludes that repeal of this flawed law \nwould actually reduce the deficit by $300 billion.\n  Ultimately, all we want is a vote on repeal.\n  Last week, some of my Democratic colleagues came to the floor to \nadvocate for rules changes that would have substantially limited the \nrights of the minority to debate.\n  The filibuster, they insisted, is an affront to democracy and \nmajority rule.\n  Well, let them put their money where their mouths are.\n  All we are asking for is an up or down vote on repeal of ObamaCare.\n  This is what the people want.\n  Ultimately, you have to ask why the Democratic majority would deny us \nthis vote.\n  I think I know the answer. It has a great deal to do with members of \nthe caucus who know their constituents hate this law. Yet, these \nMembers are torn between two masters. On the one hand are their \nconservative constituents. And on the other are the liberal interest \ngroups who supported the government takeover of the Nation's health \ncare system.\n  Unfortunately, the people again stand to lose in this calculus.\n  I understand that the conventional wisdom is that my colleagues and I \nare pursuing a symbolic act.\n  The guardians of the conventional wisdom opine that attempts to \nrepeal ObamaCare might make for good theatre, but are senseless \nexercises.\n  In my view, this attitude demonstrates a profound lack of respect for \nthe citizens of a democratic republic.\n  Over time, given the power of ideas and an engaged citizenry, \ninitially symbolic acts have a way of becoming law. It might not happen \novernight, but citizens--exercising their constitutional rights of \npetition and redress--have a way of reminding even the most hardened of \npartisan politicians that their job is to represent their constituents.\n  I have no doubt that some scoff at our efforts to repeal this bill.\n  But I rest easy knowing that I am standing with my fellow Utahans and \nthe people of this country whose distrust of ObamaCare grows as they \nlearn more about it.\n  I look forward to the day when ObamaCare is finally repealed. It may \nnot be next month. It may not be next year, but it will be repealed. If \nwe are smart, we will make it next month or in the very near future. \nWhen it is, it will be a triumph for our Constitution, a triumph for \npersonal liberty and, most importantly, it will be a triumph for the \nAmerican people to persevere in their resistance to this law.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is interesting that we face one of \nthe toughest economic recessions in modern history and a world in \nturmoil, as many countries are challenging their leadership and \nassessing the future, and the focal point of the Republican legislative \neffort appears to be the repeal of health care reform.\n  If you look at what the American people think about this, they don't \nagree. They think that if there are ways to improve the bill, we should \ndo it; that if there are changes we can make in the bill to make it \nmore effective, we should. But the notion that we would repeal this law \nand walk away from the basic provisions in it is not acceptable by the \nmajority of the people.\n  The House Republicans, new to the majority this year, decided they \nneeded to keep faith with their followers and repeal health care reform \nas their highest priority. As the whip in the Senate who counts votes \non this side of the aisle, I sense that we are not going to repeal this \nlaw, nor do I think we should.\n  It appears Republicans want us to spend some time debating whether \nhealth care reform is good for America. I welcome that debate because, \nas you know, when we reflect on what we have achieved so far, in a \nlittle over 1 year, with this health care reform and what is to follow, \nit strikes me as unusual that there are people who want to walk away \nfrom all that. The important starting point in this debate is \ngovernment-administered health care. If you listen to the other side--\nthe Republicans--the issue they object to the most is the fact that the \ngovernment has some hand in this health insurance industry. They call \nit government-run health care. Those who would take the time to read \nthe bill--and I have--will realize that at the end of the day, the only \nentities offering health insurance in America are private companies, \naside from Medicare and Medicaid. So what the Republicans are objecting \nto is a government effort to extend the availability of private health \ninsurance to more and more Americans.\n  I know every single Republican and Democratic Senator is protecting \ntheir own families with government-administered private health \ninsurance. The very thing they are condemning in the health care reform \nbill is the source of their own personal health insurance for their \nfamilies. You see, Members of Congress are part of the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program, a program that covers 8 million \nFederal employees and their families. My wife and I, each year, have an \nopen enrollment where we can choose from nine different private health \ninsurance companies in Illinois. We pick the plan we like the best. At \nour point in life, we have more coverage than younger people might, and \nmore money is taken out of my paycheck because of that decision, but it \nis our decision to pick this private insurance company in a plan \nadministered by the Federal Government.\n  As the Republicans stand and criticize the notion of extending this \navailability of options to more Americans, they are criticizing the \nsame insurance plan they are using to protect their own families. If it \nis good enough for a Member of the Senate, should it not be good enough \nfor most Americans? The insurance exchanges we are creating will offer \nthe option for people to choose from private health insurance plans in \nthe future. That, to me, is a good thing. It has certainly been good \nfor my family, in terms of the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram.\n  There are other parts of the health care reform bill the Republicans \nwant to repeal, which I know the American people think are very \nvaluable. Right now, young adults up to the age of 26 would lose their \ninsurance coverage through their parents' health plans if the \nRepublicans prevail. This would affect 47,200 people in Illinois and \n1.2 million nationally. Who are these young people, age 25? They are \ngraduates of college looking for jobs. They are finished with their \neducation and maybe had student health insurance and they are looking \nfor a job and maybe the first one they find doesn't offer benefits. So \nmom and dad say: Don't worry. We still have you under the family health \ninsurance plan.\n  That is part of the health care reform bill these people--the \nRepublican side of the aisle--want to repeal. I remember going through \nthis with our kids, as I am sure others do. You called them after \ncollege and said: Jennifer, how are you doing?\n  I am fine.\n  Do you have health insurance?\n  Dad, I don't need that yet; I will get it later. At which point you \nsay: Girl,\n\n[[Page S376]]\n\nyou have to have it, even if we have to pay for it. We know we are just \none diagnosis or accident away from needing health insurance. That \nworry is relieved for those through the age of 25 under health care \nreform and would be repealed by the Republicans.\n\n  How about lifetime limits? People with private insurance coverage, if \nthe Republicans have their way and repeal this measure, would find \nthemselves suddenly vulnerable again to having lifetime limits placed \non how much insurance companies will spend on their health care. This \naffects 7\\1/2\\ million people in Illinois and 165 million nationally.\n  I talked to a retired firefighter in Chicago. He happened to be a man \nwho volunteered and went to New York on 9/11. He came down with \nleukemia. I said: How are you doing?\n  He said: I'm feeling good. I'm getting a lot of treatment, and it's \nworking, but I'm worried. I'm not old enough to qualify for Medicare \nyet, and I have a $1 million limit. I had no idea I would come down \nwith cancer, and I have already spent $150,000. If I need additional \nmedical care, it will be taken out of my savings if I go past this \nlimit.\n  We eliminate the limits on health insurance policies. Repeal of the \nlaw will reestablish those limits.\n  How about rescissions? Insurance companies, if the Republicans have \ntheir way and repeal our Affordable Health Care Act, would once again \nbe allowed to cut off someone's coverage unexpectedly when they are in \nan accident or become sick because of a simple mistake on their \napplication. That would leave 612,000 people in Illinois and 15.9 \nmillion nationally at the risk of losing their insurance at the moment \nthey need it the most. One of the worst abuses of the insurance \nindustry would become legal again if the Republicans have their way and \nrepeal affordable health care.\n  How does this work? Well, I can tell you what happens. We have seen \nit. People have contacted our office. The most notorious example was a \nwoman who said when she needed coverage for a surgery, the health \ninsurance company went through her application and said: You failed to \ndisclose a preexisting condition. We rescind the policy.\n  She asked: What preexisting condition?\n  You had acne as a teenager.\n  Think about it. Would you ever put that down as a preexisting \ncondition when you are applying for health insurance? It was enough for \nthe health insurance company to turn her loose and refuse to cover her.\n  Also, nearly 7.5 million residents in Illinois and 165 million \nnationally would not know if they are receiving value for their health \ninsurance premium dollars because the Republican repeal of health care \nwould remove the requirement that insurers spend at least 80 to 85 \npercent of premium dollars on actual health care--not on bonuses, not \non salaries, not on advertising, and not on administrative expenses but \nactually on health care. It is an effort to have the States monitor \nthese health insurance companies and make sure when the rates go up the \nmoney being collected is actually going to health care. That would be \neliminated if the Republicans have their way in repealing the \nAffordable Health Care Act.\n  How about preventive care? Nearly 1.8 million seniors in Illinois who \nhave Medicare coverage and 44 million nationally would be forced to pay \na copay to receive important preventive services such as mammograms and \ncolonoscopies, and they wouldn't receive a free annual wellness visit. \nWe know what happens when a person doesn't have a lot of money and is \nin their senior status and they are faced with the possibility of \ngetting a test. They put it off. The longer you put it off, \nunfortunately, it is more likely something bad will occur. The \nRepublican repeal of health care would mean that this preventive care \ncurrently offered under the bill for Medicare recipients would be \neliminated.\n  Then there is the doughnut hole, or the gap in coverage, for Medicare \nprescription drugs for which 109,421 seniors in Illinois and 2.7 \nmillion nationally would see significantly higher prescription drug \ncosts if the Republicans are successful in repealing health care. Last \nyear, these beneficiaries received a one-time, tax-free $250 rebate to \nhelp fill the gap for prescription drugs in the doughnut hole coverage \ngap.\n  Medicare beneficiaries who fall into the doughnut hole in 2011 will \nbe eligible for 50 percent discounts on covered brand-name prescription \ndrugs. Without this law, the burden of high prescription drug costs \nwill hurt millions of Medicare beneficiaries across the country. That \nis the reality.\n  What the Republicans would do with the repeal of health care is to \nsay to seniors on fixed incomes: Turn to your savings; pull more out of \nyour savings for the prescription drugs your doctor tells you that you \nneed to stay well. We are filling that gap, that hole. They want to go \nback to the old days when seniors were on their own.\n  There is the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, where 279 employers \nin my State and 4,748 nationally wouldn't receive help from this \nprogram. It is a program that provides businesses, schools, unions, \nState and local governments and nonprofits much needed financial relief \nto help early retirees and their families continue to have quality \naffordable health care coverage.\n  Who are these people? One was in my family. My brother retired from \nworking for a major corporation before he reached the age of 65. He had \na heart attack and needed surgery and couldn't get insured. He had to \nwait until he was qualified for Medicare. This plan allows early \nretirees to find insurance before they qualify for Medicare and \nprovides an incentive for that to happen. The repeal of this law by the \nRepublicans would basically eliminate that program.\n  So when they stand before us and tell us they are just doing the \nright thing--what Americans really want--I am afraid that isn't the \ncase. Most Americans want us to keep health care reform--change it, \nmodify it, if necessary, but not repeal it--because when we repeal it, \nthese basic things I have described will be in trouble.\n  What about this court case yesterday in Florida? It is getting a lot \nof attention today. A judge in Florida issued a decision in a case \nfiled by 25 Republican attorneys general and Governors striking down \nthe Affordable Health Care Act. This ruling is out of the mainstream of \njudicial reasoning in its treatment of precedent and in the type of \nanalysis employed. I don't think it is likely to be upheld.\n  Twelve Federal judges have already dismissed challenges to the \nconstitutionality of the health reform bill, and two judges in the \nEastern District of Michigan and Western District of Virginia have \nupheld the law. In one other case, a Federal judge in the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia issued a very narrow ruling on the \nconstitutionality of the health reform law's individual responsibility \nprovision and upheld the rest of the law.\n  The ruling yesterday in Florida issued by Judge Vinson in the \nNorthern District is a plain case of judicial overreaching. The judge \ndeclared the entire law was null and void, even though the only \nprovision he found unconstitutional related to the individual \nresponsibility provision. This decision is at odds with decades of \nestablished Supreme Court law which has consistently found that courts \nhave a constitutional obligation to preserve as much of a statute as \ncan be preserved.\n  Under this view of the law, the estimated 4 million seniors who fall \ninto the Medicare prescription drug coverage gap I mentioned earlier \nwill pay higher prices for prescription drugs. If the judge from \nFlorida has his way, 44 million seniors on Medicare will be denied \naccess to preventive care, up to 4 million small businesses will not be \neligible for tax credits to make health care more affordable, and new \nprovisions that prevent insurance companies from denying coverage and \nthe like will not become part of the law.\n  History is on our side when it comes to this measure, Madam \nPresident. Tomorrow, the Senate Judiciary Committee, at my request, is \ngoing to hold a hearing on the constitutionality of the Health Care \nReform Act. It is the first congressional hearing on this issue. As a \nperson who is aspiring to be the chairman of the Constitution \nSubcommittee, I asked this be the first subject we take up. The reason \nI am still aspiring is we haven't closed all of the negotiations about \nfunding of committees, so nothing has become formal yet, but it is \nlikely to occur.\n\n[[Page S377]]\n\n  What we will look at tomorrow is article I, section 8 of the \nConstitution. That is the article that specifically cites the powers \nthat Congress--the Senate and the House--have. It is spelled out. In \nthe course of spelling it out, it cites, among other things, that we \nhave the power to tax, and we have the power related to provisions \nrelating to commerce. It came to be viewed in the courts as interstate \ncommerce--commerce between the States or between the United States and \nother nations.\n  Those who are arguing that the health care reform bill is \nunconstitutional first argue that the health care insurance industry is \nnot commerce. If the health care insurance industry--which offers \nindustry across State lines to millions of Americans--is not commerce, \nand it affects 18 percent of our economy, then I don't know what \ncommerce might be. I think that position is particularly weak.\n  When it comes to the individual responsibility, or individual mandate \nsystem that is in the bill, the question is being asked of the court: \nWhy is this necessary? Well, here is why it is necessary. If we say to \ninsurance companies they don't have to insure anyone with a preexisting \ncondition, then of course they are going to exclude people. But if we \ntell them they have to insure everybody, even those with preexisting \nconditions, then the obvious question is, when will a person buy \ninsurance?\n  If we don't have a responsibility on individuals to buy insurance, \ntwo things will occur: They will wait until they are sick to buy \ninsurance, which completely destroys the risk model that insurance \ncompanies use, or they will present themselves, as they do today, to \nmany hospitals for coverage and care, the cost of which is passed on to \nother people. So the individual responsibility section says: If you \ndon't have insurance coverage, then you have to pay a tax penalty. And \nthat is what many are objecting to. You cannot eliminate exclusions for \npreexisting conditions and not move more and more people into the risk \npool at an earlier stage. If people can wait until the last minute to \nget into the risk pool, then the insurance model is destroyed. That is \nwhy it is in there.\n  I think we will find, ultimately--and I hope we do--from the Supreme \nCourt that what we have passed is entirely consistent with the \nregulations or powers given to Congress under article I, section 8 of \nthe Constitution to deal with issues of commerce. Secondly, I think we \nwill find that the imposition of a tax in this health care reform bill \nis clearly enumerated in the powers given to Congress to levy taxes, \nand what we have done is necessary and proper to reach the goal where \nwe eliminate discrimination because of preexisting conditions in health \ninsurance plans.\n  That debate is ahead of us, but it is a debate we need to take up. I \nam happy to talk about the health care reform bill because I think it \nis moving in the right direction. It is not perfect--it can be \nimproved--but if the Republicans want to repeal it, they are in for a \nfight because the important provisions we have to protect families and \nbusinesses need to be protected.\n  What we want to bring up as soon as we can--when we get beyond this \ndebate on health care repeal--is the reauthorization of the Federal \nAviation Administration. We have been struggling with this issue for a \nlong time, and we believe this bill, which our majority leader Harry \nReid has asked to bring to the floor, creates and protects more than \n280,000 jobs by modernizing the air travel infrastructure and reducing \ncostly delays. I think this is an important step forward not just to \ncreate jobs--and we need them very badly--but also to make certain our \nairplanes and airliners and all those who are serving us at the \nairports have a safer environment, establishing new standards for \nsafety when it comes to the operation of our airlines.\n  I think this is a critical issue, and I hope we can move to it soon. \nI am sorry we are going to be diverted into a debate on health care \nreform. But as I said, I think it is a welcome debate. It is time we \nbrought some of these facts before the American people so they \nunderstand health care reform has real value to families and businesses \nacross the United States, making health care insurance more affordable \nand more accessible.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I wish to thank the majority leader \nfor bringing this bill to the floor so promptly--the first bill of this \nyear, the 112th Congress. The Air Transportation Modernization and \nSafety Improvement Act reauthorizes the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. It has been postponed 17 times over the last 4 years, \nto the consternation of all of us who care about this subject. There \nare three Commerce Committee members in the Chamber right now, and we \nare all frustrated about getting it done. So it is the first piece of \nlegislation.\n  The bill which I introduced and which we are considering is the text \nof the FAA reauthorization bill that was approved by the whole Senate \nlast year by a vote of 93 to nothing. All of the matters of safety and \nair traffic control systems and all the rest of it that we talk about \nare all incorporated already in this bill. Although the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives informally conferenced, it was not productive, \nand we were unable to come to a final resolution, so here we are once \nagain. I thought that beginning this year's consideration of the FAA \nreauthorization bill with the legislation that did pass unanimously \nlast year would signal a commitment to bringing forward a bill that had \nbroad bipartisan support--at least last year. It wasn't that long ago. \nThere are some new Members, and some issues still stand out. We didn't \nresolve all of them.\n  I wish to say at the beginning that this is a monumentally important \nbill. I would also say that I recognize without rancor that there are a \nlot of Members of the Congress who don't really keep up with aviation \nbecause they kind of take it for granted. It is highly technical and \nnot always interesting but always important--always important. It \nemploys 11 million people, just for a start. It is a vastly important \nbill, and we are vastly behind where we should be, and this bill will \nhelp us move forward.\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\n  I wish to thank particularly Senator Hutchison, the ranking member of \nthe Commerce Committee and my able partner, for her efforts on this \nbill last year. I look forward to working with her again this year in \npassing this bill, as I know she wants to have it happen, and get it \nenacted into law. She and I can't sign it into law, but we want to have \na good bill signed into law. I believe this bill reflects a shared \nvision and our mutual goal of making sure the United States continues \nto have the safest, most efficient, and most modern aviation system \npossible.\n  Given the importance of the airline industry to our Nation's \neconomy--again, many people take this for granted, but it is a vast \nindustry--I can't think of a more important piece of legislation to our \nNation's long-term economic competitiveness. It is the right bill to \nstart with. We know this legislation will create and support good-\npaying American jobs. It already does--11 million is a lot of jobs. \nThat is slightly more than the population of West Virginia. The bill \nimproves the safety and efficiency of our Nation's aviation system by \npreventing something called runway incursions, which people often \naren't aware of unless their plane runs into another on the tarmac, \nwhich happens infrequently but does happen. People would be shocked to \nknow how often and how many times incursions are just about to happen \nuntil they are rescued by an understaffed control tower which says: \nHey, head right, head left, stop--whatever. It also modernizes our air \ntraffic control system. That is an easy phrase--``modernizes our air \ntraffic control system.'' It is a vast, new concept. We are living in \nan age when everybody else is GPS and digitalized, and I include \nMongolia. I would like to include Mongolia because it does have a GPS \nsystem, and the thought of Mongolia being ahead of us is deeply \ndisturbing to me, and it is a way of making a point, I think one would \nagree. I wish to reduce delays that frustrate fliers, and we do that. \nIt opens the door to better economic development, especially in rural \nand underserved areas. It makes a very big point of that, with \nessential air service, airport improvement programs, and other \nprograms.\n  Simply put, this bill helps protect our position as the global leader \nin aviation. Now, I said ``global leader.'' We are. We are. The \naviation needs and goals of Texas and West Virginia are the same. \nPeople might not believe it, but they are. My good friend Senator \nHutchison represents some of the largest airports in the country. I \nrepresent some of the finest smaller airports in the Nation. All of our \nairports are critical economic engines to their respective communities. \nSenator Hutchison may have more flights in and out of Texas than we \nhave in West Virginia--in fact, I guarantee she does--but we both know \nthe importance of air service to economic growth and global \ncompetitiveness.\n  Every one of our constituents wants the safest aviation system \npossible. Before assuming our current roles, Senator Hutchison and I \nrotated being chairman and ranking member of the aviation subcommittee. \nWe did that for 10 years, so we are pretty heavily into the subject, \nand we agree on virtually everything--virtually everything. But we \nshare a passion for aviation because we know how critical this industry \nis to our economy, to the comfort and mobility of our people, and to \nour Nation's future. We both share a strong desire to get this \nlegislation enacted into law. I have already said that. It has been far \ntoo long--4 years--since the last FAA reauthorization bill was enacted. \nOur Nation cannot afford to wait one second longer.\n  Sadly, when many people think of flying, their first reaction is \noften negative, and that is usually what we hear--people complaining \nabout TSA lines, about delays, about weather; airlines are meant to \ncontrol weather. Actually, they don't, statutorily or otherwise. But \npeople are not happy, so there is sort of a grumpiness about this \nsubject, which we don't address, but we try to take away the causes of \ngrumpiness.\n  I will be the first to admit from my own point of view that travel is \nnot always enjoyable. That is a symptom of a number of expectations we \nhave somehow developed over the years. Air travel has changed with \nderegulation. Oh, how well I remember regulation. American Airlines, \nbig jets in Charleston, WV; United Airlines, big jets in Charleston, \nWV; Eastern Airlines, big jets in Charleston, WV; deregulation, and one \nmonth later, no more jets, and we now subsist basically on prop planes \nwith two propellers. If you are my height, it takes an hour or so to \nrestore your blood flow after you get out of one of those--if you are \nlucky enough to get an exit seat. If you are not, it may take 2 or 3 \nhours. Anyway, some of the changes with deregulation have been for the \nbetter. Not all of those changes have been for the best. There have \nbeen frustrating changes for travelers as the industry has adapted to \nthis new reality. There have been many other benefits, primarily \ncheaper tickets to more places for the average flier.\n  We must also remember that aviation is more than just a commercial \nair travel service. Aviation accounts for $1 trillion-plus worth of \neconomic activity for the country and, again, supports more than 11 \nmillion jobs. It is a critical sector of our economy. Boeing is the \nNation's largest exporter, and aerospace sales from large and small \nproducers provide billions of dollars toward balanced trade for the \nUnited States with international buyers. This is a great success story, \nbut we haven't been tending to it. That is why we are doing this bill \nnow.\n  In 2010, the United States did not have a single commercial aviation \nfatality. That is a truly remarkable statistic. It is one we should not \nonly be thankful for but very proud of. Safety is the No. 1 priority of \nthe Federal Aviation Administration, the airline industry, and the \npeople who work for both, and it is the No. 1 priority of Senator \nHutchison and myself, and well as the Commerce Committee as a whole. It \nalways is and has to be. It is through the hard and dedicated work of \nthe thousands of FAA and airline industry employees that we do, in \nfact, have the safest aviation system in the world. Improving the \nsafety of our aviation system has been a huge priority for all of us. \nYou can't rest on your laurels in aviation in any respect. The industry \nis always shaky. The public is always a little bit shaky. Times are \nshaky--bad times, fewer passengers; better times, more passengers. That \nsounds like good news--more passengers--but I am copping to that. It \nisn't necessarily good news that there will be more passengers in the \nfuture.\n  I strongly believe this bill is fundamentally about the future of \naviation, and it is vastly important. This bill is about making sure we \nhave the most technologically advanced satellite-based air traffic \ncontrol system in the world. This bill is about catapulting our air \ntraffic control system out of the 19th century and into the 21st \ncentury with every other industrialized country in the world. We do not \nshare that with them now. More people drive rented cars with GPS \nsystems than airplanes have. It sort of doesn't make sense, but that is \na fact. Today, as I said, we are behind Europe and even Mongolia. We \nhave to remedy that fact, and we have to do it quickly.\n  This bill is about making sure we continue to have the most dynamic \naviation industry in the world. I will say it again. The U.S. civil \naviation sector generates $1 trillion a year in economic activity and \nemploys 11 million people. All of that activity creates jobs in every \nsector of our economy, including airport construction jobs and building \nairplanes, from the smallest general aviation planes to Boeing's state-\nof-the-art 787 Dreamliner. All this activity creates jobs--jobs in \nairlines, jobs in general aviation, such as the small airports that dot \nboth Senator Hutchison's State and mine, the rural parts thereof, as \nwell as the Presiding Officer's. Airports and the aviation industry \nsupport millions of indirect jobs. That makes sense. One need only \nlook--and this is sort of the most obvious presentation of it--at the \ngrowth around Dulles, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Denver International. \nDenver International was built out in the middle of the desert. Not \nanymore. I don't think Dallas/Fort Worth was ever out in the middle of \nthe desert, but the growth is extraordinary. It attracts jobs. People \ndon't want to bicycle to Dallas or Charleston or anywhere else; they \nwant to go by air. Business decisions are made by air. So that point \nspeaks for itself.\n\n[[Page S379]]\n\n  In Beckley, WV, which is not huge but has a wonderful airport, what \nis interesting is that it also has an enormously successful business \npark at that facility. Our major airports in Charleston and Huntington \nhave direct flights to the major headquarters of chemical and energy \ncompanies that allow businesses to grow in West Virginia.\n  I believe the future of the U.S. aviation system has unlimited \npotential. We face serious challenges in making sure we reach that \npotential, but I know we are up to it. To make it work, we have to \nupgrade our 1950s-era, antiquated air traffic control system. Investing \nin technology and infrastructure is a very good place to start. It is \nembarrassing that some of our newer cars have more sophisticated global \npositioning systems than many of our aircraft in the skies. That has to \nchange, and it costs money. It has everything to do with lives and \nsafety. It is going to get much bigger, with many more passengers. We \nhave about 750 million people flying every year now. In another decade \nit will be nearly 1 billion. So it is almost like a 50-percent increase \nin the number of people flying. Everything gets more complicated and \ncrowded.\n  It is eye-opening to see the speed with which China and other \ndeveloping nations are investing in their air traffic control systems \nand their airports. They know what they are doing. They take nothing \nfor granted. Growth is on their minds. Again, we have to make the \neffort to get ahead or we will be left far behind. I am sorry, but that \nis the way it works. It is not a sentimental industry. It is one that \nneeds to be treated well, nurtured, and supported.\n  If we don't act quickly, we are at risk for falling behind our global \ncompetitors. We will lose the cargo hubs, the aircraft manufacturing \nplants, and the economic development that aviation causes. I cannot \nunderstate the importance of a vibrant and strong aviation system. I \nhave made no attempt to be shy on that account. I cannot be. It is \nfundamental to our Nation's long-term economic growth and to my State's \nability to attract new investment.\n  When choosing to invest in an area, the quality of air service is the \nprime consideration. I say ``the''; you could say ``a.'' You can have a \ngreat quality of life, but it doesn't give you a factory. Quality of \nlife is good, but it isn't preemptive. The ability to fly from West \nVirginia to almost any corner of the world, which we now have, is \ncritical for our ability to attract new businesses and jobs.\n  Why do we have 20 Japanese companies in West Virginia? That is \nactually a cerebrally interesting question. The reason is, because we \nhave good air service and good workers. But if we had good workers and \nno particularly good air service, we would not have them. You have a \nlot more of that in Texas, but for West Virginia that is a phenomenal \nstatistic. All of our futures are tied to modern aviation systems.\n  Over the last several years, we have focused more on the \ninconveniences of air travel, rather than trying to solve the \nunderlying problems that make air travel so challenging.\n  Most Americans do not understand how fragile our air transportation \nsystem is. The economic downturn of the last several years masked this \nfragility because fewer people flew, so there was less pressure on the \nsystem.\n  As our economy recovers, I am afraid the inherent weakness of our \nsystem will loom larger than ever in years to come as we get to 1 \nbillion passengers a year.\n  The possibility of a meltdown of the air traffic control system may \nbecome reality, unless we modernize it. This will create more than \ninconvenience; it will put passenger safety at a very substantial and \nunnecessary risk.\n  These are not the only troubling signs, as I noted. There were no \ncommercial aviation fatalities in 2010, but that doesn't mean the \nsystem is working to perfection. We were lucky and people worked hard. \nOver the last few years, the FAA and the industry have faced serious \nquestions over their commitment to safety. That commitment has been \ncalled into question.\n  The grounding of thousands of aircraft throughout the system in 2008 \nraised questions about the quality of airline maintenance practices and \nthe FAA's ability to provide sufficient oversight of air carriers and \ntheir maintenance, not just domestic but also overseas, which is \nanother subject.\n  The tragic accident, the downing of flight 3407 on that snowy night \nin Buffalo, exposed problems with pilot training, flight crew fatigue, \nparticularly pilot fatigue, and the ability of the industry to assure \nthe traveling public that there is one level of safety throughout the \nentire system. This bill addresses that through a number of \nstipulations, but we are making it a rule. We have to get this into \nlaw. The FAA is putting some of this into practice, but we have to make \nit into law. People have to get enough sleep. Above 10,000 feet, they \ncan talk about something other than aviation, but below 10,000 feet, \nwhere the crowd gathers and aviation is being scrutinized by air-\ntraffic control folks, you have to have what is called a sterile \ncockpit, where nobody talks about anything but landing. So I am deeply \nproud of the reforms we have put into place in the area of safety, and \nthey offer even more incentive to pass the bill quickly.\n  Before I close, I wish to recognize the efforts of former Senator \nByron Dorgan and I think Senator Hutchison would join me in saying \nthis--for his hard work on behalf of the safety issue. I am pleased to \nsay the FAA is currently working on implementing the two dozen \nprovisions of the law that he helped, with others, to create.\n  I feel very strongly that improving our aviation system is a national \npriority. My passion comes from a deep belief that our future is tied \nto a healthy aviation industry. America is the cradle of aviation. I \ndon't want to see that change.\n  Since 1988, I have worked diligently, as the chairman of the Aviation \nSubcommittee and now as chairman of the Commerce Committee, to support \nour aviation system and to address its challenges; to wit, inadequate \nfunding for the FAA, a chronically unprofitable commercial aviation \nindustry, and minimal investment in aerospace research.\n  Nobody moves forward in industry without doing research, and we will \nnot pay for it. So a lot of it is not done.\n  In some areas, we have made progress. We have increased our \ninvestment in airport infrastructure, we have opened new markets for \nU.S. air carriers and, thanks to the Obama administration, we have \nfinally begun to make serious investments in modernizing our air \ntraffic control system. It is a multi-year process, highly expensive.\n  I know many of my colleagues will say we cannot afford to make those \ninvestments in aviation at this time. But now, it seems to me, it is \nthe precise time to make them.\n  The recession has prevented widespread delays from occurring. So we \nwere lulled into thinking everything was going well. Over the last \ndecade, airlines dramatically cut capacity and parked hundreds of \nplanes in the desert. We don't have them in West Virginia, and I don't \nknow where they are parked--somewhere in the desert. They were taken \noffline because of a lack of passenger demand. Anyway, we cannot make \nshortsighted budget decisions. The cost of inaction will be far \ngreater.\n  I ask my colleague from Texas, I am proceeding well, but I am not \nfinished; is that acceptable?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator. Our economy has begun to slowly \nturn around, and the demand for air travel has slowly begun to grow. \nAirlines have cautiously increased capacity. If we act now, we can be \nprepared to meet the challenges of adding millions of passengers to the \nsystem in the next decade. If we fail to act, congestion will plague \nthe system again, delays will be a fact of life, and today will look \nlike the golden age of travel.\n  The benefits of investing in air traffic control modernization extend \nfar beyond the ability to handle more passengers. Most important, the \nNext Generation Air Transportation System, what we call NextGen, will \ndramatically improve the safety of our air transportation system by \nproviding pilots and air traffic controllers with better situational \nawareness. Now you can't tell if there is a mountain in front of you, \nyou can't tell about the ground situation, and you can't tell very well \nabout separation. It is inefficient. Planes land, but they could land\n\n[[Page S380]]\n\nmore quickly. You cannot read the distance and altitude between one \nplane flying in for a landing or one taking off. It is inefficient--\ndangerous, in fact. So we have to do this. We have to be able to see \nother aircraft and detailed weather maps in real time and to be able to \ngo from one place to another in a straight shot. That is what NextGen \nwill do for us. Now planes are going all over the place, avoiding this \nand that, as they go from one TRACON to another TRACON, a weather \nsystem or an unexpected flight. GPS NextGen will allow for straight \nflights. That saves a lot of fuel and a lot of time, and delays cost \nthe American economy over $30 billion a year.\n  So, again, we have to provide our pilots and air traffic controllers \nwith better situational awareness. They will be able to see other \naircraft and detailed weather maps, and that becomes important.\n  A new satellite-based ATC system will allow airplanes to move more \nefficiently by taking more direct routes, which saves our economy \nbillions of dollars on an annual basis.\n  Greater operational efficiency will also create substantial \nenvironmental benefits. Drastic reductions in fuel consumption means \nnot only that we will achieve lower carbon emissions--less of them will \nbe spewed out--but almost every community near an airport will benefit \ngreatly from this effort. Also, planes are becoming quieter. In all \nways they are getting better. We still have to guide them correctly.\n  As I noted, the President clearly recognizes the value of investing \nin our air transportation system, and this was reflected in his budget \nrequest. The administration proposed a total of over $1 billion in \nfiscal year 2011 for NextGen programs, which is more than a 30-percent \nincrease from the fiscal year 2010 budget. Is that bad in this time and \nage of skepticism about budgets? I hope we can continue this level of \nbudget, even in lean budget years.\n  Modernizing the ATC system will require a sustained focus and \nsubstantial resources. This legislation takes concrete steps to make \nsure the FAA accelerates and achieves key NextGen programs and that the \nagency implements modernization efforts in an effective and efficient \nmanner in the long run. How many airports can be done by 2014 and by \n2018? It is laid out in the bill.\n  Let me discuss a few key measures in S. 223 that further address \nmodernization. To improve accountability, this bill establishes an air \ntraffic modernization board, and it designates a chief NextGen officer \nto provide specific oversight of the FAA's modernization activities. \nOversight is what Congress is for, and we don't do it well enough \nbecause we are all on too many committees and have too much work to do. \nPutting somebody in who is responsible for overseeing NextGen within \nthe FAA is a good idea, not a silly one.\n  The bill also establishes specific deadlines for the implementation \nof the key NextGen programs. It has fancy names for them. Area \nNavigation, or RNAV, and Required Navigation Performance, or RNP, \nprocedures must be developed at the Nation's largest 30 airports by \n2014. Where these technologies are already in place, we are seeing \ndramatic benefits in reduced fuel consumption and many other benefits.\n  All aircraft are required to be equipped with Automatic Dependent \nSurveillance-Broadcast. I will not bore you with what that is about. It \nis called ADS-B, and it is the cornerstone of the FAA's traffic control \nmodernization effort. It provides controllers and pilots with an \naircraft's immediate position. Pilots will be able to see the real-time \nposition of other aircraft in their vicinity and receive the same \ninformation the controllers are seeing in their towers. They will see \nthem in their cockpit.\n  The FAA estimates that NextGen will cost probably about $20 billion \nthrough 2025 and the airlines another $20 billion in aircraft equipage. \nIn other words, they have to match--the airlines--to a certain extent \nwhat the Federal Government is doing. They will do that. Again, some \nwill argue we cannot afford this investment. I say it is the other way \naround.\n  This bill is paid for. It makes a substantial commitment to providing \nthe FAA with the resources it needs. I have worked with Senators Inouye \nand Baucus to reach an agreement that moves us in the right direction. \nS. 223 will create a new subaccount with the aviation trust fund to \nfund FAA's modernization efforts. This modernization subaccount will \ndedicate $400 annually to NextGen efforts and to nothing else. So it is \nboxed right in. Our colleagues have worked hard on this issue.\n\n  A word on small community air service. That is another core \nchallenge. Every part of my State of West Virginia is basically rural, \nand every State has some rural parts. Everybody thinks of LaGuardia and \nJFK, but try upstate New York, try around the Saranac or west of that \ninto Buffalo. They deal with small aircraft. That is where the small \naircraft crash took place, in Buffalo. The pilot was drowsy.\n  The continuing economic crisis has hit the U.S. airline industry very \nhard. Rural communities are at the end of the food chain. If something \nbad happens at the top of the food chain, there will be some suffering. \nBut the real suffering takes place at the bottom of the food chain. \nThat is where the flights get cut off, that is where they get limited, \nthat is where some flights suddenly stop going to places. There is hope \nfor better times, but we do not have them yet. We are in crisis.\n  The reduction or elimination of air service has a devastating effect \non the economy of the community nearby. I stipulate that with the \nprevious sentence. Having adequate air service is not just a matter of \nconvenience but also a matter of economic survival. Without access to \nreliable air service, no business is going to locate their operations \nthere. I already talked about that issue. Small airlines and small \nairports are important.\n  When Congress deregulated the airline industry in 1978, we made a \npromise to small communities--an official promise--that they would \ncontinue to have access to the Nation's air transportation system. I \nbelieve that the Federal Government needs to provide additional \nresources and tools for small communities to help them attract adequate \nair service. This legislation does this by building on existing \nprograms.\n  Authorized funding for the Essential Air Service program is increased \nto $200 million annually. The EAS program is critical to dozens of \ncommunities throughout this country. I made that point. It is needed. \nIt also provides a lot of flexibility to EAS, and what small airports \ncan do with EAS. Someone may be phasing out being a commercial EAS \nairport and headed to being a general aviation airport. This allows \nthat transition to move forward.\n  I am almost at the end. Consumer protection is key. We are about \nprotecting lives, protecting people, protecting passengers. The bill \nstrengthens passenger protections by incorporating elements of the \npassenger bill of rights which came right out of the Commerce Committee \nto deal with the most egregious flight delays and cancellations.\n  Talk about angry travelers. This is where you run into them. The \nindustry would be required to take basic steps to improve the passenger \nexperience. To wit, passengers must be provided with information \nregarding on-time arrivals and chronically delayed flights when they \npurchase tickets. Most of them will do that online so the airlines have \nto publish what is their record for on-time takeoffs or on-time \nlandings, what is their delay, what is their cancellation. That has to \nbe posted so that fliers who want to purchase tickets can compare and \ngo elsewhere if they want.\n  Air carriers are also required to permit passengers to deplane after \n3 hours have elapsed. We all heard about 9-hour waits on the tarmac. It \nis usually not as dramatic as that. If you are a mother and have three \nchildren, 3 hours not moving is a long time. Three hours moving is a \nlong time, but not moving is a very long time. They would have, after 3 \nhours, the right to deplane. It is their right to deplane. Airlines \ncannot stop that unless the pilot has a certain belief that they are \njust about to take off. They have to be given water and medical \nattention, if they need it, bathroom facilities, and the rest of it.\n  The Department of Transportation has taken steps to improve customer \nprotections, and I applaud their actions. But I for one believe \nstatutory protections are better than when a government agency decides \nto do it.\n  In conclusion, when we began work on this bill, I at least had four \nsimple goals: One, take steps to address critical safety concerns; two, \nestablish a\n\n[[Page S381]]\n\nroadmap for the implementation of NextGen and accelerate the FAA's key \nmodernization programs; three, make sure we adequately invest in \nairport infrastructure; and four, continue to improve small \ncommunities' access to the Nation's aviation system. This bill takes \nthose steps.\n  I feel very strongly about the bill. The Airport Improvement Program, \nwhich is part of this bill, is estimated to support 120,000 jobs \nannually. This bill authorizes a total of $8.1 billion for this \naccount. Moving forward with NextGen will certainly help us keep our \nposition as a global leader. This is the culmination of more than 4 \nyears of work with Senator Hutchison and myself and the hard-working \nmembers of the Commerce Committee.\n  Again, this language passed 93 to 0 less than 12 months ago. It is an \nimportant bill--important for the safety of the traveling public, \nimportant to our ability to create jobs, important to sustaining an \naerospace industry, important to having healthy airlines, important to \ngeneral aviation's future, and important to our future competitiveness.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I welcome ideas on how \nwe might improve it. I ask my colleagues to join me in our \ndetermination to complete our work and reauthorize FAA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science and Transportation, I, too, wish to discuss the FAA \nreauthorization bill and agree with the chairman, Senator Rockefeller, \nwho has just spoken, that we have worked in a bipartisan way on this \nbill for 4 years.\n  I am glad he mentioned Senator Dorgan, who was the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, who pushed so hard last year for us to come to a \nconclusion and try to pass a permanent bill.\n  The bill that is before us is the bill that passed last year. There \nare many good provisions in this bill. It passed unanimously in the \nSenate, and we were on our way to conference with the House. But the \nHouse bill was quite different. We never got to the point of being able \nto work out the differences.\n  I do think there was one part of the bill, which I will discuss more \nlater, where we worked on a compromise to achieve a goal of easing the \nperimeter rule at Washington's Reagan Airport. We were able to come to \nan agreement among the leaders on the committee, but we were not able \nto get the full agreement of the Senate. That was a gentlemen's \nagreement, if you will, that we would work on putting that into the \nconference report, but that never came to pass.\n  The perimeter rule around National Airport has slot restrictions and \nmileage restrictions on how far a plane can go directly in and out of \nNational Airport. The perimeter rule prohibits flights traveling to or \nfrom points that are more than 1,250 miles from National Airport unless \nthere is an exemption. Many Western States would like more of those \nexemptions, especially given that the airport can now handle additional \ncapacity.\n  I want to be clear at the onset of this process, I cannot support a \nfinal bill that does not address this issue. We need to work out either \na consensus majority or an agreement that addresses the issue rather \nthan just leaving it out.\n  The FAA has operated under a series of short-term extensions since \n2007; 18 short-term extensions have occurred. That is not providing the \npolicy to keep us in the forefront of modernization of our air traffic \nsystem. We need to have a bipartisan, commonsense, multiyear FAA \nreauthorization to provide the stability that the FAA and its \nstakeholders--the airlines and passengers--need to make sound \ninvestment decisions for our future aviation system.\n  The current short-term extension expires March 31. If we address \nthese issues in our Senate bill, I believe we can work with the House \nthat has already begun to formulate the basis of its bill and have a \ntrue multiyear reauthorization bill that would be able to pass on March \n31 instead of yet another short-term extension.\n  The House version last year was quite different from our bill. While \na year now has almost elapsed, many of the bill's provisions need to be \nupdated. The one we have before us would modernize the air traffic \ncontrol system, NextGen, which was mentioned by Senator Rockefeller. It \nwould improve aviation and it would ensure passengers are treated well, \nespecially if they are delayed and stuck in an aircraft for more than 3 \nhours. I call it the captive passenger rule that we need to enact.\n  First, modernization. Probably the most important area we address in \nthis bill is expediting the FAA's air traffic control air modernization \nprogram, known as NextGen. The FAA operates the largest and safest air \ntraffic control system in the world. In fact, the FAA's air traffic \ncontrol system handles almost half of the world's air traffic activity. \nThe United States has been a leader in developing and implementing new \ntechnologies to create a safer and more efficient airspace system.\n  However, today's air traffic control system is not much different \nfrom that which was started in the 1960s. The system is based on radar \ntracking and ground-based infrastructure. NextGen will move much of the \nair traffic infrastructure from ground based to satellite based by \nreplacing antiquated, costly ground infrastructure with orbiting \nsatellites and onboard automation. By doing this, the FAA will be able \nto make our aviation system more safe and efficient while increasing \ncapacity at our Nation's busiest airports.\n  Some of the modernization provisions in the bill include establishing \nclear deadlines for the adoption of existing Global Positioning System \nnavigation technology. It mandates 100 percent coverage at the top 35 \nairports by 2014, with the entire national airspace system to be \nrequired to be covered by 2018.\n  Aviation safety. As a former vice chairman of the National \nTransportation Safety Board, I understand well the critical and \ndifficult mission the FAA has in overseeing our Nation's airlines and \naviation system. Aviation safety and the public trust that goes along \nwith it are the bedrock of our national aviation policy, and we simply \ncannot allow any degradation of safety for the flying public. This bill \ngoes a long way to advance and promote the air travel system.\n  Last August, as part of one of the short-term extensions, several of \nthe important safety provisions were enacted into law that were the \ndirect result of weaknesses identified from the tragic crash and \naftermath of Colgan flight 3407 in Buffalo, NY. While those provisions \nwere of great importance and will have an impact on creating one level \nof safety through all sectors of aviation, we still have important work \nto do, and in this bill we do it, such as addressing inconsistent \napplication of airworthiness directives by improving the voluntary \ndisclosure reporting process to ensure adequate actions are taken in \nresponse to reports; limiting the ability of FAA inspectors to work \nwith air carriers over which they had oversight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will be happy to yield if the leaders allow me to \ncome in when they are finished and continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nStabenow be recognized to offer an amendment related to 1099 reporting \nforms; that she give her speech regarding this after Senator McConnell \noffers an amendment relating to health care, and the amendments be \ndebated concurrently.\n  Senator McConnell can do whatever he feels appropriate, but he will \nspeak before Senator Stabenow. How much more time does the Senator from \nTexas need?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Probably about 5 or 6 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. So whatever she and Senator McConnell decide on that is \nfine with me.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. So I will speak after Senator McConnell, and before \nSenator Stabenow.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My statement is pretty brief, if the Senator from \nTexas would not mind. I think Senator Stabenow is willing to let me do \nmy statement and lay down my amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Then Senator Stabenow will be willing to let the Senator \nfrom Texas finish her statement.\n\n[[Page S382]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Stabenow be recognized to offer \nher amendment and then Senator McConnell would offer his.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 9\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, \namendment No. 9, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To repeal the expansion of information reporting requirements \n for payments of $600 or more to corporations, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 335, after line 20, insert the following:\n\n  TITLE XI--REPEAL OF EXPANSION OF INFORMATION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS\n\n     SEC. 1101.

The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas very \nmuch for letting me make a brief statement about the amendment I am \nabout to offer, and apologize for interrupting her comments.\n  What we have today is an opportunity--an opportunity--for the \nmajority to reevaluate what it has done on the issue of health care and \nto take another path. It is no secret the American people don't like \nthe health care bill that was passed last year. If you have talked with \ndoctors or nurses or anybody else involved in health care over the last \nyear, most of them will tell you they do not like it either. Employers, \nbig and small, have been desperately trying to get the message across \nof how damaging this bill will be to their ability to create jobs. They \ntell us the impact of the bill is severe--higher taxes, penalties for \nhiring workers, new regulations that have already run to more than \n6,000 pages, and mountains of new paperwork all at a time when \nbusinesses want to create jobs and millions of Americans are looking \nfor one.\n  Don't take it from me. Here is how the National Federation of \nIndependent Business puts it:\n\n       Small business owners everywhere are rightfully concerned \n     that the unconstitutional new mandates, countless rules and \n     new taxes in the health care law will devastate their \n     businesses and their ability to create jobs.\n\n  Yesterday, a Federal court in Florida found the crux of the law to be \nunconstitutional. So we have an opportunity today--an opportunity for \nall those who supported the health law--to reevaluate your vote and to \nlisten to your constituents, who are desperately trying to get your \nattention. You can say, perhaps, this was a mistake, we can do this \nbetter or you can continue to dismiss the majority of the people in \nthis country as not knowing what they are talking about.\n  It is not every day that you get a second chance on a big decision \nafter you know all the facts. Today is one of those days. For all of us \nwho opposed the health care bill, today we reaffirm our commitment to \nwork a little harder to get it right. We can't afford to get it wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues to move beyond party affiliation. Look at the \nfacts before us. If everyone in this Chamber evaluated this bill for \nwhat it is, we would repeal it right now, and then we would begin to \nwork on achieving our mutual goal of delivering health care at a higher \nquality for lower cost. Let us not miss this opportunity.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 13\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 13.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To repeal the job-killing health care law and health care-\nrelated provisions in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act \n                                of 2010)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n            TITLE __--REPEAL OF JOB-KILLING HEALTH CARE LAW\n\n     SEC. _01.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased we are starting on the \nFAA bill and having an open amendment process so everyone can be heard. \nI will finish my remarks, as the ranking member of the Commerce \nCommittee, and then I know Senator Stabenow wants to speak on the first \namendment that is going to be offered. It is probably unrelated to our \nFAA bill but nevertheless is very important for our country.\n  Let me go back to where I was on the part of the FAA reauthorization \nbill that addresses aviation safety. We do limit the ability of FAA \ninspectors to work for air carriers over which they have had oversight, \nand we will require the conducting of independent reviews of safety \nissues identified by employees.\n  We also need to require enhanced safety oversight of foreign repair \nstations, including a minimum of two FAA inspections annually, with \nexceptions for those that have comprehensive bilateral aviation safety \nmaintenance agreements with the United States, and requiring alcohol \nand drug testing at any foreign facilities that perform maintenance on \nU.S. commercial aircraft.\n  Finally, the bill also provides infrastructure investment to our \nNation's airports. As we all know, you can have the best planes and the \nbest air traffic system but they mean nothing without the proper \nairport infrastructure in place.\n  This bill contains many important provisions and deserves the support \nof the Senate. We have been operating under short-term extensions for \nfar too\n\n[[Page S383]]\n\nlong. It is also one of the reasons we need to finally address the DCA \nperimeter rule, which has impeded the passage of this bill on too many \noccasions. While I have been talking about what is in the bill, this is \nthe one issue that is currently not included in the bill and must be \naddressed if we are to have a successful final passage.\n  After months of negotiation last year, the chairman, the subcommittee \nchairman, western Senators, and our ranking member on the subcommittee \nand I reached a compromise agreement that we hoped would finally \nresolve the issue, but we didn't have an opportunity to bring the \nconsensus version to the floor before we adjourned. It is a very \nreasonable approach. Here are the provisions of the compromise:\n  It would add five new round-trip flights beyond the perimeter for new \nentrants or limited incumbents, which means airlines that have very \nsmall bases at National Airport now. This means we would add \ncompetition with the five new round-trip flights.\n  It allows for conversion of 16 round-trip flights from large hub \nairports inside the perimeter to any airport outside the perimeter \nphased in over 2 years.\n  The conversion concept seeks to address congestion concerns by \nreplacing existing flights rather than creating more new flights. Since \n2000, there have only been 12 new flights at National Airport. That is \nsince the year 2000. Now we are asking for five more new flights, which \nwould increase competition. The conversion flights would have no impact \non congestion at the airport because they will not be new flights.\n  It prohibits the use of wide-body aircraft for converted flights to \naddress any noise concerns from local residents. But in reality, the \nnoise issue is so different today than it was when the first aviation \nauthorization was passed. We have Stage 3 aircraft now, which are much \nquieter than the planes that have gone in and out in the past. And not \nto allow the use of bigger aircraft protects the residents who might \nlive around the airport. In fact, I would argue it gives them an added \nconvenience, because those residents would also have access to the \nlong-haul flights at an airport convenient to them.\n  The DOT would evaluate the proposed flights and be able to disapprove \nof the conversions if they determined they are not in the public \ninterest.\n  The air carriers could only convert flights currently used to operate \nflights to large hubs within the perimeter in an effort to protect \nsmall communities. So, in other words, you would not see conversions \nfrom very small airports to be able to take long-haul flights away. It \nwould only be conversions from a big hub airport to another big hub \nairport. So our small communities should not feel threatened by this.\n  Carriers would be prohibited from selling, trading, leasing or \notherwise transferring the rights to fly beyond the perimeter.\n  It also eliminates financial restrictions in place between National \nand Dulles that would allow for revenuesharing between the two \nairports, which is comparable to other airport systems across the \ncountry to address any financial impact on the airport authority.\n  I lived through, dealt with, and negotiated the Wright amendment in \nTexas and the lifting of the Wright amendment that allowed an \nincremental easing of the Wright amendment restrictions at Dallas's \nLove Field. That was put in place to protect DFW Airport when it was \nfirst built. That was much of the reason for the restrictions at \nNational Airport when Dulles Airport was built, to assure that Dulles \nwould be financially secure. Dulles is financially secure. So it is \ntime to deal with the issue of allowing National to have more service \nto the western half of America. The people out West deserve to have \nmore access to National Airport if that is where they choose to fly.\n  I think Dulles has captured the international flights, and I think \nthat has been a good way for Dulles to become one of our busiest \nairports and certainly one of our most successful. So I know these are \ndifficult issues, because I dealt with them in my own State, but now I \nthink this modest expansion of only five new flights out of Reagan \nNational should be very doable. I think the western Senators have come \nup with a compromise, with the conversions, that will not affect the \ntraffic or the congestion around National but will allow better access, \nwhich I think is a win-win for everyone.\n  So especially for you, Mr. President, with some humor, I find it a \nbit ironic that tomorrow is Groundhog Day--February 2. If ever there \nwere a piece of legislation that fits the bill, this one is it. Since \nstarting this legislation in 2007, 18 short-term extensions later, and \nthis being the third consideration of the FAA bill on the floor, it \ndoes feel like Groundhog Day. And in a nod to that holiday--that \nesteemed important holiday in America--let us hope there are no shadows \nseen and winter will quickly end in a well-debated and bipartisan FAA \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan, the majority \nleader, the Republican leader, and my chairman for allowing us to start \nthe debate on this bill and finish our remarks. I know we will have \nmany amendments, but I hope in the end we have a good bill that \nsatisfies everyone's needs and that we can say permanently that winter \nis over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I want to congratulate Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Hutchison for their leadership in putting \ntogether what is such an important bill for 280,000 jobs that are saved \nor created as a result of this bill, and focusing on our ability to \nout-innovate and out-build in a global economy. We can't do that \nwithout a 21st century FAA system--airports, air traffic control, and \nso on. So I join with Senator Hutchison in hoping that--and I am sure \nit will be true--at the end of the day we will have a strong bipartisan \nvote, because they are moving forward in the spirit in which we have \nall come together in saying we want to move forward; that is, working \nhard and focusing on jobs. That is what the American people want us to \ndo, focus on jobs, and find common ground, working across the aisle. \nThat is evident from this bill.\n  I am very appreciative of the fact they are focusing, and I want to \nthank our leader for making sure that the first bill we are bringing up \nis about jobs. We understand that too many families--certainly in my \nState--are still looking for work. They have worked hard all their \nlives, and they never thought in a million years they would find \nthemselves in the situation they are now facing. They want us to be \nlaser-focused on jobs and the economy and outcompeting in the global \neconomy, as the President said. This bill is exactly the kind of policy \non which we should be focused. What is concerning to me is that while \nwe are doing that, we are now going to have a debate that is very \ndivisive, really looking backward rather than looking forward.\n\n  One of the things the President talked about--again, which I agree \nwith strongly--is that in the area of health care, what we passed last \nyear, we know there are measures we can fix to make our system more \ncompetitive, to make it better for families, to put families back in \ncontrol rather than insurance companies. We know we can make it better. \nCertainly no one has been more of a champion than our leader on this \nlegislation, now the chairman of the Commerce Committee but one of the \nleaders, the No. 2 on the Finance Committee, who brought his passion to \nthe issue of health care as well. We know this can be fixed, and we \nwant to work together to make it better but not fight old fights, \ncreate old political fights and division, and certainly not roll back \nthe clock where we put all the control in the insurance companies and \nwe see our families losing the freedom and security to make sure their \nchildren, their families have the health care they need.\n  Let me first talk about my amendment and then why I believe we should \nbe focused on this kind of amendment to fix the bill that passed last \nyear, the new law, to make it better rather than rolling the clock \nback. Certainly we have heard now, if you follow the polls, that four \nout of five Americans are saying: Don't go back and just repeal what \nwas done; fix it. So the majority of people are not supporting going \nback to old political fights or going back, frankly, to a system that \nis an uncontrolled system where insurances companies can raise rates \n20, 30, 40 percent\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\nevery year without some plan, some focus to be able to lower costs, to \nbe able to get people out of emergency rooms and into the doctors' \noffices, and, frankly, for people who have insurance not to be placed \ninto a situation where they continually see their rates go up to pay \nfor people who do not, which is what we have put in place.\n  There is a provision that has been a concern of mine and many others. \nWe have debated it on the floor. We have attempted to get it fixed \nseveral different times. I hope today, I hope tomorrow--whenever we \nvote--that we will actually be able to get this fixed. This has been \nsupported on both sides of the aisle, and it deals with eliminating \nredtape and burdensome IRS reporting requirements for our businesses, \nparticularly small businesses.\n  We are particularly concerned about what this means for small \nbusinesses. The provision that was placed into the bill that now, as we \nlook at how the IRS would implement it, is clearly too burdensome--my \namendment would repeal that. It would allow business owners to spend \ntheir time growing their companies and creating jobs instead of filling \nout paperwork from the IRS. We want them creating jobs. It is a \ncommonsense solution to an issue that has come up. Basically, it would \nmake sure that the provision that would require a 1099 form for every \nvendor when a company has a purchase of $600 or more for goods would no \nlonger be in place. This is a provision that actually does not take \neffect until next year, but we want to send a very clear message to \nbusinesses that have expressed great concern about this, about what is \ncoming for them at the end of the year. We want to let them know that \nwe will not continue the new provision. We would allow small businesses \nthat already create 64 percent of the jobs to be able to keep creating \nthose jobs, and we would make sure we are not putting in place \nadditional paperwork for them.\n  It is important to note that, according to the IRS, the provision we \nwant to repeal if left unchecked would impact about 40 million American \nbusinesses and 26 million of them are sole proprietorships--our \nsmallest businesses. They would be overwhelmed with the paperwork that \nis involved. It does not make any sense.\n  We passed a great small business jobs bill last fall that created \neight different tax cuts and focused on making capital loans more \navailable for small businesses. We don't want to now go in the other \ndirection and see a mountain of paperwork added to the small businesses \nwe have been very committed to fighting for and supporting. \nUnfortunately, if this provision were allowed to stand, it would \nrequire a 2000-percent increase in 1099 filings. Frankly, that does not \nmake sense.\n  This particular provision would repeal what was placed into the new \nhealth care law. We pay for the repeal by cutting $44 billion in \nunobligated spending. We do make it clear that certainly this does not \naffect Medicare or Social Security benefits in any way. I would not \nsupport that. I know colleagues on the floor would not as well. It \nmakes it clear that the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs and \nthe Social Security Administration are not included. But it would give \nthe Office of Management and Budget the ability to look at the \npossibility in areas for cuts, and they would then report back to us in \n60 days after enactment--to the Secretary of Treasury and the \nCongress--concerning the amounts and the accounts they would be using \nin order to cut back, in order to save this particular provision.\n  This is an area where we can come together, where Democrats and \nRepublicans--both sides of the aisle--who care passionately about small \nbusinesses can come together and eliminate redtape and burdensome IRS \nreporting provisions. We would get that off the table and make it clear \nto small businesses that there is no intent or actuality that this is \ngoing to happen. We can do that together.\n  But what we should not be doing is what the next amendment, the \nRepublican leader's amendment, would do because his amendment would \ntake us back to the time of uncontrolled insurance company increases, \nof no accountability, and it would put the control of health care \ncoverage and costs back in the hands of insurance companies. What I \nsupport and what the new law allows is the freedom and security for \nfamilies to make sure they can get the medical care they need when they \nneed it.\n  I have two beautiful grandchildren, a granddaughter age 3 and a \ngrandson age 1, and they are the most beautiful children in the world, \njust for the record. I want my son and daughter-in-law picking up the \nphone and calling the doctor when they get sick, not fighting with the \ninsurance company. If this is repealed, they go back to fighting with \nthe insurance company. I want to ensure that my children, as well as my \ngrandchildren, my mom, everyone else in my family, as well as everyone \nin Michigan and the country, is getting the medical care they need, not \nfighting with the insurance companies, not worrying that because their \nchild has juvenile diabetes or leukemia or some other disease or \ncondition, the insurance company is going to say: Tough luck, we are \nnot going to cover your child even though your child needs care or you \nsuddenly get sick and they say: You know, there is some fine print over \nhere, and we know you are sick, but we are going to cancel your \ncoverage or we have 10 treatments we will provide even though the \ndoctor says you need 20.\n  Right now, because of what we have done in the Patients' Bill of \nRights that was put into place, we put those decisions in the hands of \nfamilies and doctors instead of insurance companies. I certainly am not \ngoing to vote to taking it back to putting it in the hands of insurance \ncompanies.\n  Frankly, I have had many families approach me to say ``thank you'' \nwho now have the ability, the freedom, the security to put their \nchild--this 22-, \n23-, 25-year-old--on their insurance. They get that first job, and it \ndoesn't have health insurance, but they can go out, get started, and \nknow they have the peace of mind that they have health insurance. That \nwould be taken away under what the Republican leader is proposing. We \nwould see young people going back to no insurance as a result of that.\n  Right now, we have seniors who know they are going to have their \nfreedom and security to be able to get the cancer screening they need, \nthe wellness visits, even if they do not have the out-of-pocket--the \ncopay and deductible they were used to being charged in the past \nbecause there is no co-pay and deductible now. They will be able to get \nwhat they need in preventive care.\n\n  They will have the peace of mind, the security to know that if they \nuse a lot of medicine and they fall in a gap in coverage, the cost in \nthat gap is going to be cut in half for any brand-named drugs--cut in \nhalf. What does that do? It means my mom, who is 84, has the security \nto know that her great-grandchildren are going to have her around \nlonger--a lot longer, I hope--because she is going to be able to play \nwith those kids. Every older person is going to know they have a better \nchance to be around for their grandkids because they are going to be \nable to afford the medicine that will help them get healthy. That is \ntaken away with the Republican leader's amendment, the freedom and \nsecurity for seniors to know they can stay healthy, they can stay in \ntheir homes, they can have the medicine they need or the doctors' \nvisits they need to be able to stay healthy and live a long, healthier \nlife. That is taken away.\n  There will be the freedom and security for women to know that we are \nnot going to pay twice as much as men for insurance--which, by the way, \nin the majority of policies prior to passing this legislation, if women \nwent out to buy an insurance policy, in over half the policies, women \npaid as much as twice as much. We changed that.\n  We have also said that things such as maternity care ought to be a \nbasic part of a health insurance policy. Maybe we will not be 39th in \nthe world in the number of babies who live through the first year in \ntheir lives if moms are able to get the prenatal care they need and \nbabies are able to get it through the first year of their lives. This \ngives women the freedom and security of knowing they are going to get \nwhat they need to have healthy babies. Isn't that what we all want? \nThat is taken away with the amendment of the Republican leader.\n  Among many other things, I will just mention two others. For the \nfirst time, we are putting accountability on the\n\n[[Page S385]]\n\ninsurance industry--again, our chairman of the Commerce Committee led \nthis effort and the Finance Committee--to say that you know that if you \npay a hard-earned dollar out of your pocket for health insurance, and \nit is tough and the rates are high--and unfortunately, until we get \nthis implemented, they keep going up, they keep having it go up until \nthey have to stop--the majority of that is going to go for medical \ncare. So, depending upon the size of your policy, either 80 or 85 \npercent that you pay out has to go into medical care, not executive \ncompensation or bureaucracy but medical care. What does that mean? It \nmeans it will limit the rate increases over time and put more \naccountability on the company. The amendment of the Republican leader \nrolls that back. We have companies now that spend 60 percent of every \ndollar you give on medical care or 70 percent. This would say that 80 \nor 85 percent, the majority of your hard-earned dollars--they are hard \nto come by in this economy--if it is for health care, then it should be \nused on health care. That is what is repealed in this--accountability \non insurance companies.\n  Finally, what is also repealed is a major focus in this bill on \nsupporting small businesses to be able to get a better deal on health \ninsurance, and this takes away the freedom and security for a small \nbusiness to get the leverage they need, like a big business, to get a \nbetter deal on rates. This was something that took effect. If we were \ngoing to change something, I wish we could speed that up. That needs to \nbe faster, in my judgment, and not having to wait for the next 3 years \nbecause we have all kinds of small businesses that are going to be able \nto band together and be able to get a better rate like a big business \nthrough competition in the marketplace--not government control, private \nsector competition.\n  I had an opportunity to talk to a gentleman who runs a program for \nour automakers and other manufacturers for retirees. It is a health \nexchange, exactly like we passed in the new law. He said to me: I don't \nthink, Senator, even you guys realize how good it is, in terms of what \nwe have done in creating a marketplace and bringing rates down.\n  He said: We bring rates down about 30 percent for the auto companies, \nfor retirees, about 30 percent, because of competition in this bill, \nleveraged for small businesses, and tax cuts to help small businesses \npay for it in the new law, taken away by the McConnell amendment.\n  I hope in the spirit of the underlying bill, which is a great jobs \nbill, a great bill for innovation--it is about rebuilding our \ninfrastructure; it is about competing in a global economy; it is about \nbeing the best we can be--I would hope in the spirit of the FAA bill, \nwe would not succumb to this backward, divisive, political debate on \nrepeal. If we want to join on something on health care, I strongly urge \na 100-percent vote on eliminating the burdensome provision for small \nbusinesses, eliminate the redtape, eliminate this IRS provision on \n1099. Let's do something together that both sides agree should be done. \nLet's fix the things that need to be fixed, but let's not roll back the \nclock and put insurance companies in charge of everything, every \nmedical decision, every rate increase as they were in the past.\n  I urge adoption of the Stabenow amendment.\n  We will have a number of colleagues in the process of joining. I \ndon't have a whole list. We have a number of colleagues who will be \ncosponsors. I thank Senator Baucus for his leadership, his ongoing \nleadership on this amendment as well. I urge adoption of this amendment \nto fix what we know needs to be fixed, and then let us go on to jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I don't see any other folks who \nwant to speak on the FAA bill for the moment or on much else for the \nmoment. I will suggest the absence of a quorum but not yet. I am hoping \nSenator Baucus and Senator Hatch will come down to oversee the 1099 \nargument and repeal of the health care bill, which is about the worst \nidea I have ever heard. I think it will be voted down, and I believe \nthe minority knows that. I don't know who they are trying to speak to. \nWhen I think of the health care bill and all the work that went into \nit--the work that went into it is not that important, it is the product \nthat came out. When he says the American people are against it, that \nwas actually quite true for a year and a half, maybe almost 2 years, \nbecause we were in the process of making the bill and it was kind of \nlike making sausage, and people turned against it. But now it is going \nin quite the opposite direction. Now as people begin to get some of the \nbenefits, they understand some of the conditions they will be unbonded \nfrom, that they won't be slaves anymore to costs determined by others \nwho don't care about their health care, I think the momentum is \nswinging.\n  What we would be condemned to, if the amendment were to pass and \nhealth care were to be repealed, in that there aren't any particular \nideas of note which were put forward by the other party about what we \nshould do to make it better other than to repeal it, is another 2 or 3 \nyears trying to write a bill and not having a bill. We would be in a \nsituation as follows: I recall in the year 2008--and I just happen to \nrecall this because we worked on this in the Commerce Committee--the \nfive largest health insurance companies in America made profits of \n$12.4 billion. I don't have a problem with that. What I do have a \nproblem with is what they were doing and what will continue to happen \nif we repeal the health care bill; that is, while they were making all \nthat money, they were, through the process of rescission--and that \nmeans a unilateral decision that because somebody has acne or has been \nthrough a C-section or asthma or any number of things--they actually \ninsured 3 million fewer people while they were making that $12.4 \nbillion by the sole act, which is their right under previous law, which \nwe corrected, to do rescission. That is, by their own decision to \nsimply remove health care from people who made an agreement with them, \nsigned up, had been sending in premiums and all the rest of it.\n  I also think about a young 8-year-old I met in Charleston at a town \nmeeting. He had had leukemia for a while. Without this health care \nbill, there are lifetime limits and annual limits on what one can get \nin the way of health insurance. And when you have leukemia, the lid is \nlifted off. The boy died. He died because he couldn't get insurance. \nHis family obviously couldn't afford to pay for it, and he couldn't get \nit so he died. People say that is kind of an extra dramatic example. \nUnfortunately, it is not. It is very common.\n  Something else that would disappear, if the health care bill were \nrepealed, is something which nobody ever talks about but which is sort \nof the philosophical basis for a lot of this, and it is called the fee-\nfor-service system which we now have in America on medical care, \nparticularly with Medicare, but generally. That is the person who \nprovides the service or the medical equipment person who provides the \nmedical equipment or the hospital which provides the service, they \nprovide the service, and they bill Medicare. Medicare doesn't ask any \nquestions. Medicare just pays the bill. That is one of the reasons, of \nmany, if the bill is repealed, we will go into hock $1.3 trillion more \non our deficit, because our bill saves that kind of money. Their bill \nwould vitiate that savings. Fee-for-service is not the way health care \nought to work. The way it ought to work is that like anything else, \nthis very bill, there is no tree on this bill. What happened in the \nSenate? It was an epiphany of some sort. We decided to be transparent \nand accountable. So anybody can offer amendments on anything. And \nindeed, they are and will. But accountability causes efficiency and \nmakes better results. Under the bill that has been passed, people are \nheld accountable for what they do. Hospitals, for example, or doctors \nor medical equipment people, are measured by their outcomes. In other \nwords, it is evidence-based outcomes. What are the results of what you \nhave been doing in health care? Are they better? Are they worse? Did \nfewer people die? MRSA is a reason hundreds of thousands of people in \nthis country die. Basically that comes from relatively unclean \nbathrooms in hospitals that don't pay attention to that and \naccreditation folks who don't pay enough attention to that either. That \nis a disease which is easily cured, one, by cleaning up\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\nbathrooms and, secondly, it is just automatically a part of the expense \npart of health care and it should not be. Evidence-based outcomes, you \nprove to me that you are doing a better job this year than you were in \nthe last 2 or 3 years, or whatever the range might be. So it is not \nfee-for-service. It is fee after the explanation of the efficacy and \nthe lifesaving quality of the service.\n  That is the direction health care has to go. That isn't discussed but \nif this whole bill is repealed, that is exactly what will happen. \nEverybody is held accountable. We are being held more accountable. The \nbig three automobile companies were held more accountable. They were \nembarrassed, but they have come back pretty nicely. The way we make our \nprogress in America now is to make sure that people do what they are \nmeant to be doing, and they do it well, and they can show it. Actually \nsome of the paperwork is you have to convince the folks from Medicaid \nand Medicare, whatever else it is, that you are doing a better job. If \nhalf of all Medicare is spent, as it is, in the last 6 months of life, \nthat bears analysis. Why is that so? What are we doing? What are we not \ndoing? Don't just pay the bill because it is sent to you. You look at \nit and you ask questions. That is the direction of the new health care. \nI think it is a fair direction. It is one which I am sure the Mayo \nClinic does routinely. But it is not a good idea.\n  I will speak on this more later. I am now waiting for Senators Baucus \nand Hatch to handle both matters since it is within their jurisdiction. \nI am on the Finance Committee. I am close to Senator Baucus, but I am \nnot Senator Baucus. He needs to be down here to do that. I hope he will \nbe down shortly.\n  Pending that situation, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I wish to speak briefly on the amendment \nthat has been offered by the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, that \nwould, in effect, repeal the health care bill that was passed on \nChristmas Eve at 7 a.m. in the morning about 1 year ago--1 year ago \nthis last Christmas Eve.\n  Since the time the bill was passed, strictly along party lines, with \n60 votes--all our colleagues on the Democratic side voted for it; all \nthe folks on our side voted against it--we predicted this bill would \nlead to an increase in premiums for those who have health insurance, it \nwould raise taxes on everyone in order to fund this huge expansion of \nthe Federal Government--some $2.7 trillion worth of extra spending--and \nit would also take a $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare--which, as you know, \nis one of our troubled entitlement programs that is sorely in need of \nreform--it takes $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare to fund yet a new \nentitlement program, this health care bill.\n  We also know that on at least two occasions now a Federal judge has \nfound that this bill violates the Constitution of the United States \nbecause both these judges have said Congress has overreached its \nauthority under the Constitution.\n  The arguments were made that this was within Congress's power, but \nactually I agree with a law professor, Jonathan Turley, whose comments \nI saw today, who said that if the Supreme Court of the United States \nupholds this health care bill as being within Congress's power, \nfederalism is dead.\n  There is no limit to the Federal Government's authority if the \nFederal Government can compel you or me or anyone else to buy a \ngovernment-approved product. There are no limitations. The 10th \namendment of the U.S. Constitution that says all powers not delegated \nto the Federal Government are reserved to the States and to the people \nmight as well be written out of the Constitution.\n  So that is why I think these decisions are very important--the one in \nFlorida and the earlier one in Virginia--because they reveal a defect \nin this bill over and above the others I have already mentioned: \nraising taxes, taking from Medicare to create a new entitlement \nprogram, and, of course, imposing this onerous mandate.\n  But the real problem with this bill is more nuanced than my remarks \nwould suggest. What it does is, by imposing a mandate on employers to \nprovide government-approved health insurance or pay a penalty--what \nmany employers are going to find out is, it will cost them less to pay \nthe penalty than it will to provide health insurance for their \nemployees. Thus, many Americans who have health coverage they like, \nwhich the President promised them time and time again they would be \nable to keep if they liked it, will find that is not the case because \nemployers will--making a rational business decision, where it costs \nless to pay the penalty than it does to provide the government-mandated \nhealth insurance--they will simply choose to drop their employees and, \nthus, they will have to go into the exchanges which are supposed to be \ncreated by 2014 under this bill.\n  What is wrong with that? Well, we know this bill was gamed in all \nsorts of ways to try to provide a Congressional Budget Office score \nwhich actually only reflects a fraction of its true cost, implemented \nover 10 years. The most accurate estimate I have seen is this bill \nactually will cost some $2.7 trillion over 10 years as opposed to the \nroughly $1 trillion pricetag the Congressional Budget Office has given, \nin part, because it was scored over a 10-year period of time but with \nonly 6 years of implementation and through various other ways. As I \nsay, that score--the true cost of this bill--was gamed.\n  But one of the things the bill provides is that individuals who go to \nthe State-based exchanges to buy their health insurance because they do \nnot have it available from their employer will be subsidized by the \nFederal taxpayers up to, I believe, $88,000 for a family of four. What \nhappens if a whole lot more people drop their coverage or their \nemployers drop their coverage and they are forced to go to the State-\nbased exchanges in order to buy their health care, which is subsidized \nto this degree? Well, it is going to explode the costs of this health \ncare bill in ways the Congressional Budget Office score does not \nadequately reflect.\n  I am not quibbling with the Congressional Budget Office. They take \nthe assumptions they are asked to take and they do the best they can to \ntry to predict what the costs will be. But, again, it is possible and, \nindeed, this is an example to game the Congressional Budget Office \nscoring process to make it look much cheaper than it will actually be, \nonce fully and finally implemented.\n  So at a time when we are going to be asked to raise the debt limit--\nour credit card is maxed out, nearly maxed out at $14 trillion-plus--at \na time when our deficits are $1.5 trillion--that is just for this \ncurrent, last fiscal year--we are left with the question, everything \nelse aside about this health care bill: Can we and can the American \npeople afford it? I would say the answer to that is absolutely not. \nBecause we can do so much better by making sure the government does not \nget between patients and their doctor and by leaving the flexibility \nand the choices in the hands of consumers to make decisions that are in \ntheir best interests.\n  We could, if we tried--and I hope we will--come up with a better way \nof delivering health care because, unfortunately, this bill did not--\nwell, we squandered an opportunity to try to help bend that cost curve \ndown. Indeed, all the evidence is, it bends the cost curve up and makes \nit more expensive.\n  Let me conclude on this thought. At a time when the President's own \nfiscal commission says our fiscal situation is dire and is \nunsustainable, at a time when the President--I had hoped during his \nState of the Union Message he would say: This fiscal commission I \nappointed has come up with a report. We need to take this seriously and \nneed to work, on a bipartisan basis, to try to fix what is broken about \nour Federal Government's finances. The President did not do that. He \ntalked about investment, which we all know when the Federal Government \ninvests money, it is code for more spending, and we have been on a \nspending binge the last 2 years, with 42 cents of every dollar borrowed \nfrom the next generation and beyond, and we know we cannot keep it up.\n\n[[Page S387]]\n\n  So beyond the fundamental problems with this bill--No. 1, that it is \nunconstitutional, so held by two Federal judges; that it continues to \nmake health care more expensive rather than more affordable; that it \ndenies people the opportunity to keep what they have because of the \nincentives it puts on employers to dump their employees into the \nexchanges and that they will get the subsidies that Congress voted on, \nwhich will make this bill even more expensive than it was originally \nthought to be--this bill is one that should be repealed. We can, \nworking together on a bipartisan basis, do better.\n  This is what happens when one side or the other overreaches. They \nthink the victory is worth it when, in fact, what we find out is, there \nis a tremendous backlash by the American people, reflected in the \nNovember 2 election. The more they learn about this bill, they do not \nlike it more, they like it less. Now that two Federal judges have held \nthat this bill is unconstitutional, it is time for us to take up this \nmatter again--once we repeal this bill--and do a better job, which we \nshould have done in the first place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I wish to commend my colleague from Texas, \na former Texas Supreme Court justice, for analyzing the legal issues, \nas he has just done. It is yet another indication of why it is time for \nus to start over. I join him in urging repeal and replacement of this \nhealth care bill.\n  I would like to speak briefly about yet another reason why this needs \nto be done, and it is a very specific example. It concerns my home \nState of Arizona. There are other States that are in the same position, \nbut I can speak to the specifics with respect to my own State. It has \nto do with just one of the many burdensome new mandates.\n  In this bill, as we know, there are mandates on individuals to \npurchase insurance, for example, as my colleague was just saying. There \nare mandates on families and companies and mandates on States as well. \nI wish to talk about the mandate on States, with respect to the \nMedicaid provisions of the bill, which is called the maintenance of \neffort mandate or MOE mandate.\n  Let me describe what that is. The maintenance of effort requirement \nforces an unfunded Medicaid mandate on States by denying them the full \nability to manage their Medicaid Programs to fit their own budgets and \ntheir own unique Medicaid populations.\n  This is a huge problem because Arizona, along with most other States, \nis experiencing a dire budget crisis. Our State has lost over 300,000 \njobs in the last few years, and revenue collections are down by 34 \npercent since the start of the recession. In the 2010 fiscal year, \nArizona collected about $3 billion less in gross revenues than it did \njust 3 years prior in 2007.\n  During this same period, enrollment in Arizona's Medicaid Program has \nincreased by 44 percent. Think of that. More than 1.3 million Arizonans \nare now covered by Medicaid. That is more than 20 percent of the entire \npopulation of our State.\n  Ordinarily, the State would be able to dial back that coverage in \norder to fit within its budget. But believe it or not, the ObamaCare \nlaw that was passed prevents a State from managing its own Medicaid \nProgram by determining who is going to be covered by that program.\n  Right now, the Arizona Medicaid Program consumes almost 30 percent of \nthe State's general fund spending. That is an increase of 17 percent \nover 4 years ago. So Arizona could, as I said, dial this back, except \nfor one thing; that is, ObamaCare.\n  As our Governor, Jan Brewer, noted in a recent letter to Speaker \nBoehner:\n\n       The growth in Arizona Medicaid spending is a key cause of \n     our state budget crisis and is unsustainable. . . . We cannot \n     afford this increase without gutting every other state \n     priority such as education and public safety.\n\n  So the Arizona legislature has taken steps to address this. They have \nnow cut $2.2 billion in spending from a $10 billion budget, but that \ndoes not go far enough to address the rest of their budget problems. \nDespite these cuts, the budget shortfall is projected to be $1.2 \nbillion in the next fiscal year.\n  So let me describe how this maintenance of effort requirement or \nmandate affects Arizona's budget. In 2009, the Federal Government \nimposed a mandate on States by which States could not change their \nMedicaid eligibility standards or methodologies and procedures in place \non July 1, 2008.\n  This sounds identical to the maintenance of effort requirement in \nObamaCare, but there is one crucial difference: The Federal \nGovernment's maintenance of effort stimulus requirement--the \nrequirement I am talking about that was in the stimulus bill--was \nfunded by the Federal Government. So the State was not adversely \naffected from a budget standpoint. Under the stimulus, the States \nreceived an enhanced Federal share of their Medicaid costs. But under \nObamaCare, the maintenance of effort requirement is still there, except \nthat the States have to pick it up. They are stuck with an unfunded \nmandate.\n  So even though States such as Arizona cannot afford their current \nMedicaid obligations, ObamaCare has forced an extension of the \nmaintenance of effort requirement until 2014 but without providing any \nassistance to pay the exorbitant costs. In June of 2011, when stimulus \nfunds expire, Arizona's share of its Medicaid Program will increase by \nan astounding $700 million. The annual cost of the mandate is almost $1 \nbillion, which is simply unaffordable. This problem is especially acute \nfor Arizona and a handful of other States because we actually expanded \nMedicaid eligibility for childless adults beyond Federal requirements. \nSo Arizona, in an effort to cover more people, by law, included \nadditional people in the Medicaid coverage--adults without children. \nRather than allow States such as Arizona to cut back to the level of \nother States--for example, to forgo that coverage at least for now--the \nhealth care law, ObamaCare, freezes in all of the existing disparities. \nSo there are big differences between or among the States, depending \nupon how liberal, in effect, their coverage is.\n\n  We have tried to do our best to find ways to ameliorate the problem. \nWe have devoted more resources toward Medicaid fraud prevention. There \nhave been some very difficult decisions made, for example, including \nreimbursing health care providers with less money. As my colleagues can \nimagine, that hasn't gone over well. Even more controversial and very \nsad: Arizona has stopped Medicaid funding for several kinds of \ntransplant surgeries effective October 1. This is actually a kind of \nrationing that is required by ObamaCare. The State cannot afford to \nprovide the most expensive procedures and, therefore, it has to cut \nthem back, all because they are prevented by law from dialing back the \ncoverage of these adults without children. So the one place where they \ncan cut is transplants--a very sad day, as I said. There is nothing \ngood to say about it. Nobody is pleased with the outcome, but there is \nno other option.\n  But even that option obviously doesn't save enough money to forestall \nthis budget crisis. Many of those who have been critics of the decision \nwith respect to transplants have failed to tell the whole story which \nis that the Governor had to make that difficult decision because the \nhealth care reform bill eliminated a key option that she otherwise \nwould have had to dial back the coverage to the level of other States.\n  Before enactment of the President's health care bill, the Federal \nGovernment and States were partners in health care delivery. Now States \nare merely a financing mechanism for the Federal Government's demands. \nWhat States need is permanent reduced Medicaid demand by way of \nauthority to reduce eligibility standards for their Medicaid programs. \nAs I am suggesting, all Arizona wants the authority to do is dial it \nback to where other States are.\n  Governor Brewer recently made a formal request to HHS Secretary \nSebelius for a waiver from the maintenance-of-effort provision. Since \nthe administration has granted over 700 waivers to companies and labor \nunions, one can only hope that the same fairness will be provided to \nStates that are much more crucial partners to the Federal Government in \nthe delivery of health care. Under the terms of the waiver request, \nArizona would preserve\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\nMedicaid coverage for 1 million Arizonans who represent the core of \nMedicaid's mission--the aged, disabled, the blind, pregnant women, and \nchildren.\n  I support the Governor's request and I urge the administration to \ngrant the waiver. But ultimately, only repeal of this law will provide \npermanent relief to all of the States such as Arizona and all of the \nother States similarly situated. So I am strongly in support of the \namendment that provides for repeal and replacement with something that \nwill work and will not punish our families, our residents, and our \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I have come to address two amendments \nthat are before us. First, I wish to salute my colleagues Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Hutchison and all of those on both sides of the \naisle who have brought this FAA bill before us. It is something that is \nneeded. It is something that is long overdue. It is sad that in America \nwe don't have a GPS system--and just about every western country does--\neven Mongolia does; Tibet does not--to move forward and modernize our \nairports. It is important for jobs. It is important for travelers' \nconvenience, but I would say most of all it is important for America's \nproductivity. When people sit and wait on a runway, when planes are \ndelayed or flights canceled, the amount of output that our country \nloses is enormous. We are losing much more than France or Germany or \nEngland because they have these systems. It is about time we put them \nin.\n  I will make one more point about it. There are some who say, Let's go \nback to the 2006 level of spending. In 2006, the budget did not have a \nGPS system. Certainly we have to cut where there is waste, but just an \nacross-the-board, roll-the-clock-back approach doesn't make much sense. \nTechnology advances, the world advances, and we cannot march backward. \nThere are certain things we need to keep this country strong, and the \nPresident talked about some of those in his address. Investments--and \ntransportation has always been one since the days of the Erie Canal, \nwhich caused my city, New York City, to become the largest city in the \ncountry and it still is, praise God.\n  But I came to talk about the two amendments that are here before us. \nIt is sort of a ``do and don't,'' in my opinion. We had a long debate \non the health care bill. We all know how long it was. The American \npeople decided--the majority did not want to repeal the bill. In fact, \n80 percent don't. Even those who want to change it, the majority say, \nDon't repeal it, just change it. That is the point here.\n  Senator Stabenow is offering an amendment to change something in the \nbill that very much needs changing. The change in the reporting \nrequirements to 1099 put an onerous obligation on small business \npeople. My dad was a small businessman, and I know how small business \npeople struggle. To ask them to file paperwork every time they bought \nsomething new, even at low cost, is a bit over the top. So I am glad we \nare repealing that. No one is claiming ownership. It is going to pass \nin a bipartisan way.\n  None of us on this side of the aisle is saying the health care bill \ncan't be improved, but just repealing it without putting anything in \nplace creates a number of problems. One problem, which we will see \ntomorrow when the actual vote is called, is it would increase the \ndeficit by $260 billion in the first decade and $1 trillion in the \nsecond, because the health care bill actually does cut some costs, and \nwe know there is a tremendous amount of duplication, inefficiency, \nwaste in our health care system. It is the best in the world. It is \nalso probably the least efficient in the world. Our goal and our job is \nto keep that quality of care for people but at the same time reduce the \ninefficiencies that cost the government and cost businesses. So it does \nreduce the deficit.\n  When our colleagues are calling for repeal, when Senator McConnell, \nthe Republican leader, calls for its repeal, he is going to increase \nthe deficit. So we have all this talk: ``We have to reduce the \ndeficit,'' and then the first move the other side makes, whether you \nlike the health care bill or not, is to increase the deficit. Why \nwouldn't they propose $260 billion in other cuts to at least keep the \nbill deficit neutral?\n  The second point I would make is this: Repeal says get rid of \neverything. It is simple, it is easy, it is quick. It is wrong. There \nare many good things in this bill supported not only by the majority of \nAmericans--the vast majority--many of which are supported by the \nmajority of Republican voters who were polled, but even supported by \nmany Members on the other side of the aisle. I have heard them speak. \nEven the new freshman class that is coming into the House--very \nmilitant--says, But I am not for repealing this, or I am not for \nrepealing that. So why can't our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle at least acknowledge there are very good things people like?\n  When they say repeal, do they want to repeal the provision that makes \nit easier for senior citizens to pay for prescription drugs? That is \nthe so-called doughnut hole that says after you--and this comes from \nthe Medicare bill that George Bush put forth, not from this health care \nbill, but they didn't have enough money to pay for it. So they said \nthat after $2,500, seniors would have to pay prescription drug costs on \ntheir own. Any of us who buy prescription drugs--I do; I am taking one \nfor my back because my back went out yesterday--knows how expensive \nthey are. You get up to $2,500 when you are a senior citizen and need \neight medications--one to lower your blood pressure, one for diabetes, \none for cholesterol, you name it. When you get up to that number, our \nseniors in my State and I am sure in the Presiding Officer's State and \nin any one of the other 48 States, are having real trouble paying for \nprescription drugs once they reach that doughnut hole, once they reach \nthe level after which Medicare no longer pays. Well, in the health care \nbill, we deal with that. We reduce their costs 50 percent in the first \nyear. That saves the average senior citizen--and this is not chicken \nfeed--$550. By the time it is fully implemented, we save them $2,400 a \nyear. They want to repeal that? Well, when they vote for repeal, they \nare voting to repeal it.\n\n  How about this one: There are countless American families who have \nkids in their early 20s. They get out of college, they get a job, let's \nhope. It is hard to get a job these days. By the way, we should be \nfocusing on job creation, not on repealing this bill, and the FAA bill \ndoes that, as I mentioned. They have a dilemma. These jobs are new, \nthey are not paying top dollar, most of them, and they don't come with \nhealth care. What are these young people to do? They can't afford \nhealth care themselves--$800, $900, $1,000 a month. They are not making \nthat much money, but they know, God forbid, if they get into a car \naccident or they get a serious disease, how can they be without health \ncare? It is a dilemma that has plagued American families from coast to \ncoast, from North to South and East to West. The health care bill \ncorrects it. Here is what it says, very simply: Any young person 21 to \n26 can stay on their family's health care plan. It is a great idea. It \nis very popular. I wish to ask my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who are going to vote for repeal, are they for taking away the \nbenefit of young people 21 to 26 to stay on their family's health care \nplan if they wish? I doubt it.\n  How about this one: We all know preventive medicine saves billions, \nso in the health care bill every senior citizen on Medicare gets a \nwellness checkup free once a year to encourage them to go in. Why? Not \nbecause we want some giveaway, but the statistics show overwhelmingly \nand without doubt conclusively that when senior citizens get a \npreventive care checkup, not only are they healthier, but it saves the \nMedicare system billions and billions of dollars. God forbid someone \nhas a melanoma. Before the melanoma gets into the lymph nodes, it is a \nsimple operation rather than thousands and thousands of dollars and \nmonths and months of agony and illness. Do they want to stop those \ncheckups? When people get a colonoscopy or any of these other \npreventive exams, including mammography, it saves the taxpayers much \nmoney. The recipient is healthier. That is why we put it in the bill. \nDo they want to repeal those? Do they want to tell every senior \ncitizen, You don't get that wellness checkup which will save billions? \nI can't believe they would want to do that, I say to\n\n[[Page S389]]\n\nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  How about this one: Small businesses. Small businesses are not \nrequired to have health care now, and under our bill, if they have \nunder 50 employees, they won't be required to. But some of them provide \nhealth care for their employees. Some do it because it is a good way to \nretain a good, young employee, or a good middle-aged or a good older \nemployee. Some do it because the employer is just a good guy or gal. \nWell, what we tell them is, if you have a business that makes less than \n$1.2 million and has fewer than 25 workers, we will give you a 35-\npercent tax credit for that health care. It is a great thing. Hundreds \nof thousands of businesses in my State of New York will benefit. It \nstarted January 1. What does it mean? It means, A, more people get \nhealth care; B, it means businesses have more money to spend on job \ncreation, small businesses, because some of their health care costs are \nbeing defrayed; and C, it may mean a small business that wasn't going \nto provide health care for its workers can now. Do my colleagues on the \nother side want to get rid of that tax credit for small businesses, the \nmainstay of America? I don't think they do.\n  How about this one: We all have heard of people calling their \ninsurance company and saying my wife, my husband, my daughter, or my \nson has gotten this terrible illness and it requires an operation that \ncosts a whole lot of money. Then you get a call back from the insurance \ncompany and they say, You know what, your policy doesn't quite cover \nthis. Or when you signed it, you were supposed to check this little box \nand you didn't. You are out. If you don't dot every I and cross every \nT--they usually let you get away with it because they are collecting \nyour money, but not when somebody has a serious illness that might cost \nthem thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars. Now the \ninsurance company calls you and it is basically, Tough rocks, Jack. \nUnder our bill, that can't happen anymore. And when the insurance \ncompanies decide to raise their rates dramatically, there is an \ninsurance commissioner in the State and Federal authorities who can \nsay, You have to show us that you needed to raise the rates as much as \nyou did. Do my colleagues want to get rid of that and let insurance \ncompanies rule the roost? I don't think so.\n  There is so much in this bill that is good, that is supported by the \noverwhelming majority of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans.\n  There is so much in this bill that moves us forward. If you think \nthere are things that should not be in the bill, come talk to us. Madam \nPresident, 1099 is a bipartisan effort. Senator Stabenow has been out \nfront. Senators Klobuchar, Cantwell, and Nelson sent a letter to \nSpeaker Boehner saying: Please get us a 1099 bill. Senator Johanns has \ndone a good job. It is bipartisan.\n  We are not saying everything is perfect in this bill and that it \ncan't be improved. We are saying: Let's work together in a bipartisan \nmanner to make it better. But the other side is saying: Just repeal \nit--repeal the good things, the things they don't like, create a huge \nhole in our deficit, and leave us with nothing. The slogan was going to \nbe ``repeal and replace,'' but we have only heard the first part of \nthat. Where is the ``replace''? I will tell you why there is no \nreplace. It is hard to take this huge, unwieldy, inefficient health \ncare system and shape it up. That is why it took us so long, and that \nis why it created a great deal of controversy. I will be the first to \nadmit that. But I don't see a substitute.\n  If you wanted to be fair and you were being straight with the \nAmerican people about actually improving people's health care, you \nwould have a replacement on the floor, and then we could compare the \nrepeal of what you want to what you propose. We will wait. Maybe we \nshould have a clock--the first day without repeal and replace, the \nsecond day, and so forth. I have a feeling we are not going to see a \nreplacement. Do you know what that would say? That this is just \npolitical, throwing out some red meat, but don't dare show a \nreplacement because, guess what, to replace is hard, and you really \ndon't have a solution for replacement.\n  I urge that we vote strongly against the McConnell amendment. I urge \nmy colleagues on the other side to rethink it.\n  I look forward to hearing the remarks of not only the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, who is head of the FAA bill, but also the No. 2 \nperson, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee on which I serve, \nwho has made so many invaluable contributions to the bill, on the cost-\ncutting side, in terms of the 80 and 85 percent rule and all the other \nthings we have done.\n  With that, I will be happy to yield the floor so that we might hear \nmy distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia, \nspeak for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, after that last sentence, I had to \ndrink a little water to sort of balance myself out. To be praised at \nsuch length by Senator Schumer--one can't take it lightly.\n  I wish to make a few comments on the health care bill, which, in and \nof itself, interests me because we are here doing FAA. If I remember \ncorrectly, I stood here at excessive length and gave a speech about the \nimportance of the FAA bill. Kay Bailey Hutchison did the same. Then, \nall of a sudden, here we are on health. That is very interesting \nbecause we have sort of made ourselves entirely transparent. Anybody \ncan offer amendments. The leader doesn't fill up the tree, so it is \nopen. And what happens is, immediately everybody pops in with their \nfavorite amendment. I don't resent that; I just say it is an \ninteresting phenomenon which is showing itself on the very first day. \nWhether that will last, I don't know.\n  In any event, I think they are still working--Senators Baucus and \nHatch and others--on the FAA stuff and the 1099 matter, so I wish to \ntalk about a couple of things on health care.\n  I think it is very important--and I mentioned this in my earlier \ncomments--when you say the American people don't want this bill, there \nwas a period of time when that was correct because the bill was made in \nfront of everybody on C-SPAN--whoever watches it, but enough people did \nbecause a lot of people were interested in what was happening--and it \nwasn't a very pretty process.\n  The public option, for example--Al Franken and I put a public option \nbill on the floor and thought it would save the world. Then all the \ntalk shows took it up, either blasting it or loving it--in excess in \nboth cases. There was one problem with the public option: It didn't \nhave any votes in the Finance Committee, which means it couldn't have \ngotten far. That was based on a $50 billion Medicare benchmark. So it \nwas a real cost saver and a very good--obviously, to get a nonprofit \noption as you buy your health care is very appealing--all of which is \ntrue but all of which was unpersuasive because it sounded like too much \ngovernment. Maybe if we had called it the freedom option, it would have \nbeen different. That doesn't matter. It didn't get the votes. My \nversion got 10 votes, and Chuck Schumer got 8 votes on his--or maybe it \nwas the opposite. We then came up with a medical loss ratio, which \nnobody understood because of the ridiculous wording, except that it \nworks.\n  I want to talk about a couple of things like that until somebody \ncomes, and then I will humbly and gladly yield the floor.\n  Does the Senator wish to speak?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. After the Senator finishes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will not be too long.\n  As it happens, on the poll, over a period of months and months, \npeople saw this thing happening, and they didn't like it. People lined \nup on one side or the other--mostly one side--and they didn't like it. \nIt turns out that the New York Times and CBS did a poll--I don't \nnecessarily have to trust them because they took a poll; I don't trust \npolls--that says 80 percent of Americans oppose repeal. I found that in \nthe cloakroom. I don't live by polls. But that is based on January 20 \nof this year. Let's suppose it is off by 10 percent or 15 percent. One \nthing that becomes clear from the generalization of that number--\ncertainly it could go lower--is that people don't want repeal.\n  Then that takes you to, well, what if we do have repeal? Does the \nrepeal then lead you to a thought-out process\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\nthat would then be substituted for what we created and the President \nsigned? And then very quickly one comes to the realization that there \nisn't an alternative from the other side. There never has been. From \nthat, it quickly follows that the deduction is what they want is the \npresent system. If that is not true, then they can come down and tell \nme about that. That is what I have to believe because I haven't heard \nthe new ideas or the alternatives to what it was we worked on and \naccomplished over a very difficult period of many months and much \nangst, agony, and screaming at townhalls and all the rest of it, which \nwas worth it.\n  The bill, although not perfect, was a real step forward. It looks at \nthe fee-for-service system, which has always been a fallacy in the \nAmerican health care system, that you automatically get paid for \nwhatever you do if you are a doctor, a hospital, or you sell medical \nequipment, no questions asked. You don't save money, you don't improve \nhealth care by doing that. Productivity, efficiency, and excellence are \ndone by oversight, by accountability, by asking questions, asking \npeople to show, through the evidence of what they have done for a \nparticular service, that it is better than it was the year before.\n  I will mention--unpleasant probably and not fit for this floor--that \none of the biggest problems we have in health care today is something \ncalled MRSA. MRSA is in almost every hospital in the country. \nUnfortunately, it emanates from bathrooms that are not kept that clean. \nSo if we don't do our bill and it is repealed and hospitals then are \nnot judged on MRSA and many other things, such as too many MRIs in one \nhospital, too many MRIs in one town that can only support two but has \nseven because you have to make money off of them but they are not used \nvery much--all of these have to be checked and looked at carefully \nbefore people are paid. That is the way you save money, and that is the \nreason the health care bill that was finally signed saves $1.3 trillion \nover 20 years and $240 million or $280 million in the very first year. \nIt is a cost saver.\n  So, by definition, if we went back to the present system, you would \nhave to start with the fact that we would be losing those savings and \ntherefore adding it onto our deficit. So we would have $1.3 trillion \nmore in deficit over 20 years, et cetera, et cetera. It is unwise. But \nthen cost isn't absolutely everything. We understand that. The Senator \nfrom New Hampshire understands that. We have to use good judgment.\n  Then you look at the public option, which didn't work, and then you \nlook at the medical loss ratio. Folks don't know what that is--even \nsome in this body. It is a simple system where you simply say--and it \nwill disappear if Senator McConnell's amendment passes--that health \ninsurance companies are required to spend 80 percent of all--85 percent \nif it is a large institution or, if it is a small business or an \nindividual, 80 percent--they have to spend that percentage of their \npremiums they collect on health care, and then they have to show to HHS \nthat it is being spent on health care that makes Americans better or at \nleast keeps them where they are. The bathrooms get cleaner, to be crude \nabout it but actually quite accurate about it.\n  That is a very good system because it is not sort of mandating; it is \ncalled oversight. The American people should want to do oversight over \ntheir health care dollars because it is so much of their income they \nhave to spend on health care. The medical loss ratio--a strange name \nbut a sound principle--is where 85 or 80 percent of all premium dollars \nhave to be spent on health care, and health care cannot just be health \ncare but better than it was in the previous year or 2 or 3 years. \nObviously, we are not into that system entirely yet and won't be until \n2014.\n  Is it possible for me to explain that I am very disturbed that this \nbill we are now wanting to repeal will insure 32 million people who \ndon't have health insurance, and then I am saying to myself that there \nare a lot more than that who are uninsured in this country, but that is \nall we could afford to do because we didn't have enough money. So let's \nsay it is really 45 million and then decide there are many millions \nmore than that who are underinsured. You may be dealing with 50 million \npeople, and all of a sudden, their prospects for getting health \ninsurance disappear. They simply disappear because we repeal the bill.\n  Now, truth in telling, the 32 million people--we weren't going to be \nable to get that all done until 2020 because of the lack of funds. We \nhad to do as much as we could as soon as we could, but we couldn't do \nmore than that because we didn't have the money. Everything was scored \nby CBO, which is very tough. But I am astounded by the prospect of the \nexcellent people who are on that side of the aisle--they are like us; a \ndifferent party, but so what--saying that 32 million would lose their \nhealth insurance--or they were going to get health insurance, but now \nthey will not, so they are on their own.\n  What happens then? Well, they take up the practice, which I saw first \nwhen I was chairman of the Children's Commission for 4 years in the \nearly 1980s or the late 1980s--we went out to Chicago in one visit, to \nCabrini-Green, and Chicago was a robust health care city, and the folks \nout there told me that in that particular year, eight emergency rooms \nin hospitals had closed down. Why? Because they were being overwhelmed \neven then.\n\n  Secondly, they are by far the most expensive part of the hospital. \nThey cost the most. They drain health care because of all the emergency \nservice. People wait 5, 6 hours--we have all been through it--and they \nget their health care, maybe. It is so inefficient, so brutal, such an \nawful system where more attention, because of health insurance, would \nallow more cautious, attentive, logical work to be done on patients. \nThat is gone. That is simply gone.\n  Emergency rooms are important, but a lot of them are going out of \nbusiness because they still cannot afford to stay open. They are too \nexpensive for the hospital corporation that makes that decision. I do \nnot blame them for that.\n  I know my colleague wants to speak. I think of when I was a VISTA \nvolunteer--I sometimes talk about that on the floor--a long time ago. \nThere were no jobs, no health care. Nobody went to school because the \nschoolbus did not come to pick up any of the kids because we were \nconsidered too far away. It was kind of a bad community. I latched on \nto that community. It is the reason I went to West Virginia and then \nstayed in West Virginia.\n  They depended on a rural community center. It was right next door, \nthe Lincoln County Community Health Center. It was not a hospital so \nthey did not have to worry about going up in an elevator because many \nof them in very rural parts of the State have not been in an elevator \nbefore, have not crossed a traffic light, red or green. That is new to \nthem. They live in rural places. They deal with it that way. I suspect \nit is true in parts of New Hampshire, although New Hampshire has gotten \nsophisticated.\n  People trust rural health centers. Why? Because they are not \nhospitals. They are on the first floor. They are an old Kroger store, \nan old Safeway store, an old hardware store. But inside are doctors, \nnurses, and now health IT, which is in this bill and heavily promoted, \nwhich may be coming on its own, but I doubt it.\n  This bill is really important to health IT. They could communicate \nwith any university, any medical center, not just in West Virginia but \nin the world. They can get experts to look at, let's say, a mole on a \n14-year-old's arm. Is that just a mole or is that cancer? I have seen \nthat done. A doctor at West Virginia University--this was 20 years \nago--I can't believe that--looking at a kid in Moscow with a physician \nassistant attending. They put the then-technology on that mole. The \ndoctor in West Virginia was able to analyze it and say it is not \ncancerous. That was a wonderful event.\n  People gravitate to community centers. Poor people gravitate to them. \nRural people gravitate to them. They are easily accessible. They have \nvery good doctors. There is a lot in the bill to help with those kinds \nof doctors, those kinds of nurses, the staff, those kinds of places and \nthe whole health IT issue which makes the work they do there checkable, \naccessible anywhere else in the State, the country, or in the world. \nThose would be gone.\n  We have $10 billion in our bill for 1,000 new community health \ncenters all across America. I am excited about\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\nthat. I think that is great for rural America, and a lot of America is \nrural. Most of America is rural. That goes.\n  Then I think about subsidies for small business. I spoke to a Chamber \nof Commerce in a rural part of West Virginia, a conservative part of \nWest Virginia. They did not like the bill. That is why I went there. \nThey were all small business people. There are no big businesses down \nthere. I spent 3 hours with them. I went through the whole health care \nbill.\n  What was unusual to them is I stayed around and answered all their \nquestions. That was interesting. In other words, you do not just say \nthis is good, this is bad, here I am. You say: Have at me and I will \nanswer you as best as I can. Where you do not agree with me, you tell \nme that.\n  They had no idea that they get a 35-percent tax reduction, a tax \ncredit for giving health insurance. They cannot afford to give health \ninsurance. Maybe 35 percent is not enough, but they get that, and they \nget that until 2014. And then after 2014, it goes up to 50 percent. \nThey did not know that. All of a sudden the possibility of keeping \ntheir employees and doing the right thing by their employees--people in \nNew Hampshire, people in Wyoming, and people in West Virginia care \nabout each other. That is one of the beauties of small States. People \nreally care. They want to do the right thing because they all live \ntogether. They do not commute out to the suburbs. There are not a lot \nof suburbs around. That was impressive to me.\n  When I left, I got a standing ovation. I am going to put that aside \nbecause I cannot believe that standing ovation, but what I do believe \nis that they were interested. They at that point did not know it was in \nthe bill and there is no reason they should have known it was in the \nbill. Then someone who had been a major part in writing that bill talks \nto them and answers all their questions, the end point of which is 3 \nhours, and I get up and leave. That perplexes me.\n  If the minority leader's amendment prevails in that I do not think \nthere is an alternative coming, we go back to the present system. That \nall goes. The Senator from Wyoming, when he speaks, may say, yes, there \nis an alternative, and we will have to listen to that. If we do an \nalternative, that whole negotiation may be 2 to 3 more years. I do not \nthink people can wait that long.\n  In any event, I worry about the doughnut hole. Madam President, you \nknow that. It is so unfair that seniors pay up to a certain amount, \nthey get their prescription drugs, and they keep paying the premiums. \nBut then from $2,000 something to $5,000 something, they have to keep \npaying their premiums but they do not get any prescription drugs. That \nis the doughnut hole which we close, again not until the year 2020, but \nthey know it is going to close. That is gone. They have to work the \nsystem as best they can, pay their premiums if they can, and if they \ncannot they are out of luck. They will get cut off.\n  To me it would be brutally devastating if preexisting conditions, for \nchildren in particular, which starts right away, which is in effect \nnow, disappears. I was speaking about a 9-year-old kid who had cancer. \nHe was killed by the fact that he could not get any treatment because \nof annual limits. That is in effect now, and no lifetime limits is in \neffect now. Annual comes into effect in 2014. He died. I was a friend \nof that kid. I met with that kid. I met with his parents. I keep in \ntouch with them. He died. He could not get health care under the \npresent system. Under our bill, he would have gotten health care. One \ncan say maybe it was too late, but that does not matter in the sense \nthat he is just an example of somebody who is sick, who could get \nhealth care, and who otherwise could not get health care and he died.\n  I am haunted by that because I remember his face. His name was Sam. \nHe was a lovely kid. He is not around any longer because of the old \nhealth care system.\n  Health care is a very hard subject. It uses all kinds of words and \nacronyms. It is true in the Federal aviation bill, too, if we ever get \nback to that. Acronyms are not bad, they are just not friendly. They \nstill mean something, and because something is complicated it does not \nmean it is bad or wrong, it means it is complicated.\n  Health care by definition has to be complicated. People have to \nunderstand how the parts work together. It is very hard to do. I plead \nwith my colleagues to be cautious about repealing something which is in \nplace which appears people do not want to see repealed. They certainly \nwant to give it a chance. They certainly are seeing the benefits from \nit. We are already reading about those things, and it has just \nliterally started. It is a month-and-a-half old or a month old. We need \nto be cautious about that, particularly on repeal if it means going \nback to our present system or any substantial part of our present \nsystem. That would be a tragedy.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when I am \nfinished with my remarks, the junior Senator from South Dakota be \nallowed to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to support Senator McConnell's \namendment to repeal this health care law. I listen very carefully. I \nlisten to the people in Wyoming. The University of Wyoming conducted a \nsurvey. Sixty-eight percent of people in my home State want this law \nrepealed. The people of Wyoming have great concerns about the \nunfairness of the law. Our seniors who rely on Medicare are concerned \nwith the unfairness of a law that takes over $500 billion from them, \nfrom our seniors on Medicare, not to help Medicare, not to save \nMedicare, not to secure Medicare, but to start a whole new government \nentitlement program for someone else.\n  Let's look at the specific cuts to Medicare: $155 billion from \nhospitals; $202 billion from the 11 million seniors on Medicare \nAdvantage, and there is an advantage to Medicare Advantage. That is why \nso many seniors have signed up for it. Nearly $15 billion from nursing \nhomes; another $40 billion from home health agencies; and $7 billion \nfrom hospice.\n  The President the other night, in his State of the Union Address, \nsaid: If you have some ideas on ways to get down the cost of care and \nimprove care, I want to listen. Republicans have been bringing ideas to \nthe floor during the entire year-long debate, and those ideas have been \nignored and rejected. I suggest the President listen to his own Debt \nCommission. He appointed the Commission. They had a lengthy discussion. \nWhat the members of the Debt Commission said is that if you cut \nMedicare, a program designed for seniors, do not do what you did, do \nnot do what you suggested, Mr. President, do not do what the Democrats \nin the Senate have suggested, do not do what Nancy Pelosi wanted. If \nyou cut that kind of money from Medicare, the Commission says, you \nshould use that to help and save Medicare, not start a new government \nentitlement.\n  The Commission also said that we should repeal the CLASS Act. That is \na part of this health care law. It is called the CLASS Act. It has been \ndescribed by Democrats as a Ponzi scheme that would make Bernie Madoff \nproud because of the fact they use trickery, gimmicks to say: We will \nbring in money now and the big costs will not show up until 10 years \nfrom now.\n  I heard my distinguished colleague from West Virginia talking about \nsmall business and the tax credits. The small business owners in \nWyoming looked to that. What they found is if they want to hire an \nadditional worker, if they are at 10 or 11 workers and want to go to \n12, they lose part of the credits. Do you know how much low-paying jobs \nhave to be to get the tax credits? The average income has to be \n$25,000. It cannot be higher than $25,000 a year. If you want to give \nsomeone a raise, you are going to lose your tax credits.\n  Small business owners across the country who looked closely at this \nissue have said this does not help me at all. They are saying we need \nto make it cheaper and easier to create private sector jobs, and this \nhealth care law, with its expensive mandates and obligations, makes it \nmore expensive and tougher to create private-sector jobs. We want this \nlaw repealed.\n  Just yesterday, a court in Florida ruled that this entire health care \nlaw\n\n[[Page S392]]\n\nwas unconstitutional. There has been a separate ruling in Virginia \nprior to the beginning of this year. I will tell you that ruling in \nFlorida yesterday is a second stake in the heart of this health care \nlaw.\n  This government, this Senate, the House does not have a right to go \ninto the homes of the people of my State of Wyoming or anywhere around \nthe country and say to them: You must buy a product. You must purchase \nsomething. If the government can tell people they have to buy health \ninsurance, where does it stop? That is why I am encouraged, as are \nAmericans all across this country, when I see the ruling coming out of \nFlorida. People inherently understand this is unconstitutional. The \nhealth care law even fails to meet the President's own promise. In \nWyoming, we have a code of the West that says: If you give your word, \nkeep it. The President promised this health care law would actually \nbring down the cost of care, he said by $2,500 a family. What are we \nseeing with insurance costs? The costs continue to go up and up and up. \nThe President said: If you like what you have, you can keep it. That \nhasn't been true either. In terms of the insurance people have, they \nare losing what they have, if they like it. And even though several \npages of the health care law may have implied that, when the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services came out with over 100 pages of \nregulations, it was clear that if you get your insurance through work--\nbig company, small company--the majority of Americans will not be able \nto keep the health insurance they have and that they like.\n\n  A recent poll, released today, said that 58 percent of Americans \nwould like to have this health care law repealed. The interesting thing \nabout this was that this recent polling went further to say that when \nyou poll people who have actually talked to a nurse or talked to a \ndoctor or talked to a physician's assistant or an EMT or people \ninvolved in the health care area, even more of those people who have \ntalked to a health care provider want this health care law repealed.\n  As Nancy Pelosi said, first you have to pass it to find out what is \nin it. And as more and more people become aware of what is in it, more \nand more people want this health care law repealed. The mandates are \nexcessive and they are expensive, and States--with Governors of both \nparties--are being impacted by these huge expenses.\n  It is interesting. There was an article in Saturday's New York Times \nentitled: ``For Governors, Medicaid Looks Ripe for Slashing.'' That is \nGovernors of both parties. Well, what is Medicaid? They are going to \nslash Medicaid. The article states:\n\n       Hamstrung by Federal prohibitions against lowering Medicaid \n     eligibility, governors from both parties are exercising their \n     remaining options in proposing bone-deep cuts to the program.\n\n  I have just heard other colleagues on the Senate floor talk about \nthis huge expansion of Medicaid. That is the solution; that is the \nPresident's solution; that is the Democrats' solution; to cram more \npeople onto Medicaid, a program initially designed for the poor, with \nlow reimbursements rates and where over half of the doctors in the \ncountry won't see Medicaid patients. That is their solution.\n  I listened to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about \ncoverage and talk about care and they use the words interchangeably. \nThat is misleading to the American people. You can get a Medicaid card \nbut that doesn't mean you can get in to see a doctor in the way that \nyou might think. Half of the doctors don't want to see patients. Why? \nBecause the reimbursement is so low.\n  The New York Times article of Saturday speaks to U.S. aid running dry \nand States proposing Medicaid cuts, and the first person they cite is \nGovernor Jerry Brown of California, a Democrat, and under him, Andrew \nCuomo, a Democrat of New York. What does it say? It says:\n\n       The shrinking of Medicaid programs, if approved by the \n     state legislatures, would come at a tenuous moment for the \n     Obama administration. Starting in 2014, the health care law \n     calls for an enormous expansion of Medicaid eligibility that \n     is expected to add 16 million beneficiaries by 2019.\n\n  The health care law puts in place a program that will hire IRS agents \nto make sure people buy health insurance, but it doesn't pay to train \nthe doctors and the nurses needed to take care of those patients. As \nthe article goes on, it says:\n\n       States have already cut payments to health care providers \n     and scaled back benefits over the last few years, so these \n     new proposed cuts are much more painful.\n\n  I will tell you, the people of Wyoming want this law repealed. The \nchairman of our health committee in our State Senate--and I served \nunder him for 5 years when I was a member of the Wyoming State Senate--\nwhose name is Charles Scott, has been in the State Senate over two \ndecades and has studied this extensively. He had an article in the \nCaspar Star Tribune on January 30 speaking to this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Repeal of ``Obamacare'' Would Help Wyoming\n\n                           (By Charles Scott)\n\n       Contrary to the assertions made in Barb Rea's and Jan \n     Drury's Jan. 22 Star-Tribune guest column, ``Repealing health \n     care law doesn't help Wyoming,'' repeal of Obamacare would \n     help Wyoming because that law is a disaster for our country \n     and especially for Wyoming.\n       We need health care reform. Our American health care system \n     costs too much. There are too many uninsured. On average, \n     Americans die earlier than citizens of any other developed \n     country. Unfortunately the Obama reform makes these problems \n     worse. The Obama strategy for controlling costs is to attack \n     the health insurance companies. There is much to dislike \n     about insurance companies. Too often their strategy's to make \n     money by not insuring anyone who might get sick and not \n     paying for it when they do. However what they are telling us \n     with their high prices is that our health care system is out \n     of control. We pay for too many medical tests and procedures \n     that do us little good. The Obamacare strategy amounts to \n     shooting the messenger and doesn't solve the underlying cost \n     problem.\n       The Centerpiece of the Obama effort to insure the uninsured \n     is to expand the Medicaid program, the existing program for \n     poor people. This is the most expensive way available to \n     insure the uninsured. The Medicaid program is designed to be \n     a high-cost program. The federal government has required a \n     set of Medicaid benefits that are richer than any insurance \n     the rest of us can buy. The feds forbid most of the effective \n     cost controls the rest of us face. One consequence is that \n     Medicaid clients are free to use the hospital emergency room \n     for things most of us take care of at home. The health care \n     costs for an adult in Medicaid are one and a half times \n     larger than for a comparable adult insurance by our largest \n     private insurer and a child costs two and a half times as \n     much. The federal government cannot afford the Medicaid \n     expansion without a massive tax increase and neither can the \n     state government once the law is changed so we have to pay \n     our normal share.\n       So what is the Legislature doing to deal with the problem?\n       Last year, three weeks before Obamacare passed, we passed \n     the Healthy Frontiers pilot project. It is an effort to \n     insure the working uninsured using incentives for cost \n     control. It has an expanded prevention package and a health \n     savings account. The individual pays part of the cost on a \n     sliding scale according to income. The strategy is to spend \n     more up-front on everyone to save by reducing the need for \n     very expensive care later. Right now it is funded for only \n     about 200 people and only through June 30. We have \n     legislation this time to expand the numbers to 3,000 so we \n     can find out if it really will save money. Our computer \n     models say it will, but there is no substitute for trying it \n     with real people. If Obamacare is not repealed this will give \n     us an alternative to the expensive Medicaid expansion. If it \n     is repealed, then Healthy Frontiers is an alternative way to \n     solve the problem of the uninsured and could be imitated by \n     private insurance to reduce costs for everyone.\n       Obamacare will make our existing shortage of doctors, \n     particularly primary care doctors, even worse. To help solve \n     this problem my committee is proposing expanding the \n     community health centers. They can recruit doctors better \n     than anyone else in the state because they are not subject to \n     our tort liability system. They are under the federal tort \n     claims act so their doctors are not bothered by our \n     malpractice problems. Our failure to reform our tort \n     liability system makes it too hard to recruit enough doctors \n     to the state otherwise.\n       Obamacare mandates organizations called insurance exchanges \n     which can either be ways to improve competition among private \n     insurance companies (the Utah model) or pass out government \n     subsidies (the Massachusetts model). To work effectively \n     these may require more people to spread the costs of running \n     the exchanges than Wyoming has. We are examining this concept \n     and the federal requirements to see if they can work in \n     Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S393]]\n\n       Obamacare requires federal agencies to write several \n     hundred sets of new federal regulations. We fully expect some \n     of these rules to be impractical for a small state like \n     Wyoming or to go beyond what the federal law allows in very \n     expensive ways. My committee has proposed a litigation fund \n     so we can fight these regulations in court when need to. I \n     have also proposed a constitutional amendment to keep the \n     state from participating an any attempts to explicitly ration \n     care which I expect to eventually be part of the effort to \n     have the government take over our health care system.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the headline of the article is: ``Repeal \nof `Obamacare' Would Help Wyoming.'' I want to cite a few excerpts:\n\n       Repeal of Obamacare would help Wyoming because that law is \n     a disaster for our country. Our American health care system \n     costs too much. There are too many uninsured. Obama reform \n     makes these problems worse. The centerpiece of the Obama \n     effort to insure the uninsured is to expand the Medicaid \n     program, the existing program for poor people. This is the \n     most expensive way available to insure the uninsured.\n\n  This is from someone who has studied this for 20 years. He goes on to \nsay:\n\n       The Medicaid program is designed to be a high-cost program. \n     The Federal Government has required a set of Medicaid \n     benefits that are richer than any insurance the rest of us \n     can buy. The Feds forbid most of the effective cost controls \n     the rest of us face. One consequence is that Medicaid clients \n     are free to use the hospital emergency room for things most \n     of us take care of at home. The health care costs for an \n     adult in Medicaid are one and a half times larger than for a \n     comparable adult insurance by our largest private insurer and \n     a child costs two and a half times as much.\n\n  Those are the things we are dealing with. That is the solution the \nDemocrats have presented to the country. That is what has been passed. \nThis solution is not a solution. What we need to do is repeal and \nreplace this health care law.\n  The American people notice when month after month the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services rolls out more waivers for people under this \nhealth care law. Last week, she granted 500 new waivers. We now have \n2.2 million Americans to whom this law does not apply. They have gotten \ntheir waivers, so it doesn't apply to them.\n  You might say: Who are these people? Well, they are people with \nfriends in high places, because 166 of these are union benefit funds--\n166 entities covering 860,000 Americans. These are some of the same \nunion members who lobbied Congress, who contributed in ways to say we \nneed this health care law. Yet they say: Oh, once we have looked at \nit--followed Nancy Pelosi's idea and actually read the bill to see what \nwas in it after it got passed--we don't want it to apply to us.\n  So 40 percent of all the waivers have gone to unions, even though \nunion workers only account for 7 percent of the private workforce in \nthis country. Well, if this health care law is so great for the \ncountry, why should companies and unions need waivers? And why can't \nthe rest of America receive a waiver and get the same treatment?\n  That is why I come to the floor today, to tell my colleagues this \nhealth care law is bad for patients, it is bad for providers--the \nnurses and the doctors who take care of those patients--and it is bad \nfor the taxpayers. By voting to repeal this health care law, we will \ngive these waivers to every American and give them the opportunity and \nthe freedom they request, and the flexibility they need to get the \nhealth care that works best for them, not a one-size-fits-all approach \nthat comes out of Washington loaded with Washington wasteful spending.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to add to the comments made by my \ncolleague from Wyoming, who in his former life was a physician, and so \nhe understands this issue probably better than any of us here in the \nChamber. I think he very eloquently pointed out why this amendment we \nare hopefully going to be voting on, which will repeal the health care \nlaw, is so important.\n  Obviously, there is a big debate that has been raging in the country \nover the past year about this legislation as it was being considered \nhere in the Congress, and I think the one thing that is clear about the \npublic's view of this is that they think it was a bad idea. And that \nhasn't changed. That was true a year ago, that was true 6 months ago, \nand that is still true today.\n  I think the administration had tried to argue they had merely done a \npoor job of communicating to the American people how great this health \ncare reform idea was. But that excuse misses the point entirely. The \nAmerican people are not clueless. They know a bad idea when they see \none, and they understand that the Democratic health care plan was a bad \nidea. So despite the administration's full court PR press in trying to \nreverse the public opinion, the health spending law remains unpopular \nin the polls.\n  In fact, as was quoted by my colleague from Wyoming, there was a poll \nthat came out today where 58 percent of likely voters in a recent \nRasmussen poll favor repeal. In fact, if you drill down a little \nfurther into that survey, it says 47 percent strongly favor repeal, 38 \npercent oppose repeal, and 29 percent strongly oppose repeal. But you \nhave a decisive majority in this country--58 percent of the \npopulation--saying they wish to see this repealed, and nearly half are \nstrongly committed to that position.\n  So notwithstanding efforts by the administration to reverse the \npublic's view, the American people still get it. I think the \nadministration had hoped this would get behind them, that people would, \nonce they were educated about the benefits, come to a different \nconclusion, but I think they see clearly now that hasn't happened. That \nhasn't been the case.\n  This whole health care law has failed the test of being something the \nAmerican people think is important and something they want to see done. \nI don't doubt for a minute they want to see the issue of health care \naddressed in this country--health care reform. Unfortunately, this \nparticular proposal didn't do anything to reform health care. It \nexpanded health care dramatically and expanded the cost most people are \ngoing to bear when it comes to paying for their health insurance \npremiums. So it failed the test of public support of the people in this \ncountry who have been following this debate very carefully, because it \naffects them in a very personal and profound way. Health care is \nsomething every American understands. It is something they get, and it \nis regrettable we passed it. I think the American people have turned a \nthumbs down on it, and that should speak to the importance of this \namendment and our trying to go back and do this the right way.\n  The other test it failed--which everybody here talks about, and there \nis a great deal of lip service and a great deal of rhetoric paid to \nit--is the issue of jobs. Honestly, I think if there was a message \ncoming out of November's election it was this: The American people want \nus focused on three things. They want us focused on jobs, they want us \nfocused on spending, and they want us focused on the debt.\n  On the issue of jobs, this also fails the test. Why? Because it \nraises taxes so dramatically. If you look at the tax increases in the \nbill--$569 billion in taxes on virtually every sector of the American \neconomy. For instance, the measure penalizes employers for hiring more \nworkers by raising the Medicare payroll tax by $210 billion, levying \nnew taxes on many small businesses that will serve as the engine of \neconomic growth and job creation.\n  If we want to get this economy recovering again and creating jobs, \nthe one thing you don't want to do is to impose new mandates, new \nburdens, new taxes, new regulations on the economic engine, the job \ncreators in America today, and that is our small businesses. So if we \nare serious about the issue of jobs, this certainly didn't do anything \nto create jobs.\n  I think the American people made it plain, and it is clear, they want \nus focused on jobs. They want us exclusively focused on getting this \neconomy back on track, creating jobs and getting the American people \nback to work. So it failed on that test.\n  How about on the test of spending? I think the American people \nunderstand that very basic sort of adage--if you want to call it that--\nwhich says when you are in a hole, you don't keep digging. What we have \ndone is we have dramatically expanded the size of government at a time \nwhen we are running year-over-year trillion-dollar deficits. So what \ndid this do? When it is fully implemented, it will increase spending by \n$2.6 trillion. That is the 10-year score between 2014 and 2023. That is \na massive expansion--the most dramatic\n\n[[Page S394]]\n\nexpansion we have seen in government, literally, since the 1960s.\n  So this doesn't do anything to address the issue that the American \npeople spoke loudly about, and that is getting Washington spending \nunder control.\n  Arguably, as I said before, I think they care deeply about the issue \nof health care and getting health care costs under control. As I will \nget to in a minute, this does little, if anything, to address health \ncare costs. But it certainly increases Federal spending and increases \nthe role and the size of government at a time when most Americans are \nsaying we want the government reined in. We want less government. We \nwant the government to start living within its means. Instead, we have \nincreased and expanded the size of government dramatically.\n  How about the issue of debt? A lot has been made by our colleagues on \nthe other side that if we were to repeal this, it is going to add to \nthe deficit. Let's go back to the reason why they can make that \nargument. The reason they can make that argument is because of all the \ngimmicks, all the phony accounting that was included when this bill was \npassed in the first place.\n  We have all referenced and talked about the double counting of \nMedicare savings, to the tune of about $400 billion, new payroll taxes, \nsavings that are supposed to be achieved by reductions in Medicare \nspending double counted, counted both as a ``paid for,'' an offset to \npay for the new health care entitlement program, and as a credit to the \nMedicare trust fund. You cannot double count. You cannot score these \nthings in a way that dips into the same revenues twice. That was one of \nthe great ironies of this legislation, when it was being debated here, \nthat issue did not become more fully discussed, the way this thing was \naccounted for and the way in which the trust funds were credited with \nsaving or extending the lifespan of Medicare at the same time the same \ndollars were being used to pay for this new health care entitlement. \nYou cannot spend the same money twice and that is exactly what \nhappened.\n  The American people get that. I cannot feature any other place in \nAmerica where you could get away with what happened here during the \nhealth care debate. So you had the $400 billion--$398 billion, to be \nexact--that was double counted on Medicare. You also had $29 billion in \nSocial Security revenues that was double counted as well. The Social \nSecurity trust fund was credited with $29 billion at the same time the \nrevenue that was coming in from higher Social Security payroll taxes \nbecause some changes that were made in the legislation were counted to \npay for the new health care entitlement. So you had Social Security and \nMedicare payroll taxes that were double counted, that were essentially \nscored twice, to credit the Social Security trust fund and the Medicare \ntrust fund, at the same time they were being used to finance the new \nhealth care entitlement.\n  Add in the $70 billion that was listed as revenues to pay for this \nfrom yet another new entitlement program called the CLASS Act, which is \na long-term care entitlement program. As was described by my colleague \nfrom Wyoming, even the Senate Budget Committee chairman, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, described the CLASS Act as a Ponzi scheme of the \nhighest order, something Bernie Madoff would be proud of. Yet $70 \nbillion was scored as being a revenue raiser to pay for the new health \ncare entitlement program, knowing that full well, at some point in the \nfuture, the people who paid premiums into this new program were going \nto demand some sort of payment when it came time to stake a claim \nagainst that, against that trust fund, those benefits were going to \nhave to be paid out. So in the outyears it dramatically expands and \nexplodes the deficit, even though in the near term it was counted as \nrevenue that was used to shield the true cost of the health care bill.\n  If you add in the cost of implementation, which turned out to be $115 \nbillion, something that was not discussed nor included in the debate \nnor was it included in the initial CBO score, you have about a $208 \nbillion cost to do the doctors fix, to take care of the physician fee \nissue, which will be coming to us, which was left out of this bill to \nunderstate the true cost of this bill to put it into balance, my point \nsimply is, by any objective measure, if you look at the games that were \nplayed, the gimmicks that were used, the phony accounting that was used \nto claim that somehow this was going to be a positive impact on the \ndeficit, it does not pass the smell test. No rational American would \nlook at this and say this makes any sense at all.\n  In fact, if you add up everything I just said, if you take all these \naccounting gimmicks, all the phony accounting that was used, and you \noffset that against what is claimed as a budget savings, you actually \nget not a $143 billion savings, you get about a $700 billion deficit. \nThat is what we would be looking at over the 10 years.\n  Remember also that you have the 6 years of spending in this bill in \nthe first 10-year window, which is what the CBO used to score this, and \nabout 10 years of revenues. So the tax increases start right away, the \nrevenues are counted immediately, but the spending doesn't come until \nlater. You front-load the revenue, you back-end load the spending in \nthat decade and try to claim that somehow this thing balances out. \nAgain, the American people see through this. They get it, which is why \nthey have taken the position they have on the health care bill in the \nfirst place. On the test of debt, on the test of how does this impact \nthe deficit, how does this impact America's long-term fiscal standing, \nthis bill is a failure.\n  One other point I would like to make--I wanted to come back to it \nearlier--I think a lot of Americans were hoping that when Congress took \non this issue of health care, it actually would be with an eye toward \nreducing the cost of health care insurance premiums for most Americans. \nWhat we are seeing is the contrary. Actually, what we predicted would \nhappen is coming true. Many of us who were involved in that debate \nsaid, at the time, this was going to lead to higher health care costs \nfor most Americans, and it is actually true. Actually, the CBO said the \nsame thing. They said the individual health insurance premiums would \nincrease by about $2,100 per family as a result of the new law and that \nsome consumers would face total premium increases of more than 20 \npercent. Those are things we are seeing come to fruition now. A lot of \npeople are seeing their health insurance premiums go up. That is a \nfact. It is a reality. It is a complete contradiction of what was \npromised when this bill was being debated.\n  You have not only higher taxes on small businesses that are costing \nus jobs, that are destroying jobs, you have this massive expansion of \nspending, you have the debt and the deficit which, in the outyears, are \ngoing to explode because of all these accounting gimmicks, and then \nwhen all is said and done, you still have not done anything that lowers \nhealth care costs for most Americans. I believe, for most Americans, \nthat is what they wanted to see come out of the health care debate in \nthe Congress. They wanted to see reforms passed that put downward \npressure on health care costs to them and their families rather than \nincrease it. In fact, what we have seen is the opposite. It has not \ndecreased cost; it has increased costs. I think we are going to \ncontinue to see costs go up because as these tax increases kick in, a \nlot of businesses around the country obviously are going to pass these \ncosts on to the American consumer. So it fails the test of doing \nanything to lower costs for most Americans.\n  Finally, it is also now failing the legality test, as we are seeing \nthese courts coming out and determining that this whole exercise was \nunconstitutional. That triggers a whole other debate in this country, a \ndebate that I think we are going to watch probably for a while, but I \nhope, as this moves through the courts, it does engage the American \npublic about what is the role of the government and how intrusive \nshould it be and what kind of mandates can it impose on the American \npeople. There was a very well-reasoned decision that came out of the \nFlorida court yesterday which says this legislation is \nunconstitutional. Again, that makes the argument that many of us were \nmaking as this was being debated last year.\n  The bottom line is, we are in a position to do something about it. \nThis is not the end. This should not be the end\n\n[[Page S395]]\n\nof the debate. We should look at this as an opportunity. If the \namendment that was offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, \nactually were to pass and we were to repeal this, we could start over. \nWe could go about this in a way that actually does reform health care \nin this country in a way that lowers costs rather than raises costs for \nmost Americans. I think that would be a welcome thing for the American \npeople.\n\n  The other side is going to argue we do not need to do this. We do not \nneed to repeal this. We just need to ``repair'' it. We can make these \nlittle modifications to it. But the fundamental fact is, this was a \nmistake in the first place and we should acknowledge it. I think, \nagain, the fact that it passed last year on a total party-line vote, a \ntotal partisan vote--there was not a single Republican in the Senate \nwho voted for this. Usually, when you are doing big, bold things, when \nyou look historically in the country, it is done in a bipartisan way. \nIt is done in a way that incorporates the best thoughts, best ideas, \nbest inputs from both sides, and you generally get a bipartisan vote in \nsupport of something such as that. This was passed on a party-line \nvote. It is now facing a challenge--and I think a very direct \nchallenge--in the courts, which is going to play out in the course of \nthe next several months. But we in the Senate could do something by \nrepealing this law and starting over and going about this the right \nway. That is not to say for a moment there are not issues that need to \nbe addressed with regard to health care in this country. Many of them \nhave been touched upon by speakers who have come down here before me. \nBut there is a better way to do it. There is a way to do this that does \nnot dramatically expand, increase the size of our Federal Government, \nthat does not add and explode the debt in the outyears, that does not \nraise taxes on our small businesses when we are asking them to create \njobs, that actually does lower the cost of health care insurance for \nmost people in this country rather than increasing it and is done in a \nway consistent with what our Framers intended, in terms of the basic \nparameters that are allowed by our Constitution.\n  I hope the McConnell amendment will be voted on. I think it is \nimportant for all of us, obviously, to be on record. But I hope my \ncolleagues on the other side may reconsider the position they took when \nthis was voted last year and conclude with many of us that this was a \nfailure and that starting over is the very best solution for the \nAmerican people, if we are serious about giving them a health care \nsystem in this country that is affordable, that delivers the high \nquality they expect, and enables them to have the maximum amount of \nchoice and decisionmaking authority when it comes to something that is \nso personal and so important to them; that is, their health.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I listened to my friend from South Dakota. \nI was thinking about how long we have been debating health care reform. \nIf we were to repeal the bill we enacted last year, how long would it \nbe before we would be able to get back to serious health care changes?\n  It took us 1 year to debate and pass the bill that was ultimately \nsigned by the President, but it took us 30 years to get to this subject \nand several administrations, both Democratic and Republican, that \noffered proposals where we could bring down the cost of health care and \nmake it more available to the people of this country.\n  We brag, and rightly so, that we have the highest quality, most \ntechnologically advanced health care in the world in the United States. \nI look at my own State of Maryland, and I know people come from all \nover the world to get their health care needs met and get their doctors \ntrained, whether it is at Johns Hopkins University or the University of \nMaryland Medical Center or what is happening at NIH. I know the \nPresiding Officer can tell us about the great institutions in the State \nof Pennsylvania, and that is true.\n  The problem is, it is out of the reach for too many Americans. It is \ntoo expensive. We don't have access to care in too many communities in \nAmerica. The Congress last year did something about that. We took major \nsteps forward to help the people of our Nation.\n  I have gotten hundreds of letters and phone calls from people in \nMaryland who told me their stories about fighting health insurance \ncompanies or their stories about trying to get access to preventive \nhealth care and how they were denied under our current system. I have \ntalked to seniors in Maryland. I know how expensive health care is to \nthem.\n  Seniors are very fortunate in that they have Medicare. But seniors, \nas an age group, have the highest out-of-pocket costs of any group of \nAmericans. There are too many gaps in the system. We have to improve \nthe system.\n  The problem I have with the amendment of Senator McConnell is, if we \nrepeal what we did last year, we have to understand what consequences \nthat will mean. We are not sure when Congress will be able to deal with \nthis subject again. It might be 30 years from now. If we just repeal \nthe bill, as suggested by Senator McConnell, the consequences of that \naction will be very damaging to the seniors in Maryland and around the \nNation.\n  Let me tell you why. The bill we enacted last year started to deal \nwith the gap in coverage for prescription drugs. Seniors last year \nreceived $250. This gap--after you spend a couple thousand dollars on \nprescription medicines, you then have to pay 100 percent of the costs \nof your prescription medicines under current law, until you spend \nanother couple thousand. For many seniors, they cannot afford that. \nThat means doing without prescriptions, cutting pills in half, \ncompromising their own health care.\n  I have received many letters from seniors in Maryland telling me: I \nhad to leave a prescription on the counter because I couldn't afford it \nand I have Medicare and I have coverage under Medicare D, but I could \nnot afford it because I fell within the coverage gap. Do something \nabout it.\n  It is not fair. Taking medicine to keep me healthier--I should be \nable to get that coverage here in the wealthiest Nation in the world. \nWe did something about it last year, and repeal would eliminate that \nprotection. We are going to close totally that coverage gap, that so-\ncalled doughnut hole. This year, the benefits are going to be worth \nabout $500 to seniors who fall within that coverage gap. That would be \nlost if the McConnell amendment were adopted and became law. We can't \nlet that happen. Next year, it will even be a better benefit because it \ngets up to about $2,400. That would be lost if we were to repeal the \nlegislation.\n  It goes beyond that. We are now providing a wellness exam every year \nto seniors. They will be able to get covered for their preventive \nhealth care. They don't have that today. We expand their benefits. We \nguarantee their benefits will be provided, but we go beyond that. We \neliminate a lot of the copayments on preventive health care. We make \nthe program stronger, increasing the benefits for seniors.\n  At the same time, we do something which is extremely important: We \nmake the program safer for tomorrow. We extend the solvency of the \nMedicare trust fund for a decade. That is what we did last year.\n  If we repeal the bill, if the McConnell amendment becomes law, the \nMedicare system will be on much weaker ground, making it much more \nvulnerable to the types of attacks some of my Republican colleagues \nhave been talking about, much more likely that would become a reality. \nThat is what this bill means for the seniors of Maryland and the \nseniors of West Virginia and the seniors of Pennsylvania.\n  That is what we did. We strengthened the program. That would be lost \nif the McConnell amendment were to become law.\n  It goes beyond seniors. It goes to all families. I can't tell my \ncolleagues how many families I have run into who have said to me: \nSenator Cardin, we want to cover our children, but under the old law, \nonce they became 21 or 22, they lost coverage, even though they still \nneeded insurance coverage.\n  We changed that to the age of 26. Under this law, one is allowed to \nbe on their parents' policy until age 26. That is the law of the land \nright now. The McConnell amendment will repeal that. It will tell these \nyoung people who perhaps have graduated from college, who may be in \ntheir first job but\n\n[[Page S396]]\n\nthey don't have insurance available, that they will not have an \naffordable option for health coverage. They can't be on their parents' \npolicy. Do we want to do that? That doesn't help American families. \nThat moves us in the wrong direction.\n  We have told the private insurance marketplace that your premium that \nyou pay, whether you do it through work and your employer and your own \ncontributions or the premium you pay, that most of that premium should \ngo for health benefits. It should not go for bonuses for insurance \ncompany executives. It should not go for nonmedical expenses. Most of \nit should go for benefits. The bill we passed last year says that now \n80 to 85 percent of the premium you pay for your health insurance must \ngo for benefits. If it doesn't, you will get a rebate. The money will \nactually come back to you in your pocket. That is taking on the private \ninsurance companies, telling them they have to work within at least \nacceptable ranges. That is going to provide real benefits, improved \ncoverage for the people. If the McConnell amendment were to become law, \nthat would be lost. We would be at the mercy of private insurance \ncompanies.\n  How many constituents have we heard from who have told us examples of \ninsurance companies using preexisting conditions to block their \ncoverage? I could tell you about a family in Montgomery County. A \nhusband and wife with two children had to take out two insurance \npolicies because the insurance company said that one of their children \nhad a preexisting condition. They had to take out two insurance plans, \npaying two premiums and two deductibles. That is outrageous. We have \ndone away with preexisting conditions for children.\n  We are going to do away with preexisting conditions for all \nAmericans, as we should. You buy insurance to protect you. I was \nsurprised to learn how many Americans, if they try to buy insurance \ntoday without government protection, would run into an insurance \ncompany that tells them they have a preexisting condition. If you have \nhigh blood pressure, even if it is under control--preexisting \ncondition. God forbid you should need to see a cardiologist--not \ncovered. If you have high cholesterol, take a pill, it is under \ncontrol. You think you are in good shape. Your cholesterol numbers are \nstill good. Not for the insurance company; that has been considered a \npreexisting condition. If you are a victim of domestic violence, that \nis considered a preexisting condition. Quite frankly, some insurance \ncompanies consider women to be a preexisting condition, the way they \nwrite their policies. We do away with that. If the McConnell amendment \nwere to become law, all that protection is gone.\n  If you think we will be able to pass it again quickly in this \nCongress, come down here and watch the way Congress works. Thirty years \nit took us to bring this bill up and get it passed. These are \nprotections that are critically important to families. We need to make \nsure these are protected.\n  Caps. You buy an insurance plan and find out you have annual caps and \nlifetime caps which you thought you were buying protection against in a \ncatastrophe. It is not there. We have done away with the caps to \nprotect American families. That would be gone if the McConnell \namendment were to become law.\n  I have heard a lot of discussion about small businesses. One of the \nreasons I worked so hard for passage of the Affordable Care Act is to \nhelp small businesses. They are discriminated against. It costs a small \nbusiness owner more for the same coverage for its employees than a \nlarge company. On average, it is about 20 percent higher for smaller \ncompanies to insure their employees. That is just wrong. We take steps \nto correct that immediately by giving small businesses a credit. We \nhelp them by making it more affordable for them to cover their \nemployees.\n  I heard my colleagues complain that premiums are going up. Yes, they \nare, because of the current system, the one we have changed or are in \nthe process of changing. It is going to take some time for us to get \nfull implementation of that law. That is understandable. It is wrong. I \nwish we could do more to bring it down quicker. But for this bill the \npremiums would be even higher. We know that.\n  This bill helps us to start to get a handle on helping small \nbusinesses have affordable coverage for their employees. Once again, if \nthe McConnell amendment were adopted and became law, that protection, \nthat help for small businesses would be lost.\n  Let me talk about taxpayers for a moment. There is a lot of \ndiscussion on both sides of the aisle--and I hope we are able to reach \nagreement--about bringing down the deficit. We need to do that for the \nsake of our economy and for our children and grandchildren. It is wrong \nfor us to pass on our debt to future generations. We need to be serious \nabout deficit reduction. I hope we do come up with a game plan in order \nto bring that about, but you don't do that by repealing the health \nreform bill.\n  Our own Congressional Budget Office, our independent evaluators, \ntells us that repealing this bill will add about $1.5 trillion to the \nnational deficit over the next 20 years. I know people who are \nlistening to me may not believe what I say. I understand that. I \nunderstand there has been a lot of misinformation given out. My \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle have tried to oversell this.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is our independent evaluator.\n  I remember when Senator Rockefeller was working on this bill, and we \nthought we had a pretty good understanding on how to bring the bill \nout. But, unfortunately, the CBO said: We can't give you all the \nsavings you think you are going to get by keeping people healthy. \nSenator Rockefeller and the Finance Committee had to go back and find \nsome additional savings in order to meet the CBO's requirement so that \nwe made sure we didn't add to the deficit. In fact, we reduced the \ndeficit with this bill.\n  So what do my colleagues in the House do? They say the CBO doesn't \nmean anything. If we do that with every bill we pass here, we will \nnever attack the deficit. We have to have objective rules for \nevaluating what we do and its impact on the deficit.\n  One thing is clear by the objective scorekeepers: The McConnell \namendment will add $1.5 trillion to the national debt because of what \nwe were able to do in the Affordable Care Act.\n  We could argue this from many different sides. I am always amazed \nthat my friends on the other side of the aisle say this is what the \nAmerican people want us to do. I have looked at the polls. They go back \nand forth. Americans are divided on this issue, but most Americans want \nus to move forward. They want us to deal with job creation and job \ngrowth.\n  The bill my friend from West Virginia has brought forward, the FAA \nbill, is a very important bill for the American people. It is going to \nmake our air traffic safer, but it will also create more jobs in \ncommunities--the exact type of bill we should be bringing forward. We \nshould be working today to create more jobs and keep more jobs. That is \nwhat this underlying bill does, not the McConnell amendment. That won't \nhelp us create jobs. That will add to the deficit and make it more \ndifficult for Americans to keep and get affordable health care. That is \nnot what we should be doing.\n  I invite my Republican friends, we should be working together on this \nbill. We should be looking at ways to improve health care. We never \nsaid, when we completed our work last year, that we know there is no \nmore work to be done. We know there are ways we can improve health \ncare. Let's work today to do that, but let's not go backward. Let's \nmove forward for the American people. Let's create the jobs we need for \nour economy. Let's continue to make health care accessible to more and \nmore Americans and affordable to more and more Americans. Let's provide \nthe quality of care that is befitting of this great Nation to all of \nour citizens.\n\n  In my State of Maryland, we have a person whom we will never forget--\nDiamante Driver, a 12-year-old who lived in Prince George's County. In \nthe wealthiest Nation in the world, in 2007, he needed to see a dentist \nbut had no health insurance. So his mom tried to get him to a dentist. \nNo dentist would treat him because he had no money. So he went to a \nsocial worker. His mom took him there. They made a lot of calls. No one \nwould treat him. His condition got worse. He went to an emergency room, \nwhich is what happens\n\n[[Page S397]]\n\nwith a lot of people who have no health insurance. Talk about saving \nmoney. One of the ways we save money under the Affordable Care Act is \nto bring people out of the emergency rooms and into our clinics and get \nthem the health care they need. Diamante Driver went to an emergency \nroom months after he should have seen the dentist. Because his tooth \nhad become abscessed and had gone into his brain, he had severe \nheadaches. He went to the emergency room because of his headaches. They \nfound that the only way they had a chance to save his life was through \nemergency surgery.\n  Two surgeries later, $\\1/4\\ million spent, where it would have cost \n$80 to take care of his need, Diamante Driver lost his life in 2007 in \nthe wealthiest Nation in the world.\n  I understand that health care is personal to every person. Everyone \nlooks at how they are going to be taken care of in this health care \nbill. That is what they should do. We think the overwhelming majority \nof Americans benefit by the bill we passed last year. But I would hope \nevery American wants to make sure we have no more Diamante Drivers, \nthat every person has access to affordable quality care. That was the \nsignature accomplishment in the last Congress. We did it in a way that \nhelped seniors, that helped families, that helped small businesses, \nthat helped taxpayers and helped America to become at long last a \nNation that said health care is a right, not a privilege. All that is \nlost if the McConnell amendment were to become law.\n  I urge my colleagues to think before they vote on this amendment as \nto whether they want to be on the right side of an issue that has \nhelped define the Nation. I urge my colleagues to reject the McConnell \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, that was a magnificent speech.\n  For the information of all Senators, there will be no rollcall votes \nthis evening. I will continue to work with my ranking member, Senator \nHutchison, and the leadership on both sides of the aisle on an \nagreement to dispose of the pending amendments tomorrow. Actually, it \nis on the FAA bill. Remember that? We sort of started out the day doing \nthat. That is a very important bill, as the Senator from Maryland \npointed out.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be debate only on the FAA \nauthorization bill for the remainder of the evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk \nabout the amendment Senator McConnell brought forward in terms of \nrepealing the health care bill. I am probably going to approach this \ndifferently than a lot of my colleagues have. I do not doubt that the \nintent of what was passed a year ago last December was well \nintentioned, with the thought of solving health care problems in this \ncountry.\n  My experiences, as a physician for 25 years, and as a manufacturer in \nthe medical device field for the 10 years before that, gives me a \nlittle bit different take on what the consequences are associated with \nthis bill.\n  During that hardy debate we all had, I made some claims that people \ndoubted in this Chamber which have become absolutely apparent and true. \nCosts are going through the roof, faster than we thought; portions of \npeople cannot tolerate the plans, so we are giving them exemptions \nbecause it will not work in the business model to keep people covered \nbut, most importantly, what is getting ready to happen is what happens \nbetween a patient and their access and their care and their provider. \nAs well meaning as the bill was, the destruction of that aspect of \nhealth care will cause us to rue the day we put into motion what we are \nputting into motion.\n  Let me explain. Most of the doctors in this country became very \ninterested in this health care bill, and rightly so. They are the ones \nwho are going to be impacted, along with their patients, because they \nare the ones delivering the care. When you poll those doctors, what do \nyou find, now that they actually know what this bill is going to do?\n  Well, some pretty significant statistics have come out--one by \nThomson Reuters--where two-thirds of the doctors in this country \nabsolutely believe the care of their patients is going to suffer as a \nconsequence of this legislation.\n  Think for a minute if you are an individual needing to access care \nand we are in 2014, 2015, and the Advisory Payment Board of Medicare is \nintact. We also know what the Medicare trustees have said about that, \nthat when this is fully impacted, the payment under Medicare--this is a \nvery important point--the payment under Medicare will be less than the \nreimbursement for Medicaid.\n  So all of a sudden who was your family physician or who was your \nsurgeon is no longer there. You see, this bill is about whether you can \nwalk in and have the attention and care of somebody dedicated to you, \nwho has your best interests at heart in terms of your health. What we \nare moving to is somebody who is going to have their best interests of \nsurvival at heart and your interests second.\n  That is the real tragedy of what is happening with this bill and the \nimplementation of it. Not only are we going to have payments reduced in \nMedicare--that is the only way the bill works, by the way; it is the \nonly way we can ever get out of the jam until we address fixing \nMedicare--but 55 percent of the specialists in this country today will \nnot see Medicaid patients at the reimbursement rate we have, and we are \ngoing to have a reimbursement rate for Medicare lower than Medicaid.\n  Let me give you another example. What we know on Medicaid is, if you \nhave no insurance and you go to an emergency room with a significant \nillness versus if you have Medicaid and you go to an emergency room \nwith the same illness, the outcome for you with no insurance is better \nthan the outcome for you with Medicaid. That has been repeated in four \ndifferent studies now, and we are putting 18 million people into a \nsystem who are not going to have access to the best doctors because the \npayment is so low that there is a loss every time you see a patient.\n  So describe to yourself for a minute what happens to the mother who \nhas three young children and has their 4-year-old all of a sudden sick \nwith a fever, and there is no primary care doctor available under the \n18 million new people who are going into Medicaid, and this child does \nnot get seen for 72 hours. The mother thinks: Well, I will wait the \nfever out. I don't have a doctor I can call. I will wait the fever out.\n  When the child gets to the emergency room, because there was not a \nprimary care doctor for that Medicaid patient to call, what do they \nfind? They find the 4-year-old not with otitis media any longer, but \nwith the early stages of meningitis. What was a simple, treatable \ndisease--because access, even though guaranteed, was denied because \nthere are not the available resources to care for that child--the child \nends up with a very complicated hospital stay and potentially the loss \nof hearing or brain damage. Those are the real consequences of what we \nare talking about as we put 18 million people into a Medicaid system.\n  We have had several Senators today talk about the cost and the \ngimmicks. I am not going to do that. But I want to talk about the real \nissues. The one place we failed in health care is we did not fix the \nreal problem. The real problem is, everybody's health care costs too \nmuch. We did not ask the right question: How do you drive costs down? \nEven when you go through all the numbers that have been given by CBO, \nMedicare trustees, Medicaid trustees, and outside studies, what we know \nis, what we did not do is drive any costs down. In fact, in the short \nterm we have actually driven costs up.\n  So how do we do that? The way we do that is put some responsibility \non both the physician and the purchaser of health care for the cost. It \nis human nature. If I gave you an insurance card for your groceries, \nand once your deductible was met all you had to pay was 20 percent of \nthat cost from then\n\n[[Page S398]]\n\non out, your diet would significantly improve in terms of the quality \nand price of the products you buy. That is all in our human nature.\n  What we have failed to do is to address the real cost drivers. That \ncost driver is: There is no connection with my purchasing of health \ncare with the actual payment of health care. How do we know if we \nconnect it, it works?\n  Go to any place in the country that has Amish folks. They do not have \nhealth insurance--none of them. They do not buy health insurance. What \ndo they do? They are grand consumers and very discretionary consumers \nof health care because they come forward and they want to know what \nthey are getting and what it costs before they buy it, every time. I \nhave delivered over 500 Amish babies, and there was not one time I \nwasn't asked at the time the patient came to see me: What is the price \nfor this? Will you take a cash payment up front so I can buy for \ncheaper? Are there some other places where I can get the tests done? \nEvery test I ordered, I would be questioned on whether they absolutely \nneeded the test. They were discretionary purchasers and very sharp in \ntheir discretion on how they wanted to pay for health care. \nConsequently, their cost for the same thing was 40 percent less than \nanybody who walked in with insurance.\n\n  So we have totally missed this connection of market forces allocating \nscarce resources by making discerning consumers out of the purchasers \nof health care. We have gone exactly the other way. We have taken \npeople who are at 133 percent of poverty and said: You are going into \nMedicaid, and by the way, you can't buy private insurance even if you \nwant to. You have to be in Medicaid--a far substandard health care \nsystem. All the studies show the outcomes are poor, even after you \nequate for social disparities. We are going to put 18 million into that \nprogram, and we are going to have a shortage of over 100,000 primary \ncare doctors in this country in the next 10 years. So who is going to \nsee them?\n  Let me give another example. It happened this weekend. A patient--90 \nyears of age--severely bent over from kyphoscoliosis, bad aging and \nkyphoscoliosis, is running a fever and can't breathe well. She goes to \nthe ER. She had seen a physician on Friday. She had a chest x ray, and \nno pneumonia showed. She goes to the ER that night. She has a pulse ox \nof 81 percent. Normal is 93, 94 percent. They put her on oxygen, change \nher antibiotics, and send her home.\n  Well, what happened? Had we not interceded--I personally as a \nphysician making a call to another physician--she would be dead by now \nbecause what she had was a full-blown, raging pneumonia and restrictive \nlung disease, but she was sent home from the ER because a physician--\nnot a doctor--a physician did not see her. So consequently she goes \nback to the ER the same night and is admitted to the hospital. They \ntake a chest x ray, and all of a sudden they see this full-blown \npneumonia. She had all the symptoms, but the person seeing her in the \nER didn't have the experience to make the judgment. So is that really \nwhat we want? We want substandard care, so somebody can go home and die \nversus coming to the hospital? Today, she is 200 percent better. She is \neating. Her pulse ox, now on room air, is 91 percent.\n  We actually saved her life because a real physician put hands on a \npatient and made the right diagnosis. But we are going to put people \ninto a system where that doesn't happen because we are going to use \nphysician extenders. That doesn't mean they are bad; they just don't \nhave the same experience, and people die when they don't have the same \nexperience. But we are going to inflate the utilization of less than a \nphysician to care for the vast majority of these people who are going \ninto Medicaid.\n  These are real examples of what the consequences are of what we have \ndone.\n  As I started, I said I don't doubt the intent of my colleagues in \nterms of what they were trying to get to, but the biggest disease \nWashington has is fixing the wrong problem. We have expanded health \ncare access under this bill, but access doesn't mean you are going to \nget care. And when you add 18 million people to the Medicaid rolls, let \nalone what is going to happen to the States, ultimately, with the cost \non the maintenance of effort where they have Medicaid now and we are \ngoing to go to 133 percent, what you have done is put the States in a \npinch, and they are in a pinch already.\n  So my question to my colleagues is, Where are the things that drive \nthe costs down? Where is the discerning consumerism that allocates \nscarce resources in the most effective way? In this bill, it is not \nthere. Nowhere is it there.\n  Now, what is there? What is there is a tremendous amount of new \ntaxes. There is $52 billion over 10 years on employers who fail to \ncomply with the insurance mandate; 40 percent excise tax on high-cost \nhealth plans, $32 billion; ban on purchase of over-the-counter drugs \nfrom somebody's health savings account, $5 billion; increased Medicare \ntax on wages of small businesses, nine-tenths of 1 percent; a 3.8-\npercent surtax on investment income, and that is $210 billion; increase \nfrom 7.5 percent to 10 percent of income the threshold after which you \ncan make a medical deduction; $2,500 annual cap on flexible spending \naccount contributions--and I could go through this and through this. \nThe point is, we are increasing spending on health care by $2.6 \ntrillion after this is truly in play. Also, the gimmickry in terms of \naccounting and the problems associated with that have been discussed on \nthe floor.\n  One of the things that is there that concerns me as a physician, \ngetting back to talking about patients, is cost comparative \neffectiveness. It was really cheap to send that 90-year-old person \nhome. There was an ER visit, a little bit of oxygen, a change in \nantibiotics. That was really cheap. Comparative effectiveness would \nhave said: Oh, that is OK--except she would have been dead in 24 hours.\n  Every physician who is maintaining their license or their specialty \ncertification studies comparative effectiveness every day. They read it \nin the journals. They do it to get recertified. They know the \ncomparative effectiveness. What they don't know is that we are going to \nmandate what they will do, what is the cheapest--not what is the best, \nwhat is the cheapest.\n  Well, I will tell my colleagues, if you look at heart disease in our \ncountry, if you look at cancer cure rates in our country, if you look \nat recovery rates from massively serious illnesses in our country from \nboth trauma and otherwise, what you will see is the highest rate of \nrecovery in the world. We have the highest 5-year survival rate on \nalmost every cancer by 20 or 30 percent over every other system in the \nworld. Do we really want to take that away?\n  In 2003, I was diagnosed with colon cancer. I had metastatic colon \ncancer. I am so thankful for the health care system we had that \ngenerated new devices, that incentivized great care, and after a major \nsurgery where half of my colon was taken out, radical lymphadenectomy \nwas carried out, and 6 months of chemotherapy, I stand before you \ntoday, 7 years after that. I want to tell you, had I been in England or \nCanada, my cure rate would have been about 35 percent. Do we know what \nit is in this country for somebody with metastatic colon cancer? It is \nnearly 70 percent. Now, what created that? What gave us the technology \nto do that? It is because we looked at the best clinical effectiveness, \nnot the best price. We said: How do we best and most effectively get an \noutcome of cure?\n  This bill goes the other way. This bill is going to be a mandate from \nWashington on what your doctor can do for you, and it is also going to \nmandate from Washington what price should be paid. There is no question \nthat, according to the trustees for Medicare, for us to maintain what \nhas been put in this bill, Medicare reimbursement rates will fall below \nMedicaid rates. Do we really want that to happen? I will tell my \ncolleagues, for those in my condition, those people who are diagnosed \ntoday with colon cancer, you don't want that to happen.\n  Now, how do we get the cost down? There is no question that there is \ntons of waste in our health care system. We have not attacked in the \nway we should attack--and I can say as a practicing physician that I \nwasted money caring for people because I didn't concentrate on that \nindividual because that individual wasn't paying the bill. Some \nnebulous insurance company was paying the bill. Some government program \nwas paying the bill. But when\n\n[[Page S399]]\n\nsomebody such as an Amish patient looks you in the face and you know \nthat what you spend of their hard-earned money is going to come \ndirectly out of their pocket, all of a sudden the other obligation of a \nphysician jumps up: How do I do this in the most efficient and \neffective way that still gives the best outcome? And we have totally \nmissed that.\n  The most personal of all interchanges between humans besides those \nwithin a family are between patients and their physicians, and we are \ngoing to interrupt that. We are going to undermine it, and we are going \nto undermine it because somebody from Washington is going to be looking \nand saying: Did you do it the way we said to do it, Doctor?\n  Now, what is the doctor's oath? Is it to do what Medicare says or is \nit to do what is in the best interests of the patient? So that is the \nrub. That is where we are going with this program. So what we are going \nto have is, first of all, we are going to have tens of thousands of \nphysicians retire over age 55--our best, most experienced physicians. \nThey are leaving. They are not going to play this game. And then we are \ngoing to give physician extenders the role as primary care. They are \nvery good in what their limited knowledge will give them but not \nanywhere compared to a full 8 years of medical training, including \nresidency. They have 2 years. And then we are going to treat all of \nthese people. What do we think the cost of that is going to be in terms \nof lost lives, in terms of delayed diagnosis? Delayed care is denied \ncare. What good is it if I have Medicaid and I can't see a doctor?\n  So the problems are very real with this bill, and I don't say that as \na fiscal hawk. I want to fix health care, and I want to drive the costs \ndown. And we can drive the costs down $300 billion or $400 billion a \nyear.\n  Thomson Reuters did a study. I talked about it in our debate last \nyear. The fact is, we know that over $580 billion a year is blown in \nhealth care. That is enough to cut everybody's health care costs 20 \npercent. But we didn't address any of those issues. Not one of the \nissues that Thomson Reuters has brought up that said, here is what is \nwrong, here is why health care is more expensive--we didn't address \nthose in the health care bill that was passed. Yet we wonder why we are \nout here wanting to change this bill. It is not so we can say: You did \nit wrong; it is because we really care, as you do, that we have to fix \nthe real problem, and this bill didn't fix the real problem.\n  So I hope my colleagues will take in the spirit that it is intended--\nthat we don't believe we have done anything except expand coverage \nunder a very broken system that is highly inefficient, that tells \npeople they are going to have care, but they are not going to have \ncare, and those who have a doctor are going to be told by the Federal \nGovernment what care they are going to have. It is exactly the opposite \nof what we should have done, and we did it in haste.\n  We know there are 1,600 new sets of rules coming, of which about 100 \nare through. We have another 1,500 to go.\n  CBO says that is $100 billion in costs just to implement all this, \nwhich was never even considered in the cost of this bill. That doesn't \nconsider the cost of complying with all of the new rules and \nregulations.\n  My time is up. I will be back to talk on this again. My hope is \nthat--now we have three physicians in the Senate and we have all seen \nthe same thing. I am a primary care OB, one is an ophthalmologist, and \none is an orthopedist. We pretty well have it covered.\n  What we have done is not going to work. We are going to be sorry we \ndid it. But do you know who will be the most unfortunate receivers? It \nis the people who think they have care but don't, the people who get \nseen by less than qualified individuals for the care they need, and we \nare going to pay twice what it should cost.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed as in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Shelby and Mr. Udall pertaining to the \nintroduction of S.J. Res. 4 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements of Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I have the opportunity to speak on the \nfloor of the Senate for the first time as part of the work of the \nSenate. I am pleased to be here on a day when the Senate is addressing \nthe topic of health care because clearly it was a major topic on the \nminds of Missourians and all Americans last year.\n  I support the amendment the Senator from Kentucky has offered that \nwould repeal the health care bill and make us start again looking at \nhow we make the health care system work better.\n  This is my first speech to the Senate, so let me say a couple things \nabout that.\n  As I look in the desk drawer, I understand the tradition of the \nSenate is that people who have used this desk, the desk I get to use on \nthe Senate floor--and coming from the House where nobody had a desk, it \nis quite an accomplishment just to get a desk--but the desk I will use \non the Senate floor has names carved in it by other Missourians who \nhave used that desk before: Senator Truman, Senator Eagleton, Senator \nDanforth, and Senator Bond.\n  I am honored and humbled to get to sit at the same desk those \nindividuals used as they served our State, and they all served our \nState in a dedicated way. In fact, the collective service of those \nSenators, in various jobs working for Missourians, probably totals \nabout two centuries of collective service, where they worked hard for \nMissourians and worked hard to advance the views they believed were so \nimportant.\n  Senator Bond, whose place I am taking on the Senate floor this year, \nfor 24 years in the Senate, I think, showed an unmatched understanding \nof our State and in recent years a real understanding of the national \nsecurity issues we face and what is necessary to protect the country. \nHe was a great competitor on the Senate floor and in all other ways a \ngreat friend of mine, and certainly my wife Abby and I value the \nfriendship we have had with Senator Bond and his wife Linda.\n  In fact, as I campaigned last year all over our State in 931 events, \nI never had a single person tell me they thought I would be a better \nSenator than Kit Bond and for good reason.\n  I am here today thinking about those events all over our State last \nyear. At first, I was surprised, having campaigned in Missouri before, \nat the level of engagement on the domestic issues the country was \nfacing. I truthfully had never seen anything like it, where people were \nready to talk about the specifics of the issues about which the country \nwas talking.\n  As I thought more and more about it, it occurred to me why wouldn't \nthey be engaged. This is not like we are trying to decide what your \nfamily's position is going to be on the missile defense system. This is \nnot like we are trying to decide your family's position about foreign \npolicy toward the Middle East. This was an election about jobs and \nhealth care and taxes and, in our State, whether your utility bill \nmight double in 10 years. Why wouldn't people be engaged in ways that \nwere extraordinary? They were.\n  They said they want government to move over and allow them the chance \nto get the economy back on the right track. They understood that \ngovernment jobs, while some of them are necessary--and I am glad to \nhave one--do not pay the bill; government jobs are the bill. We need to \nbe focused on private sector jobs and how to create those jobs. The \nquestions were: Why is the Federal Government spending so much more \nmoney than it has ever spent before? Where are the private sector jobs? \nFrankly, I would have thought that would be the overriding topic of the \nfirst speech I had a chance to give on the Senate floor.\n  But as I think about those two questions, I do not know that anything \nis a bigger issue in this health care discussion than the impact the \nhealth care bill has had on private sector job creation and on our \nestimates of future government spending.\n  The biggest single deterrent to job creation is uncertainty. We have \ncertainly done great things in the last few years to create a sense of \nuncertainty. If you do not know what your tax liability is going to \nlook like, if you do\n\n[[Page S400]]\n\nnot know what your utility bill will be, if you do not know what your \nhealth care expenses are going to be, you are less likely to take that \nrisk that anybody takes when they create a private sector job than you \nwould be if you had a greater sense of those questions.\n  In health care, for every job they create or every job a job creator \nwould think about continuing, this is a time they have to wonder: What \nis the obligation going to be? What is the cost going to be?\n  I was with a group of small businesspeople in northwest Missouri one \nday last year, right after the health care bill passed, about 30 days \nafter the health care bill passed. I was at Rock Port, MO. Somebody at \nthat meeting said: I have 47 employees. I have looked at the health \ncare bill and my accountants have looked at the health care bill. I \nneed 4 or 5 more people right now, but I am not going to hire them \nbecause I am not going to get 1 employee closer to 50 than I am now \nbecause 50 creates new obligations that 49 or 48 or 47 does not. I am \nnot going to hire those people. What am I going to do? I am going to \npay overtime in the short term, but in the long term I am going to look \nat what I am doing that is not making much money, and I am going to \nquit doing that.\n  There is somebody telling me a handful of jobs ready to be created \nthat he believed he needed to create are not going to happen because he \ndoes not want to get any closer to this health care moment. He does not \nwant to get any closer to where the government comes in and says: We \nare going to make you do things you do not have to do if you do not \ncreate these jobs.\n  People I talked with in Columbia, MO, in the middle of the State, in \nthe fast food industry, said: We are going to try to figure out how not \nto have full-time employees. What he said was the person who gives you \nyour breakfast sandwich in the morning may be the same person who, \nacross the street, gives you your fast food lunch because we are not \ngoing to have that person as a full-time employee if we can figure out \nhow not to have that obligation.\n  Real, sustainable private sector job creation does not happen in an \nenvironment of uncertainty. We need to be focused on jobs that are \nfamily supporting. We need to be focused on economic growth that \nincludes letting American families keep more of what they earn, which \nincludes economic incentives for small businesses and employers, and \nencourages the government to get out of the way so employers of all \nsizes can create self-sustaining, stable, private sector jobs.\n  We need a government that meets the requirements of the Constitution. \nRarely do we have a chance to revisit a misguided decision. In fact, \nthis decision and this bill was the result of a set of circumstances \nthat nobody would have anticipated.\n  When this bill was passed by the Senate with the 60 votes the Senate \nrequired at that moment, nobody thought this bill would be the final \nproduct. Not a single person who voted for that bill thought that is \nthe bill that will go to the President's desk. Everybody who voted for \nthe bill thought this will be a bill that gets the Senate to conference \nwith the other part of the Congress, and we will work out all the \nthings in the conference that need to be worked out between the two.\n  What happened was, suddenly the 60 votes that passed that bill were \nnot there anymore. That became the only bill that could become law. The \nplan the Republican leader, the minority leader, advances lets us go \nback and revisit this discussion and do this the right way.\n  Two Federal courts have already ruled that the law, one said, did not \nmeet the constitutional standard and could not go forward. Why was \nthat? That was because of the way the bill was put together, in a way \nthat did not have the normal legislative language that would allow \nseverability, that would allow if something is unconstitutional.\n  Nobody thought this was going to be the bill, and the American people \nare the victims of having to rush forward with a bill that was not \nready to become law.\n  Another Federal judge said part of the law is unconstitutional, that \nwhich makes people buy a commercially available product. I, along with \na lot of other people, have thought from day one that there is nothing \nin the Constitution that allows that to be a requirement.\n\n  Voters in the State of Missouri, my State, on the primary election \nday--the second biggest election we have had; we had hundreds of \nthousands of people vote--were faced with a question the legislature \nput on the ballot that essentially said: Do you want to be part of this \nprocess? Do you want to be part of the mandatory obligation to buy \ninsurance? Do you want to be part of the health care bill?\n  Over 70 percent of the voters who voted that day said no. They were \nthe first voters anywhere in the United States to go to the polling \nplace and have a chance to say at the ballot box how they felt about \nthis law that would go forward. They said they did not want to be part \nof it. Those voters understood that this was a misguided plan, that it \nput government between people and their doctors in ways Dr. Coburn \ntalked about earlier today, in a meaningful way that he and other \ndoctors who join us as Members of this body would understand.\n  It puts government between people and their doctors. It implodes the \ncurrent health care system. I believe the current health care system \nwill not survive this bill, not that the current health care system is \nperfect. But it certainly produces great results for people who come \nhere from all over the world.\n  This is a bill that cuts Medicare to pay the bill. Missourians \nunderstood that. I heard it over and over at the ballot box. They said \nthey did not want to be part of it. I thought, for three election \nopportunities--2004, 2006, and 2008--that health care would become the \nbiggest domestic issue. It maybe is too complicated, maybe too \ndifficult to deal with, maybe too personal and people did not want to \nengage and they did not engage.\n  This law gives us the opportunity now to go back and get it right. We \nneeded to deal with health care for a long time. When I worked in this \nCapitol on the other side of the building, we sent medical liability \nreform to the Senate seven times in 10 years. We sent plans half a \ndozen times where people could join together in what we were calling \nassociated health plans and get their insurance that way and become \npart of however big a group they could figure out to associate with.\n  It is not as if nobody was doing anything, but there was not enough \npressure. This bill very likely creates the pressure we need to go back \nand look for better solutions. They are there, such as this idea of \nassociated health plans, where you can join other individuals who are \nsomehow similar to you or other small businesses similar to your small \nbusiness. Medical liability reform saves the most money of anything \nthat can be done for taxpayers, but it also saves money for taxpayers \nwho are paying for their own health care because it takes a lot of \nexpense out of the whole system.\n  Certainly, we want people to have access to insurance coverage who \nhave preexisting conditions. In fact, I proposed in the past and will \npropose again this year, along with other ways, to expand risk pools so \npeople can have access to coverage but not coverage they wait for until \nthey are in the ambulance and need it, coverage they get because they \nwant it.\n  We need to empower families. One of the reasons government-designed \nanything does not work very well is the one-size-fits-all concept does \nnot fit very well. In fact, the so-called one size fits all almost \nnever fits anybody. That is what I think this bill does for the health \ncare that means so much to American families.\n  Somebody told me one time that when everybody in your family is well, \nyou have lots of problems, and when somebody in your family is sick, \nyou have one problem. This discussion of health care focused \nMissourians and Americans on one problem: How do we have access to \nhealth care that is the best health care we can have and also is health \ncare that is affordable? There is no real competition in this system, \nso I am for buying across State lines.\n\n  You aren't going to see anybody on television tonight advertising \nhealth care insurance, but it is pretty hard to watch television for a \ncouple hours in the evening and not see people competing for your \nbusiness in every other\n\n[[Page S401]]\n\narea of insurance. There is no little green lizard for health care. \nThere are all kinds of other people competing to get your other \ninsurance business, but this hasn't really had a marketplace. It hasn't \nbeen transparent, it hasn't been competitive. We can achieve all those \nthings, and we need to achieve all those things. Choice plus \ncompetition equals quality and price. And in health care, we haven't \nhad enough choice or competition, so we haven't seen that reflected in \nquality and price.\n  I don't believe the government has the authority to penalize citizens \nfor refusing to buy private health insurance. I don't believe taxpayers \nwill benefit from this bill that is built on too many false premises. \nThe idea that we are going to cut compensation to doctors back to \nlevels of a decade ago is not going to happen, and it is $\\1/4\\ \ntrillion of the so-called pay-fors in this bill. It is not going to \nhappen. It is almost equally unlikely that $500 billion of Medicare \ncosts are not going to happen. And if we can find savings in Medicare, \nwe should find them and use them to save Medicare. Only in Washington, \nDC, would you say: Look, we have one program that is about to get in \nreally big trouble in a handful of years, so let's cut that program to \nstart another program. I don't think those pay-fors are going to \nhappen, either, Mr. President.\n  When employers are telling us they are not hiring because of the \nuncertainty created by this new law, when courts are ruling the law \nunconstitutional, when voters are overwhelmingly rejecting it, we need \nto understand why. Americans deserve a country where the people are \nbigger than the government. This health care bill opens the door to a \nfuture where the government is bigger than the people, and I think we \nshould reject the law, repeal it now, move forward with more \ncompetition, more transparency, and better health care.\n  Better health care at a lower cost is achievable if we do the right \nthings. I believe this bill does the wrong things, and the more the \nAmerican people look at it, the more they are convinced that it leads \nus to a future that is not the health care future they want.\n  So, Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to speak on the Senate \nfloor, and I am pleased to be able to represent Missourians.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may, Mr. President, I believe this is the first \nopportunity the new Senator from Missouri has had to address the Senate \nand his colleagues, and he certainly has chosen a most important topic \nto begin his career here in the Senate. I wish to express my admiration \nnot only for the comments he just made on what many of us believe is \nright near the top of the list of America's priorities but also his \nextraordinary service in the House of Representatives over the last 14 \nyears and also to welcome the Senator from Missouri to the Senate. As I \nindicated, he certainly picked an appropriate topic on which to make \nhis maiden speech to the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Blunt's maiden \nspeech, too. I had the honor of listening to it. Of course, I disagree \nwith his comments.\n  I have heard all this before. I have heard Republicans say this is a \nbad law, that we have to deal with all these issues. I hear that over \nand over. But I also notice, by even a cursory observation or a look \nback at our Nation's recent history, that when President Bush was in \noffice, when our Republicans controlled the House of Representatives \nand they controlled the Senate, the only thing they did on anything \nrelating to health care or pensions was try to privatize Social \nSecurity. They didn't really do anything to try to provide health \ninsurance for people who did not have it. They passed no real consumer \nprotections in terms of eliminating preexisting conditions. They did \nnothing for a 23-year-old to stay on their parents' health insurance \nplan. They were woefully inadequate in their efforts to assist small \nbusinesses in providing health insurance for their employees.\n  So, Mr. President, it really is the same kind of empty rhetoric we \nhave heard from Republicans for years. They do not like doing it this \nway, they want to repeal and fix it, but they don't really want to fix \nit because they haven't really offered anything to fix it, particularly \nwhen they had the ability to pass something through both Houses and get \nit signed by the President. They really don't ever stand up to the \ninsurance interests. The Republican Party receives huge contributions \nfrom the insurance industry. The Republican Party receives huge \ncontributions from the pharmaceutical industry and the medical device \nindustry. So they really have shown little interest in providing for \nthe kind of people whose letters I am about to share.\n  We hear Republicans say: Well, we will provide insurance by selling \nacross State lines and enacting malpractice reform. Well, even the most \noptimistic estimates reveal that might insure 2 or 3 million more \npeople and cut costs in health care by a minuscule--I don't even know \nif it is 1 percent but nothing substantive that really matters in \npeople's lives or to any degree, not to mention that it takes away a \nperson's ability to get redress when they have been injured by a \nnegligent hospital or provider.\n  So this is mostly empty rhetoric from Republicans in this whole \ndebate. But I want to bring it back and put a human face on it. The law \nof the land today--much of what we passed a year ago--will affect \npeople's lives.\n  I am particularly troubled when I hear people stand on the House and \nSenate floor--or people in attorneys general offices in Columbus and \naround my State or around the country--and say they are in favor of \nbringing a suit against this health care bill. When I think about that, \nI think about conservative politicians who have been the beneficiaries, \nthey and their families have been the beneficiaries of taxpayer-\nfinanced health insurance for their whole careers, but now they want to \ntake benefits away from voters and citizens and families in my State. \nThey want to take benefits from seniors--some of their Medicare \nbenefits. They want to take benefits away from families. And it just \nstrikes me as rank hypocrisy.\n  But I can illustrate this better by reading these letters than I can \njust by talking.\n  Megan, from Summit County, is a college student. Megan is from the \nAkron area, and she says:\n\n       Being a 22-year-old college student, it can be very \n     demanding trying to keep a successful schedule going to \n     maintain health care under my parents. As for my brother, who \n     does not attend college, health care is nearly impossible \n     because of costs. This law will allow both of us to remain \n     under our parents for a little while longer while we get our \n     feet planted.\n\n  Megan knows even when she graduates how difficult it will be to find \na good job with good-quality health insurance, so she knows she has the \noption, because of this law, to stay on her parents' health insurance \nuntil her 27th birthday. When Republicans talk about repealing this \nhealth insurance law, what are they going to tell Megan or promise \nMegan in return? I assume nothing.\n  Rose, from Cuyahoga County in the Cleveland area, northeast Ohio, is \na small business owner. She says:\n\n       As a small business owner, I do not want the new health \n     care bill to be repealed. We are excited at the small \n     business tax credit for health care and also the new plans \n     being rolled out that will give us more choices. This bill \n     will help us to continue to offer health care to our \n     employees.\n\n  Rose, if she has fewer than 50 employees, is not required to buy them \nhealth insurance, but she will have available to them a 35-percent tax \ncredit, beginning last fall, which she can use to insure her employees, \nand most small employers want to do that. Most employers, period, want \nto do that. Also, by 2014, Rose will be able to benefit in her small \nbusiness with a 50-percent tax credit.\n\n  Richard, from Huron County, west and south of where I live in the \nNorwalk area, writes:\n\n       I've been reading where Mitch McConnell wants to force a \n     vote in the Senate on the repeal of the health care law. If \n     he does this, when you are allotted the time to speak, will \n     you ask all the Republicans if they will give up their \n     Federal health care since they are so opposed to this bill? \n     Ask them if they are willing to keep the insurance provided \n     by the government, but yet at the same time take away the \n     help for seniors toward their prescriptions or the preventive \n     checkups. Or ask them to tell all the families that their \n     sons\n\n[[Page S402]]\n\n     and daughters aren't covered under their family's policies.\n\n  Richard understands there are a bunch of people in this town and a \nbunch of conservative politicians who do not believe in government but \nwho are enjoying their taxpayer-financed insurance. Yet they are \nwilling to take Medicare benefits away from seniors, and they are \nwilling to take benefits away from families.\n  Tawnya, from Warren County, southwest Ohio near Cincinnati, writes:\n\n       Please fight the repeal of the Health Care law. Please \n     don't let them take away pap smears and mammograms from being \n     part of preventive health. People with pre-existing medical \n     conditions need insurance, too. There is a lot of good in \n     this bill that will be erased if it is repealed. Please fight \n     so all Americans can have basic care.\n\n  Craig, from Cuyahoga County, has children who are college-aged, and \nhe writes:\n\n       A number of years ago, my 23-year-old daughter was in a bad \n     car accident. She had no health insurance because her \n     employer did not offer it. Since she had no good access to \n     good health care, she received substandard care and she \n     continues to suffer. Contrast this to the present. My 21-\n     year-old son is taking a year off to earn money to return to \n     school. We cannot afford his tuition and living expenses as \n     he pursues a double major in physics and economics. In the \n     past, he would be uncovered by insurance unless he could \n     afford his own. In case of an accident, his prognosis is much \n     better than his sister's. Now, he is covered under my \n     insurance until he either gets a job or turns 26. Thank \n     goodness. My point with all this is to beg you to keep the \n     health care bill intact and fight for it.\n\n  This is the last letter I will read. This is from Sue of Franklin \nCounty, the center of the State, the capital of Columbus, where the \nPresiding Officer lived for a little while. Sue writes:\n\n       Please do not let the Republicans take away my daughter's \n     health insurance. My husband and I are retired civil servants \n     on a fixed income. I was overjoyed when my health insurance \n     company informed me that my 21-year-old daughter could remain \n     on my policy until she is 26. Currently, she is a senior at \n     the Ohio State University and under the old regime, would \n     have been dropped from my policy in April 2011, when she \n     turns 22. This may not seem like a big deal to you, but my \n     daughter has a preexisting condition that requires her to \n     take three prescriptions a day, not to mention doctor \n     appointments and blood work. I paid for private insurance for \n     my older daughter for 3 years until her husband's employer \n     covered her. By the end of the 3 years, I was paying almost \n     $200 a month for my daughter's policy and she was a healthy \n     25-year-old without preexisting conditions.\n\n  We know the kinds of hardships the repeal of this health care bill \nwill inflict on all kinds of Americans--the college student, the recent \ngraduate, the child with a preexisting condition, the senior who wants \nto be able to have access to mammograms and a checkup and an \nosteoporosis screening. We know the small businessperson really needs \nthis tax credit so she can cover her 5 to 10 employees, not because the \nlaw tells her to but because she wants to. All these reasons just \nunderscore to me how outrageous it is that a bunch of people dressed \nlike this--who get elected to offices and who enjoy government \ninsurance, so they and their families have benefited from taxpayer-\nfunded insurance--are willing to continue to take their insurance, \ncontinue to enjoy those benefits, but are willing to take them away \nfrom so many seniors, so many families, so many small businesspeople, \nso many people who are working hard and playing by the rules and trying \nto achieve the American dream, but in many cases this just stops them \ncold in their tracks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the country is debating a lot of issues. \nWe passed the health care bill last year. Now there is an effort in the \nHouse to repeal and replace it. I join my House colleagues with the \nidea that we should start over and come up with some product that is \ntruly bipartisan that will lower costs. All the information we received \nabout this bill since it was passed is showing it is going in the wrong \ndirection. In May 2010, CBO Director Doug Elmendorf stated:\n\n       Rising health care costs will put tremendous pressure on \n     the Federal budget during the next few decades. In CBO's \n     judgment, health legislation enacted earlier this year does \n     not substantially diminish that pressure.\n\n  We are getting more and more input about the effect this bill has on \ncost because there are over 700 waivers now in terms of the mandates. \nForty percent of all the waivers given are to union health care plans, \nand the union workforce is 7 percent of the total workforce. The idea \nthat more and more people are asking for waivers indicates that the \ncost component of this bill is a real problem for the country.\n  The whole goal of health care reform is lower cost and improved \nquality. I am afraid what we have done with the health care bill is we \nhave increased costs, consolidated power in the Federal Government, and \nMedicare and Medicaid already are unsustainable when it comes to \nFederal financial obligations. The Obama health care bill, if fully \nenacted by 2014, would extend Medicaid coverage in the State of South \nCarolina to 29 percent; 29 percent of South Carolinians would be \ncovered by Medicaid. That is a substantial increase over the number of \npeople on Medicaid today. That would require my State to come up with \n$1 billion more of State matching money, in the next 7 years, to get \nthe Federal Government Medicaid dollars.\n  The second largest expense in South Carolina today is the State's \nmatching requirement to get existing Medicaid dollars from the Federal \nGovernment. If you expand Medicaid, you are going to bankrupt South \nCarolina.\n  I think there is a better way to deliver health care to low-income \nAmericans. I was on a bipartisan bill with Senators Wyden and Bennett \nthat did cover everyone, but it allowed people to buy health care in \nthe private sector with tax credits that took deductions away from \nemployers. That is a lot of money. It took that pool of money and \nallowed individuals to buy their own health care in a more competitive \nenvironment.\n  At the end of the day, it looks like we are going to be taking a vote \nhere soon in the Senate, I hope, to repeal and replace the health care \nlaw that was passed last year. If it is repealed, it should be \nreplaced. The way you replace something this complicated, that affects \none-fifth of the economy, is you do it deliberately, you do it in a \nbipartisan manner. Let's remember how this bill became law. It got \nexactly 60 votes, a party-line vote in the Senate. It was passed on \nChristmas Eve more than a year ago.\n  At the end of the day, the process I thought was not befitting of the \nSenate. There were a lot of provisions given to Senators in particular \nStates. Such as in Florida, the Medicare Advantage participants had a \nlot more Medicare Advantage availability than other States. Ohio, \nMichigan--some health care companies in those States got special deals.\n  At the end of the day, it was done in a backroom, partisan fashion, \nnot transparent, not negotiated before C-SPAN, as President Obama \npromised. It reinforced the worst of politics, and it is no surprise to \nme that something that came out of that process is not going down well.\n  What I say today with Mr. Barrasso, a physician, a Senator from \nWyoming, is allow States to opt out if they choose to. If this is such \na good deal, let the State legislatures throughout the country decide \nwhether they want to be covered by the individual mandate, the employer \nmandate or Medicaid expansion. I know the answer in South Carolina. My \nGovernor, my legislators, want to opt out of expanded Medicaid because \nit will bankrupt the State, and they do not want any part of the \nemployer mandates. I will challenge the Congress, if repeal and replace \ndoesn't work, let the individual States have a say about whether they \nwant to be in the system.\n  I do hope we can repeal it and replace it. That vote is coming up \nsoon. But the amount of tax increases in this bill--$17 billion in \nindividual penalties, $52 billion in employer penalties, $500 billion \ntaken out of Medicare to help pay for the uninsured--at the end of the \nday, the formula, the construct of this bill I think is going to grow \nthe size and scope of the Federal Government when it comes to health \ncare at a\n\n[[Page S403]]\n\ntime we need more private sector competition in medicine. It is going \nto increase taxes on businesses at a time when we should lower their \ntaxes. It is going to make it very hard in the future for senior \ncitizens to find doctors to take Medicare because, at the end of the \nday, the more you consolidate power in the Federal Government, the more \nobligations the Federal Government has when it comes to health care, \nthe less we can pay because we are so broke.\n  I hope this vote will happen soon. To my colleagues who want to keep \nthis bill, I respectfully disagree, but that is what debate is all \nabout. We can have a civil debate about the future of health care. I \nthink the Congress would be wise to start over and come up with a new \nproduct. It does put pressure on Republicans, if we do repeal this \nbill, to replace it with something that makes sense. What makes sense \nto me is to lower cost and make sure people have access to health care \nand that the uninsured are taken care of. But one size does not fit \nall.\n  I look forward to casting my vote to repeal and replace. If that does \nnot work, I look forward to having my amendment, along with Senator \nBarrasso, on the floor of the Senate, allowing States to opt out if \nthey choose.\n  My guess will be that a majority of the States would opt out of the \nindividual mandate, the employer-mandated Medicaid expansion, and some \nDemocratic Governors are going to be talking to the Members of this \nbody about how their States will be devastated by Medicare expansion. I \nthink you are going to have some big States in the hands of Democratic \nGovernors that are going to feel the impact of this Medicaid expansion. \nThey are going to petition this Congress to do something about it, and \nI hope we listen to them.\n  This vote should happen soon. We are in a new Congress. There are new \npeople here with new ideas and now is the time to allow the American \npeople to participate because most of this bill was passed in secret, \nwithout a whole lot of bipartisan give and take. Now is the time to \nstart over, take the idea of health care reform, a blank sheet of \npaper, and see what we come up with in a bipartisan, incremental \nfashion. The only way we can do that is to replace the bill we have \nbefore us.\n  I look forward to this debate. I look forward to the vote. This issue \nis not going away. Between now and 2012 we are going to have a very \nserious debate about the future of health care in America. I would \nargue that anybody running for Governor between now and 2012 should be \nasked the question: If you could, would you opt your State out of the \nprovisions I just described, the individual mandate, employer mandate, \nand Medicaid expansion? Those are good questions to ask and answer and \nmaybe they would have a good answer why they would say no. But anybody \nrunning for the statehouse throughout the country should have a genuine \ndebate about whether their State should be included in Obama health \ncare. That is why I hope, if we do not repeal and replace the bill with \nthe current amendment that will be offered by Senator McConnell, that \nwe not abandon this debate.\n  Debating policy in a civil way is the essence of democracy. At the \nend of the day, I do believe there is a better way to come up with \nhealth care reform than that chosen by our Democratic colleagues in the \nlast couple years.\n  Having said that, the status quo is unacceptable. I am very much for \neliminating the preexisting illness exclusion that denies Americans the \nability to buy health care when they get sick. I am very much for \nshopping around and buying a plan that is best for you and your family \nand, if you are a low-income person, helping you make that purchase but \nI don't want to consolidate any more power in the Federal Government \nwhen it comes to health care because the health care obligations of the \nFederal Government, Medicare and Medicaid alone, in 20 years, are going \nto cost as much as the entire Federal Government does today. This is an \nunsustainable course. Entitlement reform has to be embraced. But until \nwe get to that day, I would like to restart the debate, have a new \ndialog with new Members of Congress who heard, loudly and clearly in \nthe last election, the displeasure the American people have for the \nprocess--a bill that was passed in the dead of night on Christmas Eve, \nwith a lot of chicanery, replace it with a new process that leads to a \nbetter bill.\n\n  That puts us all on the hook to try to find middle ground. There was \nno middle ground found last time. Frankly, I don't think a lot of \npeople looked for middle ground. Those days are behind us. There is a \nnew Congress. If this election said anything to us in Washington, it \nought to be that the country does not like what we are doing--\nRepublicans or Democrats--and the health care bill, the way it was \npassed, is the worst of Washington, not the best. I look for better \ndays.\n  I know the Senate president tonight has genuinely tried to reform \nthis institution to make it more reflective of the American people's \nhopes and dreams. The health care bill was passed in a way that none of \nus, quite frankly, should be proud of. If we start over, the obligation \nexists for all of us to find some middle ground to move the debate \nforward.\n  The vote will be soon. It will probably be less than 60, but that \ndoesn't mean the debate ends. There are other ways to address this \nissue. I can assure the people in South Carolina that this fight will \ncontinue, that I will do the best I can as a Senator from South \nCarolina to make sure the Obama health care bill, President Obama's \nplan that was passed by the Democratic Congress, is dramatically \nchanged and altered before it takes hold and becomes irreversible.\n  We have a chance, in the next year or so, to fix this before it gets \nout of control. I hope we will take advantage of it. I look forward to \nthe debate. I look forward to offering solutions. I look forward to \nmore than just saying no, but I do look forward to a genuine debate, \nwhere I do have a say and hopefully people on the other side will \nlisten.\n  With that, I yield. The Senator from Pennsylvania is next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business, ask \nunanimous consent to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring our Armed Forces\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about the conflict \nin Afghanistan from one perspective; that is, of those who have given \ntheir lives in the service of our country. I do so, knowing we have a \nlot of work to do this year, to debate and discuss and spend a good \ndeal of time this year talking about the policy, what is happening in \nAfghanistan, whether it is our policy as it relates to security or \ngovernance or development. But tonight I just wish to focus on those \nwho gave, as Lincoln said, ``the last full measure of devotion to their \ncountry.''\n  At times such as this, we have to ask maybe one threshold question. \nFor me, it is this question: How do we adequately pay tribute to our \nfighting men and women serving in Afghanistan or anywhere around the \nworld? I guess the other part of that question is, How do we adequately \nexpress our gratitude for those who are serving, those who served and \ncame back with no injury or were able to get back to some semblance of \na normal life, those who served and came back but are suffering \ngrievously from an injury, and finally how do we adequately express our \ngratitude to those who were killed in action and express gratitude to \ntheir families as well?\n  The answer to all those questions is we cannot adequately express our \ngratitude. But even though it is inadequate, even though it falls short \nof what we hope it could be, we still have to thank them--we still have \nto--and should express our gratitude. I do that tonight, with a healthy \ndose of humility, with recognition it is very difficult to express our \naltitude.\n  We are a nation at war. As we pay tribute to the troops who are \nfighting for us, we should also never forget the sacrifices of their \nfamilies, the families who support those fighting men and women--and of \ncourse, by extension, support all of us--an enormous sacrifice when a \nloved one goes overseas. Even, as I said before, if they serve and come \nback and are OK at the end of that service, just the time away, the \nthings they miss in their families' lives, month after month, year \nafter\n\n[[Page S404]]\n\nyear--they miss family celebrations, birthdays and weddings and \nliterally the birth of a child is sometimes missed because of their \ndeployment. That is nowhere near an exhaustive list. We do want to pay \ntribute, in a very personal way, to the families as well.\n  Sometimes--when we talk about our troops and talk about our country, \nwe search for language and stories and meaning--we look to the \nScriptures. As I have often done, we quote Abraham Lincoln. We can also \nlook to some of our more modern and current artists, and there are \nplenty of them we can cite. I am thinking a lot about some words from \nthe great recording artist Bruce Springsteen.\n  He wrote a series of songs that connected to or were inspired by the \nhorrific events of 9/11. Most of the songs on that, what we used to \ncall an album, ``The Rising,'' were connected to the events of 9/11. \nBut he wrote one song, of which I think the words and the theme of the \nsong have direct application to folks who are serving our country and \nwho are, in fact, missing from their families. There is a repetition of \nsome lines in that song where he says: You are missing. At one point \nthe song goes like this. He says: You are missing. When I shut out the \nlights, you are missing. When I close my eyes, you are missing. And he \nfinally says: When I see the sunrise, you are missing.\n  I always thought that made a lot of sense to me in terms of trying, \nas best I can, to understand what our families are going through when a \nloved one is deployed, that that family is missing that family member \nwhen they are serving in Iraq or Afghanistan or anywhere around the \nworld.\n  Of course, it is especially meaningful and poignant and sad and \nmoving when it means you are missing because you have been killed in \naction. And every day they are missing, when someone is turning out the \nlights at night, when they are sleeping, and when they see the sun rise \nin the morning.\n  So we think of those words and the fact that there are a lot of \npeople missing today from their families, because of their deployment, \nor because of their death.\n  I have read the names of those who were killed in action in Iraq over \ntime, in 2007, 2008 and 2009. We got through that list of those who had \nlost their lives in Iraq. In that conflict to date, 197 Pennsylvanians \nlost their lives. As we remember those who were killed in action, \nfrom--in this case I will be referring to Pennsylvanians--we also must \nremember the wounded warriors who have returned from the battlefield. \nIn Pennsylvania that is, to date, 398 brave men and women who have been \nwounded in this war, the war in Afghanistan.\n  Last week I met two courageous young men, Army CPL Russell Carter of \nSpringfield, PA, Delaware County, right outside of the city of \nPhiladelphia, and Marine CPL David Noblit of Herndon, PA. That is in \nNorth Umberland County in the middle of our State. They had just \nreturned from Afghanistan, both wounded, remarkably strong and capable \nsoldiers fighting for us, and not a word--the Presiding Officer knows \nfrom the soldiers he has spoken to--not a word of complaint about what \nhappened to them, not a word of complaint about their care. And they \nare getting great care at Walter Reed.\n  I salute obviously their bravery and their valor, but we also, of \ncourse, salute the sacrifice of their families at this time. We commend \nthe efforts of the Walter Reed staff who take care of them, remarkable, \nalmost miraculous care and treatment of our soldiers. They work every \nday to make sure that those soldiers not only are cared for but that \nthey are progressing because of that care, because of that dedicated \ncare at so many facilities, whether it is Walter Reed or veterans \nhospitals or whatever across the country.\n  One of the reasons they do that is to ensure that the future choices \nof those young service members are not determined by an IED blast or by \nthe bullet from a sniper; that because of the rehabilitation, because \nof the healing and hope that comes from that work, that that soldier's \nfuture is determined and will be determined by that soldier and not by \nthe enemy.\n  The rehabilitation work done at Walter Reed is remarkable. We are \nreminded when we see those soldiers in that care of their strength, we \nare reminded of their skills, the dignity that comes as a result of \nthat care and treatment over time. And they, in fact, will determine \ntheir own future because of that care.\n  So what I will do now for the next couple of moments is I will read \nthe names of Pennsylvanians who have been killed in action in \nAfghanistan in Operation Enduring Freedom. I will do so in alphabetical \norder and read their hometown. But the alphabetical order, of course, \nwill be based on the last name of the soldier. I will start with \nsomeone actually from my home county:\n\n       SGT Jan Argonish of Scranton, PA; SFC Scott Ball of \n     Carlisle, PA; LTC Richard Berrettini of Wilcox, PA; CPT David \n     Boris of Pottsville, PA; PVT Matthew Brown of Zelienople, PA; \n     SGT Douglas Bull of Wilkes-Barre, PA; SGT Joseph Caskey of \n     Pittsburgh, PA; 1LT Jeffrey Deprimo of Pittston, PA; PFC \n     James Dillion, Jr., of Grove City, PA; PFC Michael Dinterman \n     of Littlestown, PA; SSG Troy Ezernack of Lancaster, PA; LCPL \n     Ralph Fabbri of Gallitzin, PA; SGT Louis Fastuca of West \n     Chester, PA; SFC Robert Fike of Conneautville, PA; SSG Sean \n     Flannery of Wyomissing, PA; SGT James Fordyce of Newtown \n     Square, PA; PO3 John Fralish of New Kingstown, PA; LCPL \n     Michael Freeman of Fayetteville, PA; A1C Austin Gates Benson \n     of Hellertown, PA; SGT Christopher Geiger of Northampton, PA; \n     2LT Michael Girdano of Apollo, PA.\n       CPL Joshua Harton of Bethlehem, PA; SGT Michael Heede, Jr., \n     of Delta, PA; SGT Brett Hershey of State College, PA; SP \n     Derek Holland of Wind Gap, PA; SFC Bryan Hoover of West \n     Elizabeth, PA; LCPL Abram Howard of Williamsport, PA; SSG \n     Matthew Ingham of Altoona, PA; PFC David Jefferson of \n     Philadelphia, PA; LCPL Larry Johnson of Scranton, PA; SGT \n     Nathan Kennedy of Claysville, PA; CPL Jarrid King of Erie, \n     PA; SP Dale Kridlo of Hughestown, PA; PFC Serge Kropov of \n     Hawley, PA; SSG Patrick Kutschbach of McKees Rocks, PA; SGT \n     Ryan Lane of Pittsburgh, PA; MSG Arthur Lilley of Smithfield, \n     PA; CPT Ronald Luce, Jr., of Wayne, PA; SP Jonathan Luscher \n     of Scranton, PA; MSGT Thomas Maholic of Bradford, PA; SGT \n     Jonathan McColley of Gettysburg, PA; SGT Andrew McConnell \n     of Carlisle, PA.\n       1SG Christopher Rafferty of Brownsville, PA; SP Jesse Reed \n     of Orefield, PA; SGT Joshua Rimer of Rochester, PA; GYSGT \n     Justin Schmalstieg of Pittsburgh, PA; SGT Derek Shanfield of \n     Hastings, PA; SFC Michael Shannon of Canadensis, PA; CWO4 \n     Michael Slebodnik of Gibsonia, PA; SSG Marc Small of \n     Collegeville, PA; SSG Glen Stivison, Jr. of Blairsville, PA; \n     CPL Sascha Struble of Philadelphia, PA; PFC Brandon Styer of \n     Lancaster, PA; SSG Paul Sweeney of Lakeville, PA; SSG Richard \n     Tieman of Waynesboro, PA; CPL Eric Torbert, Jr. of Lancaster, \n     PA; LCPL Joshua Twigg of Indiana, PA; SP Anthony Vargas of \n     Reading, PA; SSG William Vile of Philadelphia, PA; SGT David \n     Wallace III of Sharpsville, PA; SGT Jonathan Walls of West \n     Lawn, PA; SSG David Weigle of Philadelphia, PA; CPT Bryan \n     Willard of Hummelstown, PA; and CPL Anthony Williams of \n     Oxford, PA.\n\n  Those are the names of those Pennsylvanians who have been killed in \naction in Afghanistan. We now have a total of 64 brave servicemembers \nfrom the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, who as I said before, quoting \nLincoln, gave the last full measure of devotion to their country.\n  Twenty-seven of these young men came from towns with less than 5,000 \npeople. You notice in that list some came from big cities such as \nPittsburgh and Philadelphia and other big cities such as Erie and \nAllentown. But 27 of the 64 came from very small communities where the \ndeath of one soldier in a town of 5,000 or less has a seismic impact, a \nsearing impact, first and foremost on that soldier's family and on \ntheir relatives and loved ones, but obviously even on the community \nitself.\n  All we can do at times like this, when it comes to paying tribute, is \nto do our best to convey a sense of gratitude, a sense of respect, and \nalso to commit ourselves not only to helping the living, to help those \nwho come after them, who have been wounded, their family and others.\n  Lincoln also talked about ``him who has borne the battle,'' and \ntalked about those who have been wounded and their families. But all we \ncan do for those who have been killed is, as best we can, to help their \nfamilies and to pay tribute to their service and their memory, but also \nto make sure we are doing everything possible to get this policy right, \nto make sure that our policy is commensurate with their sacrifice.\n  In one sense, as my father said a long time ago, in reference to the \ngulf war of 1991: We pray for them who serve. We pray for them and we \npray for ourselves that we may be worthy of their valor.\n\n[[Page S405]]\n\n  So tonight we do that, not only for those killed in action that I \nhave read from Pennsylvania, but for those who have lost their lives \nfrom States across the country, including the State of Colorado that \nour Presiding Officer represents.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to note the passing last December of \na singular Nevadan, Charles Benjamin, who worked to promote clean \nenergy. While he lived in Nevada for only 4 short years, his efforts \nwill pay positive dividends long into the future.\n  He passed away on December 13, 2010, after a valiant battle with \ncancer, at the young age of 60.\n  Before Charles moved to Nevada in 2006, he was a lobbyist and \nattorney for the Kansas Chapter of the Sierra Club. His career in \nenvironmental law included a law practice representing more than 25 \nneighborhood associations across Kansas on a variety of land use and \nzoning issues. He was also a political science professor at Bethel \nCollege in Kansas where he taught courses in environmental studies, \nAmerican government, and international relations, and served 16 years \nas a county commissioner in Harvey County, KS. Charles earned a B.A., \nan M.A., and a Ph.D. from the School of International Relations at the \nUniversity of Southern California, and a J.D. from the School of Law at \nthe University of Kansas.\n  During his time in Nevada, Charles worked tirelessly to promote clean \nenergy by developing and strengthening relationships with key Nevada \nstakeholders, including utilities, the State's consumer advocate, \nlegislators, the governor, business interests, and the environmental \ncommunity. He was quite helpful to me in my efforts to diversify \nNevada's economy through development of our State's vast renewable \nenergy resources and to make Nevada energy independent.\n  Charles was a feisty advocate for environmental justice and came to \nNevada to help drive our State and the Nation toward a cleaner energy \nfuture.\n  To me, he was always courteous, honest and expressed his love for the \nenvironment. Nevada and the Nation need more people like Charles who \nare willing to work hard to tap into the limitless resources of the \nSun, the wind and the Earth, and energy efficiency, to build a \nstronger, cleaner and more sustainable world. He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S405-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO DR. MARGARET T. BURROUGHS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life and legacy of Dr. \nMargaret T. Burroughs, an artist, writer, and cofounder of the DuSable \nMuseum of African American History in Chicago, IL.\n  Although she was born in Louisiana, Dr. Burroughs moved to Chicago to \npursue a career in education and the arts. She spent her life \ndocumenting and preserving the history and culture of people of African \ndescent and encouraging fair representation of African Americans. Dr. \nBurroughs made the first of her many contributions to African-American \narts and culture at the age of 22 when she founded the South Side \nCommunity Arts Center, a community organization that serves as a \ngallery and workshop studio for artists and students.\n  She later went on to establish the DuSable Museum of African American \nHistory in 1961, the first museum in the country developed to preserve \nand interpret the experiences and achievements of people of African \ndescent. The museum is recognized internationally as an educational \nresource for African-American art and history, with a collection of \nover 15,000 pieces, including paintings, sculptures, and historical \nmemorabilia.\n  Dr. Burroughs' many contributions to art and history have been \nhonored nationally. Her literary works and painting have traveled \nthroughout the country--from my home State of Illinois to Washington, \nDC--and they serve as an inspiration to students and collectors of art. \nIn 1975, Dr. Burroughs was honored for her service to the arts with the \nPresident's Humanitarian Award by President Gerald Ford.\n  Dr. Burroughs' passing in November of 2010 reminds us of the \nimportance of history and the arts and our responsibility to preserve \nit. Her presence in Chicago and at the DuSable Museum will be greatly \nmissed. As the city of Chicago recognizes the achievements of African \nAmericans and the DuSable Museum during Black History Month, we in \nCongress honor the life of the DuSable Museum's founder, Margaret \nBurroughs. It is my hope that her legacy will live on through aspiring \nartists, historians, and philanthropists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S405-4", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Honest Leadership and Open Government \nAct of 2007--the act--calls for the Select Committee on Ethics of the \nUnited States Senate to issue an annual report not later than January \n31 of each year providing information in certain categories describing \nits activities for the preceding year. Reported below is the \ninformation describing the committee's activities in 2010 in the \ncategories set forth in the act:\n\n       (1) The number of alleged violations of Senate rules \n     received from any source, including the number raised by a \n     Senator or staff of the Committee: 84. (In addition, 9 \n     alleged violations from the previous year were carried into \n     2010.)\n       (2) The number of alleged violations that were dismissed--\n       (A) For lack of subject matter jurisdiction or in which, \n     even if the allegations in the complaint are true, no \n     violation of Senate rules would exist: 56. (This figure \n     includes 1 matter that was carried into 2010.)\n       (B) Because they failed to provide sufficient facts as to \n     any material violation of the Senate rules beyond mere \n     allegation or assertion: 25.\n       (3) The number of alleged violations for which the \n     Committee staff conducted a preliminary inquiry: 12. (This \n     figure includes 6 matters from the previous calendar year \n     carried into 2010.)\n       (4) The number of alleged violations for which the \n     Committee staff conducted a preliminary inquiry that resulted \n     in an adjudicatory review: 00.\n       (5) The number of alleged violations for which the \n     Committee staff conducted a preliminary inquiry and the \n     Committee dismissed the matter for lack of substantial merit: \n     08.

Mr. President, I want to take a minute to call the \nSenate's attention to a small U.S. aid program in Afghanistan that has \na big impact, which I suspect few people here know about.\n  Shortly after 9/11 and the U.S. invasion to topple the Taliban, a \nyoung Californian woman named Marla\n\n[[Page S406]]\n\nRuzicka traveled alone to Afghanistan where she soon learned about \nincidents where U.S. bombs had missed their targets and killed \ncivilians. The international press ran stories about those tragedies \nbut nothing was being done to take responsibility for what had happened \nor help the families of the victims.\n  Marla decided to do something about it, and she organized protests at \nthe U.S. Embassy in Kabul, rallied the media, and not long after was in \nWashington urging Congress to help the families and show that the \nUnited States does not turn its back on innocent victims of our own \nmistakes.\n  It was because of Marla that we started a new program, now known as \nthe Afghan Civilian Assistance Program, ACAP, which is managed by the \nU.S. Agency for International Development and implemented by the Afghan \nstaff of the International Organization for Migration. Over the past 8 \nyears, ACAP has provided millions of dollars in small grants to \nfamilies and communities that have suffered losses as a result of the \nmilitary operations. The funds have been used for such things as to \nrebuild a house that was damaged or destroyed, buy a herd of sheep, \nstart a small grocery or weaving business, or provide medical care or \nvocational training.\n  After the invasion of Iraq, Marla moved on to Baghdad and, to make a \nlong story short, again thanks to her advocacy we started a similar \nprogram there. Tragically, on April 16, 2005, she too became an \ninnocent victim, and died, along with her Iraqi colleague Faiz Ali \nSalim, in a car bombing. That program is now known as the Marla Ruzicka \nIraqi War Victims Fund, and it has helped the families of thousands of \ninnocent Iraqi victims rebuild their lives.\n  Earlier this week I received from USAID some descriptions of recent \nACAP assistance to Afghan families. While they describe exceedingly \ntragic losses of innocent life, they also illustrate the difference a \nprogram like this makes and why it is so important to our larger goals \nin that country. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Northern Region\n\n\n             Dawri Rabat Village, Chardara District, Kunduz\n\n       School teacher Ghulam Sakhi was shot dead during a \n     firefight between international military forces and the \n     Taliban. The incident happened in the village of Nahri Suf, \n     Chardara District, in February 2010. Ghulam Sakhi was the \n     breadwinner for his family. He left behind his wife, four \n     daughters and five sons.\n       His eldest son Zabihullah is 20 years old and a student. \n     After the death of his father, Zabihullah was forced to take \n     responsibility for his family. He decided to leave school in \n     search of work. He was unsure how he would be able to support \n     his family.\n       ACAP provided Ghulam Sakhi's family with a livestock \n     business, together with the full range of standard kits, plus \n     a livestock kit.\n       Zabihullah said: ``After my father was killed, life was \n     very hard for us. We asked for help from Allah. We were very \n     happy when a worker from ACAP came to interview us and \n     offered help. We were told we would be given help setting up \n     our own small business. We chose a livestock business because \n     my mother, sisters and brothers could take care of the \n     animals, leaving me with the time to resume my education. We \n     sell the milk from the cows to a dairy and make enough money \n     not to be worried. Without this help, my family would find it \n     very difficult to live. Now we can earn a living for \n     ourselves.''\n\n                             Western Region\n\n\n             Eshaq Suleiman village, Injil District, Herat\n\n       Widow Zubaida lost her son during an air strike on her \n     village in October 2001. A total of 26 civilians were killed \n     and 62 injured in the incident. Fourteen families suffered \n     serious damage to their property.\n       ACAP was informed of the incident several years later and \n     recently completed a monitoring report in order to measure \n     the impact of assistance on one widow's life.\n       Zubaida had received a small livestock business. Her \n     children and grandchildren received educational lessons. ACAP \n     also provided Zubaida with the full range of the program's \n     standard kits, which include household goods, as well as \n     educational, tailoring, and livestock items.\n       She told the ACAP monitoring assistant: ``After the death \n     of my husband in an IED explosion in late 2000, my son \n     Abdullah was the only supporter of our family. He was running \n     a shop and we could handle the difficulties of life. Abdullah \n     and I were living in a small rented house happily but it did \n     not last long.\n       ``One year later there was a conflict in Eshaq Suleiman, \n     where I am originally from. We were bombarded due to the \n     presence of Taliban fighters in the area. In the morning \n     Abdullah left the house to work but he did not come back \n     again. After the death of Abdullah I not only lost my son but \n     my only supporter.''\n       She added: ``I was not able to pay the rent any more so I \n     left the house and went to live in my daughter's house. I \n     tried to find a job. I did everything I could. I worked as a \n     housemaid--cooking, cleaning, and washing. Life was passing \n     with difficulties but then your colleague came to meet me six \n     months ago.\n       ``I received the livestock through which I now earn my \n     living. Before I felt that I was a burden on my daughter and \n     resting on her husband's shoulder but now I have a source of \n     income that pays for the house expenditures. Farzanah and \n     Khalil Ahmad, my granddaughter and son, are enjoying the \n     education assistances of your office. They are both attending \n     an English course. I received all the needed equipment for \n     keeping my livestock. Receiving the assistance from ACAP has \n     changed my life and that is why I am really grateful for this \n     program.''\n       Another victim of the incident whom ACAP has helped is \n     mother-of-three Rezagul. She lost her husband in the fierce \n     bombardment. Rezagul has two sons and one daughter. After her \n     husband died, her eldest son Gul Ahmad, who was 13 at the \n     time, was forced to abandon school to become the breadwinner \n     for the family. He tried his best to continue his education \n     in his spare time but it proved too difficult for him.\n       He was responsible for financially supporting his mother as \n     well as his younger brother Basir Ahmad and sister Sima Gul. \n     He knew that if he did not work full-time then his family \n     would face severe hardship.\n       An ACAP field assistant assessed the family's requirements. \n     A small business grant was approved which was used to set up \n     a grocery shop. Rezagul's daughter Sima Gul received English \n     lessons. ACAP also provided standard kits.\n       Sima now helps her brother run their family grocery \n     business. She packs the dry fruit which is sold to export \n     companies. Rezagul told how she no longer has money worries. \n     She said: ``My husband was the only financial supporter of \n     the family. Losing him was extremely difficult. My son did \n     not have a fixed job.'' She added: ``We always wanted to have \n     a family business where my younger son and I could help in \n     the absence of my eldest son. But we could not afford that. \n     But we have been given that opportunity through your \n     generosity.''\n\n                            Northern Region\n\n\n              Omarkhil village, Ali Abad District, Kunduz\n\n       An ISAF air-strike on two oil tankers captured by the \n     Taliban resulted in a high civilian death toll. It is \n     estimated that 70 civilians were killed and dozens injured. \n     ACAP has helped 59 families affected by the incident. One \n     beneficiary said that assistance from ACAP helped prevent up \n     to 600 men from joining the Taliban. The air-strikes took \n     place in September 2009 in Kunduz province. The Taliban had \n     hijacked two NATO oil tankers but one of the vehicles became \n     stuck in mud at a riverbank. German forces called in air \n     support and a U.S. Air Force F-15E was dispatched to destroy \n     the tankers. Local villagers had flocked to the abandoned \n     tankers in order to siphon off fuel. They were mistaken for \n     insurgents.\n       One of the affected families which ACAP helped is that of \n     widow Lailoma. When her husband was killed in the air-strike, \n     she was left unable to financially support her five children.\n       Lailoma had to rely on friends' charity until ACAP stepped \n     in. Lailoma received the full range of standard kits, which \n     include household goods, as well as educational, tailoring, \n     and livestock items. Lailoma decided to use her ACAP small \n     business grant to buy a pick-up truck. She teamed up with a \n     business partner and now the business generates enough money \n     so that she can comfortably support her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S406-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S406-S407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise in celebration of Black \nHistory Month and to acknowledge the unique contributions of Colorado's \nAfrican-American communities to my home State and our Nation.\n  The history of Colorado's African-American communities is long, rich \nand diverse; it spans from our earliest days as a territory to modern \ntimes. I think it safe to say that all Coloradans have benefited \ntremendously from African-American communities' hard work and \ndedication to continuously making Colorado a better place to live.\n  Last year in my remarks on Black History Month, I made special note \nof the diversity of settlers who moved west during the expansion of the \nUnited States. Like other settlers, African Americans moved west in \nsearch of new opportunity--some to be free, others to become \nentrepreneurs, traders, and leaders, but all played an active role in \nthe formation of Colorado as a territory and then a State.\n  A watercolor painting hangs in my Senate office to remind me of the \nearly\n\n[[Page S407]]\n\npresence of African-American westerners. The painting ``One of the \nFirst'' by noted African-American artist and Coloradan James Wider \ndepicts a Buffalo soldier during a snowstorm, reminiscent of a time of \ngreat hardship in our State's early history. For me, this image \nportrays the struggles and determination of all the people who shaped \nthe West we know today. I am appreciative to the artist, as well as Dr. \nAnthony Young, the vice chairman of the Black American West Museum & \nHeritage Center, for allowing me the privilege to temporarily hang the \npainting in my office.\n  While this painting highlights the early presence of African-\nAmericans in the West, it also reminds me of the countless individuals \nin Colorado's Black community who have served and continue to serve \ntheir communities, our State and our Nation in more contemporary times. \nI would like to highlight two Coloradans who reflect this influence: \nDr. Evie Dennis and Rev. Milton Proby.\n  Dr. Evie Dennis rose in her career as a teacher to become the \nsuperintendent of Denver public schools from 1990 to 1994, when she \nworked to improve the education of all of Denver's schoolchildren. In \n2008, Dr. Dennis was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame, \nand she continues to work in support of communities across the State.\n  Rev. Milton Proby was a prominent figure during his 47 years in \nsouthern Colorado, where he proudly faced adversity in championing \nagainst inequality and injustice. The reverend served under three \nColorado Governors and helped to establish Colorado's Civil Rights \nCommission, among many other notable achievements and awards.\n  People like Dr. Dennis and Reverend Proby have overcome struggle to \nserve--and lead--our State. Their contributions remind us of how vital \nAfrican-American communities have been to our State's history, and I \nhave no doubt that the same communities will continue to be a driving \nforce toward a better future.\n  Mr. President, Black History Month is a time for all Coloradans and \nAmericans to reflect on the contributions of African Americans to our \nState and throughout our great Nation. I encourage my fellow Coloradans \nto celebrate these contributions not only during this month but \nthroughout the entire year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S407-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JACK LaLANNE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Jack LaLanne, a fitness pioneer who inspired \ngenerations of Americans to exercise regularly and eat healthily. Mr. \nLaLanne passed away on January 23rd at his home in Morro Bay, CA. He \nwas 96 years old.\n  Francois Henri LaLanne was born in San Francisco on September 26, \n1914, and was nicknamed ``Jack'' by his brother. He spent his early \nyears in Bakersfield before his family moved to Oakland.\n  As a child, Jack was a self-described sugar addict who had an \naffinity for junk food. At the age of 15, he heard a lecture on healthy \nliving by nutritionist Paul Bragg at the Oakland Women's City Club that \nwould change his life. Inspired by the lecture to become healthier and \nmore fit, Jack developed a zeal for physical fitness and good nutrition \nthat he would later pass on to millions of people in America and around \nthe world.\n  In 1936, he opened the Jack LaLanne Physical Cultural Studio in \ndowntown Oakland. Mr. LaLanne's devotion to help others adopt healthier \nexercise and eating habits was apparent as he would often call his \nclients at home to check why they had missed scheduled workouts. His \nreputation as a fitness enthusiast grew quickly.\n  In 1952, he began hosting a morning workout show on a local \ntelevision station. The Jack LaLanne Show was especially appealing to \nchildren who he encouraged to exercise with their parents. The \ntelevision show was eventually syndicated and ran for 34 years in the \nUnited States and Europe.\n  Mr. LaLanne's rise to prominence came during a time when many people \ndoubted the benefits of regular exercise and a healthy diet. To \novercome this skepticism, he participated in a series of public \ndemonstrations to prove the positive impacts of his teachings. At age \n40, he swam from Alcatraz to San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf while \ntowing a 2,000-pound cabin cruiser. At 60, he swam the Golden Gate \nChannel while handcuffed and shackled and towing a 1,000-pound boat. At \n70, he towed a flotilla of 70 boats for a mile in Long Beach Harbor, \nonce again, handcuffed and shackled.\n  A man with an unparalleled fervor for healthy living and an \nappreciation for life that was an inspiration to so many over the \nyears, Mr. LaLanne accomplished his goal of getting people of all ages \nand from all walks of life to adopt a more active and healthy \nlifestyle. He will be missed.\n  I send my deepest sympathies to his family, especially to his wife of \n51 years Elaine, daughter Yvonne, son Jon, and stepson Dan \nDoyle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S407-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE\n                         W.

Mr. President, today I wish, with \ngreat honor and pride, to pay tribute to a member of the Fourth estate \nin my home State of South Dakota. Terry Woster's career in journalism \nhas spanned 44 years--an impressive mark in any profession, most \ncertainly in the newspaper field.\n  Terry was born to Henry and Marie Woster and grew up on a farm near \nReliance in Lyman County. He graduated from Chamberlain High School in \n1962 and from South Dakota State University in 1966 with a degree in \njournalism. Terry grew up with two brothers and two sisters, fondly \nknown as the Woster clan.\n  Terry married his high school sweetheart, Nancy Gust, after finishing \ncollege. Together they raised three children in Pierre.\n  Terry began his journalism career in 1967 at the Sioux Falls Argus \nLeader. He covered sports, wrote features, and was a photographer for 2 \nyears before he went to work for the Associated Press in Pierre. After \n9 years with the AP covering the Capitol and politics, Terry became \neditor of the Pierre Times and then managing editor for the Daily \nCapitol Journal. He became the Capitol reporter for the Argus Leader, a \nposition he held for 22 years.\n  Readers of the Argus Leader, as well as other South Dakota \nnewspapers, have become acquainted with Terry and his chosen topics \nthrough his weekly human interest columns. His writings accurately \nreflect life in South Dakota and have sometimes earned him the title of \nSouth Dakota's poet laureate.\n  South Dakotans have come to know the man who treasures his family, \nrecounting many stories of growing up near Reliance, playing basketball \nfor Chamberlain High, and boating on the Missouri River. He loves \nhistory, politics, and enjoyed going to work every day in Pierre where \nhe got to know the Governors, legislators, and all who worked in the \nSouth Dakota State Capitol Building. His strong sense of community \nservice was reflected in many ways including service on the Pierre \nLibrary Board.\n  Terry's journalism skills have earned him many prestigious awards \nover the years. The Argus Leader, South Dakota Farmers' Union, South \nDakota Newspaper Association, and South Dakota Press Association have \nall presented him awards. He is the recipient of the Distinguished \nAlumnus Award from South Dakota State University.\n  Terry has authored and published three books, including ``South \nDakota 100,'' ``The Woster Brothers' Brand,'' written with his \nbrothers, Kevin and Jim, and ``The Spirit of Sioux Falls.''\n  South Dakotans of all political persuasions know Terry Woster as a \nfair and well-respected reporter. I am among those who have long valued \nTerry's political reporting, wit, and wisdom. I also am proud to call \nTerry a friend. We have shared our experience with prostate cancer and \nare proud of our wives who are breast cancer survivors.\n  Thank you, Terry, for sharing your career and personal life with the \nnewspaper readers and the citizens of South Dakota, and congratulations \non a career filled with professionalism and dedication. You can take \ngreat pride in your career achievements and accomplishments, and you \nare a true credit to the State of South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S408-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             45TH ANNIVERSARY OF YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the 45th anniversary of Youth and Family Services, YFS, a \nwonderful nonprofit organization based in Rapid City, SD, that provides \nsupport services for children and families. YFS has steadily grown in \nthe last 45 years to become a thriving center of support to more than \n11,000 children and their families every year.\n  Beginning in 1965, the organization was known as Girls Club and was \none of many organizations offering programs and services to children \nand families. With hard work and a devotion to serving others, Girls \nClub evolved into Youth and Family Services, growing dramatically to \nincorporate several programs that offered similar services. YFS is one \nof the most comprehensive youth development organizations in western \nSouth Dakota.\n  The available programs have been consistently expanded to encompass \nmore of the community. Working closely with other organizations, YFS \nremains focused on fulfilling its mission statement to help children \nand their families be capable, caring, and contributing members of \ntheir communities. YFS is working to serve an additional 3,000 to 5,000 \nchildren and families by expanding programs within child obesity \nprevention, healthy eating, and fatherhood programming, along with many \nothers.

Mr. President, today I wish to \npay tribute to Frank Woodruff Buckles on the occasion of his 110th \nbirthday. Frank has gained fame as the last living World War I veteran \nin the United States and has humbly accepted praise on behalf of the \nveterans who have gone before him. His story, like that of so many of \nthe doughboys, is one of patriotism. As a 16-year-old in 1917, Frank \nlied to a military recruiter about his age so that he could join the \nArmy. Once overseas, Frank served as an ambulance driver in England and \nFrance. Following the Armistice, Frank was part of a company returning \nprisoners of war back to Germany.\n  During World War II, while working for a private shipping company in \nManila, Frank spent 3 years and 2 months as a Japanese prisoner-of-war. \nHe still has, to this day, the small tin cup that he ate his paltry \nmeals out of during that time period.\n  While we appropriately honor Frank for his service to our country, we \nshould also recognize him for his longevity. His 110 years of life are \nno doubt due to his dedication to fitness and his love of learning. \nWell into his hundreds, Frank was still doing 50 situps a day and \ndriving both his car and his tractor. Frank's love of learning has led \nhim to learn numerous foreign languages and read countless books.\n  Frank never intended to have the distinction of being the last \nAmerican World War I veteran. As he has said, ``I knew it would happen \nto somebody, but I didn't necessarily think it was going to be me.'' \nMr. President, I think you will agree with me that Mr. Buckles has \naccepted this honor with grace and humility. We salute you today, Frank \nBuckles, and wish you the best on this special occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S408-4", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S408-S409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. EDMOND DYAS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is appropriate that we take a \nmoment to note the passing of Dr. Edmond Dyas of Mobile, AL, who was \none of Alabama's most famous athletes and an accomplished orthopedic \nsurgeon. Dr. Dyas first came to my attention when I was a young Boy \nScout thrilled with the opportunity to have the chance to attend Auburn \nUniversity football games as an usher. He was one of my first heroes. \nHe was an Auburn team leader, a three-time Academic All American and \nAll American, the Southeastern Conference's top running back in 1960, \nand\n\n[[Page S409]]\n\nset the NCAA record for career field goals, and he was selected as a \nmember of the College Football Hall of Fame in 2009. He finished fourth \nin 1960 in the Heisman Trophy balloting.\n  I was at the game when he was pushed and injured hitting the bench \nwith his face, causing him to miss the Alabama game, thus losing the \nopportunity to perhaps win the Heisman Trophy. I also was at Auburn for \na famous Auburn-Georgia game. Georgia was led by Fran Tarkenton and Pat \nDye, later Auburn's head coach. In that classic game, Ed Dyas hit three \nfield goals and Durwood Pennington hit two. The final: 9 to 6.\n  Ed was a superb surgeon, community leader, and family man. He fought \nhis cancer like the champion he was. Our thoughts and prayers are with \nhis wife Diane, four children, and seven grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S409-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO HALL WILLIAMS THOMPSON\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Tom Brokaw, in his book ``The \nGreatest Generation,'' describes the generation that survived the Great \nDepression and World War II. He notes that their sacrifices made \npossible the many comforts and conveniences we enjoy today. On October \n27, 2010, America and Alabama lost one of the best examples of that \ngeneration with the death of Hall Williams Thompson of Birmingham, AL.\n  That Hall Thompson was a very successful family man, businessman, \ncivic leader, and philanthropist, there can be no doubt, and much could \nbe said about a host of areas where he served, giving back to his State \nand his Nation. But I want to share a few remarks about one of his most \nnotable qualities--his patriotism. Hall Thompson loved his country. He \nhad fought for it, serving in the Pacific during World War II in the \nArmy Air Corps. And that commitment to serving his country never \nabated.\n  Indeed, while he had strong views about our country and the \nexceptional nature of the American experience and was never afraid to \nexpress them, he was ever anxious to respect those who may disagree. He \nwould, with sincerity, ask questions about the subject which concerned \nhim and at the end of the conversation would say something like, \n``Well, I just think . . .'' or, ``I am just concerned.'' He made his \npoint clearly but courteously.\n  On a personal note, I called Hall and asked him to support a \npolitical event. Quickly, he assured me he could come and asked if \nLucy, his wonderful wife and partner of 66 years, could attend. The \nanswer, of course, was yes, as everyone loves Lucy. But in asking that \nquestion, Hall showed his humility and courtesy.\n  So, we gathered on October 19, and I took the opportunity during the \nevent to personally thank Hall for his support for me in 1994 when I \nran for attorney general of Alabama and for his support of many great \ncauses. He did not know me well in 1994 but had heard good things about \nme, and he was very generous in his support. I thanked him for that and \nnoted that he had never asked for a single thing personally, only for \ngood government. The fact that there are others in our country like \nHall who support their candidates, Republicans and Democrats, liberal \nand conservative, because of values and principles and not for personal \ngain, is important to our country's political health. They should be \nappreciated. They make the country a better place.\n  Later during that same meeting, Hall Thompson suffered the stroke \nthat would sadly take his life 9 days later. He had lived a full life \nof 87 years. He left an accomplished and loving family and a host of \nfriends and admirers. He loved America, closely monitored her progress, \nand was ready to help whenever possible.\n  He was a true patriot. Our State and Nation will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S409-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TERESA SCANLAN\n\n Mr. JOHANNS.

A bill to reduce Federal spending in a responsible manner; to \nthe Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am glad to be here today with the \nSenator from Missouri, my friend Claire McCaskill. We are introducing a \nbill called the Commitment to American Prosperity Act, the CAP Act. It \nis a 10-page bill designed to limit spending in Washington and set our \ncountry back on a sustainable fiscal path.\n  We have cosponsors in Senators Alexander, Burr, McCain, Isakson, \nChambliss, Inhofe, and Kirk. I thank them for joining us in this \neffort. I hope many more will do the same.\n  I spent a lifetime in business, and I came to the Senate not to score \npolitical points, not to be involved in messaging, but to solve our \ncountry's problems. Everyone in this body understands we have \ntremendous fiscal and financial issues with which to deal. This morning \nI was happy to see 33 Senators meet over at the visitor center from \nboth sides of the aisle to listen to people involved in the financial \nindustry talking about the path we are on and what that is going to \nlead to as far as the ruination of our fiscal situation and our ability \nto borrow money at low rates as we are today. All of us know what that \nwill mean to our citizens.\n  There is no one who doesn't understand how problematic our financial \nsituation is. I know the Congressional Budget Office just said that \nthis year alone we will have a $1.5 trillion budget deficit. I think \neveryone in this body is very aware that we cannot continue on that \npath. For that reason, Senator McCaskill and I have crafted a 10-page \nbill, a very simple bill. It does a lot, but there are not a lot of \nwhereases. One of its purposes is to cap spending relative to economy.\n  Most people understand that when we look at economies in other \ncountries of the world, people look at the amount of spending their \ngovernment does relative to their economic output. Senator McCaskill's \nhusband is a businessman. When he looks at the amount of debt he has in \nhis company, he looks at that in relation to revenues and the amount of \nincome he has and his ability to pay the debt. That is the way the \nworld looks at the health of countries.\n  For the last 4 years--this is the post-entitlement period--our \ncountry has been spending 20.6 percent of our GDP or economic output at \nthe Federal level. Everybody knows that right now we are way above that \nnumber, at over 24 percent. So again, not to try to create some \nmessaging tool but to solve this problem, Senator McCaskill and I have \njoined to say we need to get back to the norm over a 10-year period, on \na glide path that takes us back to fiscal health and to that 20.6 \npercent of our economy being spent at the Federal level.\n  The legislation calls for multiyear averaging so we can make sure \nthat economic differentials don't create volatility, so we know exactly \nwhat those targets are in advance, so we can go about our work in \nappropriations in a methodical and thoughtful way. In addition, it \ncreates something called sequestration. That means if Congress does not \nhave the courage, which we recently have not shown, to do the things it \nneeds to do to make those cuts to live within this glide path we have \nlaid out, then sequestration will take place. The Office of Management \nand Budget, 45 days after the end of the year, if we have not done \nthose things\n\n[[Page S413]]\n\nwe need to do to make sure we are on this glide path, will, on a pro \nrata basis, take money out of the accounts of both mandatory and \nnonmandatory spending. In addition, if there is an emergency that comes \nup, it would take a two-thirds vote by both Houses of Congress to \novercome those spending limits.\n  To my knowledge, this is the first time in the entitlement era that \nwe have ever tried to put in place a total spending limit on \ngovernment. Many of us talk about discretionary spending. All of us \nknow that discretionary spending is less than a third of all Federal \nspending. All of us know that if we don't redesign the entitlement \nprograms that are about two-thirds of our spending at the Federal \nlevel, then there is no way for us to deal appropriately with this \nissue. So for this reason, this bill would kick in, if it is \nimplemented, in 2013, giving us time to redesign the entitlement \nprograms, especially Medicare and Social Security, so that we know they \nare here for future generations, so we know that seniors have the \nbenefits they need.\n  This is the first time we would be putting everything on the table in \na comprehensive way as we look at the Federal budget. Simply, this bill \nwill cause us to live within our means.\n  The problem we find ourselves in today is not a Republican problem or \na Democratic problem. Both parties have contributed to the situation. \nWhat this bill would require us to do is to set priorities. It would \nmean that we would have to ensure that programs are being run as \neffectively and efficiently as possible. I know our main cosponsor, \nSenator McCaskill, has spent a lot of time looking at waste and abuse \nwithin the Federal Government. One of the best things about this bill \nis, if we want to limit spending relative to the country's economic \noutput, it is obviously easier to do so if the economy is growing. So \nwhat that would mean is that both parties would be joined at the hip to \nput in place policies that promote economic growth.\n  I thank Senator McCaskill for her courage in stepping forth with me \nand others on this bill. It is my hope that we will have people from \nboth sides of the aisle who will join us in this effort. Again, this is \nbeing put forth as a serious bill. It is a bill that has no ideology \nbase, simply a bill to solve a problem. We are going to a 40-year \naverage of spending relative to our country's gross domestic product. \nWe are not trying to do things differently than in the past. Both of us \nknow we have not had the courage in recent times to live within our \nmeans, to set priorities as they need to be set. This bill is something \nthat will take us toward that end.\n  We have a very monumental vote that will be taking place a little bit \nlater in the year regarding the debt ceiling. All of us know it would \nbe irresponsible not to be responsible prior to that debt ceiling vote. \nWe offer this bill as a responsible way to put us on a glide path \ntoward a place that is reasonable for this country, giving us time to \nredesign the programs that need to be redesigned. It is my hope this \nbill or something of its nature will pass prior to the debt ceiling \nvote. It is also my hope that we will go ahead and vote on actual cuts \nto the Federal budget prior to that time so we can show markets around \nthe world and the American people that we have the ability to work \ntogether to solve what I think is our most pressing domestic issue and \nthat is getting our fiscal house in order.\n  I again thank Senator McCaskill. She has been a leader on fiscal \nissues since she has been here.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, like my colleague, I appreciate the \nwork he has done on this issue. We have been talking about this for a \nnumber of weeks. Our staffs have been hammering out the details.\n  I will be candid. As I left my office, some members of my staff said: \nOK, good luck walking that plank. We will see how it works out for you. \nBecause this is politically risky, what the Senator and I are trying to \ndo. As I was riding over here on the tram to make this speech, I got a \ntext message from one of my kids. All of a sudden it became clear to me \nwhat this is like. This is like saying no when you are a parent. It is \nso easy to say yes to your kids. When they want something, when they \nwant to do something we think is risky, the easiest thing in the world \nto do is to say yes.\n  When they want money, when they want to have a new car, when they \nwant to borrow your car, when they want to go spend the night at a \nfriend's you do not know very well, when they want to stay out later, \nwhen they want this, that, when they want to go to the mall, it is so \neasy to say yes. It does not take a lot of time. It makes them happy. \nYou feel good. But there is always that voice in your head that says: \nIf I am going to be a good parent, sometimes it is more important to \nsay no.\n  Well, we have a bunch of people in Congress who have made a lifetime \ncareer of saying yes. I understand it. We run for office around here. \nWe want everyone to be happy with us. We want everyone to love us. We \ndo not want to disappoint anyone. We do not want there to be \ncontroversy about the decisions we make. So how do we avoid the \ncontroversy? We say yes. We say yes. And we have said yes and yes and \nyes until we find ourselves at this point in our history where our \nunwillingness to say no, our unwillingness to embrace controversy and \npolitical risk, has led us to an economic brink, a place where if we do \nnot do something that is going to make some people angry, that is going \nto cause some negative ads to be run against us, then we are not doing \nour job as stewards. That is all we are here. We are passing through. \nWe are not entitled to these jobs. We borrowed these jobs. They belong \nto the American people, and we have a responsibility as stewards to say \nno now, to say no.\n  I remember when I used to tell my kids: It is so much easier for me \nto tell you yes. And they would say: Well, it is easier for you. It was \neasier for me. I would say: The right thing to do is for me to say no. \nAnd they would say: Well, that is not easier for us.\n  That is beginning to be what is happening around here. I have noticed \nsome of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle saying: We are \ngoing to cut, cut, cut, cut. Now it is all bubbling up, with all the \npeople saying: No, you can't cut our subsidy; No, you can't cut the oil \ncompany subsidy; you can't cut a farm program; you can't cut this; you \ncan't cut that. Everyone is coming out of the woodwork to protect the \nspending that is embraced by our bad habit of saying yes.\n  So that is why this bill is necessary. This is like telling Congress: \nYou have to be better parents, and if you cannot muster the courage to \nsay no, these cuts are going to happen anyway. It is like a discipline \nfor us. And I do not go here lightly. I do not go here without \nunderstanding the political risks involved. But I go here because I \ndeeply believe it is necessary for our country. We cannot get control \nof the deficit if we do not control spending.\n  Let me talk for a minute about debt and deficit because as I go out \nand talk to people, there are a lot of people who use those two terms \ninterchangeably. They do not understand. There is a big difference \nbetween the debt and the deficit. The deficit is like your monthly \nbudget and not having enough money to come in to meet your monthly \nexpenses. We talk about the deficit on an annual basis: How much money \nis the government bringing in and how much money is going out. When \nmore is going out than coming in, we have a deficit.\n  What happens to that deficit every year? It goes on our debt. It is \nlike a family's mortgage. But instead of us paying down the mortgage \nevery year, we keep adding to the mortgage every year. That is why we \nnow have a $1.4, $1.5 trillion deficit this year. We are going to spend \nthat much more than we take in this year. We have $14 trillion in debt. \nThat is the long-term mortgage our country has right now that we owe \nsomeone that we have to pay. So we have to get hold of this debt.\n  I want to compliment the President of the United States because the \nshort-term spending stuff is important. And I want to compliment \nSenator Sessions. He and I have worked on short-term spending caps for \nover a year. But now it is time for us to look at long-term discipline \nand what we can do to get our country on a glide path where we no \nlonger are precariously on the edge of not being the strongest economic \npower in the world.\n\n[[Page S414]]\n\n  Our deficits are unsustainable and our debt is out of control. This \nbill takes a very measured approach, gives us time to figure things \nout. It is not like the ridiculous proposal over in the House where we \nare going to cut $2.5 trillion this year. Anybody who thinks that is \ngoing to happen, I have a tutu you need to wear down the hall tomorrow. \nThat is a ridiculous proposal. That is impossible to do. But this bill \nis possible and responsible. This puts us on a glide path to say to the \nAmerican people that our spending is going to be capped at a certain \npercentage of our economic activity in this country. That is possible, \nand it is responsible, and we should do it.\n  Who is to blame? Let's be honest about how we got here. The biggest \nfactor in our deficits the last 2 years is our poor economy. I know, I \nknow; you would think it is the stimulus. You would think it is TARP. \nIt is not. Political cheap shots but not true. The biggest fiscal hole \nwe are facing is because of the poor economy.\n  The biggest increase in spending in the last 2 years? You would think \nit was the auto bailouts or you would think it was the bank bailout or \nyou would think it was the stimulus. It was not. Do you know what the \nbiggest increase in spending was over the last 2 years? Unemployment \nbenefits because of our bad economy. That was the biggest increase in \nspending over the last 2 years. Our fiscal hole has grown primarily \nbecause of a bad economy over the last 2 years.\n  But there also have been bad decisions by both parties over the last \ndecade. When Clinton left office, our debt--he may have been running a \nsurplus in terms of the deficit, but our debt was $5.7 trillion. When \nBush left office, he had doubled it from $5.7 trillion to $10.6 \ntrillion. And today it is $14 trillion.\n  Over the past decade, we have had two wars we did not bother to pay \nfor, a brandnew Medicare entitlement--brand spanking new--that was not \nmeans tested. We are buying Warren Buffett's prescription drugs. Go \nfigure. Like we are busted and we are buying multihundred-million-\ndollar billionaires prescription drugs, and we did not bother to pay \nfor it. We have had increases in discretionary spending by both parties \nthat increased our deficit and exceeded inflation.\n  I want to talk a minute about the boogie man of the TARP and the \nstimulus. I am so sick of that being blamed. It is so wrong and \nfactually incorrect. We have tax cuts that go on forever that have \ncontributed to this. We have wars that we are fighting that have \ncontributed to this. We have entitlement programs that are not paid \nfor. But the stimulus was a one-time expenditure. It is not something \nthat goes on. It has no tail.\n  Anyone who understands economics and understands the balance sheet of \nthe U.S. Government knows this problem was not the stimulus. One-third \nof the stimulus was tax cuts. The last time I looked, unpaid-for tax \ncuts were the way of the world. One-third of the stimulus was tax cuts. \nAnother third of it, almost, was unemployment benefits. That is not the \nproblem. And TARP? Let's be honest. It was a genius decision in many \nways because it stabilized our financial sector, and it has cost us a \nmere fraction of the money that was used on a temporary basis to make \nsure our economy did not twist down the drain, as it was likely to do \nhad President Bush not intervened with his economic team to ask us on a \nbipartisan basis to do something that was in the best interest of our \nNation.\n  We can move on as to who is to blame because now we have to talk \nabout tomorrow's problems. I am proud the President is dealing with \nshort-term spending by his freeze. I am proud he is working on earmarks \nand all of the other things that are a symptom of the disease around \nhere. But our challenge is long-term spending. In the long term, \nspending is going to drive the debt up even higher. Medicare and \nMedicaid cuts are going to double by 2021. Social Security is going to \nincrease by 70 percent by 2021.\n  We have to look at those issues and make sure on a bipartisan basis \nwe do what is responsible. We have to make sure these programs--\nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--are stable and secure for my \nchildren and their children. If we cannot agree even on the modest \nmeasures such as the 3-year discretionary spending cap Senator Sessions \nand I have been pushing for over a year, I question whether we have the \ndiscipline to do the hard work. Getting control of spending is very \nhard, but we have to do it, and we have to do it now.\n  First and foremost, we need to focus on eliminating the waste and \nmismanagement. That is what drives Americans crazy. It drives people \ncrazy that we are spending money on duplicative programs and we are not \neven checking to see if they work. It drives them crazy when the \nFederal Government runs huge deficits and we are paying out $55 billion \nin improper payments at Health and Human Services and $12 billion of \nimproper payments by Treasury to people who do not even qualify.\n  It drives Americans crazy when we do not make the reforms our \nauditors recommend. The Defense Department has 1,200 suggestions that \nhave been made by our government auditors about how it can manage its \nmoney and its programs better, and they have not acted on almost 1,200 \nof them. It drives people crazy we are running deficits when we have \nDepartments such as the Agriculture Department and Homeland Security \nthat get failing management grades for 8 straight years. And it drives \npeople crazy when we are running deficits and we are passing \nappropriations bills with $15 billion worth of earmarks.\n  I have been working hard to try to clean up all this waste. We have \nbeen working on contract management. I have never requested an earmark. \nI voted against every omnibus appropriations bill that has come to the \nfloor since I have been a Senator, and I have worked hard for the last \nyear with Senator Sessions to cap spending. Now I look forward to \nworking hard with Senator Corker and many of my friends in the \nRepublican Party to work on the Corker-McCaskill bill to put a cap long \nterm on spending in the Federal Government.\n  As I say, this is a bold step. It has risks. And if this bill is \ndistorted and twisted, it could cost me my Senate seat. I will say that \nagain. If this bill is distorted and twisted, it could cost me my \nSenate seat. But it is a price I am willing to pay. It is a price I am \nwilling to pay for my country and, more importantly, it is a price I am \nwilling to pay for my grandchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Mikulski, and Mrs. \n        Gillibrand):\n  S. 247. A bill to establish the Harriet Tubman National Historical \nPark in Auburn, New York, and the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad \nNational Historical Park in Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot Counties, \nMaryland, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today, on the first day of Black History \nMonth, I am proud to reintroduce The Harriet Tubman National Historical \nPark and The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical \nPark Act. I am joined by Mr. Schumer, Ms. Mikulski, and Ms. Gillibrand \nas original co-sponsors.\n  The woman, who is known to us as Harriet Tubman, was born in \napproximately 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland and given the name \nAraminta, Minty, Ross. She spent nearly 30 years of her life in slavery \non Maryland's Eastern Shore. As an adult she took the first name \nHarriet, and when she was 25 she married John Tubman.\n  Harriet Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849. She did so in the dead \nof night, navigating the maze of tidal streams and wetlands that, to \nthis day, comprise the Maryland Eastern Shore landscape. She did so \nalone, demonstrating courage, strength and fortitude that became her \nhallmarks. Not satisfied with attaining her own freedom, she returned \nrepeatedly for more than 10 years to the places of her enslavement in \nDorchester and Caroline counties where, under the most adverse \nconditions, she led away many family members and other slaves to \nfreedom in the Northeastern United States. Tubman became known as \n``Moses'' by African-Americans and white abolitionists. She is the most \nfamous and most important conductor of the network of resistance known \nas the Underground Railroad.\n  During the Civil War, Tubman served the Union forces as a spy, a \nscout and\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\na nurse. She served in Virginia, Florida and South Carolina. She is \ncredited with leading slaves from those slave states to freedom during \nthose years.\n  Following the Civil War, Tubman settled in Auburn, NY. There she was \nactive in the women's suffrage movement, and she also established one \nof the first incorporated African-American homes for aged. In 1903 she \nbequeathed the home to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in \nAuburn. Harriet Tubman died in Auburn in 1913 and she is buried there \nin the Fort Hill Cemetery.\n  Slaves were forced to live in primitive buildings even though many \nwere skilled tradesmen who constructed the substantial homes of their \nowners. Not surprisingly, few of the structures associated with the \nearly years of Tubman's life still stand. The landscapes of the Eastern \nShore of Maryland, however, remain evocative of the time that Tubman \nlived there. Farm fields and forests dot the landscape, which is also \nnotable for its extensive network of tidal rivers and wetlands. In \nparticular, a number of properties including the homestead of Ben Ross, \nher father, Stewart's Canal, where he worked, the Brodess Farm, where \nshe worked as a slave, and others are within the master plan boundaries \nof the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Similarly, Poplar Neck, the plantation from which she escaped to \nfreedom, is still largely intact in Caroline County. The properties in \nTalbot County, immediately across the Choptank River from the \nplantation, are today protected by various conservation easements. Were \nshe alive today, Tubman would recognize much of the landscape that she \nknew intimately as she secretly led black men, women and children to \ntheir freedom.\n  In New York, on the other hand, many of the buildings associated with \nTubman's life remain intact. Her personal home, as well as the Tubman \nHome for the Aged, the church and rectory of the Thompson Memorial AME \nZion Episcopal Church, and the Fort Hill Cemetery are all extant.\n  In 1999, the Congress approved legislation authorizing a Special \nResource Study to determine the appropriateness of establishing a unit \nof the National Park Service to honor Harriet Tubman. The Study has \ntaken an exceptionally long time to complete, in part because of the \nlack of remaining structures on Maryland's Eastern Shore. There has \nnever been any doubt that Tubman led an extraordinary life. Her \ncontributions to American history are surpassed by few. Determining the \nmost appropriate way to recognize that life and her contributions, \nhowever, has been exceedingly difficult. Eventually, the National Park \nService determined that designating a Historical Park that would \ninclude two geographically separate units would be an appropriate \ntribute to the life of this extraordinary American. The New York unit \nwould include the tightly clustered Tubman buildings in the town of \nAuburn. The Maryland portion would include large sections of landscapes \nthat are evocative of Tubman's time and are historically relevant. The \nSpecial Resource Study, completed by the National Park Service in the \nFall of 2008, confirmed these findings and on July 15, 2009, the \nNational Park Service endorsed S. 227 as introduced in the 111th \nCongress during a legislative hearing in the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee.\n  During the process of preparing S. 227 for markup in the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, the Chairman of the Committee, \nMr. Bingaman, drafted a substitute amendment of the bill. The contents \nof the Bingaman substitute are the result of his work to accommodate \nconcerns that the Ranking Member on the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee had with S. 227 as introduced. An agreement was \nreached on the contents of the substitute amendment. An opportunity to \nmark up S. 227, consider the Bingaman substitute, and hold a vote in \nCommittee never happened in the final months of the 111th Congress.\n  The legislation I am introducing today incorporates the proposed \nchanges from the Bingaman substitute to S. 227. The bill establishes \ntwo parks.\n  The Harriet Tubman National Historical Park is comprised of important \nhistorical structures in Auburn, NY. They include Tubman's home, the \nHome for the Aged that she established, the African Methodist Episcopal \nAME Zion Church, and the Fort Hill Cemetery where she is buried.\n  The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park \nincludes historically important landscapes in Dorchester, Caroline and \nTalbot counties, Maryland, that are evocative of the life of Harriet \nTubman.\n  In Dorchester County, the parcels would not be contiguous, but would \ninclude about 2,775 acres. All of these parcels are located within the \nestablished master plan boundaries of the Blackwater National Wildlife \nRefuge but are not currently owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService. The four parcels located within the Blackwater National \nWildlife Refuge Boundary, are sites significant to the life of Harriet \nTubman. These parcels include the Anthony Thompson plantation parcel \nwhere Harriet Tubman likely was born, The Brodess Plantation parcel \nwhere Tubman worked as a young girl, the Cook Plantation parcel where \nas a teenager Harriet Tubman worked as a seamstress, and the Jacob \nJackson parcel which is believed to be the location of one of the first \nsafe houses along the Underground Railroad. The Park would be \nestablished upon the fee simple acquisition, by the National Park \nService, of any of these parcels located within the current boundary of \nthe Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Additional areas that would comprise the Harriet Tubman historic area \ninclude about 2,200 acres in Caroline County that comprise the Poplar \nNeck plantation that Tubman escaped from in 1849. The 725 acres of \nviewshed across the Choptank River in Talbot County would also be \nincluded in the Park. These parcels are authorized to come under \nprotection through conservation easements held by the private property \nowners.\n  The bill authorizes such sums as necessary to meet the goals and \nobjectives of the bill. Funds can be used for the construction of the \nHarriet Tubman Park Visitors Center, through a cost sharing \nrequirement, for easements, or acquisition of the designated parcels \neligible for fee simple acquisition.\n  Harriet Tubman was a true American patriot. She was someone for whom \nliberty and freedom were not just concepts. She lived those principles \nand shared that freedom with hundreds of others. In doing so, she has \nearned a nation's respect and honor.\n  Harriet Tubman is one of many great Americans that we honor and \ncelebrate every February during Black History Month. In schools across \nthe country, American History curriculums teach our children about \nTubman's courage, conviction, her fight for freedom and her \ncontributions to the greatness of our nation during a contentious time \nin U.S. history. Now it is time to add to Tubman's legacy by \npreserving, protecting and commemorating the places evocative of \nHarriet Tubman's extraordinary life.\n  I am so proud to introduce this legislation, establishing the Harriet \nTubman National Historical Park and the Harriet Tubman Underground \nRailroad National Historical Park. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to establish this important and fitting tribute to Harriet \nTubman, a life worthy of recognition.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 247\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to allow an earlier start fof State health care \ncoverage innovation waivers under the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Empowering \nStates to Innovate Act with my colleagues, Senators Scott Brown and \nMary Landrieu.\n  At a time when we are looking for ways to bring this country together \nto deal with the most contentious issues of our time, we ought to be \nsupporting innovation. We ought to be supporting unleashing creative \nkinds of approaches to deal with domestic issues. That is the \nfoundation of this legislation.\n  What Senators Brown, Landrieu and I are seeking to do is to show it \nis possible on a significant issue--I think we all understand health \ncare is about as important as it gets--that we can come together, and \nfacilitate this kind of innovation. It is pretty clear that what works \nin Springfield, OR, may not be exactly ideal for Springfield, MA. But \nwhat we can do is come up with a way to provide more flexibility and \nparticularly more choice and more competition for our States and other \nStates around the country.\n  If we can just move away from a Federal cookie-cutter approach and \nencourage the kind of creative thinking we have seen in Oregon and in \nMassachusetts and other parts of the country, I think we will be well \nserved and will be in a position to better contain health care costs. I \nthink we all understand that how to rein in these medical costs that \nare gobbling up everything in sight is first and foremost on the minds \nof our constituents.\n  The Empowering States to Innovate Act encourages additional \ninnovative approaches in States, approaches that are tailored to the \nneeds of States' own residents, that will help us, in my view, to \npromote choice and competition in the American health care system. As \nlong as they meet certain requirements as far as coverage and \naffordability are met, the States are free to do whatever they choose. \nI just offer up my own judgment that right now, at a time when most \nAmericans still don't get much choice in their health care coverage, \nthis is an ideal opportunity that both Democrats and Republicans can \nsupport. As States seek to go forward with this approach, they can make \ntheir own choices.\n  In particular, what I have been concerned about, after talking to \nhealth policymakers over the last few months, is if, in the State of \nNew York, for example, you go out and set up a process to comply with \nthe legislation for purposes of 2014 and you see that the waiver, as \nnow constituted under 1332, starts in 2017, you say: How am I going to \nreconcile those two? Am I going to set up one approach for 2014 and \nthen do another approach in 2017? It is going to put us through a lot \nof bureaucratic water torture to try to figure out how to synchronize \nthose two dates. So it only makes sense to speed it all up and make it \npossible for everybody to get started in 2014.\n  We have outlined the two key changes in the legislation that is law \ntoday. The first change is to make the waivers effective in 2014 rather \nthan in 2017 so States only have to change their systems once. The \nsecond thing the Empowering States to Innovate Act does is it requires \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to begin to review State \nwaiver applications within 6 months of enactment of the legislation. \nThis would allow States early notification of whether their State \nwaivers have been approved and would give them adequate time to roll \nout their State-specific plans. I think this, too, will help us create \nmore competition, more choice, and more affordability in American \nhealth care because it will give the States adequate time to gear up. \nThat is the philosophy behind the Empowering States to Innovate Act, \nwhether one likes one particular approach or another. Clearly, there \nwill be great diversity of approaches tried at the State level.\n  This legislation offers an opportunity for States to engage in a \n``race to the top'' for what will deliver the best health care choices \nand options to their constituents. This provides a chance for States to \ndo it better. I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to give States that chance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 248\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Empowering States to \n     Innovate Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EARLIER START FOR STATE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE \n                   INNOVATION WAIVERS.\n\n       Section 1332(a) of the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``January 1, 2017'' in paragraph (1) and \n     inserting ``January 1, 2014''; and\n       (2) by inserting ``beginning not later than 180 days after \n     the date of the enactment of the Empowering States to \n     Innovate Act'' after ``application'' in paragraph (4)(B)(ii).\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to join my \ncolleague, Mr. Wyden, to introduce legislation that will protect \nMassachusetts by allowing it to waive out of specific requirements \nunder the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n  As my colleagues know, my single priority is and has always been to \nensure that what we do here in Washington does not harm my State of \nMassachusetts, or the people of Massachusetts, and that we are \nresponsible stewards with every tax dollar.\n  This has been true when it comes to voting against raising taxes on \nfamilies and businesses. It has been true when it comes to fighting for \ncommonsense, progrowth policies that will create jobs in Massachusetts. \nAnd it has been true in my efforts to be sure that the Federal health \ncare reform bill does not diminish or harm the health care innovations \nthat have occurred in Massachusetts.\n  Today we get to make a correction to the Federal health care reform \nbill to be sure that we are doing the right thing, not just for the \nState of Massachusetts but for other States who seek to waive out of \ncertain requirements of the Federal health care reform law.\n  In many ways, Massachusetts has been on the forefront of implementing \nhealth care reform--expanding access, designing systems to increase \nmarket participation and choice, and increasing transparency for \nconsumers and providers. We continue to learn lessons every day in \nMassachusetts about what works and doesn't work in health care reform.\n  And this is an important point because it speaks directly to the \npurpose of the 1egislation that I am introducing today with my \ncolleague, Mr. Wyden from Oregon.\n  As difficult as it is for me to admit this, not every State wants to \nbe like Massachusetts. Massachusetts is a great State, with the best \nhospitals, physicians, researchers and health care providers in the \ncountry and the world.\n  But I recognize that my colleague from Oregon is interested in \nprotecting the reform efforts of Oregon. He doesn't want to be like \nMassachusetts because Oregon is different from Massachusetts. Oregon's \ninsurance market is different, its provider network is different, its \nbeneficiaries and population are different from Massachusetts. Oregon \nmight want to implement reforms or create a coverage mechanism that I \ndo not like or that would not work in a State like Massachusetts. The \nsame is true for the other 49 States--each State is different, unique--\nand each State should be able to find solutions that work for their \ncitizens and their State budgets.\n  Which is why the legislation that I am introducing today with Mr. \nWyden--the Empowering States to Innovate Act--is so important.\n\n[[Page S418]]\n\n  Right now, as provided under section 1332--``The Waivers for State \nInnovation''--of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, States \ncan waive out of provisions of the Federal reform law. That's the good \nnews. The bad news is that this waiver authority is not scheduled to \ntake effect until 2017, a full 3 years after PPACA is scheduled to be \nfully implemented.\n  That makes no sense, so we are going to fix it.\n  The first thing our bill does is to allow States to waive out of \nspecific parts of PPACA in 2014 rather than 2017. This makes sense not \njust from an operational standpoint--because PPACA takes effect in \n2014--but also from an economic and fiscal standpoint. Why should \nMassachusetts be delayed in obtaining a waiver from the Federal reform \nbill when it may have already met and or exceeded specific provisions \nof PPACA? Holding Massachusetts back--limiting my State's ability to \ninnovate, remain flexible and responsive to the health care market-- \ncosts money; it costs taxpayer money.\n  That doesn't make sense. So our legislation fixes that.\n  The second piece our bill does is to provide States with certainty \nwith the waiver process. Not every State will be eligible for a waiver \nand not every waiver will be granted. But our bill provides some \ncertainty for those States who apply for a waiver by requiring the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to begin reviewing applications \nwithin 6 months of enactment of this bill. The earlier a State knows \nwhether it has received a waiver, the earlier it can begin implementing \nits specific plans and proposals.\n  Taken together, these two changes are good for Massachusetts. They \nare good for other States who are trying to innovate and advance in the \nareas of health care reform, cost containment, and coverage.\n  During Wednesday's Finance Committee hearing, Dr. Berwick, who is \nfrom the State of Massachusetts, I might add, said this about State \ninnovation and flexibility.\n  And I quote:\n\n       The cliche about states as laboratories of democracy is not \n     just a cliche, it's true. The diversity of approaches that \n     we're seeing emerge state by state has been there for a long \n     time. I think we should be doing everything we can to \n     encourage it.\n\n  I couldn't agree more. I am a strong supporter of state rights and \nfor allowing States to solve problems without the Federal Government's \ninterference.\n  We should be encouraging State innovation, not hampering it.\n  And that is what the Empowering States to Innovate Act does--it helps \nensure that States aren't held back from innovating and seeking \nsolutions that work for their citizens, their taxpayers, their \nproviders, and their communities.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to associate myself with Mr. Wyden's \ncomments about how our bill fits into the Federal health care reform \ndebate. Enacting this legislation is the right thing to do because it \nis good for States like Massachusetts. It is good for States like \nOregon and Utah, who have begun to make changes and reforms at the \nState level.\n  The legislation provides flexibility and says that a one-size-fits-\nall health care system doesn't fit the needs of every State. I know a \nFederal standard isn't in the best interest of my State of \nMassachusetts, which is why passing this bill is the right thing to do.\n  I thank my colleague, Mr. Wyden, for his thoughtful remarks and urge \nmy colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation that I think \nboth parties can and should agree on.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Franken, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. \n        Harkin):\n  S. 250. A bill to protect crime victims' rights, to eliminate the \nsubstantial backlog of DNA samples collected from crime scenes and \nconvicted offenders, to improve and expand the DNA testing capacity of \nFederal, State, and local crime laboratories, to increase research and \ndevelopment of new DNA testing technologies, to develop new training \nprograms regarding the collection and use of DNA evidence, to provide \npost conviction testing of DNA evidence to exonerate the innocent, to \nimprove the performance of counsel in State capital cases, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the Justice \nfor All Reauthorization Act of 2011. The Justice for All Act, passed in \n2004, was unprecedented, bipartisan criminal justice legislation. It \nwas Congress's most significant step forward in many years to improve \nthe quality of justice in this country and to improve public confidence \nin the integrity of the American justice system.\n  After several hearings and much work, with this legislation we \ncontinue the process of building on that foundation to go still further \nin making sure our criminal justice system works fairly and effectively \nfor all Americans. Senator Klobuchar, Senator Franken, and Senator \nHarkin join me today as original cosponsors of this important bill, and \nI thank them for their ongoing support.\n  I also appreciate the involvement of Senators on the other side of \nthe political aisle, including Senators Sessions and Grassley, who have \nparticipated in the development of this bill and provided valuable \ninput. I am confident that this bill will pass with bipartisan support, \nas the original Justice for All Act did, and I look forward to working \nwith Senators from both parties to reach that goal.\n  In 2000, I introduced the Innocence Protection Act, which aimed to \nimprove the administration of justice by ensuring that defendants in \nthe most serious cases receive competent representation and, where \nappropriate, access to post conviction DNA testing necessary to prove \ntheir innocence in those cases where the system got it grievously \nwrong.\n  The Innocence Protection Act became a key component of the Justice \nfor All Act. The act also included vital provisions to ensure that \ncrime victims have the rights and protections they need and deserve and \nthat States and communities take major steps to reduce the backlog of \nuntested rape kits and ensure prompt justice for victims of sexual \nassault. These and other important criminal justice provisions made the \nJustice for All Act a groundbreaking achievement in criminal justice \nreform.\n  The programs created by the Justice for All Act have had an enormous \nimpact, and it is crucial that we reauthorize them. Unfortunately, the \nJudiciary Committee's hearings and recent headlines have made clear \nthat simply reauthorizing the existing law is not enough. Significant \nproblems remain, and we must work together to address them.\n  In too many communities around the country, large numbers of untested \nrape kits have been found, many of which have not even made their way \nto crime labs. It is unacceptable that rape victims must still live in \nfear and wait for justice. We must act to fix this continuing problem.\n  The original Justice for All Act included the Debbie Smith DNA \nBacklog Reduction Program, which authorized significant funding to \nreduce the backlog of untested rape kits so that victims need not live \nin fear while kits languish in storage. That program is named after \nDebbie Smith, who lived in fear for years after being attacked before \nher rape kit was tested and the perpetrator was caught. She and her \nhusband Rob have worked tirelessly to ensure that others need not \nexperience the ordeal she went through. I thank Debbie and Rob for \ntheir continuing help on this extremely important cause.\n  Since we passed this important law in 2004, the Debbie Smith Act has \nresulted in hundreds of millions of dollars going to States for the \ntesting of DNA samples to reduce backlogs. I have worked with Senators \nof both parties to ensure full funding for the Debbie Smith Act each \nyear.\n  As I have researched this problem of untested rape kits, there is one \nthing that I have heard again and again: the Debbie Smith program has \nbeen working and is making a major difference. I have heard from the \nJustice Department, States including my home State of Vermont, law \nenforcement, and victims' advocates that Debbie Smith grants have led \nto significant and meaningful backlog reduction, and to justice for \nvictims, in jurisdictions across the country.\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\n  Unfortunately, despite the good strides we have made and the \nsignificant Federal funding for backlog reduction, we have seen \nalarming reports of continuing backlogs. A study in 2008 found 12,500 \nuntested rape kits in the Los Angeles area alone, and while Los Angeles \nhas since made progress in addressing the problem, other cities have \nnow reported backlogs almost as severe. In 2009, the Justice Department \nreleased a report finding that in 18 percent of open, unsolved rape \ncases, evidence had not even been submitted to a crime lab.\n  That Justice Department study gets to a key component of this problem \nthat has not yet been addressed. No matter how much money we send to \ncrime labs for testing, if samples that could help make cases instead \nsit on the shelf in police evidence rooms and never make it to the lab, \nthat money will do no good. Police officers must understand the \nimportance of testing this vital evidence and must learn when testing \nis appropriate and necessary. In too many jurisdictions rape kits taken \nfrom victims who put themselves through further hardship to take these \nsamples--rape kits that could help law enforcement to get criminals off \nthe street--are sitting untested.\n  The bill we introduce today will finally address this part of the \nproblem by mandating that the Department of Justice develop practices \nand protocols for the processing of DNA evidence and provide technical \nassistance to State and local governments to implement those protocols. \nThe bill authorizes funding to States and communities to reduce their \nrape kit backlogs at the law enforcement stage by training officers, \nimproving practices, developing evidence tracking systems, and taking \nother key steps to make sure that this crucial evidence gets to the \nlabs to be tested.\n  The bill will also help us get to the bottom of this problem by \ncalling for the development of a standardized definition of ``backlog'' \ncovering both the law enforcement and lab stages and by implementing \npublic reporting requirements to help us to identify where the backlogs \nare. It also takes steps to ensure that labs test DNA samples in the \nbest order so that those samples which can help secure justice for rape \nvictims are tested most quickly. It will also put into place new \naccountability requirements to make sure that Debbie Smith Act money is \nbeing spent effectively and appropriately.\n  The bill makes important changes to existing law to ensure that no \nrape victims are ever required to pay for testing of their rape kits \nand that these costs are covered with no strings attached. Senator \nFranken has been a strong advocate of this important provision, and I \nthank him for his help.\n  In the years since the Justice for All Act passed, we have also seen \ntoo many cases of people found to be innocent after spending years in \njail, and we have faced the harrowing possibility that the unthinkable \nmay have happened: the State of Texas may have executed an innocent \nman. We must act to ensure that our criminal justice system works as it \nshould so that relevant evidence is tested and considered and all \ndefendants receive quality representation.\n  The Justice for All Reauthorization Act takes important new steps to \nensure that defendants in serious cases receive adequate representation \nand, where appropriate, testing of relevant DNA samples. As a former \nprosecutor, I have great faith in the men and women of law enforcement, \nand I know that the vast majority of the time our criminal justice \nsystem does work fairly and effectively. I also know though that the \nsystem only works as it should when each side is well represented by \ncompetent and well-trained counsel, and when all relevant evidence is \nretained and tested.\n  Sadly, we learn regularly of defendants released after new evidence \nexonerates them. We must do better. It is an outrage when an innocent \nperson is punished, and it is doubly an outrage that, in those cases, \nthe guilty person remains on the streets, able to commit more crimes, \nwhich makes all of us less safe.\n  This legislation takes important new steps to ensure that all \ncriminal defendants, including those who cannot afford a lawyer, \nreceive constitutionally adequate representation. It requires the \nDepartment of Justice to assist States that want help developing an \neffective and efficient system of indigent defense, and it establishes \na cause of action for the Federal Government to step in when States are \nsystematically failing to provide the representation called for in the \nconstitution.\n  This is a reasonable measure that gives the States assistance and \ntime needed to make necessary changes and seeks to provide an incentive \nfor States to do so. Prosecutors and defense attorneys recognize the \nimportance of quality defense counsel. It was persuasive to me when \nHouston District Attorney Patricia Lykos testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee that it helps her do her job as a prosecutor when there are \ncompetent defense attorneys. I have also learned through this process \nthat the most effective systems of indigent defense are not always the \nmost expensive. In some cases, making the necessary changes may also \nsave States money.\n  This legislation will also help ensure that the innocent are not \npunished while the guilty remain free by strengthening Kirk Bloodsworth \nPost Conviction DNA Testing Grant Program, one of the key programs \ncreated in the Innocence Protection Act. Kirk Bloodsworth was a young \nman just out of the Marines when he was arrested, convicted, and \nsentenced to death for a heinous crime that he did not commit. He was \nthe first person in the United States to be exonerated from a death row \ncrime through the use of DNA evidence.\n  This program provides grants to States for testing in cases like \nKirk's where someone has been convicted, but where significant DNA \nevidence was not tested. The last administration resisted implementing \nthe program for several years, but we worked hard to see the program \nput into place. Now, money has gone out to a number of States, and the \nCommittee has heard strong testimony that the program is making an \nimpact. The legislation we introduce today expands the very modest \nauthorization of funds to this important program and clarifies the \nconditions set for this program so that participating States are \nrequired to preserve key evidence, which is crucial, but are required \nto do so in a way that is attainable and will allow more States to \nparticipate.\n  The bill also asks States to produce comprehensive plans for their \ncriminal justice systems, which will help to ensure that criminal \njustice systems operate effectively as a whole and that all parts of \nthe system work together and receive the resources they need. The bill \nreauthorizes and improves key grant programs in a variety of areas \nthroughout the criminal justice system. Importantly, it increases \nauthorized funding for the Paul Coverdell Forensic Science Improvement \nGrant program, which is a vital program to assist forensic laboratories \nin performing the many forensic tests that are essential to solving \ncrimes and prosecuting perpetrators. I appreciate Senator Sessions' \nlongstanding support for this important program.\n  Finally, the legislation strengthens rights for victims of crime. It \ngives crime victims an affirmative right to be informed of all of their \nrights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act and other key laws, and it \ntakes several steps to make it easier for crime victims to assert their \nlegal rights in court. I thank Senators Feinstein and Kyl for their \nleadership in this area and their assistance in developing these \nprovisions.\n  In these times of tight budgets, it is important to note that this \nbill would make all of these improvements without increasing total \nauthorized funding under the Justice For All Act and that many of these \nchanges will help States, communities, and the Federal Government save \nmoney in the long term.\n  I thank the many law enforcement and criminal justice organizations \nthat have helped to pinpoint the needed improvements that this law \nattempts to solve. Numerous organizations including the Fraternal Order \nof Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the National \nDistrict Attorneys' Association have expressed strong support for this \nbill.\n  Today, we rededicate ourselves to building a criminal justice system \nin which the innocent remain free, the guilty are punished, and all \nsides have the tools, resources, and knowledge\n\n[[Page S420]]\n\nthey need to advance the cause of justice. Americans need and deserve a \ncriminal justice system which keeps us safe, ensures fairness and \naccuracy, and fulfills the promise of our constitution. This bill will \ntake important steps to bring us closer to that goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 250\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a commission to ensure a suitable \nobservance of the centennial of World War I, and to designate memorials \nto the service of men and women of the United States in World War I; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today--February 1--is the 110th \nbirthday of Frank Buckles, the longest surviving veteran of World War \nI.\n  It is also the day that I am proud to introduce a bipartisan bill to \nrecognize the extraordinary efforts of 4 million men and women who \nserved in World War I. I am joined by my colleagues Senators Webb, \nMcCaskill, Thune and Blunt. We are united in our effort to prepare for \nthe upcoming centennial of World War I. Our goal is to rededicate the \nDC memorial on the Mall as the District of Columbia and National World \nWar I Memorial, and rededicate the Liberty Memorial of Kansas City as \nthe National World War I Museum and Memorial. Our legislation also \ncreates a commission to plan the national observance of the centennial.\n  Having the appropriate tributes for our World War I veterans has been \na cause for Frank Buckles. Over the years, he has become a \nrepresentative of his generation of veterans. His personal story is \nsimilar to many young men of his era. As an eager 16-year-old, Frank \nBuckles tried to enlist in the Army several times and finally \nsucceeded. He then pestered his officers to be sent to France. Mr. \nBuckles drove motorcycles, cars, and ambulances in England and France, \nand during the Occupation, he guarded German prisoners. Following the \nwar, he went to work for the White Star steamship line. In December \n1941, while on business in Manila, the Japanese attacked the \nPhilippines. Frank Buckles spent over 3 years as a prisoner at the \ncity's Los Banos prison camp. On February 23, 1945, a unit from the \n11th Airborne Division freed him and 2,147 other prisoners in a daring \nraid on the Los Banos prison camp. Mr. Buckles was affected by and has \nmemories of both World War I and World War II.\n  I had the privilege of listening to Frank Buckles' compelling stories \nin his home in West Virginia while sitting with his daughter. He \ngenerously shares his memories of working to enlist and get to France, \nas well as meeting French soldiers and guarding German prisoners. \nEveryone can hear his reflections by visiting the Library of Congress's \nspecial Web site for its Veterans History Project. It has personal \ninterviews of Mr. Buckles and thousands of other veterans that have \nserved our Nation both during times of war and peace. Visiting this Web \nsite is an incredible resource for scholars, students and every \nAmerican, and it reminds us of the compelling personal stories of \nbravery, commitment, and\n\n[[Page S424]]\n\nsacrifice made by our country's veterans and how they shaped our world.\n  Our bipartisan bill is designed to honor and remember over 4.35 \nmillion Americans, like Frank Buckles, who answered the call of duty \nand served from 1914-1918 in World War I. What became known as the \nGreat War claimed the lives of 126,000 Americans, wounded 234,300, and \nleft 4,526 as prisoners of war or missing in action.\n  At the end of World War I, numerous cities and States erected local \nand state memorials to honor their citizens who answered the call and \nproudly served the United States of America. On Armistice Day in 1931, \nPresident Hoover dedicated the DC World War I Memorial to honor the 499 \nDistrict of Columbia residents who gave their lives in the service of \nour country. Since then, national monuments to commemorate the \nsacrifice and heroism of those who served in World War II, the Korean \nWar, and the Vietnam War have all been built on the National Mall. I \nbelieve that the DC Memorial should be rededicated in time for the \ncentennial as well as the Kansas City Museum and Liberty Tower.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Boozman, and Mr. \n        Udall of Colorado):\n  S.J. Res. 4.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce a piece of legislation \nthat I have introduced in every Congress since 1987--a proposed \nconstitutional amendment requiring Congress to balance our Nation's \nbudget. This bill has bipartisan support and will allow us to finally \nbegin to get our fiscal house in order.\n  A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, I believe, is the \nonly certain mechanism that will break the cycle of deficit spending.\n  I believe we must ensure that the government does not continue to \nsaddle our children and grandchildren with the current generation's \ndebts. Essentially, this amendment that I propose requires the United \nStates not spend more money than it receives in revenue, except in \ntimes of war, or when suspended by a vote of three-fifths of both \nHouses of Congress.\n  This bill that we propose will provide financial stability to our \nNation. Bailouts, stimulus programs, government takeovers of private \nindustry, and costly new programs have consumed and overwhelmed the \nFederal budget.\n  Over the past 30 years, annual deficits have become routine and the \nFederal Government has incurred massive debt--nearly $14 trillion and \nrising quickly.\n  For a moment, let me share this chart with you. It says, ``The Case \nfor a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution.'' If we go back to \n1980--just 30 years ago--we owed, as a nation, $909 billion--not yet a \ntrillion dollars. That was after nearly 200 years of government, \nincluding the First World War debt, the Depression, the Second World \nWar, the Korean war, and the Vietnamese war, and many deficits. But \nfrom 1980 to 1990, this jumped to $3 trillion. From 1990 to 2000--a 10-\nyear span--it jumped from $3 trillion to $5.6 trillion. That was pretty \nbad. But from the year 2000 to 2010, which ended a few weeks ago, it \nwent from $5 trillion to $13 trillion--in 10 years. It is slated now, \nin the next 11 years, to go to $25 trillion. That is unsustainable.\n  In fact, for the record, the United States has only had 2 years in \nits entire history where it has been debt free. Look back a while. It \nwas 1834 and 1835. I repeat, only 2 years free from debt. It seems to \nme that the most powerful Nation in the world has had its weaknesses \nexposed. Foreign markets cannot stand on our wobbly financial legs. The \nreverberations of our fiscal ineptitude have not only cost American \njobs, which we badly need, but have weakened how other nations perceive \nus. Something must be done.\n  Unfortunately, we don't have to look back far in history to see an \nexample of a once great empire sitting on the curb with its hand held \nout. Greece's excessive public spending, coupled with a massive \nborrowing campaign, has put its fiscal insolvency woes on the entire \nEuropean Union. Greece's bond rating was downgraded to ``junk'' by \nStandard and Poor's in April. Bondholders were warned they could \nrecover as little as 30 percent of their initial investment. The euro \nweakened and the European stock markets plunged. The question is, will \nthe dollar soon be seen as ``junk'' to the rest of the world? I hope \nnot.\n  American taxpayers are rightly infuriated by the Federal Government's \ndisregard for the same economic principles that govern every household \nand business budget. Unfortunately, until the Federal Government is \nrequired to spend only the amount of money it takes in, I fear we will \ncontinue to write checks the Treasury cannot cash.\n  In fiscal year 2010, the total interest alone on the Treasury debt \nsecurities was $413 billion. I believe this money could be better spent \non improving education, supporting our law enforcement or, even better, \nby returning it to the people who earned it, the taxpayers.\n  We hear on a daily basis the rhetoric about tough choices, sacrifice, \nand austerity. What we need to hear more about is basic mathematics \nwhen we are talking about the budget. A balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution is the solution, I believe, to a perpetual problem \nthat we do not have the political will to fix. It will finally put our \nNation on a path to paying off our national debt. The adoption of an \namendment that would require the Federal Government to do what every \nAmerican already has to do--balance its checkbook--is what this country \nneeds to prove that Washington is serious about accomplishing this \nfeat.\n  A balanced budget amendment is simply a promise to the American \npeople that the government will spend their hard-earned tax dollars \nresponsibly. Some opponents of a balanced budget amendment state that \nit is a drastic measure not necessary at this time. They are also \ncorrect that it is bold. But I believe it is also necessary.\n  I have introduced this legislation, as I said, in every Congress \nsince 1987. If not now, when?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I am proud to join my \ncolleague, the Senator from Alabama, in introducing legislation today \nthat would amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget.\n  The idea of requiring a balanced Federal budget seems like common \nsense to most American families, who have to balance their own \ncheckbooks. And in these hard times, they wonder why the Federal \nGovernment doesn't have to do the same. In fact, the United States has \nonly balanced its budget 5 times in the last 50 years. We heard the \nSenator from Alabama point out the Federal budget balanced only twice \nin our history.\n  The budgets of nations are not the same as family budgets. Since the \nGreat Depression of the 1930s, we have known that national emergencies \nsometimes require deficit spending. But we are fast approaching a \ntipping point where our debt threatens this economic orthodoxy. We are \napproaching a tipping point where an unprecedented level of debt--and \nour institutional failure to address it--risks our national security. \nWe need to take action now to turn around our fiscal situation.\n  By restoring responsible spending through a reasonable balanced \nbudget amendment, we can begin climbing out of our economic hole, and, \nperhaps just as important, this amendment would send a strong signal to \nthe financial markets, U.S. businesses, and the American people that we \nare serious about stabilizing our economy for the long term. That is a \nsignal I believe we need to send now.\n  Before going further, I want to recognize the obvious--that there is \na wide range of strong opinions about the wisdom of adding a balanced \nbudget amendment to our U.S. Constitution. Tinkering with the \nConstitution is not something any of us takes lightly, and this \namendment is certainly no exception.\n  I myself have had doubts in the past about similar legislation. \nDuring the\n\n[[Page S425]]\n\nClinton years, our government ran a surplus, and there was no pressing \nneed for such a requirement. When we started running deficits again, \npart of me hoped we could use other tools at our disposal to get our \nNation back on a financially sound path.\n  Additionally, Members of my party raised--and continue to raise--\ncredible arguments about why a balanced budget amendment could actually \nhurt our economy in some circumstances. Some of them believe it is \nnothing more than a rhetorical tool designed only to make a political \nstatement and move us inevitably toward smaller government.\n  The recent history of the balanced budget amendment is a partisan \none. Of the five proposals that were introduced last Congress, none had \na Democratic cosponsor--largely because of, in my opinion, extraneous \nprovisions that manipulated the budget in one way or another to protect \nfavored tax breaks or certain spending.\n  However, if you take a longer view into the past, it was actually \nprogressive Democratic Senator Paul Simon--along with Senator Hatch of \nUtah--who led the balanced budget amendment effort that came closest to \npassage in 1995. They knew that if we balanced our Federal budget, we \nwould be better able to make more intelligent choices about spending, \nrather than spending billions on debt service, and we would actually \nsee family incomes rise.\n  Today, the dilemma we face as a result of our debt is even more \nextreme. That is why I am cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Our government debt, as Senator Shelby pointed out, is now over $14 \ntrillion. That is $45,300 for every person in this country. If we don't \nput limits on how we spend money, the question we face isn't whether we \ncan make intelligent choices; it is whether we will be able to afford \nany of the programs that we value at all--programs we need to help \npropel the middle class and small business over the longer term.\n  What is at stake isn't just family income; it is our Nation's ability \nto continue to lead in the global economic race. The cochairman of \nPresident Obama's bipartisan commission on reducing the debt called our \ndebt a ``cancer'' that is eating away at our economic health. That is a \npoint I wish President Obama had made in his State of the Union Address \nlast week when he spoke about some of the investments America needs to \nmake to spur innovation and economic growth--education, clean energy, \nand infrastructure, to name a few.\n  He is right that without targeted investments to help hard-working \nAmericans and businesses, the United States will be relegated to \nsecond-class status. We won't be able to compete with countries around \nthe world or to grow jobs in America. We won't be able to unleash our \ninnovative spirit and give our children and grandchildren their shot at \nthe American dream.\n  I have also come to the conclusion that unless we put constraints on \nspending, Congress simply lacks the political will to make the \nextremely difficult decisions that will lead us out of the dire fiscal \nsituation in which we find our Nation.\n  I have been fighting for many years for smart budgeting tools--the \nPresiding Officer has as well--including pay-as-you-go budgeting, a \nline-item veto, and a ban on earmarks, which would help reduce waste \nand rein in Federal spending. I am also working with a group of \nbipartisan Senators trying to make sure the recommendations by the \nPresident's fiscal commission can get an up-or-down vote in Congress. A \nbalanced budget amendment is one more important tool we need.\n  Let me say a few words about the legislation itself. Senator Shelby, \nto his credit, first introduced this legislation--I think I can say \nthat it was when he was a Democrat, some 25 years ago, and he continues \nto reintroduce it every Congress since he became a Republican. I thank \nhim and acknowledge his leadership.\n  The Shelby-Udall balanced budget amendment would create a requirement \nthat Federal spending cannot exceed revenue and that total expenditures \nof the government cannot exceed 20 percent of the previous year's gross \ndomestic product.\n  As Senator Shelby pointed out, this requirement wouldn't apply when \nthe United States is at war, and it can be suspended by a \nsupermajority, or three-fifths, vote of each House of Congress in the \nevent certain spending is necessary to address a national emergency.\n  To my friends who worry that this balanced budget amendment puts our \neconomy into an inflexible straitjacket, I say it is not true. It \nallows commonsense safety valves to be used for exceptional \ncircumstances--to give the flexibility that is sometimes needed in \nsituations that can't be predicted or planned for.\n  All in all, I am confident our proposed amendment provides a \nresponsible approach to putting us on a path toward a balanced budget.\n  We talked a lot last week during and after the State of the Union \nAddress about the need to work together to address our biggest \nchallenges, not just sitting together. Today, I hope I am putting my \nmoney where my mouth is by joining my good friend from Alabama. I hope \nour partnership will send a signal that collaboration can help us \naddress our most pressing national issues. The American people are \ndemanding that of us. As usual, they are a few steps ahead of us. It is \ntime for us to catch up.\n  I ask my colleagues of both parties in both Chambers to work with \nSenator Shelby and me on this idea. We may not have it perfect. Nothing \nis ever perfect. But it is a good start. Let's at least have an honest \nand spirited dialog about this legislation and ways to dig ourselves \nout of our economic hole. Our children's future depends on it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S425-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S425-S426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 5--AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF \n  THE CAPITOL TO HONOR FRANK W.

Mr. President, today is the 110th birthday of Frank \nBuckles, the longest surviving American veteran of the First World War. \nFrank Buckles is a wonderful man who still lives on his farm in West \nVirginia thanks to the extraordinary care provided by his daughter \nSusannah Flanagan. I am sure that my colleagues will join me in wishing \nFrank, ``Happy Birthday.''\n  I also believe it is important that we as a nation express our deep \nconviction for the sacrifices that Mr. Buckles and all the World War I \nveterans endured for our country. Frank is a representative of the \nextraordinary men who fought in numerous battles of the Great War in \nthe defense of our nation. They have made sure that we as Americans are \nable to enjoy the quality of life that we so cherish.\n  Mr. Buckles has witnessed the world change drastically throughout his \nlifetime and has experiences that most of us can only dream about. He \nhas seen the metamorphosis that has defined the American social and \ncultural revolutions of the last century. As a young man, he served in \nthe Army's ambulance corps in France and Germany, where he evacuated \nwounded soldiers from the battlefield. During the Second World War, he \nspent over three years confined to a Japanese prison camp in the \nPhilippines as a civilian.\n\n[[Page S426]]\n\n  Today, I am introducing a resolution to allow for a tribute in the \nCapitol to Frank Buckles as the representative of all World War I \nveterans during the 112th Congress. As the longest surviving veteran, \nFrank represents nearly 4.5 million U.S. soldiers, sailors, and airmen \nwho joined forces with over 37 million Allied soldiers to defeat the \nCentral Powers. These men witnessed atrocities such as gas warfare that \nwere unprecedented at the time. Each and every serviceman made his own \nsignificant contribution to the war effort that cannot be understated. \nThis generation of dynamic young men was able to alter the course of \nhistory for the betterment of each and every one of us here today. \nFrank, like many young men of this time, worked hard to enlist and \nserve his country, and in doing so helped to change our world.\n  As America's last surviving veteran of the First World War, Mr. \nBuckles represents our final link to a generation that built a legacy \nas the defenders of the free world in the first large-scale global \nconflict. I can promise you that his legacy and the legacy of all \nveterans will live on forever in the ideals and values that make \nAmerica the strongest nation in the world. I appreciate the bipartisan \nsupport of our cosponsors and hope more will join our effort to honor \nsuch a special veteran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/01/senate-section/article/S426-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5.
