Madam President, last night the Senate held an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote to move forward with legislation preventing continued \ncurrency manipulation by the Chinese Government. This unfair practice, \nwhich gives Chinese exports an unmerited advantage in the global \nmarketplace, injures the American economy, it hurts American \nmanufacturers, and it costs American jobs, lots of them.\n  In 1990, America's trade deficit with China was $10 billion. Twenty \nyears later, thanks to currency manipulation that gives an edge to \nChinese exporters, that trade deficit has soared to $273 billion--from \n$10 billion to $273 billion. That trade deficit has fueled the loss of \nabout 3 million American jobs, including 2 million manufacturing jobs, \nin just the last 10 years alone. In Nevada, we have lost more than \n14,000 jobs to China trade, and it is all because of currency \nmanipulation. The eight hardest hit States have lost 1.4 million \npositions total, and 17 States have lost more than 2 percent of their \njobs.\n  Manufacturers simply can't compete when the Chinese Government gives \nits exporters advantages other countries don't get. American workers \nand manufacturers work as hard and are as ingenious as any in the \nworld. They don't need special advantages to succeed; they just need a \nfair shot. This important jobs legislation will give them that fair \nshot.\n  Putting an end to China's deliberate actions to undervalue its \ncurrency will even the playing field. It will also support 1.6 million \nAmerican jobs. Demanding a fair playing field will pump $300 billion \ninto our economy in just a few short years.\n  But don't take my word for it. Just ask American manufacturers. The \nAlliance for American Manufacturers called this jobs bill the \n``deficit-reducing, job-creating, no-cost stimulus that\n\n[[Page S6060]]\n\nis desperately needed.'' Business groups have lined up to testify to \nthe adverse impacts of currency manipulation on U.S. corporate \ninterests. The American Iron and Steel Institute, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, and even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nhave said the problem pits American and Chinese manufacturers against \none another in an unfair fight.\n  But this issue has also forged some strange alliances. The AFL-CIO \nhas also called for swift action to level the playing field. The \nchamber of commerce and the AFL-CIO are together on this issue.\n  This is what the AFL-CIO said:\n\n       The single most important job-supporting trade measure that \n     Congress . . . can take is to address the Chinese \n     government's manipulation of its currency.\n\n  Business and labor groups agree that American workers and \nmanufacturers aren't getting a fair shake, and they agree on what \naction Congress should take to give them that fair shake. We all know \nthat doesn't happen very often.\n  Here in the Senate we have heard the message loudly and clearly. We \ncan't ignore blatant, unfair trade practices that put American workers \nat a disadvantage.\n  Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once said: ``Fairness is what \njustice really is.'' This week, the Senate is demanding justice for \nAmerican companies and their employees.\n  I know a few of my Democratic colleagues don't support this \nlegislation but very few. There are some Republicans who don't support \nthis legislation but very few. Even though there are a few on each side \nwho don't support this bill, I think this is the mark of a good piece \nof legislation--garnering a significant number of votes from each \nparty. That is what bipartisanship is all about. With millions of \nAmericans' livelihoods at stake, I am pleased to see the Senate working \non a truly bipartisan bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/04/senate-section/article/S6060-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, there is a lot of talk these days \nabout how Washington is broken and how, unless we do something to fix \nit, the solutions to our most urgent problems will remain out of reach. \nThe fact is, that is not really true. Congress is not frozen in a state \nof perpetual gridlock, and the now imminent passage of three long-\nawaited free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea \nshows it.\n  For 2\\1/2\\ years, I and other Republicans have stated as clearly as \nwe could to anyone who would listen that we are willing and eager to \nwork with the Democrats on legislation on which we know both sides \nagree. Free-trade agreements fall squarely into that category. That is \nwhy I have been calling on the President to approve them since his very \nfirst day in office. Yet, for reasons I will touch on in a moment, he \nhas actually held back.\n  It is true that the President had to be convinced of the importance \nof these agreements. After all, he ran for office promising to \nrenegotiate NAFTA. But once he did come around, his reluctance to act \nbecame an emblem for the administration's entire approach to jobs in \nwhich results have taken a back seat to ideology. All the President had \nto do was to follow through on his own pledge--send these trade \nagreements to Congress--and we would have had an early bipartisan \nachievement which didn't add a single dime to the deficit and which, by \nhis own estimates, would protect tens of thousands of jobs right here \nat home. Instead, the President passed over what could have been a job-\ncreating, bipartisan layup and devoted the first weeks of his \nPresidency to a highly partisan stimulus that has since become a \nnational punch line.\n  So now, 2\\1/2\\ years after the stimulus was signed into law, there \nare 1.7 million fewer jobs in America, and the President is just this \nweek getting around to free-trade agreements we all knew would create \njobs, all of which raises a question: Why didn't we do this sooner? I \nthink there are two reasons we didn't do it sooner.\n  First, the White House was under pressure from unions that don't like \nfree trade. They have been extracting promises from the White House for \n2\\1/2\\ years in exchange for their support. That is one reason.\n  The second reason the White House didn't send these agreements up \nsooner is that the political operators over at the White House seem to \nbelieve they benefit from the appearance--the appearance--of gridlock. \nThey are over there telling any reporter who will listen that they plan \nto run against Congress next year. Their communications director said \nas much to the New York Times 2 weeks ago.\n  So that is their explicit strategy--to make people believe Congress \ncan't get anything done. How do they make sure of that? Well, they do \nthat by proposing legislation they know the other side won't support \neven when there is an entire menu of bipartisan proposals the President \ncould choose to pursue instead. How else do we explain the President's \nstanding before the country in January extolling the job-creating \npotential of these free-trade agreements, asking Congress to pass them \nas soon as possible, and then sitting on them until yesterday, \npreventing Congress from taking the vote? How else do we explain the \nfact that the President spent the past few weeks running around the \ncountry demanding that Congress pass a so-called jobs bill right away \neven as leading members of his own party admit the Democrats wouldn't \nhave the votes to get it through Congress even if it came to the floor? \nAs one senior Democratic aide put it yesterday: ``Nobody is all that \nexcited about the President's jobs bill.''\n  That is how to create dysfunction--by refusing to acknowledge that we \nlive under a two-party system in this country and that as long as we \ndo, the two parties will have to cooperate to some extent in order to \nget legislation through Congress. It is the refusal to accept this \nreality that leads to inaction. The President can govern as though this \nis the Congress he wants or he can deal with the Congress he has. Along \nthe first path lies gridlock, and along the second lies the kind of \nlegislative progress Americans want. As for Republicans, well, we have \nbeen crystal clear from the outset that we prefer the latter route.\n  So this morning, I reiterate the same plea I have consistently made \nfor the past 2\\1/2\\ years. My suggestion to the President is that he \nput aside proposals for which we know there is bipartisan opposition \nand focus instead on proposals on which we know both sides can agree. \nFree-trade agreements are a good first step, but they are just that--a \nfirst step. If we are going to tackle the enormous challenges we face, \nwe need to come together on much more than that. There is bipartisan \nagreement, for instance, on the need to increase domestic energy \nexploration, to reverse job-killing regulations, and to reform the \ncorporate tax code so we are more competitive. If the White House \nreally wants to make a statement, it will work with us on all of these \nissues. If it doesn't, Americans will only conclude that it would \nrather have an issue to run on than an impact.\n  With these trade agreements, we are showing we can work together to \ncreate jobs and help the economy, and it is something we should do a \nlot more of around here.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/04/senate-section/article/S6060-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I listened carefully to the statement \nmade\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\nby the minority leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, concerning the \ncurrent state of affairs in the U.S. Senate. I certainly want to \nendorse his conclusion that we should find ways to work together, try \nto find solutions, bipartisan solutions, in this divided government \nthat will actually address the problems America faces.\n  If you ask people across America about our problems, No. 1 on the \nlist is the creation of jobs, the high unemployment. President Obama \nhas come forward with a jobs plan which he is now trying to sell to \nCongress, as well as to the American people, with some success, \ncertainly when it comes to appealing to the public.\n  When you ask the American people: Is it a good idea to give a payroll \ntax cut to working families so they have more spending power, so they \ndo not have to live paycheck to paycheck, so they can fill the gas \ntank, go shopping? Of course. It makes sense. That is one of the \npillars of the President's jobs act.\n  The President also proposes that we give tax breaks particularly to \nbusinesses, smaller businesses that hire the unemployed, including \nveterans. If you ask the American public: What do you think of that, \noverwhelmingly they think that is a good idea.\n  When you say the President's plan also tries to help those State and \nlocal governments that are facing layoffs of teachers, firefighters, \nand policemen by lessening the impact that would have, the American \npeople say that is reasonable. We do not believe crowded classrooms and \ncommunities without fire and police protection are good for our future. \nSo they endorse the President's approach to that.\n  The President also thinks we should invest, in this jobs act, in \nrebuilding the fundamental structure of the American economy--not only \nhighways and bridges and airports but our schools--and the American \npeople have overwhelmingly said that is a good idea.\n  The President said we should pay for this, and we should pay for it \nby making certain those who can afford to pay more in taxes--those \nmaking $1 million or more--pay a little more so we can achieve what I \noutlined earlier.\n  Well, it turns out that is not only approved by the American people, \n59 percent of Republicans agree with that--raising taxes on the highest \nincome Americans to help move this economy forward. Fifty-nine percent \nof Republicans agree with that. As someone said in a meeting this \nmorning, unfortunately none of them are serving in Congress. And the \nRepublican Senators and Members of the House are saying: No way will we \nconsider any additional taxes on the wealthiest people in America even \nif the money is going to be used to give payroll tax cuts to working \nfamilies and to give tax incentives and credits to small businesses and \nto avoid laying off and firing firefighters and policemen and teachers. \nThey say: No way.\n  So when the minority leader comes to the floor of the Senate and says \nwe have to find common agreement, let me tell you, what the President's \njobs bill does is it comes up with a bipartisan-approved approach to \ngetting this economy moving. I hope we can find a way to do exactly \nthat.\n  The minority leader talked this morning about trade agreements, and \nour hope is to bring those up in the very near future. I think it is a \ngood thing. But we made it clear as well that before it could be \nseriously considered, we needed to take a look at something called \ntrade adjustment assistance. That is a program to help workers who lose \njobs because of trade agreements or because of the trade relationship \nbetween the United States and another country. I have had it happen in \nmy State. I am sure the Acting President pro tempore from New Hampshire \nhas had the same experience, where people in her State have lost their \njobs because of competition overseas or jobs moving overseas. Well, we \nwant to make sure those workers have a fighting chance to pick up new \nskills and education so they can find another job in this economy and \nprovide for their families.\n  That was a condition to bringing up the trade agreements. We passed \nit in the Senate. It is now pending in the House. But we can move to \nthose trade agreements. Let the Senate and House vote accordingly. But \nthe reason it has been delayed--if there has been any delay--is to get \nthat part right. I think the Senate has done that.\n  So I heartily agree with the conclusion of the minority leader that \nwe should work together in a bipartisan fashion. I suggest the minority \nleader take a look at the President's jobs act. Most of the ideas there \nare ideas Republicans have openly endorsed time and time again. I hope \nthey are not going to reject the Obama jobs act because the word \n``Obama'' is in the title. Let them come forward and think about ways, \nwith us, to design an economy that is moving forward rather than to \ndesign the next Presidential campaign slogan and bumper sticker. The \nAmerican people expect us to look beyond campaigns and get something \ndone on the floor of the Senate and the House.\n  I might differ with the minority leader when it comes to whether we \nhave had gridlock and obstruction here in the Senate, and I would just \nsay for the record that it has become a matter of course, a normal part \nof the business of the Senate to require 60 votes on virtually \neverything--60 votes. That is not required in the rules of the Senate. \nWe have reached the 60-vote threshold because of Republican \nfilibusters. If it were simply an up-or-down majority vote, 51 votes \nwould do it. But the Republicans, by threatening filibusters and \nimposing filibusters, have created a 60-vote requirement. That gives \nthem leverage. It takes away the power of the majority and gives the \nminority this new empowerment. But to suggest this has not been used \nand things have gone along just swell around here--take a look at the \nRecord. Three times now we have been knocking on the door of closing \ndown the government and closing down the economy just this year. The \nAmerican people noticed. They did not like it. Standard & Poor's \nnoticed and downgraded the American credit rating, saying the problem \nis not the economy, the problem is the political system which is in \ngridlock in Washington. That is a reality. We can change that, we \nshould change that, and I encourage my colleagues on both sides to look \nfor ways to change that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/04/senate-section/article/S6061-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6061-S6062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           A CHOICE IN BANKS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, yesterday, incidentally, I spoke about \nBank of America's decision to impose a $5 fee on their loyal customers \nwho have debit cards. Bank of America announced that this fee had to be \ncollected because they were going to be restrained in the amount of \nswipe fees they could charge for people who use debit cards.\n  Those who follow this issue know the Federal Reserve took a look at \nthis. Every time we use a piece of plastic to pay for something--as a \ndebit card--there is a charge imposed on the retailer--the restaurant, \nthe bookstore, the grocery store, you name it. There is a charge \nimposed. So we asked the Federal Reserve to take a look at that charge \nthat is being imposed by the credit card companies through the banks, \nand here is what they found. The actual cost of a bank and Visa or \nMasterCard processing a debit card transaction is anywhere from 4 cents \nto 12 cents. Remember when they used to process checks for pennies no \nmatter what the face value was? Well, the actual cost of the debit \ncard--the new checking account, the plastic checking account--is 4 \ncents to 12 cents a transaction.\n  Then the Federal Reserve Board said: What are they actually charging \nthe retailers? Madam President, 44 cents is the average charge by the \nbanks and credit card companies for the use of the debit card--more \nthan 10 times the 4-cent rate or more than 6 times the 7-cent rate the \nFederal Reserve said is the reasonable cost of a debit card \ntransaction--a 600-percent profit they are taking right out of every \ntransaction.\n  Of course, it means the grocery store, the retailer has to charge \nmore. Imagine someone comes in and gets the special--a cup of coffee \nand a doughnut at the Rock Island Country Market, which I visited \nduring the break, a 99-cent special. They use their debit card to pay \nfor it. The Country Market is now going to be charged 44 cents for a \n99-cent transaction.\n\n  So it changed. The world changed last Saturday. The new law went into \neffect, capping for the largest banks in America the debit card swipe \nfee at\n\n[[Page S6062]]\n\nabout 24 cents, splitting the difference. Still these banks are doing \nquite well. The actual cost of the transaction is 4 cents, 7 cents, 12 \ncents, and they are going to get 24 cents. Well, you would think they \ncould live with a 100-percent profit on what they are doing. No way. \nBank of America said to their loyal customers: Sorry, but because we \ncannot make as much off the retailers, we are going to nail our \ncustomers with a $5 monthly fee for the debit cards.\n  Yesterday, I sent a letter to the CEO of Bank of America, Mr. \nMoynihan. I said to Mr. Moynihan: I have just done the math here, and \nif your customers pay $60 a year for their debit cards, you are going \nto collect more money from your customers than you could possibly have \nlost because of this change in the law. You are overcharging your \ncustomers. It is not fair, and I want you to defend it. Let's see if he \ndoes, not just for me but for the people who bank at Bank of America \nand have debit cards there.\n  You see, what happened last Saturday is not just a change when it \ncomes to debit card swipe fees. I think what happened last Saturday \nwith this new law is empowering customers and retailers across America.\n  Now, incidentally, Chase bank, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America have \nall talked about imposing this debit card fee. If they decide they want \nto penalize their customers and nail them $5 a month or $3 a month, \nthat is their decision. But I hope what happens next is that bank \ncustomers across America realize they have the right to change their \nbanks, to move to banks that are not going to nail them with these fees \nthat are driven by greed.\n  There is good news. There are thousands of banks across America for \npeople to choose from and thousands of credit unions, and most of \nthem--or many of them, I should say--have already stated publicly they \nare not going to join in with Bank of America in nailing their loyal \ncustomers with a debit card fee.\n  The Press Democrat newspaper in Santa Rosa, CA, on Friday carried an \narticle saying, ``Local banks say no to debit card fees.'' The article \nlists a number of local banks and credit unions that said they would \nnot copy Bank of America's strategy. The article quotes Tom Duryea, CEO \nof Summit State Bank. He said:\n\n       It's just not something we want to do to our customers. I \n     am not going to nickel-and-dime people over $5.\n\n  Now, that is a man speaking for a bank that I think has a future--a \nbank that realizes if you treat your loyal customers right, they are \ngoing to stay loyal. But if Bank of America has their way and nails \ntheir loyal customers with a $5 monthly fee, I hope some of their \ncustomers will think twice about doing business there.\n  Washington Federal is a regional bank in Washington State. Its \nspokesperson, Cathy Cooper, was quoted in the Oregonian newspaper \nsaying:\n\n       We have absolutely no plans to impose a debit card fee.\n\n  On Saturday, the Salisbury Post in Salisbury, NC, ran an article \ntitled: ``Bank of America move doesn't prompt local banks to charge \ndebit card users.''\n  It quotes Bruce Jones, CEO of the Community Bank of Rowan, saying \nthat his bank will start running ads touting its lack of fees: ``We're \nreally going to promote that,'' Jones said, ``That's such a good piece \nof business.''\n  The Pennsylvania Credit Union Association put out a statement \nyesterday and said this on behalf of its 500 credit union members:\n\n       Study after study has shown that credit unions overall \n     offer lower fees and better savings rates. The mission of a \n     credit union is to serve its members and not Wall Street.\n\n  That is a welcome mentality.\n  There have even been some large banks that acknowledged the need to \ntreat their customers fairly.\n  USAA, for example, is a financial institution that serves military \npersonnel and their families. USAA has announced it will not charge \nconsumer debit fees, or checking account fees either.\n  And the giant Citibank has heavily promoted its position on the \nissue: Citibank will not charge its customers debit fees.\n  It is a smart move for these banks and credit unions to treat their \ncustomers well when it comes to debit cards. Customers are ready to \nshop around if they don't.\n  Across the United States more and more banks and credit unions are \nmaking it clear they are not going to nail their customers with a debit \ncard fee.\n  Now is the time for bank customers across America to say enough is \nenough. If you do not value me as a customer enough not to charge me a \nnew $5 monthly fee just for trying to access my own checking account, \nmy own bank account at your bank, I am going to do my business \nelsewhere. I think that is an important thing to do.\n  Of course, we need to stay vigilant to make sure America's consumers \nhave good, honest information about how banks are treating them. I will \nbe meeting later this week with the Acting Director of the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, Raj Date. We will be talking about how to \nensure customers know what their rights are when it comes to banking \nservices.\n  Let me tell you, there are Republicans who hate this agency the way \nthe devil hates holy water. The notion that the customers of America \nwould finally have a voice in Washington keeping an eye on the \nactivities of financial institutions scares the living heck out of some \nMembers of Congress. But many of us believe that the scales have been \ntipped for too long on the other side, that many consumers are, \nfrankly, at the mercy of these financial institutions and could use an \nadvocate who stands up every once in a while and fights for them.\n  Holly Petraeus is the wife of General Petraeus, who is now heading up \nour CIA. She and her husband have certainly given great service to this \ncountry. I met with her just a few weeks ago, and she talked about the \nexploitation of men and women in uniform serving our country by many \nfinancial institutions--predatory lending and awful practices. Many of \nthese practices, incidentally, lead to these servicemembers having to \ntake an early discharge from service because they are so deeply in \ndebt. I think that is a scandal, and I am glad Mrs. Petraeus has spoken \nout on it. She is using this agency, the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, to come to the assistance and protection of our men and women \nin uniform. That is a legitimate use of their responsibility. And for \nthose who want to do away with the Bureau, let them explain, if they \ncan, why they think our veterans and our servicemembers do not deserve \nthis kind of protection.\n  I want to see the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau up and \nrunning. I think it is about time we had some advocacy group standing \nup for men and women in uniform and consumers and retailers across \nAmerica. I hope we can soon confirm the nominee for the head of that \nBureau, Richard Cordray. I have met Mr. Cordray, and he is going to be \na smart, effective watchdog for America's consumers. As I said, there \nare some--particularly on the other side of the aisle--who hate the \nnotion that there would be such an advocate and such a counsel \navailable for consumers. But I think American consumers and families at \nleast deserve to have someone speaking out when they are about to be \nexploited.\n  The keys to a well-functioning market are competition, transparency, \nand choice. When these conditions are present, consumers have a \nfighting chance and they can thrive. So can small banks and credit \nunions. I am going to keep standing up for these basic principles. I \nbelieve competition and transparency are critical for a free market \neconomy to operate in a just and fair way. It is the right thing to do.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/04/senate-section/article/S6062-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6062-S6065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PROTECTING AMERICA'S PUBLIC LANDS\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, before the Democratic whip, \nthe assistance majority leader, leaves the floor, I wish to acknowledge \nthe great work he has done in standing up for consumers and protecting \ntheir interests, and it fits the purpose for which I rise today, which \nis to talk about protecting our public lands and the importance they \nhold for all of us as Americans. They are really at the heart of the \nway of life we hold so dear in Colorado. In addition, I would like\n\n[[Page S6063]]\n\nto talk about how public lands are important to an issue that all of my \ncolleagues care about; that is, creating jobs.\n  I know many of my colleagues, including the Acting President pro \ntempore, understand the value of public lands, but I wish to take a few \nminutes and list some of the reasons I think they are a vital thread in \nthe fabric of our country.\n  First, we are a nation of explorers and risk-takers, constantly in \nsearch of the next challenge to overcome or the next mountain, \nliterally, to climb. Public lands, especially in the West, are a \nreminder of this heritage. I wish to also acknowledge in the great \nNortheast of our country, where the Presiding Officer lives, that we \nhave mountains and we have extensive public lands as well. I know that \nsame spirit is infused in the people of New Hampshire.\n  But our public lands also benefit our communities across the country \nthrough the clean air and the clean water they provide. In urban and \nrural areas alike, open spaces filter and clean our air and water, \nimprove the environment for surrounding communities, while lowering \nstormwater management and water treatment costs.\n  Access to the public lands and the many opportunities they provide is \na key reason why many of us choose to live in the West. I know this is \nparticularly true in Colorado, where public lands and outdoor \nrecreation are truly in our blood. It is also one of the reasons \nColorado is one of the most active and healthiest States in the country \nand why I have been encouraging children and families across the Nation \nto get outside and stay active, especially in our national parks.\n  The public lands are also, to coin a phrase, in our wallets. When \ndiscussing public lands, we cannot forget their importance to our \neconomy. Our public lands have long been a source of economic value, \nand multiple use is a key component of the management of our public \nlands. An example: Extractive industries, such as oil and gas \ndevelopment and mining, will continue to be an important part of our \neconomy in the West. But these uses are certainly not the only economic \nuses of our lands. Outdoor recreation: hunting, hiking, biking--the \nlist goes on and on--are a major use of our lands, and outdoor \nrecreationalists not only enjoy our land, they also support a large and \ngrowing industry of supply stores, manufacturers, guides, hotels, and \nother important businesses.\n  In fact, in this time of economic uncertainty, outdoor recreation and \ntourism are two of the bright spots in our economy. I wish to draw \nattention to the chart I brought to the floor for those viewing the \nfloor of the Senate today. In 2006, the Outdoor Industry Foundation \nfound that biking, hiking, and hunting and all the other outdoor \nrecreational activities add $730 billion to our economy every single \nyear.\n  Perhaps most important, this is an area of our economy that continues \nto grow. It has grown by more than 6 percent in 2011 alone and has \noutpaced U.S. economic growth more generally. These numbers tell a \npowerful story of the outdoor recreation industry's contribution to our \neconomy.\n  We hear a lot about the problems government causes, and there are \ncertainly areas we can reform. We can streamline government, make it \nmore efficient. We can get government out of the way where appropriate, \nand we can increase oversight where necessary.\n  But when I was traveling my home State of Colorado over the summer, \nas the Presiding Officer travels her State, I heard a lot about how \ngovernment is working. I heard about partnerships between national, \nState and local governments, private businesses and local stakeholders \nto preserve and protect our natural resources. These efforts are \nimproving the lives of Coloradans. They are creating jobs. They are \nmaking communities better places to live, and they are building future \neconomic opportunities.\n  I wish to share a couple examples in that vein. In July, I was in the \ntown of Creede, which is in the historic San Luis Valley of Colorado. \nAmong other stops, I met with the Willow Creek Reclamation Committee. \nThis is a wonderful example--this committee--of citizens at the local \nlevel coming together to take on a problem to create solutions.\n  In this committee, there are retired miners, artists, local \nbusinesspeople, ranchers, vacation homesteaders and Federal and State \nofficials who are working together to clean up pollution in their \nwatershed.\n  The narrow valley that is above Creede is lined with abandoned mines. \nWhile the area boasts some of the best examples of mining structures \none will find in the Western United States, pollution from these \nabandoned mines hurts water quality. The pollution was so bad that \nresidents in the area feared Creede would be placed on the National \nPriorities List for a Superfund cleanup, a prospect that any community \nthat has faced it understands would hurt their tourism-based economy.\n  So, in 1999, the residents formed this committee to do something \nabout it themselves. They worked with the Environmental Protection \nAgency, the Forest Service, the Department of Agriculture, the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service, State agencies and many others and developed \na plan to clean up their watershed.\n  The plan they came up with is truly a comprehensive approach that \nrecognizes the full value of their watershed to their community. What \nstruck me most--and again I know the Presiding Officer senses and \nexperiences the same spirit in her home State of New Hampshire--nobody \nwas talking about whether they were a Democrat or Republican. They were \nnot trying to wage political or partisan battles. They saw a problem \naffecting their livelihoods. They banded together as a community, \npartnered with the Federal, State and local government officials and \nthey did something about it. Now their streams are healthier, their \nland is healthier, and their economy is healthier.\n  I would like to bring some of that Creede pragmatism to Washington, \nDC. Our public lands are an invaluable natural resource. I hope we can \ncome together in the Congress with policies and solutions to wisely \nutilize and conserve them.\n  In that spirit, let me provide some additional examples of what we \ncould do in the spirit of the people in Creede, CO. One incredibly \nsuccessful government program that has been instrumental to the growth \nof outdoor recreation across the country is the Land and Water \nConservation Fund or the LWCF. In fact, it has been proven over and \nover that every $1 of LWCF funding creates an additional $4 in economic \nvalue.\n  LWCF was developed on the belief that as we develop and exploit our \noil and gas resources, we should set aside also some land for hunting, \nfishing, and recreation for the enjoyment of future generations. So we \nas a country set up a mechanism whereby royalties from oil and gas \nleases were to fully fund LWCF projects.\n  I have to say, instead of that mission being fully fulfilled, every \nyear those dollars are taken out of LWCF for other unrelated government \nexpenditures, leaving in its wake a huge unmet need in each State \nacross the country. While royalties flow into the government coffers, \nLWCF has continually been raided, and its authorized $900 million of \nfunding every year has been fulfilled only twice since 1964. Only twice \nsince 1964 has that full $900 million been appropriated.\n  Not only are we robbing future generations of critical open spaces \nand outdoor recreation, we are underinvesting in our assets, our public \nlands, that would drive job creation.\n  I serve as the chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee. I have \nseen how these funds have been particularly useful to our parks, and \nthere is no better example in my State than the creation of the Great \nSand Dunes National Park and Preserve. This magnificent park and \npreserve was made possible by LWCF appropriations that were obtained \nwith very strong local support.\n  Great Sand Dunes protects one of our Nation's great landmarks. It is \nalso a source of tourist dollars for the surrounding rural communities. \nThat is why I have joined with several of my colleagues, including \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Burr, Senator Baucus, the Presiding Officer, \nand others, to fight for full funding of LWCF.\n  The point I wish to emphasize to my colleagues is that when we talk \nabout natural resources, we are not just talking about beautiful \nlandscapes and future generations. There are incredibly\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\nimportant economic benefits to preserving and protecting these lands.\n  In that spirit, I wish to briefly discuss another key component of \nour public lands system--wilderness. Lands classified as ``wilderness'' \nare critical to our multiple-use management strategy. Some areas should \nbe preserved as wilderness, just as some areas are better suited to \nmining, oil and gas development or off-road vehicle use.\n  Wilderness provides opportunities for backpacking, fishing, hiking, \ngrazing, and hunting, as well as protecting these precious landscapes \nfor future generations. Wilderness also provides opportunities for our \nveterans to reenter and reconnect and heal. I have a column from the \nDenver Post yesterday that speaks to the ways in which veterans can \nreconnect to their purpose in life and to reenter society. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Denver Post, Oct. 3, 2011]\n\n         Guest Commentary: Vets Find Solace in Mountain Fishing\n\n                          (By Shawna Bethell)\n\n       You know immediately when you are in the presence of grace. \n     Perhaps in a cathedral of limestone and jeweled glass where \n     centuries of ritual have left the scent of myrrh. Or, equally \n     so, perhaps in the cleft of a canyon surrounded by high-\n     country mountains where waterfalls arc from cut stone.\n       Perhaps it's where--against the roar of fast-moving water--\n     you hear the quiet voices of two men: one of wisdom and one \n     of youth, speaking quietly of water and fish, war and \n     healing, the conversation flowing easily between the two--a \n     common experience binding them.\n       There is with fly-fishing a serenity that comes, when the \n     mechanics of the process no longer take thought or effort, \n     and the mesmerizing rhythm of a cast settles into mind and \n     memory. When all else slips away, and the fishing becomes the \n     mission in front of you, then comes peace. Or at least, this \n     is what I'm learning.\n       In late June, Project Healing Waters--a nationwide fly-\n     fishing program for wounded soldiers and veterans--brought 15 \n     participants from Colorado's Fort Carson and Fort Huachuca in \n     Arizona to fish in the cold spring-melt waters around \n     Silverton. The program is based on the principle of shared \n     time and skill between experienced fly-fishermen and our \n     recently returned soldiers.\n       Programs vary from region to region, but the basic premise \n     is that during winter months, soldiers are taught to tie \n     flies and build fishing rods, then in the spring and summer \n     months, they are taken out to learn the art of fly-fishing--\n     each component lending itself to a specific method of \n     healing, whether it is learning physical dexterity with \n     damaged limbs or prostheses, or giving soldiers a focus \n     outside their memories or mental trauma.\n       On the day I was invited to join them, I had the \n     opportunity to witness one of those moments of grace, when a \n     local fisherman and a young soldier shared a conversation. It \n     was not a monumental event, nor was the speech eloquent and \n     tried. Instead, it was simply quiet. And the young man who \n     had been solemn and withdrawn, moving along the stream bank \n     with his head lowered, opened to a man who had seen his own \n     war 40 years before.\n       I had been told in my initial interview with Gary Spuhler \n     of Colorado Springs, coordinator of the Rocky Mountain \n     Region's chapter of PHW, that he got involved because he \n     wanted to make things better for our returning soldiers, \n     better than the way his generation had returned from Vietnam.\n       And I think the country as a whole, carrying the regret of \n     that treatment, is reaching out more readily to today's \n     veterans, but listening to the gentle ebb and flow between \n     the two men--the seasoned, high-country fisherman and the \n     young soldier, moving easily from fishing to military life to \n     hope for the future and healing, against the backdrop of \n     broad, sheltering landscapes--I recognized something rare.\n       We are in a time when Congress is ever trying to decimate \n     protections for our wildlands while at the same time these \n     lands are lending solace to those who have been sent to war \n     in the name of our country. It is not a stretch to say that \n     these rivers and streams are part of what is giving back to \n     the veterans who are coming home.\n       Each fisherman I spoke with, experienced or beginner, spoke \n     of the sound of the water, the scent of the air, and how the \n     rest of the world falls away when they are out there, taking \n     with it the trauma they carry with them.\n       There is a healing power that comes from the mountains and \n     streams, and there is healing in taking the time to listen to \n     our military men and women.\n       Project Healing Waters, combining the two, gives us all a \n     lesson worth learning.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. It is an inspiring column. It speaks to the \npower of wilderness and wilderness activities in the context of our \nveterans returning home from standing for us in places such as \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  Speaking of wilderness opportunities, just this last week I \nintroduced the San Juan Mountain Wilderness Act, along with Senator \nBennet. It is similar to a bill I introduced in the last Congress. My \nbill would designate--we have a photograph of this wonderfully \ninspiring area. This bill would designate 33,000 acres in southwestern \nColorado as wilderness. It would also designate about 2,000 acres as a \nspecial management area and withdraw over 6,000 acres from mineral \nentry lands within the Naturita Canyon area.\n  This bill is the work of extensive input and collaboration among and \nacross every imaginable stakeholder group. I wish to particularly note \nthe efforts of former Congressman John Salazar and his staff, who \nworked with the affected Colorado county commissioners, interested \ncitizens, and my staff in developing this legislation over the last 4 \nyears.\n  It is crafted to take into account the various ongoing uses of these \nlands, such as for water supplies and recreation, while also providing \nstrong managerial protection for these sensitive lands. I do not have \nto tell you, when we see this photograph, among many, that this region \nof Colorado is blessed with stunning beauty.\n  Much of the land proposed for wilderness and other protections in our \nlegislation are additions to existing wildernesses such as the Mount \nSneffels Wilderness Area and the Lizard Head Wilderness Area. The bill \nalso establishes a new area called McKenna Peak. This peak presides \nover imposing sandstone cliffs which rise 2,000 feet above the \nsurrounding area. It also provides important winter wildlife habitat \nfor large numbers of deer and elk, which then draw many hunters from \nall over the country every year. Over 30,000 recreational user days are \nrecorded annually during hunting season in this one game management \nunit. That is a significant number of recreational user days.\n  The bill would also establish the Sheep Mountain Special Management \nArea. Since helicopter skiing currently exists in this area, the \nlegislation designates the area in a way that protects its wilderness \ncharacter but still allows this use to continue. This is, in my \nopinion, the type of flexibility that is a key for sound wilderness \nprotection proposals and is a shining example of how protection can \ncoexist with responsible use.\n  What I am saying is, the bill has been carefully tailored and crafted \nto apply deserving protections to these lands. This is how wilderness \nshould and can be done. Between all the benefits--clean air and water, \nrecreation and economic growth--one would think Congress could work \ntogether and enact commonsense public lands legislation such as my San \nJuan Wilderness bill.\n  But I am frustrated. I know the Presiding Officer is frustrated this \nCongress has not recognized the opportunities that are before us. \nInstead of what I saw happening on the ground in Creede, CO, it seems \nas if our politics inside the beltway are getting in the way of moving \nour country forward. A prime example of politics getting in the way, at \nleast in the Senate--I will come back to why I say just in the Senate--\nis a bipartisan bill I have introduced called the Ski Area Recreation \nOpportunity Enhancement Act. I worked closely with Senator Barrasso on \nit. We have an additional 10 cosponsors across the country. In the \nHouse of Representatives, Representative Bishop and Representative \nDeGette have championed this bill.\n  Our bill would simply clarify that the Forest Service may permit \nyear-round recreational activities, where appropriate, on ski areas on \npublic lands.\n  It includes no new Federal spending. I think that is an attractive \nelement of the legislation. It would increase the money coming into the \nFederal Treasury because it would likely increase permit fees.\n  The bill would boost year-round activity in ski resorts on public \nlands, providing more opportunities for outdoor recreation, creating \njobs in the process and aiding the rural economies that surround ski \nareas.\n  The bill is so bipartisan and strongly supported that it passed the \nHouse last night by 394 to 0. No House Members voted against the bill.\n  Despite bipartisan and bicameral support for the bill, and the fact \nthat it\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\nwould create jobs, I have not been able to get this bill to a vote on \nthe floor of the Senate. I am tempted to ask unanimous consent that the \nbill pass, but I will continue to work in the regular order to move the \nbill to the floor of the Senate and on to passage.\n  I had a long career--if you want to call it that--as a high-altitude \nmountain climber before I came to the Congress. That experience \nprepared me to serve in the House and in the Senate in unexpected ways.\n  In 1992 I was on the south face of Mount McKinley, known to the \npeople of Alaska as Denali, as well. We were 10 days into what was \nsupposed to be a 7-day climb. We were out of food. The only way to get \ndown was literally to go up and over the top of Mount McKinley.\n  The lesson I learned in that successful climb was, when you are faced \nwith 20-below temperatures and high winds, the only way home is over \nthe top. You have to work together to accomplish the impossible. When \nyou do work together to accomplish the impossible, you find a way to \nmake it happen.\n  In some ways I believe that is the choice Congress has to make as we \nface these challenging times. We can either work together and find a \nway up and over the summit--passing legislation that will create jobs, \nfix our budget problems, and start working on the problems Americans \nface every day--or we can keep fighting with each other, in effect, \nstarving the country of the leadership I know Congress can provide and \nthat we must provide in these challenging times.\n  Madam President, I close my remarks today by asking my colleagues to \njoin me in passing this straightforward, bipartisan, and commonsense \nski areas bill and to support full funding for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. I also ask my colleagues to work with me to enact \nlocally developed wilderness proposals, such as the San Juan Wilderness \nAct.\n  As we tackle unemployment and how to grow the economy, let's not \nforget the important role our public lands can and will play in the \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/04/senate-section/article/S6065-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n     Navy Master-At-Arms Petty Officer First Class John Douangdara\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today to honor a fallen hero--\nNavy Master-At-Arms Petty Officer First Class John Douangdara of South \nSioux City, Nebraska. Petty Officer Douangdara was part of the East \nCoast Based SEAL team on the Chinook helicopter that was downed by \nenemy fire in Afghanistan on August 6, 2011.\n  He was a dog handler for the SEAL team. He and his combat assault dog \nled their unit on patrols in order to expose dangerous explosives and \nhidden enemy combatants. He and 29 fellow servicemembers, and his \ncombat assault dog Bart paid the ultimate price in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom. As a dog handler, the East Coast Based SEAL team \nentrusted their lives to him and to his dog. His first dog Toby was \nkilled in action in Iraq. His second dog Bart would die with him on the \nhelicopter.\n  The name ``Douangdara'' can be difficult to pronounce, so his Navy \ncomrades soon gave him the call sign ``Jet.'' Members of his unit \nremember him for being trustworthy and always positive. The decorations \nand badges earned during his distinguished service speak to his \ndedication and his skill. He received the Purple Heart, the Defense \nMeritorious Service Medal, the Bronze Star with ``V'' Device, the Joint \nService Commendation Medal with ``V'' Device, the Army Commendation \nMedal, the Presidential Unit Citation (2 awards), the Good Conduct \nMedal (2 awards), the National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan \nService Medal (3 awards), the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global War on \nTerrorism Medal, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (3 awards), the \nOverseas Service Deployment Ribbon (3 awards), the Rifle Marksmanship \nMedal, and the Pistol Marksmanship Medal.\n  I am told Petty Officer Douangdara had a joyful disposition and a \ndeep sense of commitment to American ideals that were evident to \neveryone he encountered. John's high school friends and teachers recall \nhis sense of humor coupled with a competitive desire to win. \nParticipating on the high school mock trial team was one way he \ndirected his very considerable energy.\n  John was also about helping others. It was not a surprise to those \nwho knew him that his energy, focus, and empathetic nature would lead \nhim to military service and the challenge of working with the Navy \nSEALs.\n  John belongs to a very special family. His mother and father escaped \nfrom Laos 31 years ago and emigrated to the United States. They settled \nin South Sioux City, Nebraska, where they grew and nurtured a very \nrespected family. The South Sioux City community honored John with a \nspecial memorial service on September 25, 2011. They also named a local \npark after John.\n  I know his community and Nebraskans as a whole are enormously proud \nof his service. I am confident they will provide his family with \ncomfort during this very difficult time.\n  Today, as we bow our heads with the Douangdara family, I ask that God \nbe with all those serving in uniform and that He bring them home \nsafely.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my chief of \nstaff, Dr. Patrick DeLeon, who has helped me to serve the people of \nHawaii and our Nation for 38 years. Dr. DeLeon is retiring, but he \nleaves behind a legacy of work that has greatly improved the lives of \nmany of our citizens in Hawaii, particularly the native Hawaiians, \nwhile advancing the professional circumstances of doctors, nurses, and \npsychologists.\n  After joining my staff in August of 1973, Pat, a psychologist and \nattorney, directed my efforts to create and refine health and education \npolicy. In the later years he would also serve as chief of staff for my \nWashington, DC, office. Pat helped to shepherd legislation related to \nnative Hawaiians, immigrant children, the people of the Pacific, and \nhigher education. Under his service the importance of nurses, \npsychologists, and other health professionals have been properly \nrecognized.\n  He has been very active in helping our community college system in \nHawaii become full-fledged 4-year colleges. For example, he played a \nmajor role in the establishment of a school of pharmacy and a school of \nnursing at the University of Hawaii's Hilo campus.\n  Pat also serves as a teacher, a mentor, and psychologist to my staff, \na role that will be difficult to replace.\n  I thank Pat for his decades of hard work, his service to the people \nof Hawaii and this Nation, and, most importantly, for his friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/04/senate-section/article/S6065-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6065-S6066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FURTHER CORRECTING H.R. 2608\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                            working together\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I appreciate the \nopportunity to come down to the floor once again to speak to you and \nthe American people. I come to the floor today because there is \nsomething that too many people in Washington, DC, are missing right \nnow; that is, we are Americans first.\n  It is a simple idea but one that seems easily forgotten in politics \nbecause Washington has a way of making elected officials act like \npartisans rather than problem solvers. For example, how can any one \nMember of the Senate be 100 percent right? I just don't know how that \nhappens. How can they also vote 100 percent of the time with their own \nparty? Do they honestly believe their party is right 100 percent of the \ntime or is it easier than going with the alternative--easier than \nworking together with people whom one doesn't agree with on every \nsingle issue?\n  I ran for the Senate to make a difference, and I believe the voters \nof this country sent us here to find ways in which we can all agree, to \nmove our country forward and to make things better. Governing wisely \ndoesn't mean spending all our time politicking--making the other side \nuncomfortable by voting a certain way or taking uncomfortable votes, \nputting those votes in the bank for more petty attacks during the \nelection season. But why else would we spend hours and days trying to \nram through one-sided bills that can't pass simply to highlight our \ndifferences? Is that honestly why we were sent here today? Because \nthere is no Republican bill that is going to pass and there is no \nDemocratic bill that is going to pass. It needs to be a bipartisan, \nbicameral effort that the President will sign.\n  We face very huge challenges. That means we must rise to the occasion \nand rise above politics to accomplish the very big things the American \npeople expect from their elected officials. Our jobs and economic \npicture, as we all know, is bleak. The line of unemployed workers would \nstretch across America and back again. Our national debt and deficits \nare spiraling out of control. Working families are getting squeezed by \nthe high cost of energy, high health care costs, high education costs. \nBusinesses are squeezed by high tax rates, burdensome regulations, and \nuncertainty about the future and the political leadership in this \ncountry. Our housing market is frozen, and the government is making it \nharder and harder, rather than easier, for borrowers to refinance. Yet \nwith all these challenges we have, the answer here in Washington is \njust more of the same--more threats, more gridlock, more partisanship. \nI say enough already, because I have said this back home in \nMassachusetts and people, I think, greatly appreciate the sentiments: \nWe are Americans first. If we don't work together right now--at this \nmoment in time, right now--then we are going to miss a great \nopportunity.\n  We need to focus on jobs. We need to focus on the economy. That is \nwhat I have done since the day I got elected. I believe the American \npeople deserve better. They deserve better than congressional gridlock \nand political gamesmanship. For example, the President--not you, Mr. \nPresident, but the President--has given us a jobs bill that isn't \nperfect, but it is a start. The majority leader has said the Senate \nmight consider the President's package eventually. Really? Eventually? \nWe are in a financial emergency. We are going to talk about creating \njobs eventually?\n  Let's be honest with those who sent us. The current proposal from the \nPresident isn't going to pass either Chamber if it relies entirely on \ntax increases to pay for it. I know it and the Presiding Officer knows \nit. So when we bring it up, are we going to try to make it better? Are \nwe going to try to pass it?\n  I urge the majority leader to bring the jobs bill--or jobs bills--to \nthe floor that can actually get 60 votes as well as have a chance of \npassing in the House. What would they look like? They would look like \nparts of the President's proposal that actually have bipartisan support \nand can help our fellow Americans immediately. We should take the \nthings everybody agrees on and bring them forward now--right now. We \ncould pass a payroll tax cut for both employers and employees. I stood \nwhen he said that. I clapped. I agree with him.\n  We can also pass his version of the Hire A Hero Act that provides tax \nincentives for employers to hire our heroes who are returning from \ndoing incredible service for our country. It puts them back to work. \nTheir unemployment rate is 25 percent. I am all for it. I clapped \nagain. It is a great idea.\n  We can get to work on reforming our Tax Code in a way that eliminates \nloopholes and leads to lower rates. We can do these things. It is \npossible. Those are the things we agree on and we should be doing \nimmediately--not just bringing a bill forward, knowing it is not going \nto pass and then spotting a particular person or party for an election \nseason that is so far away that if we don't do something right away, we \nare going to be in deep trouble and miss the opportunity. We are \nAmericans first. We can do it better and we should do it better.\n  I have been a little bit discouraged--it seems to go in ebbs and \nflows--about the ability to actually have an open amendment process. We \nhad to sign a letter to the President guaranteeing we would actually \nmove forward with the trade agreements. Then we had an open amendment \nprocess and, quite frankly, I think when it was done, everybody was \nsatisfied that it was just that--an open amendment process--and we got \nsome good suggestions and sent them off to the President. I am eager \nfor those bills to be passed.\n  We need to allow our Members to offer their own ideas on job \ncreation. There is no one particular person, whether it be the \nPresident, the majority leader, the minority leader, or any individual \nhere, who has all the ideas on job creation. Since when? I have a vote, \njust as each and every one of my colleagues does. I am sure the \nPresiding Officer has some amendments he thinks would help job growth \nin his State. I know we have worked on one that was cited by \nindependent groups as being probably the No. 1 way to actually get the \neconomy moving, but we will not even have the opportunity to allow that \nto be filed as an amendment. Is that right? Of course not.\n  I have a number of bipartisan pieces of legislation, one of which I \njust referenced with the Presiding Officer, to help boost our economy \nin Massachusetts. Whether it is working with our fishermen to protect \nthat industry which provides food for American citizens and throughout \nthe world or whether it is the high-tech sector, biofarming--you name \nit--my bills will help solve, as will the Presiding Officer's and \nothers, some of our economic problems. It will not be done overnight, \nbut it is a first step. There is absolutely no reason we can't move \nforward to have an open amendment process on a bill that will actually \ncreate jobs. But they will make a difference in\n\n[[Page S6067]]\n\nMassachusetts today, and that is what my constituents sent me here to \ndo.\n  Secondly, we need to focus on our debt and deficits. They are out of \ncontrol. When I got here, we had an $11.5 trillion national debt. It is \nnow up to $14.5 trillion in a little over 1 year. There is plenty of \nblame to go around. I hear my colleagues ranting and raving and blaming \neverybody, but everybody is at fault. Let's acknowledge that and set \naside the sniping of whether we should blame this administration or \nthat administration because, quite frankly, it doesn't matter. It \ndoesn't matter at this point. Everyone has contributed, and now \neveryone needs to work together to solve these very real problems.\n  I am urging the debt committee to put aside partisanship and remember \nthat we are, once again, Americans first and we have an opportunity \nright now--right now, in this moment in time--to do it better and to \nsolve these very real problems. We should not get lost in party \npolitics. We should think the way great American leaders have always \nthought. They didn't waste time scoring points. They took the long \nview. They thought about leaving a legacy for the next generation and \nleaving our country in a better place. I know, as the Presiding Officer \ndoes, and many others, I have pictures of my children and my family--no \ngrandchildren yet--here in my office in Washington and in my home and \nin Boston. If we care about the young people in those photos, we should \nbe demanding--absolutely demanding, we should have a lot of the folks \nwho are not in leadership actually get up and demand a bipartisan \ncompromise on the debt, one that finally puts us back on the track \ntoward a balanced budget. As the Presiding Officer knows, because I \nbelieve he served with him, before I held this Senate seat, it was held \nby the late Senator Ted Kennedy and before that it was held by John F. \nKennedy. I wish to remind my colleagues that it was President Kennedy \nwho famously said: ``Those to whom much is given, much is expected.''\n  The voters have given us so much. They have given us so many \nopportunities to do it better and to be better in solving our country's \nvery real problems. They have given us a responsibility and an \nopportunity to come here and work and get something done. Every minute \nwe waste, we let them down. With every petty attack, they get more \ncynical and expect less and less from the people who serve in this \ngreat and historic Chamber. While Washington bickers, their faith in \nour democracy is waning. So I, for one, challenge the majority leader, \nthe minority leader, and all the Members to finally do something for \nthe American people who need our leadership so badly. Let's work \ntogether on these big challenges. Let's renew the faith the people of \nAmerica have bestowed in us and let's remember we are Americans first \nand we owe it to them to do it better.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Does the Senator from Tennessee wish to be \nheard on the motion to proceed?\n  Mr. CORKER. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized under the motion to \nproceed.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the bill that is \nabout to come before us--the China currency manipulation bill, as many \nare calling it. I want to speak about this bill because I think it is \npoor public policy.\n  I know back home in all of our States people are concerned about the \nfuture; I am concerned about the future. People are concerned about \nmanufacturing jobs; I am concerned about manufacturing jobs. But it \nseems to me what we ought to focus on are those things that will take \nus to the place we want to be.\n  I know a lot of times when we are having these types of economic \nsituations, the country turns inward. The country tries to look for \nother things to blame for the cause of where we are, and I think that \nis exactly what this bill is doing. Here we have a situation where our \neconomy is slow, we have a financial crisis in Europe that has created \ntremendous fear in every country in the world. Yet what we are looking \nat doing in the Senate is creating a trade war with the second largest \neconomy in the world--an economy that is growing rapidly and where our \nexports to this country grew twice as fast in the year 2010 as it did, \non average, with the rest of the world.\n  To me, Mr. President, this is one of those bills where we cut our \nnose off to spite our face. It is one of those bills where we try to \nmake it look back home as though we are doing something constructive \nwhen what we are really doing is hurting the U.S. economy.\n  We have three free-trade bills that are coming to the floor--that \nhave been held up now for over 900 days--and that I think are going to \npass. I believe this body is going to embrace them because we know this \ncountry is losing market share in the three countries we are reaching \nan agreement with. We are losing market share in South Korea, we are \nlosing market share in Colombia, and we are losing market share in \nPanama. In other words, the manufacturers in Tennessee and Virginia and \nall across this country have a lesser ability to sell their goods into \nthese three countries because these three free-trade agreements are not \nin place. But it is my sense we are getting ready to do something \nconstructive, in a bipartisan way, and approve these bills.\n  So what is stunning to me is that we would be actually taking up \nanother bill that would likely hurt trade with the fastest growing \nother economy and the biggest other economy in the world. By the way, \nChina does manipulate its currency. It does do that. It has something \ncalled a managed float. Their financial system is antiquated. It is \nbeing liberalized. They understand what they are doing with their \ncurrency has to change.\n  Over the last 5 years, the Chinese currency has actually appreciated \nrelative to our dollar by 30 percent. China knows it has to do even \nmore of that. The fact is, as the standard of living in China improves, \npeople are going to want even greater access to American goods. So what \nwe ought to be doing, instead of trying to create a trade war with a \ncountry we want to create better relationships with, is focus on the \nreal problems that exist in China.\n  There is no question the Chinese Government--the Chinese Government--\nneeds to open procurement policies. As a government, they are a large \npurchaser of goods. Right now they have laws in place that cause them \nto purchase those goods from companies that exist in China. We need to \ncause them to open. The Secretary General, or the person we believe to \nbe the next leader of China, is going to be here in January. This is \nsomething our President ought to talk with him about when he comes to \nvisit and create an opportunity for success for our companies in \nAmerica to be able to sell goods to China.\n  Secondly, we should focus on intellectual property rights. There is \nno question Chinese companies take advantage of U.S. companies by \nstealing intellectual property rights. It exists in almost every area. \nThat is something we certainly should be talking to China about.\n  Thirdly, we ought to be talking about China investing in this \ncountry. The fact is, we would like to see more plants created in this \ncountry. We would like to see more manufacturing occur. So, yes, we \nshould be talking to China about making investments in this country.\n  Lastly, we should certainly be creating avenues for Chinese consumers \nto\n\n[[Page S6068]]\n\nhave greater access to American goods. Those are the types of solutions \nwe ought to be talking about, and they can certainly be dealt with at \nthe executive branch level. There are WTO violations we ought to be \nbringing to the WTO's attention.\n  This bill, in my opinion, is great in optics. It allows Senators to \ngo back home--by the way, the Senate is supposed to be the cooler \nplace. It is interesting the leadership in the House, where we might \nexpect a bill like this to move out quickly--a hot piece of \nlegislation--has already talked about what bad policy this is. So, \nhopefully, this bill will not gain traction if it passes the Senate and \ngoes to the House of Representatives. The fact is, this is not the kind \nof thing the Senate ought to be taking up, and certainly not something \nthe Senate ought to be passing.\n  We are now in a situation where we have an economic slowdown, the \nmarkets are continually getting worse--and have been, especially since \nAugust 2--and we have a financial crisis in Europe where contagion with \nthose financial institutions is potentially spreading around the world. \nYet the Senate, in its wisdom, is considering a trade war to add to all \nof that. This is exactly the kind of reaction and behavior that took \nplace in the 1930s. Again, it is almost as if we cannot learn from the \npast.\n  Mr. President, I understand that numbers of Senators voted to proceed \nto this bill, and I understand we ought to have debate on this kind of \nbill. That is what the Senate is for. But I would encourage all of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle not to have an investment in this \nbill.\n  Again, I realize there are numbers of cosponsors, but I would \nencourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up and \nto realize this is terrible policy. I know back home it may sound good, \nbut I hope when Americans understand what we are doing is pursuing the \nwrong issues in the name of trying to make ourselves look good back \nhome, this bill will not see the light of day. Hopefully, we will not \nhave the 60 votes to have cloture on this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I hear this over and over and over \nin this body and in the House of Representatives; that whenever the \nPresident of the United States talks about increasing taxes on \nmillionaires--just making their tax rate the same as middle-class \ntaxpayers--the other side yells ``class warfare, class warfare, class \nwarfare'' against the rich. Yet we know class warfare in this country \nis being aimed right at the middle class and has cost so many jobs and \ncaused so many people in the middle class to see their incomes remain \nflat for the last 10 years.\n  When I hear discussions about trade, I always hear characterizations \nof protectionism or trade war; we are in a trade war. Look at the \nnumber of jobs we have lost to China in the last 10 years. We don't \nhave to look very far to know every time we go to the store and buy \nsomething, it seems darned near everything is made in China. It wasn't \nthat way 10 years ago. It sure wasn't that way 20 years ago.\n  Ten years ago this body made a mistake--many of us opposed it, and I \nwas in the House of Representatives then--with something called \npermanent normal trade relations with China--letting China join the \nWorld Trade Organization. In those days, there was a relatively small \ntrade deficit with China. A trade deficit means we buy more from them \nthan we sell to them. Today that trade deficit with China is about $750 \nmillion every single day. Every day we buy $750 million more in \nproducts from China than we sell to China.\n  If we are buying that much more than we sell day after day after \nday--7 days a week, 52 weeks a year--we end up losing jobs because \nthese are the things we were making in this country.\n\n  Never in our history do I remember--and I am not a professional \nhistorian, but I have never heard anybody say otherwise on this--that \ncompanies in one country would shut their production down--stop \nproducing steel in Steubenville or stop producing chemicals in \nCleveland or stop producing cars in Dayton or stop producing glass in \nToledo--shut down a plant, move it to another country--often China--and \nthen sell the product back into the home country, back to the United \nStates of America. That is not a ticket for anyone in America to gain \nmiddle-class status, and it is not good economic policy. It doesn't put \nus in the place we need to be.\n  So when I hear the opponents to this whole idea of leveling the \nplaying field say: Oh, my gosh, the Senate, which is supposed to cool \nthe saucer--whatever that George Washington/Thomas Jefferson saying \nwas--cool the hot tea in the saucer, or however he said that, and then \nsay this is a trade war, that our attempt to simply level the playing \nfield is a trade war, that is just unilateral disarmament. The Chinese \nunderstand what a trade war is about.\n  Let me cite one example real quickly. I was talking to a gentleman \nwho works for paper companies in the United States, including paper \nmanufacturers we still have in Ohio, in Chillicothe and West \nCarrollton, sort of the Dayton area, and down into Butler County near \nCincinnati and other places around the State, and he said the Chinese \ndidn't even have a coated paper industry 15 years ago. That is the kind \nof paper that is the glossy magazine-type paper. The Chinese started \nthis industry 15 years ago. They buy their wood pulp in Brazil, then \nship it to China, and then it is milled in China. Paper is expensive to \ntransport. It is heavy, for the cost of it, and it is bulky, for the \ncost of it. But the Chinese take wood pulp from Brazil, and then it is \nshipped and milled in China and then sold back here.\n  The labor cost of making paper is only 10 percent of the cost. Yet \nthey can undercut prices here. Why is that? Well, we assume they \nsubsidize water and capital and land and energy. We also know they get \na 25-percent additional subsidy because of currency because the Chinese \ngame the currency system. They devalue their currency. They \nunderappreciate, if you will, their currency, meaning they, in a sense, \nget a bonus.\n  When they sell anything to the United States, they get a 25-percent \ndiscount. So they can undercut American manufacturers that could be \neven more efficient than they are or, if the United States sells into \nChina, our sellers, our producers, get a 25-percent penalty.\n  But look at the job loss. This is the whole story. This really is the \nwhole story. We have 10 cosponsors. We have five Democrats--Senator \nSchumer and I and Senators Hagan, Stabenow, and Casey--and five \nRepublicans--Senators Snowe and Collins of Maine and Senators Sessions \nof Alabama, Burr of North Carolina, and Graham of South Carolina. This \nis a bipartisan effort that got 79 votes out of 98 yesterday.\n  So when I hear the other side say we are starting a trade war, look \nat this chart. This is California, in the last 10 years, since PNTR--\nsince we set up this relationship with China and allowed China into the \nWorld Trade Organization. Look at the job loss. California lost almost \na half million jobs. Most of these are manufacturers. Texas lost \n232,000. My State lost 103,000 jobs.\n  These are 103,000 people that saw their plants close. We have lost \n50,000 manufacturing plants in this country in the last decade or so. \nThese are 103,596 people, our people. If they lose their job, $16-an-\nhour manufacturing, they often lose their health insurance; they often \nlose their home.\n  It is easy for us to talk numbers and easy for us, dressed like this \nand getting paid well to do these jobs, to forget what an individual \nsuffering from this kind of job loss is all about. Imagine a family in \nRichmond or a family in Columbus, where they lost their job, then they \nlost their health care, and then they lost their home. They have to go \nto their 12-year-old daughter and say: Honey, we are going to have to \nmove. We are losing our house. We can't live here anymore.\n  These are terrible human problems. To dismiss our efforts to try to \ncome to an even, level playing field so we can compete is what we need \nto do, not using names such as trade war and protectionism and class \nwarfare and all that.\n  I will conclude my remarks. There will be much more in the next 2 \ndays' debate on these issues.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Republican leader.\n\n\n                               Jobs Bill\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for 3 weeks President Obama has been \ntraveling across the country calling on Congress to pass what he calls \nhis jobs bill right away. Here is what he will say in Texas today, if \nhe has not said it already: At least put this jobs bill up for a vote \nso the entire country knows where every Member of Congress stands. \nWell, I agree with the President. I think he is entitled to a vote on \nhis jobs bill.\n  The suggestion that the Senate Republicans are not interested in \nvoting on his jobs bill is not true. I think he is entitled to a vote. \nIt won't surprise anyone to know I do not think it is a good approach, \na way that is likely to create jobs, but he has asked for a vote. I \nthink we ought to accommodate the President of the United States on a \nmatter he has been speaking frequently about over the last few weeks \nand give him his vote.\n  In fact, they have been calling for this vote with great repetition. \nHis Press Secretary said it on October 3, and David Plouffe, the White \nHouse Senior Adviser, said the same thing on September 27. David \nAxelrod, his top strategist, called for us to have this vote on \nSeptember 13. The President himself--let me count the number of times: \n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11--12 times the President of the United \nStates himself, over the last few weeks, has called on us to have this \nvote. As he put it: I want Congress to pass this jobs bill right away. \nWell, I hope it will not pass because I do not think it is the right \ndirection for the country to take to begin to deal with the joblessness \nissue, but I do think the President makes an important point--that he \nis entitled to a vote.\n  If I were to be given an opportunity by my good friend the majority \nleader, I would offer the President's jobs bill, which we think would \nbe more accurately described as stimulus 2, sort of a redo of the \napproach and the bill we approved back in 2009, after which we have \nlost 1.7 million jobs. Therefore, I would ask consent to set aside the \npending motion and amendments in order to offer the amendment which I \nhave just described and hold in my hand at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am not \ngoing to do a long dissertation on stimulus 1, the jobs bill that, in \neffect, did so much good for our country. I can't talk about the other \n49 States, but I can talk about what the Recovery Act did for the State \nof Nevada. It basically saved the State of Nevada from going into \nbankruptcy, hundreds of millions of dollars to help State government \nstop massive layoffs of teachers and create tens of thousands of jobs \nin areas such as renewable energy. So that is enough on the American \nRecovery Act. I thought it was extremely important for Nevada. Other \nSenators can come and talk about how their own States benefited.\n  ``Right away'' is a relative term. The President has been calling for \na vote on his jobs bill and rightfully so. Why did he start calling for \na vote on his jobs bill? Because there was again one of the long \nobstructions that took place in the Senate and in the House on an issue \nthat was fairly simple. What was that? Funding the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency. These devastating floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, and \nfires had created a situation where FEMA was about to go broke. You \nwould think we could move quickly past that, but, no, we couldn't \nbecause something we agreed on in late July--that we would fund the \ngovernment for the rest of the year--was again brought to the forefront \nand because the Republicans were threatening to close down the \ngovernment again. So of course the President was calling for his jobs \nbill. He recognized that what was going on here in the Senate and in \nthe House was a waste of time; that is, why were we spending time \nunnecessarily on funding one of the essentials of government; that is, \ntaking care of people who have been devastated by these terrible storms \nand other calamities.\n  We have moved very quickly, after we got through that slog caused by \nthe\n\n[[Page S6070]]\n\nRepublicans, to get FEMA funded and to get the CR extended for 6 weeks. \nWe are now on something that is long overdue: China currency. China has \nbeen manipulating its currency for a long time. In the last 10 years, \nwe have lost 2 million jobs because of this. If there were ever a jobs \nbill, it is this we are doing on the floor right now.\n  I sponsored the President's bill. I am the one who brought it to the \nfloor. I have announced in a number of speeches I have given out here \nthat I believe we should move to this jobs bill. We need to move to \nthis right away, there is no question about that, but to tack this onto \nthe China currency manipulation legislation is nothing more than a \npolitical stunt. We all know that. If we don't, we should know. I am \ntelling everyone. I said I will bring the American Jobs Act to the \nfloor this work period. We have 2 more weeks left in this work period.\n  Obviously, the Republican leader, my friend, the Senator from \nKentucky, wants to do something about the jobs bill. I am glad he does. \nHe wants us to move this forward. So my suggestion would be to modify \nmy friend's unanimous consent request and suggest that we have the \npermission, for lack of a better word, of the Republicans here in the \nSenate to immediately move--the motion to proceed would be unnecessary. \nWe could move to that as soon as we finish--you have two choices: \neither as soon as we finish the China currency legislation or we finish \nthe trade legislation, which Senator McConnell and I have talked about \nfinishing next week. So I would move to modify my friend the Republican \nleader's consent agreement that we move immediately to the legislation \nI have introduced on behalf of the President either after we finish the \nChina currency legislation or after the trade bill, whatever my friend \nwould rather do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending request is a request from the \nRepublican leader.\n  Mr. REID. I have asked that it be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Republican leader so modify his----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I \nlistened carefully to what my good friend the majority leader had to \nsay, and he was talking about other matters debated at other times--the \nfirst stimulus bill, on which I think we probably have a basic \ndisagreement. I think it was almost a total failure. He also talked \nabout the debate we had with regard to the continuing resolution, which \nwas finally worked out on a bipartisan basis. But those are things that \noccurred in the past.\n  What I am trying to do here today by suggesting that we vote on the \nPresident's jobs bill which my good friend the majority leader has \npreviously introduced and I gather by way of introduction supports, \nthat we honor the request of the President of the United States to vote \non it now. He has been asking us repeatedly over the last few weeks to \nvote on it now. If my friend the majority leader is saying he doesn't \nwant to honor the President's request and vote on it now but would like \nto consider voting on it later, that is something he and I can discuss \nas we decide how to move forward with Senate business.\n  But I think the President of the United States, whose policies I, \ngenerally speaking, do not support--although I am happy to support his \ninitiatives on trade, be they ever so late--is entitled to know where \nthe Senate stands on his proposal that he has been out talking about \nover and over in the last few weeks, suggesting that we are unwilling \nto vote on it.\n\n  What I am saying is, we don't agree that it is the right policy, but \nwe are more than willing to vote on it. What I hear my friend the \nmajority leader saying is that even though he supports it, he wants to \nvote on it some other time. Well, the President has been saying he \ndoesn't want to vote on it some other time, he wants to vote on it now.\n  If my friend is saying we are not going to vote on it now, I would be \nhappy to talk to him and reach an understanding to vote on it later. \nBut my feeling here is that the least we can do for the President is \ngive him a chance to have a vote on his proposal now, as he has \nrequested on numerous occasions. So I will object to the modification, \nunderstanding full well the majority leader and I, off the floor, will \nhave further discussions about when we might move to the President's \nbill and give him the vote he has been requesting.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, further reserving my right to object, there \nare 14 million people in this country who are out of work.\n  What a charade we have going on here. We are in the midst of some of \nthe most important legislation we have done this entire year--China \ncurrency manipulation--and we now have a proposal that is ridiculous on \nits face; that is, we vote with no debate on the President's jobs bill. \nThis is senseless. It is unfair to bring this up in this form. We are \ngoing to get to this, and we are going to do it either as soon as we \nfinish this China currency or after we finish the trade bills, whatever \nI can work out with my Republican colleague so that I can move to it. \nIt takes 60 votes to get to this legislation.\n  The American people, I am sure, can see through this very clearly, \nthat this is nothing more than a political stunt. It is clear we need a \nfull debate on this--we don't need a filibuster--and that time will \ncome very soon, so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may elaborate further, we have had \na request from the President on multiple occasions to vote on what he \ncalls his jobs bill and to vote on it now. Just to count again, 1, 2, \n3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11--12 times the President has asked us, over \nthe last few weeks, to vote on what he calls his jobs bill now. I don't \nthink the President is saying he wants an extensive debate about it; I \nthink he is saying he wants a vote on it. I wanted to disabuse him of \nthe notion that somehow we are unwilling to vote on his proposal. We \nare more than happy to vote on it.\n  I understand why my friend the majority leader may have some \nreservations about going forward. I have read a number of critiques of \nthis legislation by Democratic Senators, one part of it or another. But \neven though there is bipartisan opposition to the President's jobs \nproposal, I think he is entitled to a vote. So I am sorry it appears we \nwill not be able to achieve this vote the President has repetitiously \nasked for over the last few weeks. I would like to give him that vote, \nand we will be talking to the majority leader about when we might have \nan opportunity to vote on his proposal, the President's proposal which \nthe majority leader introduced, which he has been requesting us to vote \non.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the President introduced his jobs bill. \nImmediately, the Republicans continue their obstruction on issues very \nsimple but maintain the floor. There are things going on here. You just \ncan't automatically move to legislation. We know the Senate procedure \ntakes 60 votes to get on a piece of legislation.\n  The President was calling upon Congress, and especially the \nRepublicans in Congress, to allow his jobs bill to move forward. As I \nindicated, we were hung up here on issues that had very little to do \nwith the jobs bill. In fact, we should not have been doing it. All the \ntime, I repeat, we have been hung up on FEMA funding, on the continuing \nresolution, which should have been approved quickly because we agreed \nto that last July, but they reneged on that even, and threatened to \nshut down the government unless FEMA was paid for the way they wanted. \nWe were able ultimately to win that debate, but it took a long time.\n\n  So when the President said he wants to move to his legislation right \naway, he was absolutely candid and forthright. He wanted to clear the \nunimportant things off the floor--the stalling tactics on the floor--\nand move to his bill, and that is what we are going to do.\n  What I would be willing to do, if my friend would be agreeable--would \nthe Republican leader agree to a vote on the motion to proceed to the \njobs bill? We could do that. We could interrupt this legislation right \nhere. We could interrupt the trade bills. We could vote on a motion to \nproceed to the jobs bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is my friend propounding a consent \nagreement or simply asking a question?\n\n[[Page S6071]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I think if the Republican leader is interested in the \nsubject, I could put it in proper form, but we get the point. To get it \non the floor, it needs 60 votes. I would be happy to, if the Republican \nleader would agree to a vote on a motion to proceed to the jobs bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say to my good friend, I am \nprepared to vote on the President's proposal today. If the majority \nleader wants to vote on it some other day, we can talk about that, \nabout how to move forward with it. But the President has been \nrepeatedly asking us to take it up and vote on it now, and I am \nprepared to do that. With regard to taking it up some other time and \nvoting on it some other day, we will be happy to talk about that off \nthe floor, as we do frequently on every issue we deal with.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sure that in the immediate future--\nright away--the American people will see, once again, the Republicans \nare filibustering measures they shouldn't be filibustering--this time, \nthe jobs bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would just add in closing, I think my \ngood friend's problem--and I sympathize with him--is that there is \nbipartisan opposition to the President's proposal.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I heard my friend say that, and I didn't \nwant to get into a long dissertation about bipartisan opposition. There \nare 53 of us. A majority of Democrats will support the President's jobs \nbill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The majority leader just confirmed what I was saying, \nwhich is that there is bipartisan opposition to this, and we will \ndiscuss at what point the majority leader is comfortable with going \nforward with this proposal. My only reason for offering it today was to \nrespond to the President's request that we vote on it, and we are \nprepared to do that. If we can't do it today, we will be happy to \ndiscuss, as we always do, the agenda of the Senate and when it would be \nappropriate to vote on it some other time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know I only have in my head the math I \nlearned from Mrs. Picker at Searchlight Elementary School. But I do \nknow, when we have 53--and I have told everyone here we will get a \nmajority of the Senate--a majority of the Senate, not a majority of the \nDemocrats, a majority of the Senate--that is not very bipartisan \nopposition to this bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I can only quote my good friend the \nmajority leader who repeatedly has said, most recently in early 2007, \nthat in the Senate it has always been the case we need 60 votes. This \nis my good friend the majority leader when he was the leader of this \nmajority in March of 2007, and he said it repeatedly both when he was \nin the minority as leader of the minority or leader of the majority, \nthat it requires 60 votes certainly on measures that are controversial.\n  So it is not at all unusual that the President's proposal of this \nconsequence, that would raise taxes, that would spend $\\1/2\\ trillion \nin a second stimulus bill, would have to achieve 60 votes. That is the \nway virtually all business is done in the Senate, certainly not \nextraordinarily unusual.\n  Mr. REID. The American people will see very soon that a majority of \nthe Senate supports the President's jobs bill.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes and that \nfollowing my remarks, Senator Barrasso be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes about an \namendment I introduced that, in my view, gets to the heart of some of \nthe more troubling Chinese trade policies that are threatening the \neconomic security and the long-term competitiveness of our country.\n  It is well known that many American companies operating in China are \nrequired to transfer their intellectual property and proprietary \ntechnology to China as a prerequisite for doing business in that \ncountry. I will repeat that they are required to transfer this \ntechnology. Despite assurances from the Chinese leadership earlier this \nyear that this was no longer ``official'' Chinese policy, China does \ncontinue to be aggressive and overt in its pursuit of foreign \nintellectual property as it seeks to develop its own, what it calls \nindigenous innovation. Companies such as General Electric and \nWestinghouse, among many others, have been required to transfer \nproprietary technology to Chinese counterparts in order to do business \nthere.\n  If a private company has developed technology on its own and it makes \na business decision to transfer that technology to a joint venture \npartner in a place such as China, unless there are national security \nissues, we are obligated to respect the free marketplace. They may be \nseeking short-term profits at the expense of long-term competitiveness, \nbut that is a business decision. But it is a different case when the \nAmerican taxpayer has financed the development of these technologies \nthrough Federal funding assistance, and I do not believe it is \nappropriate to allow those technologies simply to be given away to \nother countries.\n  Every American owns a piece of intellectual property that has been \nfinanced through taxpayer assistance. Federal dollars that go to R \nfunding, loan guarantees, and public-private partnerships in order to \nhelp develop the next generation of technologies here are supposed to \nbe making American businesses competitive and generating American jobs, \nnot helping develop other industries such as those in China. My \namendment would prohibit that practice.\n  Last year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce issued a report entitled \n``China's Drive for Indigenous Innovation.'' The Chamber noted that \nChina's master plan for the development of science and technology ``is \nconsidered by many international technology companies to be a blueprint \nfor technology theft on a scale the world has never seen before.''\n  The report went on to state that China's ``persistent'' intellectual \nproperty theft is ``compounded by the indigenous innovation industrial \npolicies which compel technology transfers in order to have access to \nthe China market.''\n\n  The New York Times recently reported that Ford Motor Company is \nlooking to share proprietary technologies for electric vehicles in \nexchange for selling cars in China. The electric vehicle sector has \nbeen developed through Federal R funding, loan guarantees, and \npublic-private partnerships--costs borne by American taxpayers. In \n2009, for instance, Ford Motor Company received a $5.9 billion loan \nguarantee from the Department of Energy to advance its vehicle \ntechnology manufacturing program.\n  We see these types of transfers in other industries as well. The \nWashington Post reported last month that General Electric has \ntransferred valuable aviation avionics technology to state-owned \nAviation Industry Corporation of China. Our government has long \nsupported the aviation industry through procurement initiatives and \nFederal research projects. The fruits of American taxpayer support will \nnow be incorporated into Chinese commercial airliners, in line with \nChina's desire to develop an internationally competitive aircraft \nindustry that could rival American-based Boeing.\n  We see similar examples of technology transfer in the nuclear energy \nsector. According to the Financial Times, Westinghouse Electric has \ntransferred more than 75,000 documents to Chinese counterparts as the \ninitial phase of a technology transfer program in exchange for a share \nof China's growing nuclear market. These documents relate to the \nconstruction of four third-generation AP1000 reactors that Westinghouse \nis building in China.\n  American taxpayers supported the development of the AP1000 as well as \nits predecessor, the AP600, through decades of nuclear energy research \nand development at the Department of Energy. In other words, our \ntaxpayers provided years of government support for the design and \nlicensing of this reactor.\n  In a January 2010 letter to Obama administration officials, the heads \nof 19\n\n[[Page S6072]]\n\nAmerican business and industry associations wrote of ``[s]ystemic \nefforts by China to develop policies that build their domestic \nenterprises at the expense of U.S. firms and U.S. intellectual \nproperty.'' Signatories to that letter included the Business \nRoundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 26, 2010.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Secretary of State.\n     Hon. Timothy Geithner,\n     Secretary of the Treasury.\n     Hon. Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n     Attorney General.\n     Hon. Gary F. Locke,\n     Secretary of Commerce.\n     Hon. Ron Kirk,\n     U.S. Trade Representative.\n       Dear Secretary Clinton, Secretary Geithner, Attorney \n     General Holder, Secretary Locke and Ambassador Kirk: We seek \n     your urgent attention to policy developments in China that \n     pose an immediate danger to U.S. companies. The Chinese \n     government has promulgated a series of ``indigenous \n     innovation'' programs as part of a long-term plan that \n     threaten to exclude a wide array of U.S. firms from a market \n     that is vital to their future growth and ability to create \n     jobs here at home. Given the far-reaching impact of these \n     policies on the American economy, we urge you to make this a \n     strategic priority in our bilateral economic engagement with \n     China.\n       For several years, the Chinese government has been \n     implementing indigenous innovation policies aimed at carving \n     out markets for national champions and increasing the locally \n     owned and developed intellectual property of innovative \n     products. We are increasingly alarmed by the means China is \n     using to achieve these goals.\n       Of most immediate concern are new rules issued by the \n     Chinese government in November to establish a national \n     catalogue of products to receive significant preferences for \n     government procurement. Among the criteria for eligibility \n     for the catalogue is that the products contain intellectual \n     property that is developed and owned in China and that any \n     associated trademarks are originally registered in China. \n     This represents an unprecedented use of domestic intellectual \n     property as a market-access condition and makes it nearly \n     impossible for the products of American companies to qualify \n     unless they are prepared to establish Chinese brands and \n     transfer their research and development of new products to \n     China.\n       This directive targets some of our most innovative and \n     competitive manufacturing and service industries, including \n     computers, software, telecommunications and green technology. \n     Once this system is in place, it is expected to be expanded \n     to other industries. The November directive was followed in \n     late December by the announcement that the government would \n     develop a broader catalogue of indigenous innovation products \n     and sectors to be afforded preferences beyond government \n     procurement (i.e., including subsidies and other preferential \n     treatment). The December announcement, which was issued by \n     four Chinese agencies including the State Owned Assets \n     Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), also \n     raises the specter of China subtly encouraging its many \n     state-owned enterprises to discriminate against foreign \n     companies in the context of procurement, including for \n     commercial purposes.\n       These particular programs are part of a broader set of \n     government policy initiatives covering, for example, patents \n     and standards, competition policy, encryption and tax, the \n     effect of which is creating barriers to competition in the \n     Chinese market for our most innovative companies.\n       They also run counter to repeated pledges by the Chinese \n     government to avoid protectionism, including the joint \n     commitment of President Hu and President Obama at their \n     recent summit in November to pursue open trade and \n     investment. Moreover, they do not provide a constructive \n     framework for a positive, cooperative and mutually beneficial \n     relationship.\n       U.S. economic growth relies in significant measure on \n     access to key international markets. China is the world's \n     third largest economy and represents a major potential growth \n     market for the United States. A healthy U.S.-China bilateral \n     relationship requires an expanding economic relationship \n     based on mutual openness. Systematic efforts by China to \n     develop policies that build their domestic enterprises at the \n     expense of U.S. firms and U.S. intellectual property is not a \n     framework for a positive and cooperative relationship. \n     Additionally, we are further concerned that such policies, if \n     left unchallenged, will be pursued by other important trading \n     partners, compounding the impact on the U.S. economy.\n       We respectfully request that your agencies make this issue \n     in particular a strategic priority in your bilateral economic \n     engagement with China; develop, in consultation with the \n     business community and like-minded foreign governments, a \n     strong, fully coordinated response to the Chinese government; \n     and raise this issue with your Chinese counterparts in all \n     appropriate multilateral and bilateral meetings and forums.\n           With best regards,\n         Stephen J.

It is intended to \nprotect American innovation and American jobs, and it is intended to \nmake America more competitive and to create jobs here at home. In cases \nwhere technologies are developed with the support of the American \ntaxpayer, my legislation prohibits companies from transferring the \ntechnology to countries that by law, practice or policy, require \nproprietary technology transfers as a matter of doing business.\n  Specifically, it says: A country which, by law, practice or policy, \nis required to transfer proprietary technology or intellectual property \nas a condition of doing business in that country will not be the \nrecipient of any of these technologies that were developed with the \nassistance of the American taxpayer.\n  Quite simply, if taxpayers supported the development of the \ntechnology, they own a piece of it, and it can't just be given away. \nThe transfer of publicly supported proprietary technologies by American \nfirms to China, and potentially other countries, clearly and \nunequivocally places the competitive advantage of the American economy \nat risk.\n  Our trade laws are designed in order to protect national security, \nbut our economic security is also an element of our national \nsecurity. Intellectual property in the civilian sector should also be \nprotected. My amendment seeks to do that.\n\n  I believe this is an issue every Senator can support.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I have \nrepeatedly since the health care bill was signed into law, to offer a \ndoctor's second opinion about issues related to that health care law.\n  A group of House and Senate Republican lawmakers, including Senator \nThune of South Dakota, released a startling new report about the \nPresident's health care law. The report is entitled ``CLASS' Untold \nStory: Taxpayers, Employers, and States on the Hook for Flawed \nEntitlement Program.'' I commend this report to my colleagues.\n  Many may remember that President Obama's health care law established \na brandnew, Federal long-term care entitlement program. It is called \nthe CLASS Program, the Community Living Assistance Services and \nSupports Program.\n  This CLASS Program pays a stipend to individuals enrolled when they \nare unable to perform daily living activities--dressing, bathing, \neating. To qualify for the benefits, an individual would have to pay a \nmonthly premium for 5 years--pay a monthly premium for 5 years--before \nthe Federal Government starts to pay out any of the benefits.\n  The health care law mandates that the CLASS Program collect \nindividual\n\n[[Page S6073]]\n\npremiums for those 5 years before the program actually even starts to \npay out benefits.\n  It sounds pretty good but not so fast. When it comes to the health \ncare law, the American people have come to realize that if it sounds \ntoo good to be true, it probably is.\n  The CLASS Program was supposed to start January 1, 2011--10 months \nago. But the Obama administration's officials decided to delay the \nprogram because they know it does not work. It is now known that the \nCLASS Program was an intentionally designed budget gimmick--that is \ncorrect: an intentionally designed budget gimmick.\n  During Senate floor debate of the President's health care bill, I, \nalong with many other Members of this side of the aisle, warned \nrepeatedly--repeatedly--that the CLASS Program is a financial disaster \nwaiting to happen.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated the CLASS Program would \nreduce the deficit by $70 billion over a 10-year period. These savings \nare mythical, and they come from the premium dollars CLASS collects \nthose first 5 years, before it pays out a single penny.\n  During those first 5 years, the program is not required to pay out \nany benefits to any individuals. Over its first 10 years, the \nCongressional Budget Office says this CLASS Program will collect $83 \nbillion in premiums and only pay out $13 billion in benefits.\n  But instead of holding on to the $70 billion in excess premiums \ncollected to pay for future expenses we know are coming, Members of the \nSenate--Members on the other side of the aisle--used those same funds \nto pay for President Obama's health care law.\n  To add insult to injury, Washington Democrats then tried to claim \nthat the $70 billion could also be used to pay down the deficit.\n  The American people immediately saw this claim was irresponsible. \nEven the Senate Budget Committee chairman, Senator Kent Conrad from \nNorth Dakota, admitted the CLASS Program was ``a Ponzi scheme of the \nfirst order--something Bernie Madoff would be proud of.'' Yet the \nPresident and Washington Democrats pushed to include this CLASS Program \nin the health care law.\n  This new report provides undeniable evidence that administration \nofficials knew the CLASS Program's design and payment structure were \nfiscally unsustainable. The Obama administration knew it. Yet they \nrepeatedly ignored the explicit and persistent warnings.\n  One might ask: Why is that? The only logical explanation is, \nadministration officials chose to hide the CLASS Program's true cost \nfrom congressional lawmakers and the American people--all to advance \nPresident Obama's ideological health care agenda.\n  This push to advance an agenda, rather than reasonable patient-\ncentered health care reforms, served only to create yet another \nunsustainable entitlement program, an entitlement program this country \nsimply cannot afford. The Obama administration's own Chief Actuary, a \nman named Richard Foster, repeatedly tried to tell administration \nofficials that the CLASS Program was not fiscally sound. Internal e-\nmails from Mr. Foster first warned administration officials in May of \n2009--well before the health care law was enacted.\n  According to that report, Mr. Foster's e-mail says:\n\n       The program is intended to be ``actuarially sound'', but at \n     first glance this goal may be impossible. Due to the limited \n     scope of the insurance coverage, the voluntary CLASS plan \n     would probably not attract many participants other than \n     individuals who already meet the criteria to qualify as \n     beneficiaries.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       While the 5-year ``vesting period'' would allow the fund to \n     accumulate a modest level of assets, all such assets could be \n     used just to meet benefit payments due in the first few \n     months of the 6th year.\n\n  Then, a key sentence:\n\n       The resulting substantial premium increases required to \n     prevent fund exhaustion would likely reduce the number of \n     participants, and a classic ``assessment spiral'' or \n     ``insurance death spiral'' would ensue.\n\n  What does this mean in plain English? It means the CLASS premiums \nwill be too expensive to persuade young, healthy people to participate. \nIt means the CLASS plan's long-term care payout is very enticing to \npeople who know they are going to need the care; healthy people do not \nparticipate, sicker people do participate. Individuals in the health \ncare system call this phenomenon adverse selection. When adverse \nselection occurs, the American taxpayer is at very serious risk of \nbeing forced to bail out the program when it fails.\n  The report goes on to show that Mr. Foster repeated his concerns \nduring the summer of 2009. He writes to another administration \nofficial:\n\n       I'm sorry to report that I remain very doubtful that this \n     proposal is sustainable at the specified premium and benefit \n     amounts.\n\n  He says:\n\n       Thirty-six years of actuarial experience lead me to believe \n     that this program would collapse in short order and require \n     significant federal subsidies to continue.\n\n  Let me remind everyone that the Chief Actuary is a nonpartisan, high-\nranking official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \nThe Chief Actuary's estimates are critical to understand the health \ncare law's true fiscal impact and long-term viability.\n\n  Mr. Foster certainly does not have an ax to grind. He simply offered \nhis analysis based on the data, and the Obama administration ignored \nit. Not only did Obama administration officials ignore Mr. Foster, they \nstopped requesting his input. But Mr. Foster was not alone.\n  In the fall of 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services' \nOffice of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation also \nraised the red flag. According to the report, one employee wrote in an \ne-mail on October 22:\n\n       Seems like a recipe for disaster to me. . . . I can't \n     imagine that CLASS would not have high levels of adverse \n     selection given the significantly higher premiums compared to \n     similar policies in the private market.\n\n  Just a week after Senator Thune released this stunning new report on \nthe floor of the Senate, media outlets indicated that the Department of \nHealth and Human Services has closed its CLASS Program. Mr. Bob Yee, \nthe CLASS Chief Actuary, announced the closure in an e-mail. He went on \nto say he would leave his position as the CLASS office Actuary \neffective immediately. News reports indicated the CLASS office's \nemployees have either been reassigned or asked to leave.\n  Mysteriously, however, the Department of Health and Human Services \nissued a statement denying the office was officially closing. In fact, \nthe statement failed to say if and when the CLASS Program would even \nstart. The Obama administration has had 18 months to figure out how to \nimplement this CLASS Program. Recent developments show they are not \neven close to resolving questions about the program's solvency.\n  The American people deserve more. The American people deserve the \ntruth. The evidence is indisputable. Administration officials at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services knew the CLASS Program was \nunsustainable, and they knew it before President Obama signed the \nhealth care bill into law. They knew it. Yet this Senate and the House \nof Representatives and the administration failed in their duty to be \nhonest with the American people and to tell them the truth.\n  Were administration officials deliberately hiding CLASS's true cost \nfor political gain? This is certainly not the first time during the \nlast several weeks that we have seen troubling reports exposing the \nadministration's tendency to ignore financial warnings. They ignore the \nwarnings so they can advance politically important projects to them--\nprojects that turn into expensive failures, with the American taxpayers \nbeing stuck with the bill.\n  I see this report, this incredible study, as yet one more piece of \nevidence that the President's health care law must be repealed. It must \nbe repealed and replaced with reasonable, commonsense, and financially \nsound alternatives: patient-centered reforms that allow individuals to \nget the care they need, from the doctor they want, at a price they can \nafford.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 680 that \nwe have filed. I am concerned that the bill before us will have only \nmarginal effects on China's manipulation of its currency. My amendment \noffers a different approach, one which I believe\n\n[[Page S6074]]\n\nwill be more effective over the long term.\n  Let me first say, I strongly agree with the sponsors of this bill \nabout the need to send a strong signal to China, and other currency \nmanipulators as well, that massive intervention in the currency markets \nto gain trade advantage will no longer be tolerated. For the \ninternational economic system to work, every country, including China, \nneeds to play by the rules.\n  Similarly to many of my colleagues, my frustrations with China's \ntrade and economic practices go far beyond currency manipulation. For \nexample, China's failure to protect intellectual property rights, \nChina's industrial policies, their limitations on American investment, \nand their unfair support and subsidization of State-owned and State-\nassisted enterprises are all very serious problems we need to address.\n  So while today we are focusing on currency manipulation, I look \nforward to working with Senator Baucus to examine potential solutions \nto these problems through Finance Committee hearings on China, which I \nhope we will hold soon.\n  The sponsors of this bill assure us that their approach is WTO \nconsistent and will not result in a trade war with one of our largest \ntrading partners. Given the importance of these questions, I wrote \nSecretary Geithner and Ambassador Kirk to request the administration's \nviews. While they assured us they are reviewing the bill, to date, they \nhave not publicly weighed in one way or the other. It seems to me they \nneed to weigh in. Given that they know the Senate is debating the \nlegislation this week, I think this is very unfortunate. If the \nadministration is going to have any impact on this debate, I would urge \nthem to comment soon.\n  Even though I have supported similar legislation in the past, I have \ncontinuing reservations about this approach. Fundamentally, we must \nremain focused on one question: Will this legislation actually solve \nthe currency problem with China? After careful consideration, I have \ncome to the conclusion it will not. While well-intentioned, the bill is \ntoo focused on unilateral remedial actions. As a result, I fear the \nbill will only have a marginal effect on China's practices, while at \nthe same time potentially targeting many U.S. exporters for trade \nretaliation by China.\n  For example, the Congressional Budget Office scored this bill as \ngenerating $61 million in revenue over 10 years. To put this in \ncontext, in 2010 alone, the United States imported almost $365 billion \nof goods from China. Given the scope of the problem, I find it \ndifficult to believe that unilaterally imposing an additional $6 \nmillion in antidumping and countervailing duties a year on Chinese \nimports will compel China to change its currency policies or have any \nmeaningful impact on our trade deficit with China.\n  Many of the other remedial provisions in this bill require the U.S. \nGovernment to take other unilateral actions against China, many of \nwhich may actually harm U.S. exporters directly or expose them to \npotential retaliation by the Chinese. To succeed over the long term, I \nthink we must go in a different direction.\n  My amendment does just that. My amendment strikes the unilateral \nprovisions while retaining the core of the bill that actually advances \nour shared goal of combating Chinese currency practices. I agree with \nmy colleagues that the exchange rates and International Economic Policy \nCoordination Act of 1988 is simply not working. Administration after \nadministration refuses to exercise its authority and deem China a \ncurrency manipulator. This is enormously frustrating to all of us, \nespecially since candidate Obama campaigned against China's current \ncurrency practices, and after being elected had his own Treasury \nSecretary testify before Congress that China is, in fact, manipulating \nits currency. Yet they refuse to act.\n  So I agree the Congress must tighten the criteria and establish a \nmore objective approach to identifying fundamentally misaligned \ncurrencies and designating fundamentally misaligned currencies for \npriority action.\n  I supported this goal in the past and continue to today. I also agree \nwe need to hold the Secretary of the Treasury and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative accountable. So I have retained the requirements under \nthis bill that they report to and testify before Congress on their \nprogress. But to succeed over the long term we need to adopt a \nfundamentally different approach.\n  We have had some success in the past. For example, during the Bush \nadministration, from 2005 to 2008, negotiations pushed China to \nappreciate its currency by 20 percent. Unfortunately, the Obama \nadministration has had no such success.\n  My amendment builds on this successful model but also takes it a step \nfurther. First, my amendment directs the Secretary of the Treasury and \nthe U.S. Trade Representative to initiate negotiations in the World \nTrade Organization and the International Monetary Fund to develop \neffective remedial rules and actions that will mitigate the adverse \ntrade and economic effects of fundamentally misaligned currencies \ndesignated for priority action under this bill, and that will encourage \npriority action countries to adopt appropriate policies to eliminate \nthe fundamental misalignment of their currencies.\n  The WTO and the IMF were designed to handle complex issues like \ncurrency, so we should start there and work with our allies to devise \nlong-term and effective solutions. Working with like-minded countries, \nwe should be able to agree that when individual members advance their \nnationalistic interests so aggressively through currency manipulation \nthat they threaten the whole global economy and their own long-term \ninterests, and their actions need to be addressed.\n  Many of my colleagues may argue that negotiations in the WTO and IMF \nwill not work. My amendment addresses that potential problem in its \nsecond section. It provides that if the Secretary of the Treasury and \nthe U.S. Trade Representative cannot make progress to effectively \nmitigate the adverse effects of fundamentally misaligned currencies \nwithin the WTO and the IMF within 90 days, then the administration \nshall enter into plurilateral negotiations outside of the WTO and IMF \nto develop agreements with our friends and allies who are also \ncommitted to open and fair currency policies.\n  These negotiations will need to develop mechanisms to mitigate the \nadverse effects of priority action country currency policies, and to \nencourage those priority action countries to abandon their \ninterventions into their currencies.\n  We have seen multilateral approaches work in the past in combating \nsome of China's unfair trade and economic practices. For example, China \nchanged course on both its aggressive indigenous innovation policies \nand on efforts to hoard its rare earth materials primarily due to \nmultilateral pressure against the Chinese. These important issues have \nnot been solved and require additional efforts.\n  But by working with our friends and our allies, we effectively \nconvinced the Chinese Government to take a more constructive approach. \nLet's build on the successes we have witnessed in recent years. Let's \nwork together to counter, in a systematic and comprehensive way, the \nefforts of those priority action countries that derive trade advances \nthrough current policy.\n  To be clear, I am not suggesting that the United States violate any \nof its international obligations. That point is made clear in the \namendment. But I am suggesting that the solution to the currency \nproblem cannot be achieved unilaterally, and our negotiators must reach \nout to our allies to aggressively counter the behavior of China and \nothers. So far the administration has failed to lead on the currency \nissue. My amendment requires that they do so.\n  The third section of my amendment helps maintain pressure on the \nadministration to take concrete action. It requires the Treasury \nDepartment and the USTR to report to Congress every 180 days following \nenactment of this bill. In these reports the administration must \nidentify: one, the countries with which the United States is conducting \nnegotiations to mitigate the adverse effects of priority action \ncurrencies, and in what international fora or negotiating \nconfigurations those negotiations are taking place; two, the remedial \nrules and actions under discussion in those negotiations; three, any \nremedial rules that have been adopted and any remedial actions that\n\n[[Page S6075]]\n\nhave been taken pursuant to those negotiations; and, four, what, if \nany, additional authority the Secretary or the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative needs from Congress to conduct these negotiations and to \neffectively mitigate the adverse trade and economic effects of \nfundamentally misaligned currencies or to implement coordinated actions \nwith other countries.\n  Finally, my amendment sets up a process to immediately take advantage \nof ongoing international trade negotiations by establishing a new \npriority negotiating objective of the United States for ongoing and \nfuture trade agreements. This new objective requires that each party \nagree to not fundamentally misalign its currency in a manner that would \nresult in a priority action designation and agree to work together to \nmitigate the adverse trade and economic effects of fundamentally \nmisaligned currency by non-parties such as China.\n  For example, if the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations are to \ntackle 21st-century trade and investment issues, as the USTR continues \nto promise, I think this plurilateral negotiation would be a great \nplace to start to address the challenges of fundamentally misaligned \ncurrencies. Working with this group of like-minded countries, we should \nbe able to agree amongst all nine parties that no party will \nfundamentally misalign its currency.\n  We should also be able to agree to work together to counter the \nactions of other countries whose interventions in currency markets \ndestabilize the global economy. We have seen multilateral engagement \nwork in other areas. If we are truly going to solve this currency \nproblem, we need to look at what other efforts have actually produced \nsome results in moving the Chinese off a mercantilist policy course and \nimprove the conditions for American businesses and workers competing \nagainst the Chinese.\n  We can all agree that China's massive interventions in its financial \nsector and currency have disrupted global trade and that its efforts to \nbenefit China at the expense of others has harmed many countries and \nworkers, including many in our own United States. But I believe rather \nthan merely sending a message to China, we must try and find real, \nlong-term solutions and empower and direct our negotiators to reach out \nto our friends and allies around the world and finally solve the \nproblem.\n  If existing institutions are not working, we must modify them. If \nthat is not possible, we must look to create new effective \ninternational agreements. The challenge that China's currency \ninterventions present are not just to the United States but to the \ninternational economic community. We, the Congress, must demand that \nthe administration launch these critical negotiations so we can avert \nfurther damage by currency policies of countries like China.\n  So I call on my colleagues to join me and to not just send a message \nbut to take actions that could, in fact, produce results. In the end, \nChina itself, as well as its neighbors and trading partners, will \nbenefit from a more open, transparent, and fairly exchanged currency \nregime. What is at stake is far more than making a statement. We need \nto actually alter the international agreements and the rules of the \ngame to address the problems of today and tomorrow.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment when it comes up. I \nhope we can get it up once we come to the final agreement on how to \nproceed on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, my main purpose is to address the China \ncurrency bill, particularly in regards to the remarks of Speaker \nBoehner and Chairman Bernanke. But there are two other points I wish to \nmake on previous speakers' comments. First, Senator Webb's amendment.\n  It is a very important amendment. What it says, of course, is that in \ncases where commercial technologies are developed with the support of \nU.S. taxpayers, it prohibits companies from transferring the technology \nto countries that force proprietary transfers as a condition of doing \nbusiness. We have seen this over and over.\n  China, which does not play fair up and down the line, basically gets \naway with economic murder. One of their techniques is to say to a big \nAmerican company: We will allow you to sell a ton of stuff to us. You \nwill make lots of money. But in return you must give us your \nproprietary technology--basically your family jewels.\n  It is outrageous, and in the long run it weakens America's ability to \ngrow and create jobs. The companies do this because in the 5- or 10-\nyear period in which they have signed the contract, they get a lot of \nrevenue. But it certainly hurts American workers, and it certainly \nhurts these companies in the long run. But the CEOs probably figure \nthey will be long gone before that money is made. So I want to support \nSenator Webb's amendment.\n  In regards to my good friend from Utah who proposed an alternative, I \nwould say this: We have tried for a decade to get multilateral action. \nThat involves getting China's acquiescence. It is not going to happen. \nMultilateral action--like saying to the Chinese: Please--has not \nworked. It will not work. Our legislation is much stronger. It can \npass. It got a large vote here this week. It has bipartisan support.\n  I know Speaker Boehner--I will talk about this in a minute--has said \nhe will not take up our bill. But there is going to be huge pressure \nfor him to do so, as I will elaborate later.\n  So to my good friend from Utah--and I have tremendous respect for \nhim, and I do not doubt for a minute his good intentions, his \nintegrity, his hard work and desire to see things happen. To say to the \nChinese: Please negotiate, is a strategy for weakness, is a strategy \nfor failure, and multilateral action will not succeed. The Chinese \nunderstand only one thing--I will yield in a brief moment to my \ncolleague for a question or a comment, whichever he prefers.\n  But the Chinese only understand one thing: being tough; telling them, \nif they do not discontinue these actions we are going to take action \nunilaterally on our own. I have been doing this for years. I can tell \nyou, China's policies get worse and worse and worse. As one of my \nconstituents said to me: Uncle Sam, when it comes to China, is Uncle \nSam.\n  To have a policy that involves large multilateral actions and says to \nthe Chinese: Come and negotiate with us, makes no sense at all.\n  I yield for a brief moment on my time to my colleague from Utah--for \na minute or so.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I appreciate that. My colleague has always been very \nfair and gracious to me. I feel the same way toward him. I understand \nhis deep feelings about this matter. I respect and appreciate them as \nwell. But I am not talking about necessarily negotiating with China \ndirectly, other than what we can do. I am talking about dealing with \nnations that literally are feeling the same way we do, and gradually \nmultiplying our effectiveness by working together--not just sending a \nmessage but getting the whole world to start saying: Yes, the United \nStates is right; yes, this group of nations is right. And we can do \nthat even outside of the international organizations that currently \nexist.\n  But I would like my colleague to look at that amendment and see--I \nthink he will see some real good in it. I think it will get us farther \ndown the pathway of doing what he knows needs to be done, and I know \nneeds to be done, without necessarily causing a major trade war.\n  So I just bring that up to my colleague for that purpose, respecting \nhim and what he is trying to do. I think this plural lateral approach I \nam talking about goes far beyond the IMF and some of the other \nworldwide organizations; it means really doing effective diplomatic \nwork to bring worldwide pressure to get people to live within certain \nmonetary constraints.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague, and I understand his good \nintentions and desire to get to the same place, which is to get China \nto behave fairly. I certainly will look at his bill.\n  I simply say this: Growing up in Brooklyn, we had to deal with a lot \nof bullies. The only time bullies give in is when you stand up to them. \nThe proposal my colleague has made does not stand up to China.\n  The nations of the world have made their opinions clear. Recently, \nBrazil did. China doesn't care. They will only\n\n[[Page S6076]]\n\ncare if there are sanctions, tough sanctions that give consequences to \ntheir unfair--and usually illegal by WTO standards--action.\n  Now I want to talk about Speaker Boehner's remarks and Ben Bernanke's \nremarks.\n  Last night was a milestone in the Senate. For years, the Government \nof China has been willfully breaking the rules of free trade without \nprovoking a formal response from the U.S. Government--until yesterday. \nThe full Senate for the first time went on record that it wanted to \nconsider formal action to confront China's currency manipulation. It \nwas a lopsided vote, a bipartisan majority of both parties, with 79 \nSenators in favor. We will spend the next few days debating the \nparticulars, but make no mistake about it, when it comes to China's \nunfair trade practices, there is a consensus to act in the Senate.\n  It can be hard at times here to get 79 votes to turn the lights on. \nWhen the majority leader and the minority leader vote together to move \nforward on a major jobs-boosting measure, we should not delay in moving \nforward. But then today, less than 24 hours after the Senate saw the \noverwhelming vote in favor of moving forward to finally confront China \nwith real action, the Speaker of the House of Representatives suggested \nhe would not take up the bill if it passes the Senate. He called it \ndangerous. The Speaker's argument is behind the times. The only thing \nthat would be dangerous would be to continue turning the other cheek \nwhile China mounts its assault on U.S. jobs, U.S. wealth, and U.S. \nmanufacturing. Up and down the line, they oppose fair practices. They \nare mercantilists, maximizing their wealth at the expense of American \nworkers, American companies, and American jobs.\n  Critics like the Speaker say the bill could start a trade war with \nChina. Well, I have news, Mr. President: We are already in a trade war \nwith China, and it is not going that well. American companies are \nfighting for survival in the United States and around the globe, \nbattling subsidized Chinese exports with a built-in price advantage of \n20 to 40 percent.\n  We cannot raise the white flag on American jobs, American wealth, and \nAmerican manufacturing. We can compete successfully against Chinese \ncompetition at home and in China and around the world but only--only--\nif we level the playing field. Our bill helps level that playing field.\n  There is already a trade war going on, I say to the Speaker. China is \ncheating to gain unfair advantage. It is about time we do something \nabout it. As Mr. Samuelson said in his article in the Washington Post, \nthe only thing worse than a trade war--and I believe that won't happen \nbecause China has more to lose in a trade war than we do, and if they \nare one thing, they are smart, and they won't cut off their nose to \nspite their face. They may take a few sanctions, but they won't create \na trade war. The only thing worse than even a trade war is continuing \nour present policies where, 5 and 10 years from now, America cannot get \nup off the ground because of unfair Chinese policies.\n  The House Speaker seems to want to sit out this fight. He seems to \nwant us to take a hands-off approach to China. He says, ``This is well \nbeyond what Congress should be doing.'' I am aghast at that notion, \nthat the Speaker says that fighting for American jobs against unfair \npractices China foists upon us is well beyond what Congress should be \ndoing. What should we be doing? There is nothing else Congress should \nbe doing except rising to defend American jobs.\n  If he doesn't believe these practices are unfair, he should just \nlisten--the Speaker should--to Chairman Bernanke. This is what he said \nthis morning:\n\n       The Chinese currency policy is blocking what might be a \n     more normal recovery process in the global economy. It is . . \n     . hurting the recovery.\n\n  He is the top economist in the land. It is hurting the recovery, I \nsay to the Speaker. That is what Ben Bernanke said. Does the Speaker \nreally think it is beyond what Congress should be doing--to confront \nsomething that is hurting the recovery, that everyone who studies it \nsays is unfair, that nobody has come up with a solution to? \nMultilateral negotiations? Give me a break. China won't budge. We know \nthat.\n  I find it ironic that the Speaker wants a hands-off approach on \nChina's unfair currency practices considering he, along with the rest \nof the Republican leadership in both the House and the Senate, just \nsent a letter a couple weeks ago seeking to meddle in U.S. currency \npolicies. Just 2 weeks ago, the Republican leadership in the House and \nSenate sent a letter to Chairman Bernanke trying to influence his \nhandling of monetary policies in a highly inappropriate way. It was \nnothing short of a breach of a protocol that has long been observed, \nwhich is that you don't put political pressure on the Federal Reserve \nbecause they need to handle monetary policy in an economic way, not a \npolitical way. A former Fed official called that attempt to politically \nmeddle in the Fed's independent policymaking outrageous. Politico wrote \nthat the letter was ``an audacious move against a central bank that \nprizes its political independence.'' A leading economist said that ``it \ncrosses a line that shouldn't be crossed.''\n  Let me get this straight. The Speaker and the House leadership feel \nit is OK to cross the line and try to strong-arm the Fed but it is not \nOK to have the will to stand up to China. This is totally inconsistent, \nand it is hard to figure out how you could do one thing one week and \nsay another the next week--unless, of course, the House leadership's \ngoal is to hold back our economic recovery. I fear to think that. I \nfear to think their goal is to make sure the economy is so bad that \nthey might do what our Republican leader said was his No. 1 goal: \nunseat President Obama. I shudder to think that the millions of \nAmerican households without jobs, with people looking and searching to \nfind a way to provide some dignity for their families, have to be \npolitical fodder for a goal to hold the economy back. I don't want to \nembrace that conclusion, but it is hard to see another explanation for, \non the one hand, trying to twist the arm of the Fed when it comes to \nU.S. monetary policy but when it comes to fighting back against China, \nto say: Hands off. That is totally inconsistent.\n\n  I also find the Speaker's position on this China currency measure \nstrange because if he blocks this measure, he is effectively thwarting \nthe will of his own Members in the House, where there are 225 \ncosponsors--61 Republicans at last count--for a measure similar to the \none being debated in the Senate right now. It is clear there is a \nconsensus in the House very similar to the one here in the Senate. So I \nurge the Speaker to heed his own Chamber and put this bill on the \nfloor. Don't thwart your own Members who want to support this measure. \nGive it an up-or-down vote. Even if the leadership doesn't want to vote \nfor it, they should at least allow the will of the House to go forward. \nThey should not suppress the collective will of their Chamber because \nat the end of the day you have to ask yourself which side you are on.\n  Two major candidates for President on the Republican side support \nthis legislation. John Huntsman, who just got back from China--hardly \nknown as a radical--said he would sign this bill. I haven't talked to \nhim, but I can tell you, having worked on this issue for 6 years, I am \nsure that former Ambassador Huntsman is totally frustrated with the \nChinese, and he knows that, unfortunately, the legislation introduced \nby his fellow Utahan doesn't address it and that the Chinese don't \nreact when you ask nicely. They don't react when you ask, period. They \nonly react when there are consequences that are harmful to them if they \ncontinue the unfair, anti-free-trade policy.\n  For some inexplicable reason, the Republican leadership in the House \nis siding with the Chinese Government. This is not the time to go soft \non China. The top economist in the country tells us China is holding \nback the recovery. Many other economists say that China, in its \ncurrency policies, is thwarting and distorting world trade. I have seen \nsome list it as one of the causes for the international recession we \nhave. We know--we know--it costs America in jobs.\n  I want to relate what I did yesterday. Just one company in upstate \nNew York--and I remind some of the editorial writers and pundits who \nsay this will just move jobs from China to Bangladesh, that they are 5 \nyears behind\n\n[[Page S6077]]\n\nthe times. We are not talking about jobs that are in labor-intensive \nindustries such as toys, clothing, or furniture. Those are gone, and \nthey are not coming back. They are talking about top-end, middle-size, \nand smaller size American manufacturers and producers who have to fight \nwith one hand tied behind their back because of Chinese currency.\n  This company, which makes a ceramic that is put in generators, \nelectric generators, prevents pollution. They have a great ceramic \ntool. They are doing fine. But a few years ago, China stole it; they \njust took it. The head of the company told me he didn't mind because \nhis growth was so large just from selling these in the United States \nand Europe that if China wanted to sell them in China, where they are \nbuilding lots of powerplants, so be it. But now China is not only \nproducing them for consumption in China--his product--it is producing \nthem to export to America, and this gentleman said he cannot compete \nwith them head to head. But when China gets a built-in 30 percent \nadvantage on intellectual property that they stole, how is he going to \nsurvive?\n  That story can be repeated over and over. Of course China is holding \nback our recovery. Of course China's policies lose us millions of \nAmerican jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars of American wealth. \nAnd finally this body, in a strictly bipartisan way, with five lead \nRepublicans and five lead Democrats as cosponsors--and we have \ncriticized both Presidents Bush and Obama for their failure to act--\nthis body gets some resolve, and the Speaker says no.\n  Do you know what, I don't believe his ``no'' is going to stand. This \nis an issue the American people know has to happen. This is something \nthey care about--Democrats and Republicans. Look at the polling. There \nis no partisan divide; it includes both liberals and conservatives. You \ndon't have to have a Ph.D. in economics to know that China is cheating \nus and playing unfairly with us.\n  I believe the pressure from Members on both sides of the aisle in the \nother body and, more importantly, from the American people and \nmanufacturers all over the country could work, could get the Speaker to \nreconsider his view. And I plead, pray, and hope that it does because \nthere is no greater step we can take to restore jobs in America than to \npass this important bill, get it enacted into law, and see, for once, \nour top-notch American companies be able to compete evenly--a fair \nfight--with Chinese manufacturers.\n\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      EPA Inspector General Report\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wanted to come to the floor today \nbecause 2 days ago I got the results of an inspector general's report \nthat I requested 18 months ago having to do with the endangerment \nfinding of the EPA. While it is a little bit complicated, I will go \nback and put this in perspective.\n  Back in the 1990s, we were asked by the then-Clinton administration \nto ratify a treaty called the Kyoto treaty. This was a treaty that was \naimed at the reduction of greenhouse gases--anthropogenic gases and \nthis type of thing. Well, it didn't pass. It went down 95 to 0 because \nof two reasons: We all declared in this body we weren't going to ratify \nany treaty that, No. 1, was damaging economically to the country; and, \nNo. 2, we would treat developing countries differently than developed \nnations. Of course this missed on both those criteria.\n  After that happened, it became popular by some of the more radical \nenvironmentalist groups who enjoy the overregulation we have so much of \nin this country to seek the introduction of different bills. We had the \nMcCain-Lieberman bill of 2003 and again in 2005. We had the Warner-\nLieberman bill and several others--the Sanders-Boxer bill--and then, I \nguess, the last one was a House bill called the Waxman-Markey bill.\n  Anyway, these bills were all aimed at what we can do in this country \nin order to restrict our use of CO2. Obviously--and there is \nno disagreement on this--if we in the United States unilaterally reduce \nour CO2, it will not affect the CO2 emissions \nworldwide because this isn't where the problem lies.\n  Even when I asked Lisa Jackson, the Obama-appointed Administrator at \nthe EPA, for whom I have a great deal of respect, if we were to pass \nany of these bills I just mentioned--that would have the effect of the \nKyoto treaty but only on the United States in reducing anthropogenic \ngases--would this have the effect of reducing CO2 emissions, \nshe said, no, because, as I pointed out, this would only affect the \nUnited States.\n  I would take the argument one step further and say it would have the \neffect of increasing, not decreasing, emissions because, as our \nmanufacturing base has to find power to generate itself, they have to \ngo where that is. Anyway, I only wanted to bring that up because that \neffort is still going on today.\n  With all these bills that have been before us--and at the time of \nmost of them the Republicans were in the majority and I was the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee which had \njurisdiction over this subject--I was the one who stood on the floor of \nthe Senate to defeat these bills, and it became easier as each bill \ncame along because people recognized that while the science is in \nquestion, the economics are not.\n  It had been determined by a number of sources--including a branch of \nthe Wharton School of Economics, MIT, and CRA, or Charles River \nAssociates--that the range of the cost of a cap-and-trade bill is \nalways in the range of between $300 billion and $400 billion a year.\n  It is confusing when we talk about these large numbers. Peoples' eyes \nglaze over. They do not understand, and even I have a hard time \nunderstanding how this affects me and my 20 kids and grandkids out in \nOklahoma. So I have a system--and I recommend it to my friends in the \nSenate--that I take the number of family income tax returns that are \nfiled each year--get a current figure--and then I do my math. So this \nrange between $300 billion and $400 billion, when we reduce it down to \nwhat it would cost each family, is in excess of $3,000 a year. Even if \nwe were to pass something like this, it still wouldn't reduce the \nemissions, and that is what we need to get over.\n\n  Anyway, when President Obama saw this, he saw there was no way in the \nworld the Senate or the House would pass a cap-and-trade bill. So he \ndecided to do it just by regulation, and we have been talking about \noverregulation in the Senate. Sometimes we are inclined to think the \nantibusiness attitude of this administration is just in overtaxation \nand this type of thing. That is not true. Overregulation is also a \nkiller. In this case, we are talking about the overregulation of \nsomething we cannot sustain.\n  So in order for the President to be able to do through regulation \nwhat he could not do through legislation, he had to have what they call \nan endangerment finding; that is, the Environmental Protection Agency \nhad to come up with a conclusion that CO2 is dangerous to \nour health. It is called an endangerment finding.\n  I was getting ready to go over to a meeting in Copenhagen they have \nevery year. These people who are promoting these programs have these \nmeetings, and I was getting ready to go over there, and we had \nAdministrator Jackson before our committee. I remember looking at her \nand saying: I am leaving for Copenhagen tomorrow. Shall I assume you \nare going to have an endangerment finding as soon as I leave town? She \ndidn't answer, but she smiled. She smiles a lot. Anyway, that is what \nhappened when I left.\n  An endangerment finding has to be based on science, and that is where \nthis inspector general's report came in. Again, this is new stuff, just \n2 days ago. I had requested 18 months ago that they look into the \nendangerment finding to see if this, in fact, is based on science. Of \ncourse, they came out with\n\n[[Page S6078]]\n\nthis report, which was just released. It confirms the endangerment \nfinding, which was the very foundation of President Obama's job-\ndestroying regulatory agenda, was rushed--and I am using their words, \n``rushed, biased and flawed.'' It calls the scientific integrity of the \nEPA's decisionmaking process into question and undermines the \ncredibility of the endangerment finding.\n  Keep in mind, we have to have an endangerment finding before we can \nstart regulating all this stuff. Well, the inspector general's \ninvestigation uncovered the EPA's failure to engage in the required \nrecordkeeping process leading up to the endangerment finding. That is a \nrequirement by law. So they did not comply with the law at that time. \nIt also did not follow its own peer review procedures. Peer review is \nsomething that is required, and they didn't do it.\n  Administrator Jackson readily admitted way back in 2009 that the EPA \nhad outsourced its scientific review to the United Nations' \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n  Now, this is interesting because they are going back to say: All \nright, you guys. You do the peer review on the very thing you have \ndeveloped. Well, it doesn't work that way, and I think at that time we \nwere complaining about that. So the EPA still refused to conduct its \nown independent review of the science, as the EPA inspector general \nfound. Whatever one thinks of the U.N. science, the EPA is still \nrequired by its own procedures, by law, to conduct an independent \nreview.\n  Of course, I have long warned about the IPCC process and what they \nhave been doing in the past. In fact, it was 6 years ago that I sent a \nletter to Dr. Pachauri, the head of the IPCC, specifically raising the \nmany weaknesses of the IPCC's peer review process. But Dr. Pachauri \ndismissed my concerns, and here is what Reuters said in their article \non how Dr. Pachauri responded to my request. I am quoting now from \nReuters:\n\n       In the one-page letter, [Pachauri] denies the IPCC has an \n     alarmist bias and says ``I have a deep commitment to the \n     integrity and objectivity of the IPCC process.'' Pachauri's \n     main argument is that the IPCC comprises both scientists and \n     more than 130 governments who approve IPCC reports line by \n     line.\n\n  Now, that is what he said, as reported. As I predicted, it all came \napart for the IPCC. On the Senate floor last year I highlighted several \nmedia reports uncovering serious errors and possible fraud by the IPCC. \nThis is the United Nations we are talking about. They are the ones that \nstarted all this.\n  ABC News, the Economist, Time magazine, and the Times of London--\namong many others--reported that the IPCC's research contains \nembarrassing flaws--using their language--and the IPCC chairman and \nscientists knew of the flaws but published them anyway. Media reports \nuncovered a number of non-peer-reviewed studies that the IPCC used to \nmake baseless claims, including that global warming would--and listen \nto this; this is the IPCC stuff that has totally been rebuked--melt the \nHimalayan glaciers by 2035. Didn't happen.\n  It had 40 percent of the Amazon rainforest endangered by global \nwarming. It didn't happen.\n  Melt mountain ice in the Alps, Andes, and Africa. It didn't happen.\n  Slash crop production by 50 percent in North Africa by 2020. It is \nsomething that is not even going on.\n  These embarrassments led to a number of these same publications to \ndemand that the IPCC come clean on the review process of the IPCC.\n  I am going to read this to let everyone know how serious this is.\n  The Financial Times, talking about the IPCC:\n\n       Now it is time to implement fundamental reforms that would \n     reduce the risk of bias and errors appearing in future IPCC \n     assessments, increase transparency and open up the whole \n     field of climate research to the widest possible range of \n     scientific views.\n\n  Time Magazine has always kind of been on the other side of this \nissue. We might remember, Time Magazine had on their cover this last \npolar bear standing on the last cube of ice and we are all going to \ndie. Time Magazine, when they talked about the glaciers all melting, \nsaid:\n\n       Glaciergate is a black eye for the IPCC and for the climate \n     science community as a whole.\n\n  The Economist:\n\n       This mixture of sloppiness, lack of communication, and \n     high-handedness gives the IPCC's critics a lot to work with.\n\n  Newsweek came out:\n\n       Some of the IPCC's most-quoted data and recommendations \n     were taken straight out of unchecked activist brochures, \n     newspaper articles, and corporate reports--including claims \n     of plummeting crop yields in Africa and the rising cost of \n     warming-related natural disasters, both of which have been \n     refuted by academic studies. Just as damaging, many climate \n     scientists have responded to critiques by questioning the \n     integrity of their critics, rather than by supplying data and \n     reasoned arguments.\n\n  That was in Newsweek. So their analysis was that they are doing all \nthis stuff, and they resort to name-calling and this type of thing \nbecause they don't have a logical response for it.\n  Last year--and keeping in mind this is after I requested the \ninspector general's report and before; and still 1 year ago in a speech \nI made right here I said:\n\n       There is a crisis of confidence in the IPCC. The challenges \n     to the integrity and credibility of the IPCC merit a closer \n     examination by the U.S. Congress. The ramifications of the \n     IPCC spread far and wide, most notably to the Environmental \n     Protection Agency's finding that greenhouse gases from mobile \n     sources endanger public health and welfare. EPA's finding \n     rests in large measure on the IPCC's conclusions--and EPA has \n     accepted them wholesale, without an independent assessment. \n     At this pivotal time, as the Obama EPA is preparing to enact \n     policies potentially costing trillions of dollars and \n     thousands of jobs, the IPCC's errors make plain that we need \n     openness, transparency, and accountability in the scientific \n     research financed by the U.S. taxpayers.\n\n  That was a year before the IG report came out, and it is almost \nexactly what the IG report said just this last week.\n  Two months before that speech, I asked EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson \nto delay the EPA endangerment finding based on Climategate. She told \nme--and I have a lot of respect for her, by the way. I have professed \nthat many times. She is one whom normally I will ask her a question, \nand she will come out and give an answer, even though it may be an \nunpopular answer with her boss, President Obama. She said:\n\n       I do not agree that the IPCC has been totally discredited \n     in any way. In fact, I think it is important to understand \n     that the IPCC is a body that follows impartial and open and \n     objective assessments.\n\n  She is saying essentially the same thing:\n\n       Yes, they had concerns about e-mail. I do not defend the \n     conduct of those who sent those e-mails.\n\n  Here, they are talking about Climategate. We all remember those \nsecret e-mails going back and forth between the principals to somehow \nfraudulently manipulate the science. She goes on to say:\n\n       There is peer-review, which is part of the IPCC process. \n     There are numerous, numerous groups of teams and independent \n     researchers all a part of coming up with IPCC findings, such \n     that even the IPCC has said that while we need to investigate \n     and ensure that our scientists are to a standard of \n     scientific conduct that we can be proud of, we stand behind \n     our findings.\n\n  So they are all whitewashing the work of the IPCC--again, that was \nbefore the IG report came out--but it didn't work because there are \nmagazines throughout the world, publications which generally were on \nthe other side of this argument or their side of the argument. The \nGuardian, for example, talking about Climategate and how they are a \ndisgrace, said:\n\n       Pretending that this isn't a real crisis isn't going to \n     make it go away.\n\n  The Daily Telegraph said:\n\n       This scandal could well be the greatest in modern science.\n\n  This is what they are talking about with Climategate.\n  The Atlantic Monthly:\n\n       The stink of intellectual corruption is overpowering.\n\n  Let's remember, the economic ramifications of global warming \nregulations imposed upon the EPA under the Clean Air Act will cost \nAmerican consumers somewhere in the range of $300 billion to $400 \nbillion a year. This is not to mention the absurd result that EPA \nreadily admits they need to hire 230,000 additional employees and spend \nan additional $21 billion to implement its greenhouse gas regime if \nthey are not given wide discretion to circumvent the law, and all this \neconomic pain is\n\n[[Page S6079]]\n\nfor nothing--no gain at all. As the EPA Administrator admitted before \nour committee, it would have no effect on the overall release of \nanthropogenic gases.\n  Also, of note, what happened to the EPA's vow in 2009 that the Agency \nwould commit to high standards of transparency because ``the success of \nour environmental efforts depends on earning and maintaining the trust \nof the public we serve'' or Obama adviser John Holdren's promise that \nthe administration would make decisions based on the best science \npossible because, as the President said, ``the public must be able to \ntrust the science and scientific process informing public decisions.'' \nGiven what has come to light in this report, it appears the Obama EPA \ncannot be trusted on the most consequential decision the Agency has \never made.\n\n  I have already called upon the committees in the Senate--this would \nbe my committee of which I am the ranking member, the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee--to have an investigation. My gosh, I don't ever \nrecall in the years I have been here an IG report coming out where \nthere weren't numerous hearings to find out and to probe into why they \ncame up with the decisions they made.\n  I have tried for 10 years now to pursue this thing with the various \nbills that were introduced to do legislatively--to implement the \nrequirements. Then, when we see they are unable to do it--and if we \nlook around this Senate, there are only about 30 votes now. They don't \nhave half the number of votes to impose cap and trade. They don't have \nit. It is not here. That is why the President is trying to do it \nthrough regulations.\n  It is kind of interesting, if we put this in perspective. This \nsupercommittee they keep talking about, the 12 people--6 Democrats, 6 \nRepublicans, 3 from the House, 3 from the Senate--their goal is to find \n$1.5 trillion in 10 years. We have a President in his own budget--and \nthis isn't Democrats or Republicans or House or Senate. This is the \nPresident. His three budgets he came out with have just under a $5 \ntrillion deficit. That is inconceivable.\n  I can remember coming down here in the mid-1990s, when President \nClinton was in power. The first $1.5 trillion budget we had, I \ncomplained this is not sustainable. Now it is $1.5 trillion over and \nabove what it costs to run America. Obviously, that can't be done.\n  So when we stop to think about the fact that it should be fairly easy \nto find $1.5 trillion, that would just be his deficit for 1 year to \nfind $1.5 trillion.\n  This is kind of hard to follow. But if they were successful in \nimplementing what they could not do by legislation and have a cap and \ntrade, that would cost a minimum of $300 billion a year; or, multiply \nthat by 10, that would be $3 trillion.\n  So we have this supercommittee out there trying to find $1.5 \ntrillion; at the same time, they are advocating increasing the cost to \nAmerica by $3 trillion. It is not believable.\n  I think it is very important, and I am on the floor now trying to \ngather support for having a hearing. We can't have an IG report talking \nabout the flawed product of the EPA, of the IPCC, of the United Nations \nand not have some kind of investigation. I hope we will be able to do \nthat.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise to speak this afternoon about the \nlegislation that is before us, the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight \nReform Act, which got an overwhelming vote yesterday. There are not \nmany times when a piece of legislation on a specific topic gets the \nkind of overwhelming support to move forward as we saw yesterday in the \nvote that took place, and now we are considering the bill.\n  When you go across Pennsylvania, if you drew a line down the middle \nof our State and moved to the east, a lot of communities were \ndevastated by flooding. Other than that issue, the No. 1 issue for the \npeople of our State--and I think the people of the United States in \ntotal--is the issue of jobs. In their frustration, they look to \nWashington for action and for solutions. Too often what they see when \nthey turn on the television set or read about what is happening here, \nthey see a lot of fighting, a lot of bickering, a lot of back and forth \nand, frankly, a lot of politics but not enough action on the question \nof jobs.\n  What we have before us is not some esoteric bill about currency, \nalthough it is somewhat about that. Obviously, it truly is not that. \nThis is a bill that speaks directly to the frustration Americans feel \nand I know the people of Pennsylvania feel. There are not many places \nin Pennsylvania I can go where I talk about this issue of China for \nmany years cheating on currency and us losing lots and lots of jobs \nbecause of it. Hundreds and thousands of jobs are lost because of that. \nThere are not many places in our State where I can go to talk about \nthat where the point of view that I express doesn't receive unanimous \nsupport.\n  This is a very real issue for people. This isn't far off. They know \nthat, just as in other aspects of life, especially on something as \nconsequential and significant as international trade--most people \nunderstand that when we are involved in that kind of endeavor, we have \nto play by the rules. Every country should play by the rules. When we \nhave a country as big and as significant in the international economy \nor the international marketplace as China not playing by the rules, \ncheating time after time after time, giving their workers and their \nindustries an unfair advantage, I think most people know what that \nmeans. It is not just a question of fairness and playing by the rules; \nit is the impact of that cheating, as Americans lose jobs and have lost \njobs. So we have to take action. The time is up. We have been talking \nabout this for years. We have been pleading with China in one way or \nanother, urging them, pushing them, but the time for that is over. The \ntime to act is now.\n  This is a prudent piece of legislation. It does a couple of things. \nBasically what it does is to at long last help American manufacturers \nand our workers by clarifying that our trade enforcement laws can and \nshould be used to address currency undervaluation. It also provides an \nopportunity for us to improve oversight by establishing objective \ncriteria to identify misaligned currencies and imposing tough \nconsequences for offenders. So it doesn't put into place a new rule for \ninternational trade; it just says that if you violate the rules, there \nare going to be consequences and that our Treasury Department and our \nCommerce Department are going to take action no matter what \nadministration is in office, a Democratic administration or a \nRepublican administration.\n  I can point to a number of Senators in both parties--and I think I am \none of them--who have been urging this administration and the prior \nadministration to take stronger, more decisive action. For a variety of \nreasons, they haven't done that. That is not to say they haven't been \nworking on it and not to say they haven't been pushing their \ncounterparts in China, but I think we have been far too timid in the \napproach we take because, again, this isn't some far-off issue. This is \nabout American jobs and whether we are going to stand by and allow more \nand more--tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands more--American \njobs to be lost in the next decade as we have seen hemorrhage from our \nsociety in the last 10 years. One of the causes, one of the substantial \nfactors in that job loss--not the only but one--is the cheating China \ndoes on its currency.\n  It is as if we are telling our workers and our companies: Look, we \nare going to have a foot race with Chinese companies and Chinese \nworkers, and we are going to have this competition, as we have every \nday in the international marketplace, but China is going to start at \nthe--if this is a 100-yard dash, they are going to start at the 20- or \n25- or 30-yard line and then we are going to start the race and see how \nwe do.\n  It is completely unfair to our workers. It undermines their ability \nto compete even if they are working as hard as they can, even if they \nhave a high skill level, even if the company has invested time and \ntraining in those workers, has invested capital in the\n\n[[Page S6080]]\n\nequipment and the technology. Sometimes it doesn't matter what the \ncompany does to improve its production, to improve its efficiency. It \ndoesn't matter what the workers do. They can go to school and learn and \nprepare and get trained. But if they are at a 15- or 20- or 25-percent \ndisadvantage--by the way, those are the lowest estimates. This has been \na problem of above 30 percent or higher at times. But no matter what \nthe percentage is, we know there has been a lot of cheating and we know \nit is costing us jobs. So it is time for action.\n  This morning at the Joint Economic Committee hearing, we had Federal \nReserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. I asked him about currency, and I \nactually read to him some statements he has made in the past about \ncurrency and about the adverse role China has played, the role about \nwhich I am as frustrated as any American. I asked him about that. The \nsummation of his comments has been reported already, but in addition to \ncommenting about the impact on our workers and our companies, he talked \nabout the impact of China's currency policies on the global economic \nrecovery. So this isn't just an adverse consequence for America, for \nthe United States, this is an impediment to a full and robust recovery \naround the world. So this isn't just limited to the impact on our \nworkers and our companies, it has worldwide reach, worldwide impact, \nand worldwide consequences.\n  So the United States is unwilling, so far, to crack down on China's \ncurrency and to crack down on what I would assert is manipulation. Some \nwill say: Well, it might be something different than that, but I think \nit is basic manipulation--cheating. I think it is a step we have to \ntake now, to have rules in place for how we react to their cheating and \nthen to have very tough consequences. That is what is in the bill.\n  Unfortunately, this inability to respond appropriately or assertively \nor aggressively is one of many, I would argue, pieces of a flawed trade \nstrategy that have been a prevailing point of view over the course of \ntwo administrations. We are going to have some debate about trade \ncoming up, and we are going to see some interesting alliances, some \ninteresting coalitions here. But our flawed trade strategy--if we can \neven call it a strategy--has failed over many years, failed our workers \nand failed our companies.\n  We will get to the debate on the trade agreements later, but at least \ntoday and this week we can finally make progress on an issue that has \ncost the American people lots and lots of jobs.\n  Let me give my colleagues a sense of what could happen if we are able \nto pass this legislation. In a report dated June 17 of this year from \nthe Economic Policy Institute--one of the many think tanks across \nWashington of various points of view that have studied this issue--and \nI am broadly summarizing, but one of the many conclusions they reached \nabout this issue is that if China revalued its currency by 28.5 \npercent--now, many would say it is a bigger problem than a 28.5-percent \nor 28.5-percent advantage their workers and their companies have--if \nthey revalued to that level, at 28.5 percent, the growth in our gross \ndomestic product in the United States would support 1,631,000 U.S. \njobs. If other Asian countries also revalued their currency, then \n2,250,000 American jobs would be created. So even if someone could \nprove those numbers are off by 10,000 or 20,000 or even if we could \ndebate the number being off because some might reach different \nnumbers--but I have seen numbers that high, and I have also seen \nnumbers in the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  So any policy we can enact here--in this case, being appropriately \ntough with China on the cheating they do on currency--if passage of \nlegislation such as this, the one we are considering, leads to the \ncreation of 1.6 million jobs just as it relates to having China play by \nthe rules, why wouldn't we pass legislation to do that?\n  People are saying over and over to us, please do something about \njobs. And sometimes the response is, well, we are trying, but we can't \nget agreement or we are trying, but we don't have all the solutions. We \nfinally have a piece of legislation that will create jobs for sure and \nhas broad and substantial bipartisan support.\n  We should pass this bill because it will send two messages that are \nbadly needed right now from us to the American people--No. 1, that we \nare focused on job creation in the near term, not 10 years from now but \nin the next year or two. So it is a very specific answer to their \nrequest of us as their elected representatives that we focus on \nenacting legislation that will create jobs. Secondly, the message we \nwill send to the American people is that we finally get it. Finally, \nDemocrats and Republicans can come together on a very serious issue of \ngreat consequence to families who have been devastated by job loss; \nthat we are finally coming together, Democrats and Republicans, working \ntogether to have a unanimous vote on a job-creation bill.\n  It is that simple. Anyone who tries to make it more complicated than \nthat is probably trying to mislead because it is that simple. We need \nto focus our attention in the days ahead to get this legislation passed \nand to finally take action in a way that is directed at job creation in \na bipartisan way.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I appreciate the Presiding \nOfficer's comments earlier in support of the Currency Exchange Rate \nOversight Reform Act of 2011. The Presiding Officer and I--both \nDemocrats--joined by five Republicans and three other Democrats--are \nthe prime sponsors of the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act \nof 2011.\n  The cloture motion on the motion to proceed was agreed to--the rules \nin the Senate are sometimes a bit impenetrable, but the cloture motion \non the motion to proceed to the bill was agreed to last night with 79 \nvotes out of 98. So there is clear interest in this body to debate one \nof the most important jobs bills we have seen in front of us, I say to \nthe Presiding Officer, in our almost 5 years in the Senate. I have not \nseen in my time here another jobs bill be voted on this overwhelmingly, \nthis bipartisanly, that was this important for putting people back to \nwork.\n  Let me sort of expand on that. First of all, this Currency Exchange \nRate Oversight Reform Act of 2011 has broad support from business and \nlabor. It creates jobs without spending taxpayer dollars. In fact, this \nlegislation raises revenue and reduces our deficit, clearly, because \nwhen people go back to work, people who are now on unemployment \nbenefits--sometimes receiving food stamps, sometimes getting other \nsubsidies, maybe trade adjustment assistance, which the Presiding \nOfficer has been so involved in--instead, people going back to work \nwill be paying taxes and not be the beneficiaries of those programs. So \nit is a plus both ways in terms of reducing our government's budget \ndeficit.\n  Most important, it is in response to an enormous problem, an enormous \neconomic threat, brought on by the Chinese Communist Party Government. \nSenators Schumer, Casey, Snowe, Stabenow, Sessions, Burr, Hagan, \nCollins and I have been working closely to bring this bill to the \nfloor. I thank the majority leader, who usually sits at this desk, for \nbringing this bill to the floor to respond, purely and simply, to \nChina's protectionist trade policies. This is not the United States \nturning inward and pointing fingers at other countries. This is a \nresponse to Chinese protectionism, to Chinese economic policies and \ntrade policies that have been unfair, that cheat--the Chinese have \ncheated--and that cost us American jobs.\n  We know when a factory closes--we have had 50,000; Senator Sanders \nsaid earlier today, we have had 50,000 factories close in this country \nin the last decade or so, not all because of China. I do not blame them \nnearly for all that. But when a factory closes, we know what it does to \na community, whether it is in Harrisburg, whether it is in Sharon, \nwhether it is in Erie, whether it is in Cleveland or Akron or Canton.\n\n[[Page S6081]]\n\n  I am encouraged by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who \nsupport this bill who see how China's protectionist trade policies have \nundermined businesses, have disadvantaged manufacturers, and \nultimately, most importantly, have cost American jobs. We all know the \nproblem. For years, China subsidized its exports by adopting \nartificial, manipulated exchange rates not based on market forces. As a \nresult, China's exports to the United States remain cheap, our exports \nto China remain more expensive. In other words, because they cheat on \ntheir currency, a product made in Wuhan and sold in Lima or Dayton, OH, \nwill be cheaper because they have subsidized their production by \nweakening their currency.\n  At the same time, if a company in Lima or Dayton, OH, tries to sell \ninto China, the cost of that item is 25 percent more because China has \ngamed the currency system. So by keeping the value of the renminbi, the \nRMB or the yuan, the words for the Chinese currency, by keeping the RMB \nartificially low, China incentivizes foreign corporations to shift \nproduction there because it reduces the price of investing in China and \nmakes Chinese exports cheaper.\n  In this continued devaluation--I use the percentage 25 percent, some \neconomists say it may be as high as 40 percent, but clearly it is that \nrange--they are cheating, they are gaming the system 25 to 40 percent. \nThink about in Pennsylvania and Ohio, two States that have a lot in \ncommon. Think about a company, think of two gas stations on opposite \ncorners. One buys its oil 25, 30 or 35 or 40 percent less expensively, \npays a lower price than the competitor across the street. It is clear \nwhat is going to happen. The competitor that cannot get the break, get \nthe subsidy, is going to go out of business pretty quickly.\n  It is that phenomenon that has caused serious harm to the U.S. \neconomy and has cost America jobs. In 1993, the Chinese currency, the \nRMB, was valued at approximately 5.5 to 1 U.S. dollar. Then, from 1995 \nto 2005, it was valued at about 8.28 without change during that period. \nThat can mean one of two things: a huge coincidence or blatant currency \nmanipulation.\n  Our trade deficit with China in 1993 was about $30 billion, $40 \nbillion--in that range. Today, we run a deficit 8, 9, 10 times that, of \n$275 billion--a bilateral deficit just in our relationship with the \nChinese. According to a recent Economic Policies Institute report, \nsince China joined the WTO, the World Trade Organization, in 2001, 2.8 \nmillion jobs have been lost or displaced in the United States as a \nresult of the U.S. trade deficit--2.8 million jobs. That is hundreds of \nthousands in my State. It is tens of thousands in States as small as \nWest Virginia. It is hundreds of thousands in States as large as \nPennsylvania.\n  Currency manipulation is not the only reason China enjoys an enormous \ntrade surplus, but it is certainly a big part of the reason. From 2005 \nto the middle of 2008, we started to fight back and were headed in the \nright direction, however slowly. The Senate overwhelmingly supported a \nmeasure offered by New York Democratic Senator Schumer and South \nCarolina Republican Senator Graham that would put tariffs on Chinese \nimports if the government did not let its currency appreciate.\n  All it did was it wiped clean the advantage China had created by \nmanipulating its currency. That bill passed the Senate, but it did not \npass the House. It was never signed by the President. But what it did \ndo was get China's attention. Beginning in 2005, China began to do a \nslight currency appreciation, which allowed for a few years of modest \nprogress toward letting its currency appreciate.\n  But then in the summer of 2008, China abandoned its feigned interest \nin fairness. It once again fixed the value of the renminbi against the \nU.S. dollar. Then, in June 2010, China vowed to allow its currency to \nfloat more freely against the dollar and other foreign currencies. The \nPeterson Institute for International Economics found that, despite the \nintervention appreciation, the RMB is even more undervalued today \nagainst the dollar than it was 1 year ago. That is the recent history \nof China's currency manipulation.\n  The Chinese, in other words, when they know people are watching, when \nthey see the U.S. Government, with our very strong economy--even when \nwe look weak internally and way too many people unemployed, we are the \nmajor economic force on Earth--when they see us doing something, they \nrespond. They start to act a little better. It is a little bit similar \nto a naughty kid. When the parents are watching, they are going to act \nbetter. When the Chinese--we hope our kids do not break the law the way \nthe Chinese do, international trade law, but when we watch them, they \nbehave better. When we exert discipline on them, in other words, we are \ngoing to change this law the way they have gamed the system on \ncurrency, they begin to let the currency float and let it appreciate \nand do some better, more fairminded things.\n  New research by economists at MIT shows how much damage China's trade \nand export policies have done to our labor market and to our \ncommunities. The report shows China imports actually have effects on \njobs but also increased use of Federal programs such as the Social \nSecurity and disability insurance program. Of course it does. When \npeople get laid off, all kinds of things happen in their lives. They \napply for food stamps. They may lose their home, causing, if they are \nforeclosed on, the values of homes in the neighborhood to decline, and \nthe public schools do not have quite the support. They may not be able \nto hire one teacher as a result of a handful of people losing their \njobs. All those things happen. So when the Chinese game the currency \nsystem and jobs are lost in Pittsburgh or in Dayton, then bad things \nhappen in Pittsburgh and Dayton to those families, to those \ncommunities, to those States.\n  What has been our response when our trading partners use any means \nnecessary--low labor costs, direct subsidies, currency manipulation--to \ncompete? What has been our response? It has been inaction. We have not \ndone very much. It has been adherence to the status quo, and we can no \nlonger afford to do that. Some like the Presiding Officer from \nPennsylvania and others of us around here have been beating the drum \nfor a long time that these trade agreements are not fair, that they are \nnot fair to the American worker and to Americans, particularly small \nmanufacturers. Bigger manufacturers kind of take care of themselves. \nThey kind of do it by moving production overseas. Small manufacturers \nusually cannot do that.\n  We know what it does to our workers--bad tax law, bad trade law, bad \ncurrency policy. This bill is a modest measure. It is not as sweeping \nas I would like to do. But it is a modest measure that gives our \ngovernment the tools to fight back. With different parts authored by \nseveral of my colleagues, this bill came from two other bills we put \ntogether. The bill updates the processes and tools the government would \nhave at its disposal when it comes to countries that are currency \nmanipulators, that are in some ways repeat currency manipulators.\n  Senator Snowe from Maine, a Republican, and I, a Democrat, have \nworked on a part that would immediately designate unfair subsidies as \nan unfair trade practice. That means jobs for a number of industries: \ncoated paper in southwest Ohio, tires in Finley, OH, aluminum \nextrusion, tubular steel in northeast Ohio. It means more American \nmanufacturers, from autos to clean energy, can petition the government \nagainst unfair subsidies from importing countries.\n\n  That measure is combined with comprehensive measures to reform the \nstructural deficiencies in our government's approach to combating \ncurrency manipulation. That part of the bill was spearheaded by \nSenators Schumer and Graham. It would improve oversight of currency \nexchange rates--and I would add Senator Stabenow was involved in that.\n  It would improve oversight of currency exchange rates. It would \nensure that the Treasury Department properly identifies countries that \nundervalue their currency. Under the Omnibus Trade Act of 1988, the \nTreasury Department is required to formally identify countries that \nmanipulate their currency for the purpose of gaining an unfair \ncompetitive trade advantage. In recent years, Treasury has found that \ncertain country's currencies were undervalued. It was pretty clear and \npretty obvious.\n\n[[Page S6082]]\n\n  Reputable economists from the Reagan administration, from the Carter \nadministration, for years respectable economists were saying these \ncurrencies were undervalued 25 percent, 35 percent, some have said as \nhigh as 50 percent. It was pretty hard for the Treasury Department to \nsay anything other than these countries' currencies were undervalued.\n  However, based on the interpretation of the law's legal standard for \na finding of manipulation, the finding of the word ``manipulation,'' \nTreasury has refused and continues to cite such countries as currency \nmanipulators.\n  Our legislation is bipartisan. As I said, five Republicans, five \nDemocrats are the primary sponsors. It got 79 votes. Three Democrats \nvoted against moving the bill forward yesterday; 16 Republicans voted \nagainst it. So it has broad bipartisan support.\n  But what is amazing is the President of the United States, in either \nparty--President Bush was negligent in finding of manipulation. \nPresident Obama has been negligent in finding manipulation. I will give \nsome credit to President Obama in his move, in some cases, of actually \ndoing real enforcement of trade rules and trade laws. It has turned \nimmediately into job growth in the Mahoning Valley, a new steel mill, \nin Finley with tires, in southwest Ohio with paper. But the President \nand the Treasury Department have just neglected to do their duty; that \nis, interpreting and saying China has manipulated currency.\n  The biannual release of this statutorily required report to Congress \nis almost a Washington charade. Last year, Secretary Geithner even \nannounced he would delay the report's release. I care less about the \nexact timing of this report than I do the administration's willingness \nto be open with Congress and the American people about what it is doing \nand why it is doing it. But here is why it is important.\n  Some argue the Commerce Department already has the authority to treat \ncurrency manipulation as an export subsidy and apply countervailing \nduties. But the Commerce Department has tended to also kick these \ndecisions down the road, duck the issue of currency manipulation when \nit investigates other subsidies. The bill puts an end to that \nbureaucratic end-around.\n  I told a story earlier today on the Senate floor. I would like to \nrepeat it, briefly. A trade lawyer representing a southwest Ohio paper \ncompany told me China did not even have a coated paper industry, the \nglossy paper magazines are typically printed on--did not even have that \ntechnology until a decade or so ago.\n  When they started those companies in China, they bought their wood \npulp in Brazil, they shipped it to China, they milled it in China, and \nthey sold it back here--at the high cost of transporting something as \nheavy as paper, as bulky as paper, for the price of paper; it is a \npretty expensive move to ship it from Brazil to China to the United \nStates. The cost of labor is only about 10 percent of the production of \npaper. Yet China has found a way to underprice Ohio paper and \nunderprice paper made in other parts of the country.\n  It is pretty clear that is, in part, because they get a 25-, 30-, 35-\n, 40-percent basically add-on benefit for their price because of \ncurrency manipulation. That is why, in part, they are being able to do \nthat. They are probably subsidizing their water, their energy and their \nland and their capital also, so that they can underprice us. That is \nwhy this is so serious.\n  Ohio workers have lost jobs because China has gamed the currency \nsystem. That is all we should need to know. American companies have \nfolded, have gone out of business, because China has cheated on its \ntrade policies, not following the rule of law in the World Trade \nOrganization. That should be enough to get 100 votes in this body.\n  It got us 79 yesterday. Our bill makes it clear that countervailing \nduties can be applied when imported goods benefit from currency \nmanipulation as an export subsidy.\n  The bill would establish new criteria to identify countries \nmisaligning currency--and trigger tougher consequences for those who \nengage in such unfair trade practices.\n  We can no longer accept China and other countries doing whatever it \ntakes to make their exports cheaper. We can no longer accept that China \ncontinues to mount a massive trade surplus in the United States.\n  It is time to enforce the trade laws, and it is time the WTO enforces \nits rules.\n  Critics claim this bill would ignite a trade war with China. Frankly, \nthey declared a trade war at least one decade ago. If it is not a trade \nwar, critics assert this bill is not compliant with our World Trade \nOrganization obligations.\n  I have listened to many multinational companies argue our bill will \nprovoke retaliation by China. My question to these detractors is, How \ncan China impose retaliation against something that is, in fact, WTO \nlegal? But since receiving PNTR status and the benefits of WTO \nmembership, China has taken money from American consumers and investors \nwithout fully opening its markets to American businesses and workers.\n  The results are record trade deficits and millions of lost jobs in \nOhio and across the United States.\n  These arguments come from the same proponents of giving China PNTR \nstatus and WTO membership, so China would adhere to a rules-based \ntrading system--and they predicted and promised in 2000, when it \npassed, that China would adhere to a rules-based trading system. They \nhave not been. People care about our exports to China, as do I. \nRemember, currency undervaluation makes exports harder to sell also. \nYes, our exports have grown in China. But while U.S. exports to China \nhave increased to China, they have not come close to balancing imports \nfrom China. Imports from China have grown faster--in fact, about three \ntimes as many as we export to China.\n  Look at our trade deficit with China versus the rest of the world. In \n2000, China represented 26 percent of our total trade deficit. Last \nyear, it was just over 70 percent. In the space of 10 years, look how \nthis changed. That is the whole story.\n  Currency is a big factor that cannot be denied. While many \nmultinational companies don't say it, I think it is clear that even the \nmost ardent proponents of China PNTR are feeling a bit of buyer's \nremorse because of China's aggressive protectionism.\n  Others, in criticizing this bill, will say there is nothing we can do \nto bring back the jobs we have lost--that Americans don't want to work \nat those jobs anymore anyway. That is a pretty naive view of American \nmanufacturing. My State is No. 3 in manufacturing. California, which \nhas three times the population, and Texas make more than we do.\n  If we don't act, we are not just talking about jobs in textiles or \nsteel or tires, which are important; we are talking about jobs in clean \nenergy, semiconductors, and auto supplies.\n  A trade war? WTO compliance? Retaliation? We welcome this debate. I \nwant colleagues to come to the floor--some of the 19 who opposed moving \nthis bill forward, when they say China will start a trade war and talk \nabout WTO compliance and retaliation. The fact is China has been \nplaying that trade war for 10 years.\n  The American people have been patient as the administration continues \na strategy of talk without action. But our patience is up, as more U.S. \nbusinesses are undercut and more U.S. jobs are eliminated.\n  This bill is about economic competitiveness, where everyone is \ncompeting in the market by the same set of rules.\n  I have been to maybe 150 manufacturing plants in my State in the last \n3, 4 years. I know American businesses can compete and American workers \ncan compete. Let's make the playing field level, and S. 1619 will help \nus do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I commend the Senator from Ohio for \nhis leadership on this bill. This has been a long time in coming. It is \na long battle that is being fought over Chinese unfair trade practices. \nOne of the most significant and damaging unfair trade practices is the \nmanipulation of currency by the Chinese. Senator Brown is taking the \nlead in getting this finally rectified. I commend him for it. I know \nthe Presiding Officer, the Senator from Pennsylvania, is also a real \nfighter in this area, trying to correct the unfairness that has been \nallowed to exist\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\nwhen the Chinese currency is manipulated. Senator Casey, I believe, has \nbeen a leader and is an original cosponsor. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of the bill.\n  I have long supported the effort to take action against unfair \ncurrency manipulation by our trading partners. I think for at least the \nlast 8 years we have had bills that have been introduced to address the \nissue of unfair currency manipulation. This is an unfair trade practice \nthat contributes to large U.S. trade deficits and to job loss.\n  The reality is that when American companies do business in the global \nmarketplace, they are not competing against companies overseas; they \nare competing against foreign governments that support those companies. \nThat is especially true with foreign governments such as China and, in \nthe past, Japan and other countries that manipulate the value of their \ncurrency to keep its value artificially low. Currency manipulation \nmakes Chinese exports unfairly cheap and U.S. products more expensive \nin China, displacing U.S. production and jobs. This is nothing short, \nas Senator Brown has said, of a Chinese Government subsidy, and we \nshould be fighting against it--hard.\n  Trade creates new jobs when we export. Trade results in the loss of \njobs when imports replace goods that were once produced here. When \ntrade deficits rise, we are losing jobs to imports. The reality is, we \nhave been running massive, unsustainable trade deficits with China. \nJust in the first 7 months of this year, we had a trade deficit of more \nthan $160 billion with China. That is four times larger than our \ndeficit with any other trading partner. Last year, we exported $92 \nbillion of goods to China, and we imported an astounding $365 billion \nfrom China. So there is a growing trade surplus, as illustrated by the \ncharts Senator Brown has presented to us.\n  China's growing trade surplus with the United States and the rest of \nthe world has been fueled by massive currency manipulation, subsidies, \nand other unfair trade practices. Estimates are, the Chinese currency \nis undervalued by up to 40 percent, which makes U.S. goods that much \nmore expensive for Chinese consumers and makes Chinese goods \nartificially cheap in the United States and around the world. As a \nresult, U.S. imports from China have increased, and U.S. exports to \nChina have been suppressed.\n  Senator Brown has gone through some of the numbers, and I will repeat \nthem because I think it is important that every American focus on these \nnumbers and the growth of this trade deficit with China.\n  In 2001, our trade deficit with China was $84 billion. It grew to \n$278 billion in 2010. According to an Economic Policy Institute study, \nreleased in September, this deficit resulted in the loss or \ndisplacement of nearly 2.8 million U.S. jobs over that period. The \nreport blamed part of our deficit with China on their manipulation of \nits currency, and it is simply long overdue that we enact legislation \nto end that unfair advantage because the tools we have to combat the \nproblem have been, so far, unequal to the task.\n\n  The International Monetary Fund has what it calls articles of \nagreement. Those articles prohibit countries from manipulating their \ncurrency for the purpose of gaining unfair trade advantage. But the \nwords are hollow because the IMF has no means to enforce that \nprohibition.\n  Our current laws give the administration, on paper, the power to act \nto combat currency manipulation. But those laws are easily bypassed and \ntoo easily ignored. Both Republican and Democratic administrations have \nfailed to take action. The Treasury Department is required to issue a \nsemiannual report on international economic and exchange rate policies, \nin which it could conclude--as almost every independent observer \nconcludes--that China is manipulating its currency. To date, the \nTreasury Department has never made such a finding since the 1988 Trade \nAct mandated the report. Instead, what it does--the Treasury \nDepartment--is hint, suggests, and sometimes threatens, but it doesn't \nact.\n  A couple examples. The Bush administration's 2006 exchange rate \nreport said the following:\n\n       China needs to move quickly to introduce exchange rate \n     flexibility at a far faster pace than it has done to date. \n     Given our strong disappointment [5 years ago] and the \n     importance of China to the world economy, the Treasury \n     Department will closely monitor China's progress in \n     implementing its economic rebalancing strategy, remain fully \n     engaged at every opportunity with China, and continue \n     actively and frankly to press China to quicken the pace of \n     renminbi flexibility.\n\n  That was the Bush administration 6 years ago. In May of 2011, under \nthe Obama administration, here is what the exchange rate report states:\n\n       Treasury's view, however, is that progress thus far is \n     insufficient and that more rapid progress is needed. Treasury \n     will continue to closely monitor--\n\n  Those were the same words used 5 years ago. Maybe they took this from \nthe computer and moved it from 2006 to 2011.\n\n     the pace of appreciation of the renminbi by China. It is a \n     high priority for Treasury--\n\n  Really? That is good news. The trouble is, the facts don't support \nthe statement.\n\n     working through the G-20, the IMF, and through direct \n     bilateral discussions to encourage policies that will produce \n     greater exchange rate flexibility.\n\n  The failure of administration after administration to do more than \nclosely monitor rather than take action is why Congress must act to \npass legislation to require action against foreign countries that are \nunfairly manipulating their currency.\n  So the bill before us, S. 1619, the Currency Exchange Rate Oversight \nAct, which is a bipartisan bill, combines several earlier currency \nmanipulation bills. It clarifies that U.S. countervailing duty laws can \naddress currency undervaluation, giving American companies and \nmanufacturers stronger tools to fight back against these unfair trade \npractices. It would also replace the weak and flawed currency \nprovisions in current law with a new framework, based on objective \ncriteria that will require Treasury to identify misaligned currencies \nand require action by the administration if countries fail to correct \nthe misalignment.\n  Under this bill, the administration would be required to take \nspecific action if a country with a priority currency designation does \nnot adopt policies to eliminate the misalignment within specified \nperiods of time. For instance, if no policies are adopted after 90 \ndays, the legislation directs the administration to, among other \nthings, prohibit Federal procurement of goods and services from the \ndesignated country, unless that country is a member of the WTO \nAgreement on Government Procurement, of which China is not. After 360 \ndays of failure to adopt appropriate policies, the USTR--the Trade \nRepresentative--is required to request a dispute settlement in the WTO \nwith the government responsible for the misaligned currency.\n  Congress is on record in support of fighting currency manipulation. \nIn 2007, a majority of Senators went on record supporting a currency \nmanipulation bill that was brought up as an amendment to a State \nDepartment reauthorization bill. That bill would have imposed tariffs \non Chinese imports to compensate for currency manipulation by China. \nBut it was withdrawn by its sponsors in exchange for a promise to \ndevelop and vote on a WTO-compliant bill. The pending bill is a WTO-\ncompliant bill. Last Congress, the House of Representatives passed a \nbill, H.R. 2378, the Currency Reform For Fair Trade Act. That narrower \ncurrency manipulation bill made it clear that the Department of \nCommerce is to fight the illegal subsidization of foreign currencies by \nusing U.S. countervailing duty laws. Unfortunately, the Senate ran out \nof time at the end of the session and we did not take up the bill.\n\n  So the bill before us, S. 1619, will allow us to deal with any \ncountry that is found to be manipulating its currency, not just China, \nwhich is at the moment the worst offender. In the 1990s and early \n2000s, Japan manipulated its currency, and this was a major problem for \nour manufacturers and put them at an unfair competitive disadvantage \nvis-a-vis Japanese manufacturers. For instance, when the Japanese \nGovernment was intervening in currency markets to hold the yen at 116 \nyen to the dollar, that translated into an $8,000 subsidy for every \nlarge vehicle imported into the United States from Japan. The market \nshare\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\ngained by Japanese auto manufacturers was to a significant degree the \nresult of the currency manipulation undertaken by the Japanese \nGovernment on behalf of its exporters. Because today the Japanese yen \nis at historic highs, Japanese currency is not an immediate concern. \nThis could change at any time because Japan has recently indicated it \nis willing to intervene again in currency markets.\n  So, Mr. President, with both Chambers now on record supporting \ncurrency manipulation legislation, there is no reason we should not \npass this legislation quickly and send it to the President for his \nsignature. I hope our colleagues will support this bipartisan \nlegislation because it will finally--finally, long overdue, years too \nlate--address the very problematic and costly practice of our trade \ncompetitors who manipulate their currencies to create jobs in their \ncountries at the expense of jobs here in the United States.\n  I again thank Senator Brown of Ohio for his great work on this bill. \nI know he and the Presiding Officer, Senator Casey, and others, \nincluding my colleague from Michigan, have been working hard on this \nbill, and hopefully in the next couple of days it will come to a \nfruitful conclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I thank Senator Levin. There is no \nbetter team in any State in the country than Senator Levin and Senator \nStabenow. With all the troubles they have had in that State with \nmanufacturing, as has my State, they are always on the right side of \nthese issues and advocating for local companies, especially small \ncompanies that feed into the auto supply chain, and for the workers of \nthose companies. So I am appreciative of his leadership for so many \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nthe Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2011, and I would \nnote the presence on the floor of one of its principal sponsors, \nSenator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, whom I have been very pleased to work \nwith on this legislation.\n  I am proud to be one of the original cosponsors of this bill, an \nimportant piece of bipartisan legislation that will help protect \nAmerican workers from the trade-distorting effects of currency \nmanipulation. In particular, this legislation will allow us to fight \nback against policies China has used to gain an unfair advantage over \nAmerican manufacturers.\n  Our American trade deficit with China rose from $83 billion in 2001--\nthe year China joined the World Trade Organization--to $273 billion in \n2010. That trend is discouraging enough on its own, but it is more \ntroubling to consider that the growing trade deficit ultimately \nrepresents goods no longer made in the United States by U.S. workers. \nIn fact, the Economic Policy Institute estimates that the trade deficit \nwith China has cost 2.8 million American jobs over the past decade, \nincluding nearly 12,000 jobs in my home State of Rhode Island.\n  With so many families still struggling with unemployment in the wake \nof the recession, it is important that we examine just how we came to \nlose so many jobs to a single country and respond accordingly. It would \nbe one thing if the answer was that China's workers are just more \ntalented, their products are of higher quality, and they have simply \nbested us in the open market. But that is not the case. The evidence \nsuggests another explanation: that China is gaming the international \nsystem.\n  First, China provides subsidies to critical industries, which likely \nviolates World Trade Organization rules and gives Chinese companies an \nunfair competitive advantage over American manufacturers.\n  Second, by restricting exports of their raw materials, China drives \nup the cost of making products here in the United States.\n  Third, by turning a blind eye to or even facilitating the rampant \ntheft of American intellectual property, China benefits from what may \nbe the largest illicit transfer of wealth in history.\n  Finally, of course, China appears to be intentionally manipulating \nthe value of its currency. Indeed, through controlled purchases of \nmassive amounts of U.S. currency, the Chinese central bank has made the \nvalue of its currency--the yuan--artificially cheap relative to the \nU.S. dollar. Economists estimate the yuan is currently undervalued by \nas much as 28 percent against our dollar. The depressed value makes it \n28 percent cheaper to buy goods from China than from the United States \nand it makes U.S. goods correspondingly more expensive. It is \nessentially a subsidy for Chinese products and a tax on U.S. products.\n  This is much more than a problem of abstract economic theory. The \nconsequences of currency manipulation are deeply felt in households in \nRhode Island and across the country. In the Presiding Officer's home \nState of Pennsylvania, in the floor manager's home State of Ohio, and \nall across the United States, it is felt by families who for \ngenerations have contributed to our growth as a nation by going to work \nevery day and building things, from cars and boats to toys and \nelectronics. These workers helped define our American character, from \nthe start of the industrial revolution at Slater Mill on the banks of \nRhode Island's Blackstone River through the first decade of the 21st \ncentury. But they have watched in recent years as job after job has \nbeen lost to China.\n  This unfair competition needs to stop. The advantage the undervalued \ncurrency gives to Chinese companies has put American manufacturers out \nof business and middle-class Americans out of work.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported last week on a study that measured \nthe impact of unbalanced trade with China on communities across the \ncountry. The research shows that areas with industries exposed to \nChinese import competition have higher unemployment rates and lower \nwages, and the people in these areas are forced to rely more heavily on \ngovernment safety net programs.\n  That study ranked the Greater Providence, RI, area second among \nregions exposed to competition from China. This comes as no surprise to \nRhode Islanders.\n  Rhode Island was once a world leader in textiles and jewelry \nmanufacturing. But these industries have been hit hard by a flood of \ncheap imports from China, greatly straining our State's economy. If we \nregained the nearly 12,000 jobs estimated to have been lost to China \nover the past decade, our unemployment rate in Rhode Island would drop \nby two full percentage points.\n  As I travel around Rhode Island, I have heard time and time again \nfrom workers and business owners about the costs of Chinese currency \nmanipulation.\n  George Shuster is the CEO of Cranston Print Works, a textile \nmanufacturer that traces its roots in Rhode Island back to 1807. He \ntold me:\n\n       We know first-hand the impact that China's disruptive \n     policies have had as we have seen factory after factory close \n     their doors around us. Addressing China's manipulation of its \n     currency would be a good first step to bringing our trade \n     policy to where it needs to be to help get American \n     manufacturers moving in the right direction again.\n\n  Leslie Taito is the CEO of the nonprofit Rhode Island Manufacturing \nExtension Service. She has worked with a diverse set of manufacturers \nacross the State to help them increase their efficiency and become more \ncompetitive. She told me this:\n\n       U.S. manufacturers are resourceful, agile, and fully \n     capable to meet national and international demand. Currency \n     manipulation creates an uneven playing field that has cost \n     the United States countless jobs and has dramatically \n     increased our trade deficit. I equate it to telling a boxer \n     to go into the ring with one hand tied behind his back and \n     asking him to come out the victor. Manufacturers in this \n     country aren't asking for special consideration, they just \n     want it to be fair.\n\n  Mr. President, this is why I made addressing currency manipulation a \ncentral part of my ``Making It in Rhode Island'' manufacturing agenda, \nand why I was one of the original cosponsors of\n\n[[Page S6085]]\n\nthe legislation that is before the Senate today.\n  The Currency Exchange Rate Oversight Reform Act of 2011 will \nstrengthen the tools that we have at our disposal to counter the \nactions of countries such as China that choose to manipulate their \ncurrency rates. This legislation will first improve the oversight of \nexchange rates and allow us to identify currencies that are misaligned. \nFor countries found to manipulate their currency values or that fail to \ncorrect a misalignment, this law will trigger tough consequences. Our \ntrade enforcement agencies will gain clear authority to eliminate the \nadvantage created by currency manipulation by imposing tariffs on \nproducts imported from offending countries. This should send a clear \nmessage to China, or any currency manipulator, that if they abuse the \ncurrency markets, they will not benefit.\n  Simply put, this legislation will help level the playing field for \nAmerican companies. Economists have predicted that a fair market for \nour exports would reduce our annual trade deficit by between $100 \nbillion and $200 billion. The resulting increase in production would \nadd over one-quarter of $1 trillion to our GDP and create up to 2.25 \nmillion American jobs.\n  Are the Chinese squawking about this? Are the big multinational \ncorporations who have no allegiance to any flag or nation squawking \nabout this? Yes. Of course, they are. America has for too long been \ntaken advantage of, allowing the wiles of others to erode our wealth. \nThe winners at a rigged game will always object when the other party \ngets wise to the fact that the game is rigged and begin to do something \nabout it.\n  But if we are to solve the problem of China's currency manipulation \nand stand up for American companies, American manufacturers, and \nAmerican workers, we should pass this legislation.\n  I applaud my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for their work \non this bill, and I commend in particular Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio \nwho is here on the Senate floor managing the bill right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, with unemployment stuck at 9.1 percent, \nand consumer confidence plummeting, we must take action now to help put \nAmericans back to work.\n  Our Nation's job creators have been telling us for some time that the \nlack of jobs is largely due to a climate of uncertainty, most notably \nthe uncertainty and cost created by new Federal regulations.\n  America needs a ``time-out'' from regulations that discourage job \ncreation and hurt our economy. If a proposed rule would have an adverse \nimpact on jobs, the economy, or America's international \ncompetitiveness, it should not go into effect.\n  Today, I am filing an amendment to provide a 1-year moratorium on \nfinal rules that could have an adverse effect on the economy. The \namendment is based on S. 1538, The Regulatory Time-Out Act, which I \nintroduced last month with 16 of my colleagues. The timeout would cover \nmajor rules costing more than $100 million per year, and other rules \nthat have been considered ``significant'' under Executive orders going \nback to President Clinton and followed by President George W. Bush and \nPresident Obama.\n  The point of my amendment is to provide job creators with a sensible \nbreather from burdensome new regulations. This would give businesses \ntime to get back on their feet, create the jobs that Americans so \ndesperately need, and enhance the global competitiveness of American \nworkers.\n  This moratorium would also provide us with the time we need to review \nand improve the regulatory process. Earlier this year, I proposed the \nCURB Act, which stands for clearing unnecessary regulatory burdens, \nwhich would reform the regulatory process in several important ways. \nMany of our colleagues have also introduced regulatory reform \nproposals, and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nhas already held three hearings on the topic this year. I expect this \nissue will be a priority for our committee this fall.\n  In sports, a ``time-out'' gives athletes a chance to catch their \nbreaths. American workers and businesses are the athletes in a global \ncompetition that we must win. Our workers need policies that will get \nthem off the sidelines and back on the job. Our economy needs a time-\nout from excessive and costly regulations. My amendment will provide \nthis needed time-out. I am pleased that Senators Blunt, Coats, Coburn, \nEnzi, Hutchison, and Thune have joined me in offering this amendment, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the Currency \nExchange Rate Oversight Reform Act, which I was pleased to join with \nSenators Brown of Ohio, Schumer, Graham, Snowe, and others in \nintroducing. This legislation will ensure that the U.S. government \nfinally gets tough with countries, like China, that manipulate their \ncurrency to gain an unfair trade advantage.\n  Maine's manufacturers and their employees can compete with the best \nin the world, but not when the competition is gaming the system to get \na leg up. Time and time again, I hear from Maine manufacturers whose \nefforts to compete successfully in the global economy simply cannot \novercome the practices of illegal pricing and subsidies of countries \nsuch as China. The results of these unfair practices are lost jobs, \nshuttered factories, and decimated economies.\n  A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute estimates that \nbetween 2001 and 2008, the U.S. trade deficit with China eliminated or \ndisplaced 2.8 million American jobs, including 9,500 jobs in the State \nof Maine. China's policy of intervening in currency markets to limit \nthe appreciation of its currency against the dollar has played a major \nrole in driving this deficit by making Chinese exports cheaper and \nimports more expensive.\n  The bill that we are now considering is an important step toward \nholding accountable countries, such as China, that manipulate their \ncurrency for the purpose of gaining an unfair trade advantage. I thank \nthe leader for bringing this bill to the floor, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, this summer my wife and I spent some time \nvisiting the forests in the Rocky Mountains and we were horrified at \nthe rate of dead and dying trees throughout the region from the \nmountain pine beetle epidemic. Upon returning to the Senate and \nvisiting with my colleagues, I learned that Montana has almost 5 \nmillion acres of trees impacted by this epidemic. Additionally, Wyoming \nhas approximately 3\\1/2\\ million acres also impacted by this epidemic. \nThese forests are in dire need and we must step up and empower the \nForest Service to address this looming issue. The tactic of waiting for \nthese trees to decompose while we solve our forest management battles \ndoes not work. While we wait, the timber infrastructure which can \naddress this problem is also dying and\n\n[[Page S6086]]\n\nthose jobs will be lost forever. The cost of performing timber work in \nthe future will become more and more cost prohibitive, consuming the \nForest Service budget.\n  We must step up and help our forest communities with this problem by \nproviding the timber industry new tools and piloting different tactics \nto address these red and gray forests, all while balancing the needs of \nconservation. We must do this while restoring these lands and setting \naside other lands for future generations. I believe Senator Tester's \nForest Jobs and Recreation Act accomplishes this aim by designating \n666,000 acres of wilderness for hunting, fishing, and hiking. This bill \nalso puts another 375,000 acres into areas specifically for recreation \nso people can bike, ride, and snowmobile in more places. Additionally, \nthis bill focuses on recovering our forests from the impacts of beetles \nand restoring these woods to prime habitat for fish, birds, and big \ngame. All of this will create much-needed jobs, healthier forests, and \nmore opportunities for outdoor recreation--and the economy it supports.\n  Decisions on how to use and protect our natural resources are never \nsimple or clear cut. They require commitment and fortitude. They force \nconversations and compromise. They make us stronger by overcoming \ndifferences and looking toward the future. That is something the U.S. \nSenate could reflect upon. Senator Tester's collaborative approach of \nlistening to his constituents who came together and found solutions to \nthe problems facing their communities is a positive example of people \nworking together to achieve their common goals of bettering this \nlandscape for future generations. We cannot wait. The dead and dying \ntrees become more of a hazard each day and the ability of mills to make \nsomething from this decomposing product will not last. The more \nproactive we can be, the less this will cost us in the long run.\n  Senator Tester's efforts and collaborative approach to address the \nbeetle epidemic should be commended. This is why I am a cosponsor of S. \n268, the Forest Jobs and Recreation Act, introduced by Senator Tester.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/04/senate-section/article/S6086-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               EXPANDING DIVERSITY OF AMERICA'S AIRWAVES\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the lack of diversity in our Nation's \nradio and television media ownership is a far cry from the reality in \nwhich we live. Multilingual and multicultural stations are critical to \nthe fabric of communities all across this country, yet their access to \nthe airwaves increasingly has been disappearing.\n  It is clearly in the best interest of our democracy that media \nownership reflects the wealth of this Nation's diversity.\n  That is why today I pause to applaud Clear Channel and Minority Media \nand Telecommunications Council, MMTC, for their efforts to expand the \ndiversity in media ownership with their recent partnership. Clear \nChannel has donated six radio stations to MMTC to use for training \npurposes and ultimately for sale to minority and women broadcasters.\n  I am pleased to say that one of these stations is in my home State of \nNew Jersey. Through this program, ``Radio Vision Cristiana,'' a \nminority broadcast company, has purchased WTOC, based in Newton, NJ, \nand will use the station to broadcast Hispanic religious programming.\n  Diversity in media ownership enhances diverse perspectives and better \nserves the community as a whole. It provides a window into communities, \ninto languages, views, and values that might otherwise be totally \nsuppressed without those outlets.\n  So I am pleased to acknowledge the partnership between Clear Channel \nand MMTC to furthering this goal, and I only hope that this deal will \nencourage others to donate stations so that the American airwaves can \none day reflect the diverse makeup of the country's people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/04/senate-section/article/S6086-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL MICHAEL G. MULLEN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to ADM Michael Mullen, a man who served our country with \ndistinction for 43 years.\n  During his tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he has \npresided over the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the historic repeal of \nthe don't ask, don't tell policy, the successful operation against \nOsama bin Laden, and an episode of unprecedented change in the Middle \nEast. He has been tireless in his job, having visited our troops in \nIraq and Afghanistan so many times that we have lost count. Moreover, \nhis tenure as Chairman has been noteworthy for the amount of time he \nhas spent with our troops on the front lines of war.\n  Before becoming Chairman, Admiral Mullen served as the Navy's Chief \nand Vice Chief of Naval Operations, as the Commander of U.S. Naval \nForces in Europe, and as the Commander of the Allied Joint Force \nCommand in Naples, Italy. Over the course of his career, Admiral Mullen \nhas served aboard seven warships, three times as the commanding \nofficer. In the U.S. Navy's history, he is only the third naval officer \never to be appointed to four different four-star assignments. He is \nalso one of the few remaining veterans of the Vietnam War serving in \nthe top ranks of our military.\n  When the Vermont National Guard's 1-86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team \ndeployed to Afghanistan in 2010, Admiral Mullen traveled to Vermont to \nvisit the troops at one of their departure ceremonies. On a cold \nJanuary morning, joined by his wife Deborah, he spoke to a hall packed \nwith families and friends seeing their soldiers off to war. He thanked \nthem for their service to our Nation, and he assured them all--the \ntroops and their families--that they had the full support of our \ncountry's highest ranking military officer. It was a great comfort to \nthe Guard, and they will not forget his expression of support. Neither \nwill I.\n  In fact, Admiral Mullen and his wife, Deborah, have dedicated much of \ntheir time to advancing a range of initiatives to support troops and \ntheir families. These include wounded warrior care, veteran employment \nand education, survivor benefits, suicide prevention, and mental \nhealth.

Born in Berlin, Germany, and\n\n[[Page S6087]]\n\nimmigrating to the United States as a young boy, Stephan exemplified \nthe American spirit through a life of hard work and public service. I \nworked closely with Stephan while he served as the U.S. Ambassador to \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe from 2001 until \n2005. During that period, he made significant advances in Europe, the \nCaucasus and Central Asia on a wide range of security-related concerns, \nincluding counterterrorism, arms control, human rights, \ndemocratization, and economic development.\n  Prior to his appointment, Ambassador Minikes practiced law for more \nthan 30 years in Washington, DC and New York. He worked in public law \nand policy strategy, while more recently he represented clients in \nnational defense, energy, transportation, and international trade. A \nwell known member of the Washington political, legal and diplomatic \ncommunities, Ambassador Minikes combined knowledge of business and \ngovernment from the perspectives of the White House, the U.S. Congress \nand Federal agencies, as well as of the roles of U.S. embassies and \nforeign embassies in Washington, DC.\n  Ambassador Minikes was a 1961 graduate of Cornell University and a \n1964 graduate of Yale Law School. He was a member of the bars of the \nDistrict of Columbia, the State of New York, the U.S. Supreme Court and \nvarious other Federal courts, including the U.S. Court of Military \nAppeals, and a member of the American Bar Association, the District of \nColumbia Bar Association, the Federal Bar Association, the American \nSociety of International Law and the Association of the Bar of the city \nof New York.\n  Along with these bar association memberships and his impressive \neducational background, Stephan was a wonderful public servant \nthroughout his lifetime. He lectured to students around the world on \nissues ranging from foreign policy to national defense, traveled to \nmore than 100 countries representing the U.S. Government and private \ninterests, served as the director of the Washington Opera at the \nKennedy Center, was a member of the Executive Committee of the Yale Law \nSchool and a member of the board of directors of the American Council \non Germany.\n  Ambassador Minikes was devoted not only to his country, the promotion \nof human rights and the improvement of global policies, but to his \nfamily. Colleagues, please join me in honoring and remembering of \nAmbassador Stephan Minikes, a true leader and patriot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/04/senate-section/article/S6087-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DELTA COUNTY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are thousands of small and \nmedium size counties across our country that form the backbone of our \nshared history and cultural heritage. These communities shape our \npolitical, economic, and social structure. Each has a unique history \nthat defines its region and its citizens. Delta County, MI, set along \nLake Michigan in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, is one such place, and \nsince its inception 150 years ago, has contributed much to the rich and \nproud history of my home State.\n  While human life in this region dates back to at least 500 A.D. as \nevidenced by cliff paintings found in the area, the area was first \nsurveyed in 1843, and in 1861, a triangle shaped section of this land \nwas incorporated as Delta County. At one point in the early 1850s, the \nmouth of the Escanaba River was home to the largest timber producer in \nthe world; built by one of the county's founding fathers, Nelson \nLudington. Two years after the county's incorporation, the Chicago and \nNorthwestern Railroad constructed Delta County's first iron ore dock. \nOver the ensuing decade, the residents of Delta County witnessed the \nconstruction of the first frame houses and a hotel, in addition to the \nSand Point Lighthouse in Escanaba. The Delta County Historical Society \nrestored this lighthouse in 1987, and it still stands today along Delta \nCounty's majestic coastline.\n  The years following Escanaba's establishment were prosperous, as \nDelta County grew as a transportation hub for iron in the north, \npowering the growth of the Great Lakes region's manufacturing prowess. \nIn 1877, the city of Gladstone was incorporated at the end of the Soo \nLine railroad. Twenty-one years after its founding, Delta County \nconstructed its first courthouse, and a year later, in 1883, the \nvillage of Escanaba, the county seat, incorporated as a city. Today, \nthe county takes pride in its continued role in transporting ore, \npartnered with a diversified paper industry and its popularity as a \ndestination for tourists visiting one of our Nation's most pristine \nregions.\n  The Hiawatha National Forest accounts for more than half of Delta \nCounty's land area. This beautiful natural resource stretches across \nMichigan's Upper Peninsula, touching three of the five Great Lakes and \ncontains 413 inland lakes, making it a popular destination for campers \nand outdoor enthusiasts. A respect for the environment is a central \npart of the culture of Delta County residents, and in 1991, Delta \nCounty was awarded one of six statewide ``model'' program grants for a \nrecycling and composting program.\n  Delta County's sesquicentennial marks a great moment for the \ncountless citizens who have contributed much to the success of this \nregion and have helped shape the cultural fabric of this area over the \nlast century and a half. On June 22, Delta County held a ceremony \nreminiscent of its 100th anniversary celebration, raising a flag and \nexploring in depth the long, rich history of the county. I know my \ncolleagues in the Senate join me and thousands of citizens across \nMichigan in wishing the residents of Delta County the best as they \nchart a course for another century of accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/04/senate-section/article/S6087-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING AMOS McCLURE\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Mr. Amos \nMcClure, who passed away on October 1, 2011, at the Veterans \nAdministration Hospital in St. Louis, MO. A veteran of the Korean war, \nduring which he was taken prisoner, Amos lived the life of an American \npatriot.\n  Just out of high school, Amos joined the U.S. Army in 1948 at the age \nof 17. At the U.S. Armed Forces Institute in Fort Lewis, WA, he became \nan expert rifleman before specializing in heavy infantry during the \nKorean war. On November 29, 1950--just 19 days shy of his 20th \nbirthday--Amos was captured by the enemy while serving his nation in \nKorea. He spent almost 3 years as a prisoner of war, until his release \non August 8, 1953--Armistance Day.\n  Amos was shot and wounded as a prisoner of war. But Amos was a \nsurvivor and his strength and determination helped him overcome both \nthe physical and emotional wounds that were inflicted on so many \nAmerican POWs. For his service, and in recognition of the sacrifices he \nmade for his country, CPL Amos McClure received numerous military \nawards, including the Prisoner of War Medal.\n  Amos returned home from serving in Korea to marry his sweetheart, \nNorma Jean Southerland. They were married for almost 52 years before \nshe passed away. They leave behind five children.\n  After his discharge, Amos worked for the Atomic Energy Commission as \na storage battery technician. Later, as a civilian for the U.S. Air \nForce, he worked as a storage battery technician before moving to St. \nLouis to become a service manager and electrician until his retirement \nin 2004.\n  I honor Amos today out of appreciation for the sacrifices he made on \nbehalf of his fellow Americans, for his contributions to his community, \nand for the example he set for his children. He had the benefit of a \nstrong family support system and a work ethic that allowed him to move \nforward from the horrors of war. His spirited approach to life is \nemblematic of the courage, honor, and strength of our veterans who \nfought for our freedom.\n  I join his family, the people of Missouri, and all Americans, in \nsaluting Amos McClure's courage, and I humbly recognize him for all \nthat he has done and for all that he endured for this country. Amos \nMcClure was a true American hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/04/senate-section/article/S6087-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6087-S6088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MAUREEN BEAUREGARD\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN.

Today \nFamilies in Transition provides essential services including substance \nabuse treatment, mental health counseling, childcare services, and is \nspread out over ten housing units, two retail outlets, and 53 \nemployees.\n  A leader and role model to others in the non-profit field, it is no \nsurprise that earlier this year Maureen Beauregard was honored for her \nhard work and dedication by New Hampshire Business Review as an \nOutstanding Woman in Business. Her accomplishments over the years have \ntruly been remarkable, and she will continue to have a positive impact \non countless at-risk families in New Hampshire.\n  As we mark the 20th anniversary of Families in Transition, I would \nlike to recognize Maureen Beauregard and thank her for all that she has \ndone to make New Hampshire a better place to live and raise a \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/04/senate-section/article/S6088-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JOHN RIST\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN.

As he retires as principal of Central High \nSchool, I thank him for his service to the people of Manchester and the \nState of New Hampshire.\n  John first came to Central High School in 1999 as interim principal. \nWith his strong personality and generous nature, he successfully led \nCentral through challenging times. He was named principal of the school \nin 2002 and during his tenure John helped Central gain full \naccreditation, established the Central Pride Foundation to support \nschool activities, and oversaw major renovations. Under John's \nleadership, Central's standardized test scores increased and the \ndropout rate decreased.\n  John's commitment to our young people extended well beyond the \nprincipal's office. He was a constant presence in the band room, \ncafeteria, and at Central's many sporting events.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nworkplace health incentives by equalizing the tax consequences of \nemployee athletic facility use; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Workforce Health \nImprovement Program Act of 2011, otherwise known as the WHIP Act. I am \nvery pleased to be joined again by my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Tom Harkin, who shares my commitment to helping keep America \nfit.\n  Public health experts unanimously agree that people who maintain \nactive and healthy lifestyles dramatically reduce their risk of \ncontracting chronic diseases. And as the government works to reign in \nthe high cost of health care, it is worth talking about what we all can \ndo to help ourselves. As you know, prevention is key, and exercise is a \nprimary component in the prevention of many adverse health conditions \nthat can arise over one's lifetime. A physically fit population helps \nto decrease health-care costs, reduce governmental spending, reduce \nillnesses, and improve worker productivity.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, the \neconomic cost alone to businesses in the form of health insurance and \nabsenteeism is more that $15 billion. Additionally, the CDC estimates \nthat more than one-third of all U.S. adults fail to meet minimum \nrecommendations for aerobic physical activity. With physical inactivity \nbeing a key contributing factor to overweight and obesity, and \nadversely affecting workforce productivity, we quite simply need to do \nmore to help employers encourage exercise.\n  Given the tremendous benefits exercise provides, I believe Congress \nhas a duty to create as many incentives as possible to get Americans \noff the couch, up, and moving.\n  With this in mind, I am reintroducing the WHIP Act.\n  Current law already permits businesses to deduct the cost of on-site \nworkout facilities, which are provided for the benefit of employees on \na pre-tax basis. But if a business wants or needs to outsource these \nhealth benefits, they and/or their employees are required to bear the \nfull cost. In other words, employees who receive off-site fitness \ncenter subsidies are required to pay income tax on the benefits, and \ntheir employers bear the associated administrative costs of complying \nwith the IRS rules.\n  The WHIP Act would correct this inequity in the tax code to the \nbenefit of many smaller businesses and their employees. Specifically, \nit would provide an employer's right to deduct up to $900 of the cost \nof providing health club benefits off-site for their employees. In \naddition, the employer's contribution to the cost of the health club \nfees would not be taxable income for employees--creating an incentive \nfor more employers to contribute to the health and welfare of their \nemployees.\n  The WHIP Act is an important step in reversing the largely \npreventable\n\n[[Page S6092]]\n\nhealth crisis that our country is facing, through the promotion of \nphysical activity and disease prevention. It is a critical component of \nAmerica's health care policy: prevention. It will improve our nation's \nquality of life by promoting physical activity and preventing disease.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1644\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish an alternative accountability model; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak \nabout a Colorado common-sense approach to solving a national problem \nfacing schools because of the current No Child Left Behind, NCLB law. \nToday, I am introducing the Growth to Excellence Act, along with my \nfriend and colleague Senator Bennet.\n  In my travels across the great state of Colorado, educators from \nPueblo to Grand Junction have shared with me the difficulties and \ncumbersome burdens placed on them by NCLB. Although well-intentioned, \nNCLB has continued to suffer from under-funding and poor \nimplementation, which have in turn hurt our nation's students.\n  A major component of the current law is the measurement of Annual \nYearly Progress, or AYP for short, for a group of students. Current law \nrequires States to compare one year's class of students to the next \nyear's class, and it fails to measure the progress of individual \nstudents over time.\n  This is problematic for schools because it doesn't adequately \nrepresent true educational progress, focusing instead on anonymous \nstudents' test scores. Likewise, the information is meaningless to \nparents and students because it does not properly measure individual \nstudents' growth over time. Unfortunately, under current law, schools \nare punished when such groups of students do not meet the required \nlevel of AYP, even if individual students actually displayed \nsubstantial growth over that time. Our bill would fix that.\n  Using the nationally recognized Colorado Growth Model as its \ninspiration, the Growth to Excellence Act would amend current law to \nallow all states to move toward an accountability system that measures \nstudent growth rates together with their attainment of college and \ncareer readiness. Growth models, which track students from year to \nyear, provide schools, parents, teachers, and students alike with the \ninformation they need to see where individual student improvements have \nbeen made and where there is still room for continued learning.\n  This legislation, I believe, will provide a proven system of tracking \nactual student growth aimed at preparing our students for college and \nfor their careers, without unnecessarily punishing schools in a one-\nsize-fits-all approach. This will ultimately improve accountability \nstandards for teachers, principals and school systems nationwide as it \nwill provide us with the data we need to ensure America's students are \nprepared to win the global economic race in the 21st Century.\n  As Congress continues its important work on the reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I urge my colleagues to \njoin both Senator Bennet and me in supporting the Growth to Excellence \nAct.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1654\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ASSESSMENTS OF EMPLOYMENT IMPACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Employment Impact Act of 2011''.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this section are the \n     following:\n       (1) To declare that the impact of Federal regulations on \n     jobs and job prospects in the United States is a significant \n     and relevant consideration to all Federal regulatory policy \n     actions and henceforth should be taken into account by \n     Federal regulators when they decide to take actions under \n     their respective statutory authorities.\n       (2) To express the concern of Congress that Federal \n     regulators consider the cumulative impact of multiple \n     proposed Federal regulations on jobs and jobs prospects in \n     the United States and that the cumulative impact of such \n     regulations should be given all due consideration and weighed \n     in the balance with the other purposes sought to be achieved \n     by such regulatory measures.\n       (c) Duty to Assess the Impact of Federal Action on Jobs and \n     Job Opportunities.--\n       (1) In general.--The Congress authorizes and directs, to \n     the fullest extent possible, that all agencies of the Federal \n     Government shall--\n       (A) utilize a systematic, interdisciplinary approach which \n     shall insure the integrated use of the relevant fields of \n     research and learning in planning and decisionmaking which \n     may have an impact on jobs and job opportunities;\n       (B) identify and develop methods and procedures, in \n     consultation with the Council on Economic Advisors, Office of \n     the President, which will insure that presently unquantified \n     impacts on job and job opportunities may be given appropriate \n     consideration in decisionmaking along with environmental and \n     other considerations; and\n       (C) include in every recommendation or report on proposals \n     for legislation and other major Federal actions with \n     potentially significant effects on jobs and job \n     opportunities, a jobs impact statement as described in \n     paragraph (2).\n       (2) Jobs impact statement.--\n       (A) Contents.--A jobs impact statement required under \n     paragraph (1) shall include a detailed statement by the \n     responsible official on--\n       (i) the impact of the proposed action on jobs and job \n     opportunities, including an assessment of the jobs that would \n     be lost, gained, or sent overseas as a result of the proposed \n     action;\n       (ii) any adverse effect on jobs and job opportunities which \n     could not be avoided should the proposal be implemented;\n       (iii) alternatives and modifications to the proposed action \n     that could avoid negative impacts on jobs and job \n     opportunities; and\n       (iv) the relationship between any local short-term impacts \n     on jobs and job opportunities and the maintenance and \n     enhancements of long-term productivity and environmental \n     values.\n       (B) Consultation with relevant federal agencies.--Prior to \n     preparing a jobs impact statement, the responsible Federal \n     official shall consult with and obtain the comments of any \n     Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special \n     expertise with respect to any jobs or job opportunities \n     impacts involved. Copies of such statement and the comments \n     and views of the appropriate Federal, State, and local \n     agencies that are authorized to develop and enforce policies \n     and programs relevant to jobs and job opportunities, shall be \n     made available to the Council of Economic Advisors and to the \n     public as provided by section 552 of title 5, United States \n     Code, and shall accompany the proposal through the existing \n     agency review process.\n       (C) Cumulative impact of proposed actions.--In determining \n     the impact of a proposed action on jobs and job \n     opportunities, the responsible Federal official shall take \n     into account the cumulative impact on jobs and job \n     opportunities of concurrently pending proposals affecting a \n     particular industry or sector of the economy, and shall not \n     make a finding of no significant impact solely on the basis \n     of examining the impacts of a single proposal in isolation \n     from other pending proposals.\n       (D) Combining environmental and job impact statements.--A \n     jobs impact statement required under this section may be \n     combined with a detailed statement of environmental impacts \n     required to be prepared under the National Environmental \n     Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), if both \n     statements are required with respect to the same proposed \n     action.\n       (d) Conformity of Administrative Procedures.--All agencies \n     of the Federal Government shall review their present \n     statutory authority, administrative regulations, and current \n     policies and procedures for the purpose of determining \n     whether there are any deficiencies or inconsistencies therein \n     which prohibit full compliance with the purposes and \n     provisions of this section, and shall propose to the \n     President not later than one year after enactment of this \n     Act, such measures as may be necessary to bring their \n     authority and policies into conformity with the intent, \n     purposes, and procedures set forth in this section.\n       (e) No Judicial Review of Jobs Impact Statements.--\n     Implementation of this section, including a jobs impact \n     statement prepared in accordance with this section, shall not \n     be subject to judicial review.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 672.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the following:\n       (A) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, the Committee on Finance, and the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate.\n       (B) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Ways and Means, and the \n     Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) Debt instruments of the united states.--The term ``debt \n     instruments of the United States'' means all bills, notes, \n     and bonds issued or guaranteed by the United States or by an \n     entity of the United States Government, including any \n     Government-sponsored enterprise.\n\n     SEC. _03. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the growing Federal debt of the United States has the \n     potential to jeopardize the national security and economic \n     stability of the United States;\n       (2) the increasing dependence of the United States on \n     foreign creditors has the potential to make the United States \n     vulnerable to undue influence by certain foreign creditors in \n     national security and economic policymaking;\n       (3) the People's Republic of China is the largest foreign \n     creditor of the United States, in terms of its overall \n     holdings of debt instruments of the United States;\n       (4) the current level of transparency in the scope and \n     extent of foreign holdings of debt instruments of the United \n     States is inadequate and needs to be improved, particularly \n     regarding the holdings of the People's Republic of China;\n       (5) through the People's Republic of China's large holdings \n     of debt instruments of the United States, China has become a \n     super creditor of the United States;\n       (6) under certain circumstances, the holdings of the \n     People's Republic of China could give China a tool with which \n     China can try to manipulate the domestic and foreign \n     policymaking of the United States, including the United \n     States relationship with Taiwan;\n       (7) under certain circumstances, if the People's Republic \n     of China were to be displeased with a given United States \n     policy or action, China could attempt to destabilize the \n     United States economy by rapidly divesting large portions of \n     China's holdings of debt instruments of the United States; \n     and\n       (8) the People's Republic of China's expansive holdings of \n     such debt instruments of the United States could potentially \n     pose a direct threat to the United States economy and to \n     United States national security. This potential threat is a \n     significant issue that warrants further analysis and \n     evaluation.\n\n     SEC. _04.

Mr. CORNYN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 1619, to provide for identification of misaligned \ncurrency, require action to correct the misalignment, and for other \npurposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SALE OF F-16 AIRCRAFT TO TAIWAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Defense, in its 2011 report to \n     Congress on ``Military and Security Developments Involving \n     the People's Republic of China,'' found that ``China \n     continued modernizing its military in 2010, with a focus on \n     Taiwan contingencies, even as cross-Strait relations \n     improved. The PLA seeks the capability to deter Taiwan \n     independence and influence Taiwan to settle the dispute on \n     Beijing's terms. In pursuit of this objective, Beijing is \n     developing capabilities intended to deter, delay, or deny \n     possible U.S. support for the island in the event of \n     conflict. The balance of cross-Strait military forces and \n     capabilities continues to shift in the mainland's favor.'' In \n     this report, the Department of Defense also concludes that, \n     over the next decade, China's air force will remain primarily \n     focused on ``building the capabilities required to pose a \n     credible military threat to Taiwan and U.S. forces in East \n     Asia, deter Taiwan independence, or influence Taiwan to \n     settle the dispute on Beijing's terms''.\n       (2) The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) conducted a \n     preliminary assessment of the status and capabilities of \n     Taiwan's air force in an unclassified report, dated January \n     21, 2010. The DIA found that, ``[a]lthough Taiwan has nearly \n     400 combat aircraft in service, far fewer of these are \n     operationally capable.'' The report concluded, ``Many of \n     Taiwan's fighter aircraft are close to or beyond service \n     life, and many require extensive maintenance support. The \n     retirement of Mirage and F-5 aircraft will reduce the total \n     size of the Taiwan Air Force.''\n       (3) Since 2006, authorities from Taiwan have made repeated \n     requests to purchase 66 F-16C/D multirole fighter aircraft \n     from the United States, in an effort to modernize the air \n     force of Taiwan and maintain its self-defense capability.\n       (4) According to a report by the Perryman Group, a private \n     economic research and analysis firm, the requested sale of F-\n     16C/Ds to Taiwan ``would generate some $8,700,000,000 in \n     output (gross product) and more than 87,664 person-years of \n     employment in the US,'' including 23,407 direct jobs, while \n     ``economic benefits would likely be realized in 44 states and \n     the District of Columbia''.\n       (5) The sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan would both sustain \n     existing high-skilled jobs in key United States manufacturing \n     sectors and create new ones.\n       (6) On August 1, 2011, a bipartisan group of 181 members of \n     the House of Representatives sent a letter to the President, \n     expressing support for the sale of F-16C/Ds to Taiwan. On May \n     26, 2011, a bipartisan group of 45 members of the Senate sent \n     a similar letter to the President, expressing support for the \n     sale.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON BRAZIL AND THE INFORMATION \n                   TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENT OF THE WORLD TRADE \n                   ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Under the Ministerial Declaration on Trade in \n     Information Technology Products of the World Trade \n     Organization, agreed to at Singapore December 13, 1996 (in \n     this section referred to as the ``Information Technology \n     Agreement''), 70 countries have eliminated their tariffs on \n     information technology products. Those countries represent \n     about 97 percent of the global trade of information \n     technology products.\n       (2) The United States is a signatory to the Information \n     Technology Agreement, as are other developed countries as \n     well as developing countries.\n       (3) By liberalizing the trade of information technology \n     products, the Information Technology Agreement improves \n     global interconnectedness and promotes economic development \n     in signatory countries, including developing countries.\n       (4) The list of signatories to the Information Technology \n     Agreement does not include Brazil, a major trading partner of \n     the United States.\n       (5) Brazil is one of the 10 largest economies in the world, \n     is the fifth largest consumer market for information \n     technology products in the world, and is the largest consumer \n     market for such products in Latin America. Brazil ranks \n     seventh in the world in the use of the Internet.\n       (6) Brazil is a major market for information technology \n     products and it imposes tariffs on information technology \n     products imported from the United States, but the United \n     States imposes no tariffs on such products imported from \n     Brazil.\n       (7) Morever, because the United States designates Brazil as \n     a beneficiary developing country under the Generalized System \n     of Preferences under title V of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 \n     U.S.C. 2461 et seq.), over $2,000,000,000 in imports from \n     Brazil entered the United States duty-free under the \n     Generalized System of Preferences in 2010.\n       (8) It is reasonable for the United States to expect Brazil \n     to provide tariff reciprocity and, at a minimum, to become a \n     signatory to the Information Technology Agreement.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should make it a priority to urge Brazil to \n     become a signatory to the Information Technology Agreement.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than the date that is 180 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act and not later than the \n     date that is 1 year after such date of enactment, the United \n     States Trade Representative shall submit to the Committee on \n     Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of \n     the House of Representatives a report on the progress made in \n     efforts to urge Brazil to become a signatory to the \n     Information Technology Agreement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 683.

PROMOTION OF JOB CREATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In terms of bilateral surveillance, Article IV of the \n     International Monetary Fund (referred to in this section as \n     the ``IMF'') Articles of Agreement lays out a code of conduct \n     for countries' exchange rate and domestic policies. Within \n     this setting, Article IV consultations use exchange rate \n     assessments to monitor countries competitiveness and \n     vulnerabilities to balance of payments crises.\n       (2) The IMF uses three complementary measures to perform \n     exchange rate assessments and to help determine exchange rate \n     misalignments, a ``macroeconomic balance'' approach, an \n     ``equilibrium real exchange rate'' approach, and an \n     ``external sustainability'' approach.\n       (3) Exchange rate assessments are based on the notion of \n     equilibrium, which the IMF has identified as ``consistency \n     with external and internal balance over the medium to long \n     run''.\n       (4) The ``medium term,'' according to IMF definitions \n     relevant to exchange rate assessments, is a horizon over \n     which domestic and partner-country output gaps are closed and \n     the lagged effects of past exchange rate changes are fully \n     realized.\n       (5) An output gap is measured by the difference between \n     actual output in an economy and potential output.\n       (6) Potential output is the level of output in an economy \n     that would be realized if labor, capital, and other resources \n     were at high levels of utilization.\n\n[[Page S6107]]\n\n       (7) Negative output gaps mean that actual output in an \n     economy is below potential output.\n       (8) This Act seeks to help close a negative output gap in \n     the United States by promoting the elimination of global \n     imbalances and currency misalignments, and relies partly on \n     IMF determinations of exchange rate misalignments which, in \n     turn, rely on the concept of the output gap.\n       (9) Negative output gaps are typically consistent with \n     unemployed labor resources. The more negative the gap, the \n     larger tends to be the unemployment rate and the greater the \n     need for job creation.\n       (10) Negative output gaps for the United States mean the \n     difference between the actual gross domestic product and \n     ``potential gross domestic product''.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Output gap computed by the cbo.--The term ``output gap \n     computed by the Congressional Budget Office'' means the \n     difference, computed by the Congressional Budget Office, \n     between actual gross domestic product and the Congressional \n     Budget Office's measure of potential gross domestic product.\n       (2) Potential gross domestic product.--The term ``potential \n     gross domestic product'' means the Congressional Budget \n     Office's estimate of ``full-employment'' gross domestic \n     product, according to the Congressional Budget Office's \n     definition of full-employment as taken from statistical \n     procedures grounded in economic theory.\n       (3) Unemployment rate.--The term ``unemployment rate'' \n     means the U-3 measure as computed by the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics, which is the total number of unemployed as a \n     percentage of the civilian labor force as reported in the \n     Bureau of Labor Statistic's Current Population Survey \n     (commonly known as the ``Household Survey'').\n       (c) Davis-Bacon and McNamara-O'Hara Not Applicable.--\n       (1) In general.--No Federal funds shall be used to \n     administer or enforce the wage-rate requirements of \n     subchapter IV of chapter 31 of part A of subtitle II of title \n     40, United States Code (commonly referred to as the ``Davis-\n     Bacon Act''), or of the Service Contract Act of 1965 (Public \n     Law 89-286; commonly referred to as the ``McNamara-O'Hara \n     Service Contract Act''), with respect to any project or \n     program funded by the United States, during any calendar \n     quarter following a calendar quarter for which the output gap \n     computed by the Congressional Budget Office is negative or \n     the unemployment rate as computed by the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics averages five percent or more, until such time as \n     the Congressional Budget Office makes the determinations \n     under paragraph (2).\n       (2) Future application.--The limitation provided for in \n     paragraph (1) shall cease to apply and the wage-rate \n     requirements described in paragraph (1) shall apply beginning \n     in the first calendar quarter that follows four or more \n     consecutive calendar quarters of non-negative output gaps as \n     computed by the Congressional Budget Office and four or more \n     consecutive quarters of average unemployment rates that are \n     below the level of the unemployment rate deemed consistent \n     with the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of full \n     employment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 685.

Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Coburn) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by her to the bill S. 1619, to provide for \nidentification of misaligned currency, require action to correct the \nmisalignment, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the \ntable; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n  TITLE __--FREEDOM FROM RESTRICTIVE EXCESSIVE EXECUTIVE DEMANDS AND \n                            ONEROUS MANDATES\n\n     SEC. ___1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Freedom from Restrictive \n     Excessive Executive Demands and Onerous Mandates Act of \n     2011''.\n\n     SEC. ___2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to the recovery of the economy of the United States.\n       (2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n     entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n     other small entities, sometimes inhibiting the ability of \n     small entities to create new jobs.\n       (3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n     in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n     small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome \n     demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs, \n     thereby threatening the viability of small entities and the \n     ability of small entities to compete and create new jobs in a \n     global marketplace.\n       (4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n     recognize and take account of the differences in the scale \n     and resources of regulated entities, but in many instances \n     have failed to do so.\n       (5) In 2009, there were nearly 70,000 pages in the Federal \n     Register, and, according to research by the Office of \n     Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, the annual \n     cost of Federal regulations totals $1,750,000,000,000. Small \n     firms bear a disproportionate burden, paying approximately 36 \n     percent more per employee than larger firms in annual \n     regulatory compliance costs.\n       (6) All agencies in the Federal Government should fully \n     consider the costs, including indirect economic impacts and \n     the potential for job loss, of proposed rules, periodically \n     review existing regulations to determine their impact on \n     small entities, and repeal regulations that are unnecessarily \n     duplicative or have outlived their stated purpose.\n       (7) It is the intention of Congress to amend chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, \n     including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final \n     rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking \n     process and that the agencies assess a full range of \n     alternatives that will limit adverse economic consequences, \n     enhance economic benefits, and fully address potential job \n     loss.\n\n     SEC. ___3. INCLUDING INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT IN SMALL ENTITY \n                   ANALYSES.\n\n       Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) the term `economic impact' means, with respect to a \n     proposed or final rule--\n       ``(A) the economic effects on small entities directly \n     regulated by the rule; and\n       ``(B) the reasonably foreseeable economic effects of the \n     rule on small entities that--\n       ``(i) purchase products or services from, sell products or \n     services to, or otherwise conduct business with entities \n     directly regulated by the rule;\n       ``(ii) are directly regulated by other governmental \n     entities as a result of the rule; or\n       ``(iii) are not directly regulated by the agency as a \n     result of the rule but are otherwise subject to other agency \n     regulations as a result of the rule.''.\n\n     SEC. ___4. JUDICIAL REVIEW TO ALLOW SMALL ENTITIES TO \n                   CHALLENGE PROPOSED REGULATIONS.\n\n       Section 611(a) of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``603,'' after ``601,'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``603,'' after ``601,'';\n       (3) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:\n       ``(3) A small entity may seek such review during the 1-year \n     period beginning on the date of final agency action, except \n     that--\n       ``(A) if a provision of law requires that an action \n     challenging a final agency action be commenced before the \n     expiration of 1 year, the lesser period shall apply to an \n     action for judicial review under this section; and\n       ``(B) in the case of noncompliance with section 603 or \n     605(b), a small entity may seek judicial review of agency \n     compliance with such section before the close of the public \n     comment period.''; and\n       (4) in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``, and'' and \n     inserting a semicolon;\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) issuing an injunction prohibiting an agency from \n     taking any agency action with respect to a rulemaking until \n     that agency is\n\n[[Page S6111]]\n\n     in compliance with the requirements of section 603 or 605.''.\n\n     SEC. ___5.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``United States Optimal Use \n     of Trade to Develop Outerwear and Outdoor Recreation Act'' or \n     the ``U.S. OUTDOOR Act''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The outdoor industry contributes $730,000,000,000 to \n     the United States economy annually.\n       (2) Outdoor activities are vitally important to the health \n     and well-being of the people of the United States.\n       (3) Duty rates on recreational performance apparel are \n     among the highest duty rates imposed by the United States \n     Government, with duties on some recreational performance \n     apparel as high as 28.2 percent.\n       (4) The duties currently imposed by the United States on \n     recreational performance apparel were set in an era during \n     which high rates of duty were intended to protect the \n     production of other apparel in the United States, and before \n     the technologies and innovations that create today's \n     recreational performance apparel industry were developed.\n       (5) In July 2007, the United States International Trade \n     Commission confirmed in USITC Publication 3937 that \n     recreational performance apparel produced in the United \n     States makes up less than 1 percent of the total recreational \n     performance apparel market and therefore concluded that there \n     is no commercially viable production of recreational \n     performance apparel in the United States.\n       (6) On November 1, 2005, the Committee for the \n     Implementation of Textile Agreements confirmed in the Federal \n     Register that imports of certain recreational performance \n     apparel do not contribute to domestic market disruption or \n     adversely affect United States textile and apparel producers \n     (70 Fed. Reg. 65889).\n       (7) The elimination of duties on the importation of certain \n     recreational performance apparel would provide an economic \n     benefit to United States consumers of outdoor products and \n     would promote increased participation in healthy and active \n     lifestyles.\n\n     SEC. _03.

Res. 266\n\n       Whereas people in the United States are living longer, and \n     the cost of retirement is increasing significantly;\n       Whereas Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement \n     income for the great majority of the people of the United \n     States but was never intended by Congress to be the sole \n     source of retirement income for families;\n       Whereas recent data from the Employee Benefit Research \n     Institute indicates that, in the United States, less than \\2/\n     3\\ of workers or their spouses are currently saving for \n     retirement, and the actual amount of retirement savings of \n     workers is much less than the amount needed to adequately \n     fund their retirement years;\n       Whereas the financial literacy of workers in the United \n     States is an important factor to workers understanding the \n     true need to save for retirement;\n       Whereas saving for retirement is a key component to overall \n     financial health and security during retirement years, and \n     the importance of financial literacy in planning for \n     retirement must be advocated;\n       Whereas many workers may not be aware of their options in \n     saving for retirement or may not have focused on the \n     importance of, and need for, saving for retirement;\n       Whereas many employees have available to them, through \n     their employers, access to defined benefit and defined \n     contribution plans to assist them in preparing for \n     retirement, yet many of those employees may not be taking \n     advantage of those plans at all or to the full extent allowed \n     by Federal law;\n       Whereas the need to save for retirement is important even \n     during economic downturns or market declines, which make \n     continued contributions all the more important;\n       Whereas all workers, including public and private sector \n     employees, employees of tax-exempt organizations, and self-\n     employed individuals, can benefit from increased awareness of \n     the need to develop personal budgets and financial plans that \n     include retirement savings strategies and to take advantage \n     of the availability of tax-preferred savings vehicles to \n     assist workers in saving for retirement; and\n       Whereas October 16 through October 22, 2011, has been \n     designated as ``National Save for Retirement Week'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of ``National Save for \n     Retirement Week'', including raising public awareness of the \n     various tax-preferred retirement vehicles as important tools \n     for personal savings and retirement financial security;\n       (2) supports the need to raise public awareness of the \n     availability of a variety of ways to save for retirement \n     which are favored under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and \n     are utilized by many people in the United States, but which \n     should be utilized by more;\n       (3) supports the need to raise public awareness of the \n     importance of saving adequately for retirement and the \n     continued existence of tax-preferred employer-sponsored \n     retirement savings vehicles; and\n       (4) calls on the States, localities, schools, universities, \n     nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, and the \n     people of the United States to observe National Save for \n     Retirement Week with appropriate programs and activities, \n     with the goal of increasing retirement savings for all people \n     in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/04/senate-section/article/S6143-4", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 5, 2011\n\n  Mr. REID.
