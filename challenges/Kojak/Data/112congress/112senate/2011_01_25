Madam President, in the 2 weeks we were away from \nWashington, all of us absorbed the numbing tragedy and horrific attack \nin Tucson, AZ. The Nation mourned the loss, thanked the heroes, and \nwaited anxiously by a brave Congresswoman's hospital bedside. We \ncontinue to wish victims a full and speedy recovery and continue to \nkeep their families in our thoughts.\n  In the days since the Senate last convened, the Nation also resumed a \ndebate over the words, the tone, and the metaphors we use in the \nSenate, as well as along the campaign trail, on the Internet, and over \nthe airwaves. The national conversation about our national conversation \nis not new. It happens every year. Candidates promise it in every \nelection. But since the shooting in Tucson, calls for more careful \nlanguage have been multiplied and amplified.\n  There is no evidence that partisan politics played any role in this \nmonstrous attack. Even so, we should be more civil anyway. Being more \nmindful of the weight of our words always helps. We have much more to \ngain with civility and discretion.\n  In this new year, I hope we will return to the respect that has \nalways been a hallmark of the Senate. I hope my colleagues will join in \nrenewing our commitment to productive debate. Some may be inspired by \nthe town hall meetings of two Augusts ago, others by the heated \nelection debates. Some may be motivated by the conversations started \nafter Tucson, AZ, and many will seek more civility simply because it is \nthe right thing to do. Whatever the reason, I hope the return to more \nresponsible rhetoric is more than empty rhetoric. I intend to do my \npart.\n  What I am talking about goes beyond inflammatory allegations or hate \nspeech. It also means not questioning each other's motives or calling \ninto\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\nquestion the patriotism of a colleague who has been elected to serve \nhis State and his country.\n  But it is even more than that. As we more carefully choose our words, \nwe must also remember we do not have the luxury, as Senator Moynihan \nused to caution, to choose our own facts. If we are going to change the \nway we speak in the hope of changing the way we do business, we have to \nreintroduce truth into the public debate.\n  This doesn't mean just rephrasing an attack line from ``job-killing'' \nto ``job-destroying,'' as House Republicans have done in response to \nthe shooting. It means if there is no proof that a policy takes away \njobs--if in fact the evidence shows the opposite--we shouldn't pretend \nany differently. The nonpartisan referee we rely on for this data--the \nCongressional Budget Office--found that when it comes to health care \nreform--which is what the Republicans are talking about in this case--\nthe claim is simply not true. Changing our rhetoric requires us to \ndebate facts, not invent them.\n  In the coming weeks, much of the discussion on the Senate floor will \nrevolve around health care, the deficit, and debt limit--those three \nthings. Each of these issues affects the No. 1 issue in America, jobs. \nEach issue is complex. If we are going to make the right decisions and \npoint our economy back in the right direction, we have to start with a \nshared respect for the facts.\n  First, let's look at health care. Independent fact checkers examined \nall the political rhetoric of the last year. Given the intensity of the \nlegislative debates and the election season, there was a lot from which \nto choose. But one claim stood out above all--the habit of those \nopposed to health care to call it a ``government takeover.''\n  One of those nonpartisan experts, factcheck.org, called it plainly \n``false.'' Another, PolitiFact, a project of the St. Petersburg, FL \nTimes, called it the ``Lie of the Year.'' So if we are going to have an \nhonest debate about the health reform law we passed last year, retiring \nthis scare tactic would be a good place to start.\n  The deficit: Madam President, my friends on the other side are quick \nto associate the current President with the current deficit as if it \nhappened overnight and under his watch. But here is a brief review of \nthe facts.\n  In the 1990s, we balanced the budget under the direction of President \nClinton. At the beginning of the next century, America had a bigger \nsurplus than ever in its history. Over the next decade, while our \ntroops went into battle, the costs of two wars went off-budget. The \nrichest took home giant tax breaks but nobody paid the bill. A massive \nprescription drug program wasn't paid for either.\n  President Clinton left President Bush a record surplus. President \nBush left President Obama a record deficit. Those unpaid-for wars, tax \nbreaks, and programs are the reason we are in a hole today. What we do \nnext is fair game for debate. But facts, as President John Adams said, \nare stubborn things.\n  Finally, Madam President, the debt limit: We will soon debate the \ndebt limit. Earlier this month, the Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy \nGeithner, sent us each a letter as to what would happen if we don't \nraise that ceiling. It would be the first time in the history of \nAmerica that our country would default on our legal obligations. He \ndidn't share his partisan opinion in that letter; he simply laid out \nthe facts. This is what he wrote:\n\n       Default would effectively impose a significant and long-\n     lasting tax on all Americans and all American businesses and \n     could lead to the loss of millions of American jobs. Even a \n     short-term or limited default would have catastrophic \n     economic consequences that would last for decades.\n\n  What are some of those consequences? Our troops and veterans would no \nlonger get their paychecks. Our seniors would no longer get the Social \nSecurity and Medicare checks to which they are entitled. Student loans \nwould simply stop. On a larger scale, the Secretary of the Treasury \nwarned it would lead to a worse financial crisis than the one we are \nstill recovering from.\n  There soon will be lots of time to debate what we will do about the \ndebt limit, but these are the facts we must first acknowledge and \nconsider.\n  Finally, the American people voted in November for a divided \nlegislative branch of government, a Democratic Senate and Republican \nHouse. They didn't elect Houses led by competing political parties \nbecause they want us to compete; they did so because they want us to \ncooperate. We cannot cooperate without an honest debate and we cannot \nhave an honest debate if we insist that fiction is fact.\n  Mark Twain, a great Nevadan, once said:\n\n       If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.\n\n  He was right. Here is one thing every Senator should remember and \nnever forget: Although there are many different points of view in this \nbody, we all share the same reality.\n  I look forward to a productive Congress and we can do that by \ndebating the facts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S72-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S72]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROVIDING FOR A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS TO RECEIVE A MESSAGE FROM THE \n                               PRESIDENT\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, every grade school student knows that \nall three branches of the Federal Government in Washington are equal, \nbut as every Member of Congress quickly learns, the President sets the \nagenda. Never is that more apparent than on the day of the State of the \nUnion Address. This year the President will be speaking to a Congress \nthat looks very different from the one he spoke to last year. The \nvoters sent a clear message in November that when it comes to jobs and \nthe economy, the administration's policies have done far more damage \nthan good.\n  One very positive thing that the President could do tonight is to \nacknowledge they have a point. He has tried to do so indirectly in \nrecent weeks by hiring new staff and by speaking in tones of \nmoderation, but it takes more than a change in tone to improve the \neconomy. It takes more than a change in tone to reduce the debt. It \ntakes more than a change in tone to help create the right conditions \nfor private-sector job growth. It takes a change in policy, and the \nearly signals suggest the President isn't quite there yet.\n  The President has talked recently about working together to improve a \nregulatory climate that stifles business innovation and job growth. Yet \nhe has not acknowledged the extent to which his own policies have \nstifled growth. Over the past 2 years, his administration has issued \nmore than 130 economically significant new rules or 40 percent more \nthan the annual rate under the last two Presidents. What is worse,\n\n[[Page S73]]\n\nthe new health care bill will alone create 159 new bureaucratic \nentities and it is exempt from the President's proposed regulatory \nreforms. The health care bill, which will create 159 new bureaucratic \nentities, is exempt from the President's proposed regulatory reforms. \nThis is bad news for small business that was already struggling to get \nby in a down economy and which is now grappling with how to afford all \nthe new mandates in the new health care bill.\n  The President has talked about streamlining and reducing the burden \nof government. Yet the health care bill he has signed is already \nincreasing the cost of care and forcing people out of their existing \ncoverage. The debate over this bill continues and the President and \nDemocrats in Congress continue to defend it. But when nearly two-thirds \nof doctors surveyed predicted it will make health care in America \nworse, Americans are right to be concerned. It should tell us something \nthat of the 19 doctors currently in Congress, 18 of them support repeal \nof the health care bill.\n  The President has talked about the need to cut spending and reduce \nthe debt. Yet over the last 2 years his policies have added more than \n$3 trillion to the national debt, much of it through a stimulus that \npromised to keep unemployment--now hovering just below double digits--\nfrom rising above 8 percent. And now we hear that he plans to stick \nwith the same failed approach of economic growth through even more \ngovernment spending with a call for ``investments'' in education, \ninfrastructure, research, and renewable energy.\n  We have seen before what Democrats in Washington mean by investments. \nIn promoting the failed stimulus, the President referred to that too as \nan investment in our Nation's future. Fourteen times alone during his \nsigning statement he referred to the stimulus bill's investments. We \nall know how that turned out.\n  The first stimulus, we were told, would include critical so-called \ninvestments in education, infrastructure, scientific research, and \nrenewable energy--the same areas we are told he will focus on tonight. \nOnly later did we learn that some of these critical investments \nincluded things such as repairs on tennis courts, a study on the mating \ndecisions of cactus bugs, hundreds of thousands of dollars for a plant \ndatabase, and a $535 million loan to a California solar panel maker \nwhich, instead of hiring 1,000 new workers as planned, just laid off \n175 instead.\n  This is what happens when the government decides to pick winners and \nlosers without considering what the marketplace wants. Competitors are \nleft out in the cold, employees get a false sense of security, and \ntaxpayers are left holding the bag. Unfortunately, the President does \nnot seem to have learned this lesson quite yet. But taxpayers now know \nthat when Democrats talk about investments they should grab their \nwallets.\n  So I am all for the President changing his tune, but unless he has a \ntime machine, he cannot change his record. If we are going to make any \nreal progress in the areas of spending, debt, and reining in \ngovernment, the President will have to acknowledge that the policies of \nthe past 2 years are not only largely to blame for the situation we \nfind ourselves in, but that unless we do something to reverse their ill \neffects, the road to recovery and prosperity will be a bumpy one.\n  The President has spoken in the tones of a moderate many times. He \ndid so in his campaign. He has done so in countless speeches. He has a \nknack for it. I have no doubt he will do so again tonight. But speeches \nonly last for as long as they are delivered. Americans are more \ninterested in what follows the speech and, in the case of this \nadministration, Americans have good reason to be skeptical. Time and \ntime again the President has spoken in a way that appeals to many, then \ngoverned in a way that does not. My hope is he will leave that method \naside. A better path, in my view, is the one Republicans have been \nproposing for 2 years, one that respects both the wishes of the public \nand the two-party system.\n\n  Last year, prior to the President's State of the Union, I proposed a \nnumber of areas where I thought the two parties could find common \nground and work together to help the economy. The President ignored \njust about everything I proposed. So when the pundits ask whether there \nare areas where the two parties could come together, I would say yes, I \nhave proposed several of them, but the Democrats don't seem to be \ninterested. Some have suggested that in this new post-election \nenvironment I might find a more receptive audience. So in the spirit of \nbipartisanship, I wish to propose once again a few areas where I \nbelieve the two parties can work together in the weeks and months \nahead.\n  I believe the parties can and should work together on energy \ninitiatives that expand America's domestic energy supply and make us \nless reliant on foreign sources; on expanding exports and creating jobs \nthrough free trade agreements with Panama, Colombia, and South Korea; \nand on reforming corporate taxes so American businesses are more \ncompetitive in an increasingly global marketplace. These are just a few \nof the things we can do beyond the symbolic gestures and the posturing \nto help the economy.\n  Beyond that, we must work to cut spending and to rein in the size and \nscope and cost of government. The voters have been crystal clear on \nthis point. By proposing more government spending tonight, the \nPresident is not only defying their will, he is refusing to learn the \nclear lesson of the failed stimulus--government may create debt but it \ndoesn't create jobs.\n  I think we have a lot of work to do in bringing the two parties \ntogether in a program that will actually address the problems we face. \nBut there are reasons for optimism. The President's change in tone is \nan acknowledgement at least that something has to change, as was his \nwillingness to work with Republicans last month to keep taxes from \ngoing up on anyone. In the coming weeks and months Americans will be \nlooking to him to come around on spending and debt as well, and \nRepublicans will be working hard to persuade him to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S73-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S73]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, last week President Hu Jintao of China \ncame to Chicago after he was received in Washington. He was received in \na gala manner in that great city and I happened to be there for the \ndinner. There were leaders of the community and business all there \nbecause China has become an important part of American life. It wasn't \nthat long ago that China was stuck in the past. We can recall the \nChinese in their green quilted identical clothes on their bicycles \nholding their ``Little Red Books'' of Chairman Mao's great quotations \nand basically being discounted and dismissed as not a major factor.\n  In the world economy today, China is a major factor and that is why \nthe remarks of the Republican minority leader need to be put in \nperspective. The real question the President will ask us tonight is, is \nAmerica ready to compete in the 21st century? Do we have what it takes \nto regain the edge when it comes to manufacturing jobs and to be \ncompetitive? The challenge the President offers us is to do what is \nresponsible when it comes to our budgeting but not to forget the \ninvestments necessary in our future. When I look at how the United \nStates is likely to succeed, you have to start with education and \ntraining. We have to have an educated workforce, the best in the world. \nWe have to reward innovation; provide the kind of research incentives \nat the Federal Government level that lead to the commercialization of \nproducts and ultimately manufacture and production that grows our \neconomy.\n  If we walk away from that, if we say that the United States can no \nlonger\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\nafford to invest in America, we are walking away from what is essential \nfor our competitive edge. When I hear the Republican leader stand and \nsay we cannot afford these investments in America anymore, I wonder \nwhat his vision is when it comes to our competitive edge. I think it is \nimportant that we maintain that. The President is going to do that, I \nbelieve, in the context of responsible budgeting.\n  For the record, we had a deficit commission proposed on a bipartisan \nbasis last year by Senator Conrad and Senator Gregg, and it was a \ncommission that came up for a vote on the floor of the Senate. Does the \nSenator from New Hampshire remember what happened? We failed to pass \nthis deficit commission when seven Republican Senators, who were \ncosponsors, came down and voted against it.\n  The President had no choice at that point but to start an executive \ncommission, on which I was proud to serve, and that executive \ncommission did not have the binding authority that the legislative \ncommission did, which was defeated by the Republicans on the floor of \nthe Senate. So, now, as they pose for holy pictures in deficit \nreduction, they want us to erase that memory of seven Republican \nSenators, cosponsors, who turned and reversed their position when it \ncame to this deficit commission.\n  I served on this commission. The one thing the commission reminded us \nof over and over is that when we hit the deficit brake, do not hit it \ntoo soon or we can skid off the road. We can be back into a deeper \nrecession if we are not careful.\n  There is good news--not as much as we would like, but there is good \nnews. A CNN opinion research poll released this morning said the \npercentage of the American people who felt things are going well is up \n14 points since December. And the polling director said: We have not \nseen numbers like this since April of 2007. One likely reason for the \nchange is the public's growing optimism about the economy. Why is it \nthat this good news about the economy makes the Republicans feel so sad \nand gloomy? It is an indication we are moving in the right direction.\n  When the Senator from Kentucky gets up and says: Government just \ncreates debt, it does not create jobs, that was not the speech we heard \nwhen we extended the tax cuts. Exactly the opposite was said on the \nfloor of the Senate. Republican Senators stood up and said: Give tax \ncuts to people, and they are going to be able to spend more money for \ngoods and services and have more confidence in the future.\n  That was a government decision--a government decision endorsed by the \nPresident and a strong bipartisan majority in the Senate and the House. \nThe government can work in a positive way.\n  Let me say one word about health care. I listened carefully as \nRepublican after Republican came to the floor to decry the notion that \nthere would be a government-administered health care plan. Now, it is \nnot a government health insurance plan; it is private health insurance \nadministered through the government and insurance exchanges to give \neverybody a chance to have health insurance. But those on the other \nside who stand up and decry government-administered health insurance \nplans are, in fact, insured under a government-administered health care \nplan called the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n  So I would basically say this: We all know the Hippocratic Oath, and \nwe all know the saying ``Physician, heal thyself.'' I would say to \nthose Republican Senators calling for repeal of health care for the \nrest of America, first, Senators, repeal your own. Step away from the \ngovernment-administered health care plan. If you find it so \nobjectionable for the rest of America, then reject it when it comes to \nyour own health insurance. Members of the Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans, I think without exception, are all members of the \ngovernment-administered health care plan. If it is good enough for \nMembers of the Senate, why is it not good enough for the rest of \nAmerica? I think that is the basics.\n  Let me close by saying this: When it comes to trade agreements, I \nbelieve we should have good ones, ones that are fair to American \nworkers and businesses, ones that are enforced when there are unfair \ntrade practices. But we have to be careful as well that we have a tax \ncode that also rewards good conduct by American businesses.\n  Our Tax Code currently subsidizes America corporations that want to \nship production overseas. Why in the world would we spend a dollar in \nour tax money to reward a company that wants to remove a job from \nAmerica? Over and over again, we have begged the Republicans to join us \nin a bipartisan effort to end this subsidy for shipping jobs overseas. \nThat would be a good way to build the economy here in America, create \ngood-paying jobs here at home, and invest in a country which has a \nbright future if we do not get caught up in the political rhetoric of \nthe day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I would like to call timeout from this \npartisan discussion to speak for a moment about the events in Tucson of \nJanuary 8. It is the first opportunity I have had to address my \ncolleagues about the tragedy of that day. The theme I would like to \ndiscuss is the goodness of people because if I have gotten any lesson \nfrom this, after meeting and talking with all of the people whom I \ncould who were involved in this tragedy, the overwhelming notion of the \ngoodness of people is what I am most left with.\n  Tomorrow, Senator McCain and I will offer a resolution in support of \nthe victims of the shooting, offering condolences to those who were \nlost and their loved ones and our prayers for the recovery of those who \nwere injured and expressing appreciation to those who engaged in real \nacts of heroism. We will have time more formally to talk about it when \nwe do that tomorrow, but I wanted to share some thoughts from my heart \nbased on my interaction with the people over the last 2 weeks after \nthis event occurred.\n  It begins with the proposition that Tucson likes to call itself a \ntown, not a city. It is over half a million people. But you are all \nfamiliar with communities which, though large in numbers, seem small \nbecause people work together, they play together, and they have a sense \nof community and of helping and working with each other. That is \nTucson, where my wife and I both attended the University of Arizona. \nThe Safeway where this event occurred is only two blocks from my Tucson \noffice, and the head of my Tucson office and his staff were at the \nSafeway that Saturday morning shopping, and they left about 7 or 8 \nminutes before this occurred.\n  Judge John Roll, who was a very close friend and attended Mass \nvirtually every morning, had just come from Mass and had decided to \ncome to the Safeway to express his appreciation to Representative \nGabrielle Giffords. They were friends. Among other things, he wanted to \ntell her he appreciated her signing a letter, along with Representative \nGrijalva, that supported the Arizona Federal District Court in its \ndesire to be named an emergency district by the commission that does \nthat for the Federal courts because of the overwhelming caseload in \nthat court.\n  Judge Roll, though he had significant administrative \nresponsibilities, kept a full caseload himself because to do otherwise \nwould have been to put part of the burden onto his colleagues. So he \nwas really carrying two separate loads, administering a very busy \ncourt, and at the same time acting as a judge on all of his cases.\n  One of the things he and I had been working on--in fact, Senator \nBarrasso, Senator LeMieux, and I had lunch with Judge Roll the Friday \nafter the election to talk about how we could strengthen the courts, \nespecially because of the crushing caseload from drug and immigration \ncases because that is the district that is right down on the border. \nPart of his work, which I was working with him on, was to try to find \nways to ameliorate the load of this court and potentially get some \nadditional magistrates, if not judges, to help handle the caseload.\n  When Representative Giffords decided to hold this ``Congress on Your \nCorner'' event, many of the people on her Tucson staff went with her to \nthe event. They are very devoted to her. I\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\ndo not know anyone who enjoys meeting with constituents more than \nRepresentative Giffords. So she had several staff people there too. \nWhen the gunman came, he immediately headed for her. His intention was \nobviously to do her harm, but right after shooting Representative \nGiffords, he began to shoot the people on her staff and the others \nwaiting in line to talk to her.\n  This is where some of the goodness of the people comes out. I mean, I \ntalked about the goodness of the people. Judge Roll did not have to say \n``thank you'' to Representative Giffords, but he went out of his way to \ntry to do that. When Ron Barber, the head of Representative Giffords' \nTucson staff, was shot, Judge Roll, the cameras show, pushed him down \nunder a table and put his body over Ron Barber's body and thus took the \nbullet that killed John Roll. Talk about the goodness of people.\n  At his funeral, everyone in Tucson and in Arizona who knew Judge Roll \nspoke not just of his abilities as a jurist and his public service but \nhis goodness, his love for his wife Maureen, their three sons, their \ngrandchildren. Incidentally, three of his grandchildren spoke. It was \nso moving when they talked about the love they had for their \ngrandfather, who took a lot of time with each of them to teach them how \nto swim, to play basketball, and so on. The goodness of people.\n  Representative Giffords' staff was there. They liked her and were \nvery willing to be with her on a Saturday morning when they could have \nbeen doing something else with their families.\n  Gabe Zimmerman, just 30 years old, was one of those staff people, and \nhe, too, lost his life. My staff in Tucson really enjoyed working with \nGabe. Now, I am a Republican, they are Republicans, and Gabe is a \nDemocrat working for a Democratic Representative. That did not matter \nto them. They really enjoyed working together for the same \nconstituents. And I will tell you, my Tucson staff has taken his loss \nvery hard.\n  There were others from his staff who were there, one of whom is an \nintern we are going to see this evening. He is going to be sitting in \nthe President's box. His name is Daniel Hernandez. We saw him at the \nceremony in Tucson at the University of Arizona on Wednesday after the \nshooting. He was one of the people who immediately went to \nRepresentative Giffords' aid and continued to staunch her bleeding. The \ngoodness of people--his unselfish act to help her.\n  Pam Simon was another one of her staffers who were shot. I had a \nchance to visit with Pam in the hospital and then after. There she is \nwith wounds. A bullet went in and out of her arm and another in her \nleg. She could not wait to get back to work, and she has done so now.\n  The other people who were shot there--Christina Taylor Green was the \n9-year-old. The things that were said about her remind me so much of my \ngranddaughter, my youngest granddaughter. The hugest heart you can ever \nimagine, athletic and yet studious, interested in government--all the \nthings you would want in a young woman. President Obama spoke \neloquently about her in his remarks on that Wednesday. She was taken to \nthe event with a friend who just wanted to expose her to Representative \nGiffords and a little bit about our government.\n  Dorothy Morris. Now, I did not know Dorothy, but I knew her husband \nGeorge. They had communicated with me, and I visited with George a \ncouple of times after this event. He is a retired marine. I will tell \nyou, he is having a hard time with this because he said that Dot, his \nwife, would follow him--in his words, ``She would follow me to hell.'' \nWell, she is obviously in a different place, and he is going to be as \nwell. But the fact is, she did not particularly want to go that \nmorning, but he is a Republican, he wanted to go talk to Representative \nGiffords because he thought he could talk to her just in the way that \nwe do about issues and have a good conversation with somebody he did \nnot totally agree with.\n\n  Dorwan and Mavy Stoddard. Dorwan was killed. His whole recent life \nwas devoted to service at his church. I visited with Mavy at her home. \nHer two daughters were there and a very good friend of ours, Ed \nBiggers, from Tucson, who also attends their church. The kindness of \nall of those people and the way they talked about the others involved, \nas well as, as you can see, the members of family and friends helping \neach other, was, as I said, an impression that will stick with me \nforever.\n  Phyllis Schneck, who everyone agreed was a wonderful grandmother, \nspent her winters in Tucson--she lived in New Jersey.\n  All of these folks were human beings with friends, with family, with \nfutures, and to have all of them taken from us is a real tragedy.\n  What can we take from that? At this time, I think I have gone almost \n10 minutes. Tomorrow, I will mention some of the other heroes. I will \ntake a second with some of them, though.\n  Bill Badger, a retired Army colonel, did not want to talk about his \nheroism, but he helped to subdue the assailant.\n  Anna Ballis, who has two sons, both of whom are U.S. marines who have \ndone repeated tours in Afghanistan and Iraq, was in the Safeway, came \nout, and immediately began administering to Ron Barber. I went to visit \nRon in the hospital at the same time Anna had gotten there, a few \nminutes before, and Ron was holding her hand the entire time, saying: \nThis is the lady who saved my life. Just a tremendous act of selfless \ncourage on her part and showing again the wonderful humanity of all of \nthe people there.\n  Steve Rayle, a doctor, a former emergency room doc, was there and \nhelped to subdue the assailant and so on.\n  There are many others. We will talk about some of the others tomorrow \nwhen we express more formally our views on this resolution. I know all \nof our colleagues will want to join us in supporting this resolution to \nlet the folks of Tucson know we appreciate what they have endured here, \nwe appreciate the heroism. Our prayers are with the victims, and our \nhearts go out to all of those who were injured in some way or other.\n  From this, among the lessons we learned is that people have innate \ngoodness. We all have a side of us that we wish we did not have \nsometimes too frequently expressed on the floor of this body. But maybe \nfor a little while, we can acknowledge the fact that there is goodness \nin everyone, and I saw so much of that in all of these people drawn \nfrom all over the community, different walks of life, different \npolitical parties, different ages. Yet when they came together, what \nwas most obvious? It was their sacrifice and their goodness. I think \nthat is something that should be a lesson to all of us.\n  Tomorrow, I will speak more formally, as I said, about this \nresolution. But I am deeply grateful for the expressions of condolence \nand support all of my colleagues have presented to me and to Senator \nMcCain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I certainly grieve and also appreciate \nall the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Arizona. What a \ntragedy. But there are heroes there as well. I thank the Senator for \nhis comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S75-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S75-S80]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DISTURBING FISCAL SITUATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, in recent months President Obama has \nfrequently discussed our Nation's disturbing fiscal situation.\n  He is right to do so.\n  Our yearly deficits and accumulated debt hang over the futures of our \nchildren and grandchildren like a sword of Damocles.\n  Though he was late to the table on this issue, President Obama seems \nto have finally recognized the frustration and anger of the American \npeople over our Federal fiscal policy.\n  Recognizing that you have a problem is an important first step, and I \napplaud the administration for speaking about our Nation's structural \ndeficits.\n  But this is a critical issue, and any solution will require that \nthose responsible give a full and fair accounting of the policies that \nled to this crisis.\n  Unfortunately, rather than own up to his administration's complicity \nin our fiscal imbalance, the President prefers to blame our current and \nfuture fiscal problems on the previous administration.\n  For this President, the buck always seems to stop over there.\n  This trope is getting old.\n  Well before citizens began organizing against this administration and \nits historic spending spree, the President and\n\n[[Page S76]]\n\nhis Democratic allies in Congress were justifying their stimulus \nprogram by blaming the previous administration. Yet trying to pass off \nthe consequences of the last 2 years on a long-retired President and a \nCongress that ended over 4 years ago is no longer plausible.\n  Try as they might, revisionist fiscal history will not absolve our \nfriends on the other side for the fiscal decisions made on their watch.\n  I will explain that point separately, and in detail, in a few days.\n  It is well past time that this administration stop pointing fingers. \nThe American people are demanding that their elected Representatives, \nin Congress and the White House, act like adults and fix this fiscal \nmess.\n  In a few weeks, President Obama will send Congress his third budget.\n  The fact that Treasury Secretary Geithner has already written us \nrequesting legislation to raise the debt ceiling does not bode well for \ncitizens seeking greater spending restraint from this administration. \nThe people of Utah and of this Nation deserve a fair accounting of the \nspending decisions that have led to this request.\n  Let me be clear.\n  The President's desire for a larger level of public debt is a \nconsequence of the fiscal policy choices that he and a Democratic \nCongress have made over the last 2 years.\n  Between 2007 and 2010, Democrats enjoyed unprecedented control over \nFederal policy. When the President was inaugurated 2 years ago, he set \nto work with historic majorities in both the House and Senate.\n  Never letting a crisis go to waste, he sought a fundamental \nrestructuring of the American economy, one in which government would \nplay a starring role.\n  Thanks to our Founders' design, the American people were able to go \nto the ballot box and give their opinion about these spending policies.\n  Unfortunately, the administration and its allies did not curb their \nspending in response to democratic uprisings.\n  The people spoke--first in Virginia and New Jersey, then in \nMassachusetts, and finally, last summer, nationwide.\n  But the Democrats, rather than adjust their policies accordingly, \njust kept on spending.\n  The tab for this binge is almost beyond description. In the 2 years \nthat Democrats controlled Washington, our debt has risen by almost $3 \ntrillion.\n  I have a chart documenting these staggering hikes in the debt limit.\n  During the short period of all-Democratic rule, the law was changed \nto raise the debt ceiling on three separate occasions.\n  On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed a debt limit increase \nbill of $789 billion, the cost of the stimulus bill at that time.\n  On December 28, 2009, President Obama signed a debt limit increase \nbill of $290 billion.\n  And on February 12, 2010, President Obama signed a third debt limit \nincrease bill of $1.9 trillion.\n  These dollar figures, in terms of the percentage of the economy they \nrepresent, are breathtaking. I, like most other Members on both sides \nof the aisle, eagerly await the President's State of the Union Address. \nThe President is a gifted speaker. And in his usual, eloquent manner, I \nam sure he will skillfully lay out his fiscal and economic policy \ngoals.\n  As the incoming ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, let me \nbe the first to say that Republicans are happy to hear the President \ncontemplating serious deficit reduction proposals. We would be \noverjoyed if he actually took a stand for a meaningful attack on \nstructural deficits and the debt.\n  But we will judge his proposals harshly if they provide mere window \ndressing, rather than bold efforts to address a spending trajectory \nthat is approaching crisis status.\n  Willie Sutton, the infamous bank robber, was asked why he robbed \nbanks.\n  By the way, here is a chart depicting a photo of Mr. Sutton from \nLife.com.\n  How would Willie respond?\n  He allegedly said he robbed banks because that is where the money is.\n  If President Obama wants to propose credible deficit reduction \nproposals, he needs to go where the deficit dollars are.\n  And what is the source of those deficits?\n  Taking Willie Sutton's answer to heart, where do we look for those \ndeficits?\n  They are in the trillions of dollars in new spending that the \nAmerican taxpayer has been burdened with by this administration.\n  Non-defense discretionary spending, by itself, has grown by 24 \npercent over the last couple of years.\n  And that 24 percent figure does not include the stimulus bill \nspending.\n  If stimulus spending is included, nondefense discretionary spending \nhas grown by 84 percent.\n  That is right, Madam President, 84 percent.\n  How many typical taxpaying American families have grown their budgets \nby that much in the last couple of years?\n  Let's take a look at the Gallup weekly survey of daily consumer \nspending as a comparison. I have a chart which shows the trend line in \ndaily consumer spending.\n  Over here, we can see from the chart consumer spending before the \nfinancial crisis of fall 2008 and the recession.\n  It is running near or above $100 per day.\n  Then what happens?\n  Americans cut back their extra spending.\n  It is right here on the rest of the chart.\n  Is it any wonder Americans are telling us to cut our spending?\n  They have cut spending. Why can't we in Washington do the same?\n  When the President laid out his last two budgets, the loudest \nbipartisan applause came when he stressed fiscal discipline.\n  That reaction should surprise no one. Though conservatives led the \nway, the American people understand that deficit reduction is not a \npartisan issue. If the promises of our Declaration of Independence and \nConstitution--promises of liberty and opportunity--are to mean anything \nfor future generations, our country needs to take up deficit reduction \nnow.\n  Republicans are going to insist on meaningful deficit reduction as a \ncourse correction to our currently unsustainable fiscal path. As our \nNation comes out of this painful slow-growth period--hopefully sooner \nrather than later--we must focus on cutting the deficit and the debt.\n  As Republicans, we agree with the President on the priority of fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  But deeds mean more than words.\n  And twice, the President's budget, in spite of rhetorical nods to \nfiscal discipline, has gone in the direction of unpaid-for spending, \nnew government programs and entitlements, and massive financial burdens \non the next generation of American taxpayers.\n  The numbers don't lie.\n  The President and the Democratic leadership have dramatically \nexpanded the deficit and piled onto the debt.\n  Two years ago, Republicans and Democrats dramatically disagreed on \nthe stimulus bill. Out of all the Republicans in the House and Senate, \nonly three supported the stimulus bill conference report.\n  Along with most of my Republican colleagues, I rejected this stimulus \nbill for several reasons.\n  First was the size and the form of the stimulus. Most on our side \nunderstood that $1 trillion in deficit spending was an unacceptable \nburden on the people who would ultimately foot the bill.\n  Second, we questioned the focus of the stimulus. We weren't keen on \ntrying to grow the economy by priming the government pump. Spending $1 \ntrillion of taxpayer money on the academic theory that you have to \nspend money to make money was a gamble the American taxpayer could not \nafford. And last year, while the administration and its allies were out \npromoting recovery summer, citizens in Utah and around the country had \nlong before figured out that the administration's stimulus bet was a \nbig loser.\n  Finally, what disturbed us most was the hidden fiscal burden built \ninto the bill. Although sold as a $787 billion bill, the real cost of \nthe stimulus was, in fact, much higher.\n  I am going to use a chart to show this hidden cost of the stimulus \nbill. This chart was produced last year but will be updated when we \nreceive the Congressional Budget Office baseline.\n  According to the nonpartisan CBO, if popular new programs in the \nstimulus\n\n[[Page S77]]\n\nbill are made permanent, the cost will be $3.3 trillion.\n  To use Washington speak, the greatest threat of the new stimulus bill \nwas that it raised the baseline.\n  This is a nifty trick if you can pull it off.\n  Its purpose is to open any future spending cuts, no matter how \nmodest, to withering attack.\n  Here is how it works.\n  First, Democrats raise spending for some program--to borrow from \nGeorge Costanza, we will call it The Human Fund.\n  After Democrats take control of Congress and the White House, \nspending for The Human Fund goes up by 25 percent, from $1,000,000 to \n$1,250,000.\n  Then, when the people reject this spending and send Republicans to \nroll it back, efforts to cut that spending by a meager 5 percent, from \n$1,250,000 to $1,187,500, leads all of the interest groups dependent on \nthis federal money to scream that the sky is falling.\n  An attack on The Human Fund is an attack on all that is decent in \nthis country!\n  Never mind that this program is still substantially better off than \nbefore the Democrats' massive increase in spending.\n  All that we will hear is that Republicans are ruthlessly seeking to \ncut 5 percent from this program's budget.\n  And so it goes.\n  Our deficit and debt continue to grow as irresponsible and \nunaffordable increases in spending are baked into our budgetary cake.\n  This strategy of raising the baseline is on full display in the \nstimulus bill and the threat that its programs--sold to the public as \ntemporary--will become permanent.\n  This chart details CBO's analysis of the stimulus.\n  Let us move from left to right on the chart.\n  The first column is the basic cost of the bill. If the making work \npay refundable tax credit is extended, there is $571 billion in future \ndeficits.\n  It is in the second column.\n  If the new entitlement spending in the stimulus is made permanent, \nthen the cost of the bill more than doubles.\n  It means almost $1 trillion in new hidden entitlement spending right \nhere.\n  In the fourth column, we have the appropriations spending.\n  If those increases become permanent, then there is $276 billion in \nnew nondefense discretionary appropriations in this bill.\n  Finally, we have the rent on all this borrowed money. That is the \ninterest expense. CBO tells us that the interest cost alone on the \novert new spending and the hidden new spending from the stimulus totals \n$744 billion.\n  Total it all up, and we get $3.3 trillion, not $787 billion.\n  The total cost of the stimulus is $3.3 trillion.\n  Our Nation can simply no longer afford this.\n  These are CBO figures. They are not from a conservative think tank.\n  There are a couple of simple ways for the stimulus bill supporters to \ncorrect this trajectory.\n  If they want to keep the long-term cost of the stimulus down, they \ncould agree to make all of the stimulus provisions temporary.\n  Or they could agree to offset extensions of stimulus spending with \nother spending cuts.\n  But our friends on the other side have done just the opposite. They \nhave insisted on extending the policy in the stimulus bill without \noffsets in other areas of spending.\n  You will recall then National Economic Council Director Larry \nSummers' three Ts tests for stimulus.\n  To be effective, the stimulus needed to be timely, targeted, and \ntemporary.\n  It is failure on that third T, the temporary test, which has been \nvery troubling. Two years into this failed economic experiment, and \nDemocrats still refuse to agree that temporary stimulus proposals \nshould remain temporary.\n  The path forward is not going to be easy.\n  While we do have a recent example of deficit reduction, it was not \ngenerated by this administration or its congressional allies. If you \nwant to look at enacted legislation over the last decade, there is one \nsignificant spending reduction bill. It was the Deficit Reduction Act \nof 2005. It contained a modest amount of deficit reduction.\n  The deficit reduction attained was $35 billion. And how did we \nachieve those savings? That bill was accomplished through \nreconciliation. The other side opposed it in lock step.\n  In the end, only Republican votes carried that stand-alone deficit \nreduction measure.\n  Yet now American taxpayers are being asked to believe that Democrats \nhave found religion on deficits and debt.\n  Our friends on the other side will, no doubt, say time out. We have \nproduced a significant deficit reduction bill, they will say.\n  They will point to last year's ObamaCare legislation. They will argue \nthat this bill, which creates massive new entitlements, somehow saves \nmoney. Our Democratic friends will even cite a CBO score showing $230 \nbillion in deficit reduction from this bill.\n  This assertion does not pass the laugh test.\n  Anyone who looks beyond the basic score will see that ObamaCare is \nanother huge deficit generator that will burden the American taxpayer \nfor generations to come.\n  House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan released an analysis, \nderived from CBO data, that tells the full story of ObamaCare's deficit \nimpact. Here is what Chairman Ryan said:\n\n       Claims of deficit reduction exclude the $115 billion needed \n     to implement the law. The score double-counts $521 billion \n     from Social Security payroll taxes, CLASS Act premiums, and \n     Medicare cuts. It strips a costly doc-fix provision that was \n     included in initial score. It measures 10 years of revenues \n     to offset 6 years of new spending. There is no question that \n     the creation of a new trillion-dollar, open-ended entitlement \n     is a fiscal train wreck.\n\n  Add it all up and the fiscal reality is that ObamaCare busts the \nbudget by $701 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Chairman Ryan's analysis be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nFive Budget Reasons To Repeal the Democrats' Costly New Health Care Law\n\n       1. Take away smoke and mirrors and law adds over $700 \n     billion to deficits: Democrats' score excludes the $115 \n     billion needed to implement the law; double-counts $521 \n     billion from Social Security payroll taxes, CLASS Act \n     premiums, and Medicare cuts; and fails to account for the \n     costly ``doc-fix'' provision that Democrats stripped out of \n     the bill and passed separately.\n       2. Massive tax increase minus slightly less massive \n     spending increase isn't ``fiscal responsibility'': According \n     to CBO, the Democrats'' law will ``reduce deficits'' by \n     increasing taxes by $770 billion, while ``only'' increasing \n     net spending by $540 billion. That's not the kind of \n     ``deficit reduction'' we're interested in. Furthermore, we \n     believe spending will actually be much higher.\n       3. True cost 10-year cost of the law is closer to $2.6 \n     trillion: The Democrats rigged their law to show 10 years of \n     revenues offsetting only 6 years of new spending. A true 10-\n     year score of the new spending in the law puts the cost \n     closer to $2.6 trillion. Costs could run even higher if \n     employers dump their employees onto government exchanges and \n     Medicare ``savings'' fail to materialize.\n       4. This law bends the cost curve up, not down: Exploding \n     health care costs are bankrupting families, companies, \n     states, and the federal government. The Democrats' new health \n     care law--with its maze of mandates, dictates, controls, tax \n     hikes and subsidies--will drive costs up even faster.\n       CBO Director Doug Elmendorf says new law ``does not \n     substantially diminish'' pressure of rising health care costs \n     on the federal government.\n       Medicare/Medicaid Chief Actuary Richard Foster says that \n     the law would result in ``higher health expenditures,'' \n     straining budget to the breaking point.\n       5. Creation of a new open-ended entitlement isn't ``fiscal \n     responsibility'': The reality is that we cannot pay for the \n     health care entitlements we have, much less a new government \n     takeover of health care that adds trillions of dollars to our \n     existing liabilities, drives costs up even faster, and puts \n     the federal government in charge of even more health care \n     decision-making.\n       The only way to control costs when the government is in \n     charge of the system is for bureaucrats to ration care.\n       The path to greater choice for patients and lower costs for \n     all must begin with a full repeal of the Democrats' costly \n     new health care law.\n\n       The True Deficit Impact of the Democrats' Health Care Law\n\n       Bottom line: The Democrats' health care law is a budget-\n     buster. Claims of deficit reduction exclude the $115 billion \n     needed to implement the law. The score double-counts $521 \n     billion from Social Security payroll\n\n[[Page S78]]\n\n     taxes, CLASS Act premiums, and Medicare cuts. It strips a \n     costly doc-fix provision that was included in initial score. \n     It measures 10 years of revenues to offset 6 years of new \n     spending. There is no question that the creation of a new \n     trillion-dollar, open-ended entitlement is a fiscal train \n     wreck.\n       Over $700 billion in red ink: To hide the true cost of \n     their $2.6 trillion health-care overhaul, the Democrats \n     loaded the overhaul with gimmicks and double-counting. Once \n     these gimmicks are accounted for, the law would add over $700 \n     billion in red ink over the next decade, as health-care costs \n     send the debt spiraling out of control.\n       Discretionary Spending: The CBO score did not include the \n     cost of setting up and administering the massive overhaul, \n     including the cost of hiring new health-care bureaucrats to \n     run the new spending programs, as well as thousands of IRS \n     agents to enforce the new mandates.\n       Accounting for these discretionary appropriations would add \n     $115 billion to the bill's 10-year cost, all but wiping out \n     its alleged ``savings.''\n       Double-Counting: The new law double-counts an estimated \n     $521 billion in alleged offsets:\n       Social Security will receive an additional $53 billion in \n     higher payroll tax revenue as a result of the new law. \n     Instead of setting aside this revenue for promised Social \n     Security benefits, the law spends it on new subsidies.\n       The Democrats' bill created the CLASS program, a brand new \n     long-term care entitlement. Over the first 10 years, program \n     would take in $70 billion in premiums, but instead of setting \n     money aside to pay for future benefits, the law spends the \n     premiums on new subsidies. Senate Budget Chairman Kent Conrad \n     called the CLASS Act: ``A Ponzi scheme [that] Bernie Madoff \n     would have been proud of.''\n       Democrats claim they are extending solvency of Medicare by \n     cutting $398 billion from the program, but they \n     simultaneously claim that these savings will offset new \n     subsidy programs. CBO has made clear these savings cannot be \n     used twice.\n       The Doc Fix: The Democrats' bill originally included the \n     ``doc fix'' that CBO estimated would add $208 billion to the \n     bill's score. Democrats removed this provision to lower the \n     bill's CBO score, but promised doctors that they would enact \n     the fix later, and did in fact pass a short-term prevention \n     of cuts to physician payments last year, adding to the \n     deficit.\n       Add It Up: Take $115 billion in discretionary costs, plus \n     $521 billion in double-counting, plus $208 billion for a \n     long-term doc fix (minus the $143 billion of claimed \n     savings)--and the law would add $701 billion to the deficit \n     over the next 10 years.\n       The Democrats' brand new open-ended health care entitlement \n     will--unless repealed--exacerbate the spiraling cost of \n     health care, explode our deficit and debt, and forever alter \n     the relationship between government and the American people.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. This double counting of the Medicare cuts is a dangerous \naccounting gambit. Former Senator Gregg and I warned the Medicare \ntrustees about it in a letter last year. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Hatch, Gregg Urge Medicare Trustees to Provide ``An Accurate and \n       Complete Assessment of New Health Law's Impact on Medicare\n\n       Washington.--U.S. Senators Judd Gregg (R-New Hampshire), \n     Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee, and Orrin \n     Hatch (R-Utah), Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Health \n     Subcommittee, today urged the Medicare Trustees to release \n     supplemental information when they issue the 2010 Medicare \n     Trustees report ``so that the public can accurately assess \n     the impact of the new health care law on the Medicare \n     program.''\n       ``Our nation stands on the precipice of fiscal ruin. Based \n     on past Trustees reports, we know Medicare is on the brink of \n     collapse,'' said Senator Hatch. ``It's in the best interest \n     of our country and our nation's seniors for the Trustees to \n     release a full and honest assessment of the fiscal impact of \n     the health care law on the viability of the Medicare program. \n     One of the most dishonest claims about this new law is its \n     magical ability to use Medicare money not only for Medicare, \n     but also for hundreds of billions in new entitlement \n     spending. That's an outrageous accounting gimmick and \n     everyone knows it.''\n       ``We need a full and accurate picture concerning Medicare's \n     unfunded liabilities,'' said Senator Gregg. ``For example, \n     Medicare savings should not be used as a piggy bank to \n     finance new entitlement spending. The Democrats are counting \n     Medicare savings twice--once to partially offset the cost of \n     a new health care entitlement and argue that bill does not \n     increase the deficit, and then again to claim they have \n     improved Medicare's solvency. This is an undeniable budget \n     gimmick. As we continue to wrestle with the historic debt and \n     deficits facing our nation, Congress should receive a \n     projection of Medicare's condition based on the reality that \n     these savings can only be used once, despite the wishful \n     thinking of the majority.''\n       In a letter to Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, Labor \n     Secretary Hilda Solis, Health and Human Services Secretary \n     Kathleen Sebelius, and Social Security Commissioner Michael \n     Astrue, who serve as the Medicare Trustees, the Senators \n     wrote, ``It is our sincere hope that the Trustees Report will \n     give every American an accurate and complete assessment of \n     the fiscal challenges facing the Medicare program and the \n     federal government. Failure to do so would be a tremendous \n     disservice to the American people and our nation.''\n       Specifically, the Senators requested:\n       The Trustees produce a separate report, in conjunction with \n     the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Actuary, \n     outlining Medicare's unfunded liabilities, taking into \n     account the real cost of fixing the broken Medicare physician \n     payment system. The Senators point out that the Trustees \n     report is based on current law, and while Democrats ignored \n     the physician payment issue during the health reform debate, \n     the Trustees should consider the long-term cost of Congress \n     continuing to delay these scheduled cuts in Medicare \n     reimbursement.\n       The Trustees estimate the year when Medicare's Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted, reflecting the fact \n     that Medicare cuts and payroll tax increases in the new \n     health law are used to finance new spending outside of \n     Medicare and therefore cannot simultaneously be available to \n     pay for more future spending out of the Medicare program.\n       The Medicare Trustees release an annual report on the \n     solvency and health of the Medicare program, which is \n     required by law to be submitted by April 1. The Trustees \n     decided to delay the report this year because the two health \n     care laws were enacted in late March.\n       Below and attached is the full letter that Senators Gregg \n     and Hatch sent to the Medicare Trustees today:\n     Hon. Timothy F. Geithner,\n     Secretary of the Treasury, Department of Treasury, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Hilda L. Solis,\n     Secretary of Labor, Department of Labor, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kathleen Sebelius,\n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, Department of Health \n         and Human Services, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael J. Astrue,\n     Commissioner of Social Security, Social Security \n         Administration, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Honorable Trustees: As Congress and the American \n     people await the release of the 2010 Annual Report of the \n     Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and \n     Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds (the 2010 \n     Medicare Trustees Report), we are writing to request \n     supplementary information in an accompanying document so that \n     the public can accurately assess the impact of the new health \n     care law on the Medicare program.\n       The 2009 Medicare Trustees Report laid out a grim \n     assessment of the financial status of the Medicare program. \n     Fueled by an aging population and rising health care costs, \n     Medicare expenditures, according to that report, would rise \n     from 3.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2008 to \n     11.4 percent of GDP in 2083. The 2009 Trustees Report \n     estimated that Medicare's unfunded liability is $38 trillion \n     over the next 75 years and that its Hospital Insurance (HI) \n     Trust Fund is expected to become insolvent in 2017.\n       For Congress to effectively address the critical challenge \n     of Medicare solvency, it must have a complete and accurate \n     assessment of the program's fiscal position. We would like to \n     request that you provide to Congress, contemporaneous with \n     the release of the 2010 Medicare Trustees Report, a report \n     that addresses the two following issues.\n       In recent years, the Trustees have noted an important \n     limitation regarding the report's projections for Medicare \n     Part B expenditures from the Supplementary Medical Insurance \n     (SMI) trust fund. While the Trustees' projections are based \n     on the assumption that current law will continue unchanged, \n     the law's scheduled reductions in Part B payments to \n     physicians under the Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) provisions \n     have not occurred after 2002--the only time a decrease was \n     allowed to take effect; since 2003 Congress has consistently \n     enacted changes in law to defer the reductions. The 2009 \n     Medicare Trustees Report warned that projections of Part B \n     expenditures under current law (which assumes the deferred \n     large reductions will eventually occur) thus are ``likely \n     understated and should be interpreted cautiously.''\n       As a result of this divergence between the unrealistic \n     projections and the level of payments to physicians that \n     Congress actually enacts, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \n     Services (CMS) Actuary started producing a supplement to the \n     Trustees Report. The most recent supplemental memorandum, \n     Projected Medicare Part B Expenditures under Two Illustrative \n     Scenarios with Alternative Physician Payment Updates (May 12, \n     2009), contains estimates of a range of Medicare expenditures \n     based on scenarios where Congress prevents the scheduled \n     reductions in physician payments. Relying on the same two \n     illustrative scenarios, an analysis (by former Public Trustee \n     Thomas R. Saving) concluded that, over the next 75 years, \n     Medicare's unfunded liability could be as much as $1.9 \n     trillion more than the Trustees projected in the 2009 report.\n       We request that the CMS Actuary produce a report similar to \n     the May 12, 2009 supplement, and that, related to the 2010 \n     Medicare Trustees Report, the Trustees provide projections \n     for Medicare's unfunded liability\n\n[[Page S79]]\n\n     over a 75-year horizon under the two alternative scenarios \n     for physician payments that will be included in the \n     supplement produced by the CMS Actuary.\n       Our second request relates to an issue raised in the \n     memorandum released by the CMS Actuary on April 22, 2010, \n     titled Estimated Effects of the ``Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act,'' as Amended, on the Year of Exhaustion \n     for the Part A Trust Fund, Part B Premiums, and Part A and \n     Part B Coinsurance Amounts. That memo stated the following \n     about the impact of health reform on the HI trust fund for \n     Medicare Part A:\n       The combination of lower Part A costs and higher tax \n     revenues results in a lower Federal deficit based on budget \n     accounting rules. However, trust fund accounting considers \n     the same lower expenditures and additional revenues as \n     extending the exhaustion date of the HI trust fund. In \n     practice, the improved HI financing cannot be simultaneously \n     used to finance other Federal outlays (such as coverage \n     expansions under the PPACA) and to extend the trust fund, \n     despite the appearance of this result from the respective \n     accounting conventions.\n       According to CMS, PPACA contained $575 billion in net \n     Medicare savings, including $63 billion in Medicare payroll \n     tax increases over fiscal years 2010-2019. However, as the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) previously indicated in a \n     letter on December 23, 2009, these dollars cannot both offset \n     new spending under PPACA and then also extend the life of \n     Medicare's HI trust fund. CBO concluded:\n       The key point is that savings to the HI trust fund under \n     PPACA would be received by the government only once, so they \n     cannot be set aside to pay for future Medicare spending and, \n     at the same time, pay for current spending on the other parts \n     of the legislation or on other programs . . . To describe the \n     full amount of HI trust fund savings as both improving the \n     government's ability to pay future Medicare benefits and \n     financing new spending outside of Medicare would essentially \n     double-count a large share of those savings and thus \n     overstate the improvement in the government's fiscal \n     position.\n       We request that the Trustees provide a projection for the \n     date of exhaustion for Medicare's HI trust fund assuming that \n     all the estimated Medicare savings under PPACA are not set \n     aside to pay future Medicare benefits but instead are used to \n     finance new spending (outside of Medicare) in the new health \n     care law.\n       We trust that you will provide a response to our request \n     concurrent with the release of the 2010 Medicare Trustees \n     Report. It is our sincere hope that the Trustees Report will \n     give every American an accurate and complete assessment of \n     the fiscal challenges facing the Medicare program and the \n     federal government. Failure to do so would be a tremendous \n     disservice to the American people and our nation.\n       Sincerely,\n     Judd Gregg,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Orrin Hatch,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. A clear pattern has emerged with respect to Democratic \nrhetoric on the budget.

This was not some academic exercise. And \nnow the American taxpayers are on the hook for roughly $280 billion, \ncourtesy of Democrats purportedly committed to spending restraint.\n  Still, we are heartened that Democrats are at least claiming a \ncommitment to deficit reduction.\n  Talking tough is a necessary--though not sufficient--step toward \ngetting our fiscal house in order.\n  Similarly, it is a positive development that the President has \nendorsed passage of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. Maybe the \nadministration is waking up to the importance of our pending trade \nagreements for our exports and the workers who make them.\n  But the proof of his commitment to our exporters must go beyond the \nKorea FTA. We can no longer let our trade agreements with Panama and \nColombia languish as we lose competitiveness and allow other countries \nto seize these markets for their workers.\n  Talking about trade does not produce jobs. We need the President to \ntake action and submit these agreements to Congress. And we need that \naction now. The U.S. worker cannot afford to wait.\n  Passage of these trade agreements can boost our economy and our \ncompetitiveness without additional spending. They are important tools \nthat we must put to work. If the President chooses this route, I \nbelieve he will find an important ally in Congress.\n  I look forward to President Obama's proposals for prioritizing \ndeficit reduction. There is no issue more critical to this Nation's \nfuture.\n  And I expect we will hear quite a bit about it in the State of the \nUnion Address.\n  The President can count on applause from our side of the aisle if he \npresses for reductions in out-of-control spending. But merely \nrelabeling new spending as investments will not make our deficits go \naway, and it will do nothing to tackle our escalating debt.\n  The President must give serious attention to the legitimate arguments \nand concerns of conservative citizens if he wants to achieve anything \nmore than a pleasant sounding rhetorical flourish.\n  President Obama did inherit a serious budget deficit. And our friends \non the other side will, once again, applaud that line. They will cheer \nthe assertion that they merely inherited deficits. They will spin the \nconvenient tale that Republicans alone bequeathed the deficit to \nPresident Obama. But that is certainly not the case. And the record is \nclear. A Democratic Congress and a\n\n[[Page S80]]\n\nRepublican President created this deficit from bipartisan policies they \njointly developed.\n  To those Democrats who claim Republicans have no right to discuss \ndeficits, they need look no further than their own actions. Take a look \nat the fiscal effects of the stimulus bill they crafted 2 years ago. \nTake a comprehensive look at the real deficit impact of ObamaCare.\n  Take an honest look at the appropriations bills that piled on double-\ndigit increases in spending.\n  American families don't have the luxury of 84 percent or 24 percent \nincreases in their spending. They have made their priorities and \nrestrained their spending.\n  If American families can prioritize, deleverage, and live within \ntheir means, I hope the President will push his allies in Washington to \ndo the same.\n  All of us in Congress await the arrival of President Obama's third \nbudget.\n  The American people are demanding that he make deficit reduction a \npriority. And they are asking Congress to approach this subject in an \nintellectually honest fashion.\n  We need to acknowledge that when it comes to the budget, the road to \nfiscal ruin has been paved with good intentions. In the name of fixing \nthe economy, the Democrats' stimulus bill has imposed both short-term \nand long-term costs on American taxpayers, jeopardizing economic growth \nand, with it, liberty and opportunity. That damage has been expanded \nwith un-offset extensions of what we were told were temporary \nprovisions.\n  As we start writing a budget, let's do it with all the fiscal cards \non the table. Let's remove the political blinders and deal with the \nfiscal facts. And that means being realistic about expiring tax relief, \nits merits, its economic growth effect, and its political popularity.\n  This is not a problem that we can tax our way out of. Getting our \nfiscal house in order is going to require hard decisions on spending. \nWe need to put our shoulders to the wheel. We owe it to the people who \nsent us here.\n  There is an old saying that applies here. I am not the first person, \nnor will I be the last, to reference it in the context of our fiscal \ntroubles. The saying is: When you find yourself in a hole, stop \ndigging. We need to use our shovels to fill this fiscal hole, not dig \nit deeper.\n  I look forward to this debate on spending. It will not be an easy \none. But the American people have demanded that Congress take up this \ncause, and I fully intend to.\n  Ultimately, I am confident that we will achieve meaningful deficit \nreduction. Yet I go into this debate with my eyes open.\n  President Reagan, in the foreign policy arena, reminded us to trust, \nbut verify.\n  As we await the President's State of the Union speech, Republicans \ntrust that Democrats will make a nod toward deficit reduction, but we \nneed to verify whether they are serious about getting this problem \nunder control.\n  Democrats do not have a great track record when it comes to cutting \nspending. But hope springs eternal.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, on Monday, January 17, our Nation once \nagain celebrated the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as a \nnational holiday. Signed into law in 1983, the bill to make Dr. King's \nbirthday a legal public holiday was the result of a 15-year legislative \neffort.\n  Although I was not a Member of the Congress at the time, I remember \nwell the national debate and eventually the overwhelming support this \nlegislation engendered. For the Senate pages on the floor today, for \ntheir entire lifetimes, Dr. King's birthday has been a Federal holiday. \nBut they and all young Americans should know the passage of that law \nwas not certain and not without controversy at the time.\n  I was the speaker of the Maryland house of delegates in the 1980s \nwhen the State of Maryland took up legislation to make Dr. King's \nbirthday a State holiday, and we were one of several States that passed \nState laws to make Dr. King's birthday a holiday. As the federalism \nsystem works, as more States got engaged in this issue, the momentum at \nthe national level became very apparent. And for the importance of this \nday and its message to Americans, the Congress finally enacted \nlegislation in 1983.\n  This holiday, which has appropriately come to be known as a day of \nservice, would not have happened without the leadership of former \nSenator Charles Mathias of Maryland. I am very proud of the work \nSenator Mathias did on this issue and so many issues that were \nimportant to the opportunities for all Americans. I also want to \nacknowledge the work of former Representative Katie Hall of Indiana. \nThey were the authors of the 1983 legislation. This holiday also would \nnot have happened without the work of Representatives John Lewis and \nJohn Conyers, who have dedicated their lives to social justice. Also, I \nmight add, without the work of our former colleague, Senator Ted \nKennedy, this bill would never have become law. I congratulate all of \nthem for their work.\n  Serving in the Senate today are colleagues whom I would also like to \nthank for their efforts to enact this legislation, the 1983 King \nholiday bill. Six of the thirty-four sponsors are still in the Senate \ntoday, including Senator Baucus, Senator Bingaman, Senator Inouye, \nSenator Lautenberg, Senator Levin, and Senator Lugar, as well as the \npresident of the Senate, Vice President Joe Biden. Moreover, five \nSenators who were Members of the House of Representatives at the time \nwere original cosponsors of the companion bill, H.R. 3706, which became \nlaw. They are Majority Leader Reid, Senators Akaka, Boxer, Mikulski, \nand Schumer. I thank them all for their leadership and vision in the \n1980s as to the importance of making this holiday a remembrance to Dr. \nMartin Luther King.\n  Twenty years before its enactment, in August of 1963 on the steps of \nthe Lincoln Memorial, Dr. King delivered what is his most well-known \nspeech, in which he called for racial equality and social justice for \nall Americans.\n  In honor of Dr. King's birthday, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of that speech be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           ``I Have a Dream''\n\n                    (By Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.)\n\n       ``I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in \n     history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the \n     history of our nation.\n       ``Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic \n     shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. \n     This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to \n     millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of \n     withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the \n     long night of their captivity.\n       ``But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. \n     One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly \n     crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of \n     discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a \n     lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of \n     material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is \n     still languished in the corners of American society and finds \n     himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here \n     today to dramatize a shameful condition.\n       ``In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a \n     check. When the architects of our republic wrote the \n     magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of \n     Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which \n     every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that \n     all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be \n     guaranteed the `unalienable Rights' of `Life, Liberty and the \n     pursuit of Happiness.' It is obvious today that America has \n     defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of \n     color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred \n     obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a \n     check which has come back marked `insufficient funds.'\n       ``But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is \n     bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient \n     funds in the great\n\n[[Page S81]]\n\n     vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to \n     cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the \n     riches of freedom and the security of justice.\n       ``We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America \n     of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in \n     the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug \n     of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of \n     democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate \n     valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. \n     Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of \n     racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the \n     time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.\n       ``It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency \n     of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's \n     legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an \n     invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-\n     three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that \n     the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content \n     will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business \n     as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in \n     America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. \n     The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the \n     foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice \n     emerges.\n       ``But there is something that I must say to my people, who \n     stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of \n     justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we \n     must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to \n     satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of \n     bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle \n     on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not \n     allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical \n     violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic \n     heights of meeting physical force with soul force.\n       ``The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro \n     community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, \n     for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their \n     presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny \n     is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize \n     that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.\n       ``We cannot walk alone.\n       ``And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall \n     always march ahead.\n       ``We cannot turn back.\n       ``There are those who are asking the devotees of civil \n     rights, `When will you be satisfied?' We can never be \n     satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the \n     unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be \n     satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of \n     travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and \n     the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as \n     the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a \n     larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children \n     are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity \n     by signs stating: `For Whites Only.' We cannot be satisfied \n     as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in \n     New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, \n     we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until \n     `justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a \n     mighty stream.'\n       ``I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of \n     great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh \n     from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas \n     where your quest--quest for freedom left you battered by the \n     storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police \n     brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. \n     Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is \n     redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go \n     back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to \n     Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern \n     cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be \n     changed.\n       ``Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you \n     today, my friends.\n       ``And so even though we face the difficulties of today and \n     tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted \n     in the American dream.\n       ``I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and \n     live out the true meaning of its creed: `We hold these truths \n     to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.'\n       ``I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, \n     the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners \n     will be able to sit down together at the table of \n     brotherhood.\n       ``I have a dream that one day even the state of \n     Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, \n     sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed \n     into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n       ``I have a dream that my four little children will one day \n     live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color \n     of their skin but by the content of their character.\n       ``I have a dream today!\n       ``I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its \n     vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping \n     with the words of `interposition' and `nullification'--one \n     day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls \n     will be able to join hands with little white boys and white \n     girls as sisters and brothers.\n       ``I have a dream today!\n       ``I have a dream that one day every valley shall be \n     exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the \n     rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will \n     be made straight; `and the glory of the Lord shall be \n     revealed and all flesh shall see it together.'\n       ``This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to \n     the South with.\n       ``With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the \n     mountain of despair a stone of hope.

Madam President, I will speak for just a few moments on \nsomething I think is the most important issue facing our country today. \nI can't think of a better time than the first day of the new session in \nthe U.S. Congress to address it; that is, the Federal deficit. I am \nproud to say that later this week, Claire McCaskill from Missouri will \nbe joining me, along with Richard Burr, John McCain, Senator Alexander, \nand Senator Isakson in something called the Cap Act. The bill takes us, \nover a 10-year period, from where we are in spending at the Federal \nGovernment level as a percentage of our country's economy, the gross \ndomestic product, at 24 percent, down to the 40-year average which we \nhave had in this country, as I mentioned, for 40 years, of 20.6 \npercent. It puts in place a construct or a straitjacket on Congress \nthat allows us, over time, to take a methodical, thoughtful approach to \nspending at the Federal level but to actually have to do it.\n  This bill, which we also offered as an amendment during the lameduck \nsession--it is now a stand-alone bill--again, we will be offering it a \nlittle bit later this week. We hope to have additional cosponsors from \nboth sides of the aisle. What it would do is take us from where we are \ntoday down to that average. If Congress did not act responsibly, then \nOMB would have the ability, through sequestration, to actually take \nmoney out of both mandatory and nonmandatory accounts to ensure that we \nagain have that discipline to take us where we need to be.\n  I have traveled throughout Tennessee and spoken about this bill. I \nhave made about 46 presentations of how we in Congress could act more \nresponsibly. It is amazing that people on both sides of the aisle have \nlooked at this and said this makes a lot of sense. So it is my hope, as \nwe look at trying to rein in Federal spending, that this bill--I \nbelieve this bill is the vehicle--there may be other ideas, but I hope \nthis is something we, in fact, will act upon during the spring.\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\n  I know the President most recently has talked a great deal about this \nissue of fiscal responsibility. I thank him for that. I am hoping that \ntonight, when he delivers his speech, he talks about the fact that we \nin Washington have to have the same kind of discipline that all our \nfolks back home have to live by. Again, this is something we have been \nworking on for a long time. We have tried to work on it in a way that \nin no way points fingers. I think people understand that people on both \nsides of the aisle are responsible for our country ending up where it \nis fiscally. So we have tried to draft something that brings people \ntogether and that, for the first time since I have been here--I have \nbeen here 4 years, and I have been amazed at the lack of discipline \nthat exists in Congress. We have no mechanism, no straitjacket, if you \nwill, that forces us to act responsibly.\n  So over a long period of time we have worked to put together a bill--\nby the way, I think it is eight or nine pages long--that actually does \nthat. It has a smoothing mechanism in it so that when there are \ngyrations in our economy--we know the Federal Government can't react \nquite as quickly as a State or city--that smoothing is averaged out so \nwe know what the target is in the ensuing year. It has tight \nconstraints. It requires a 67-vote majority or two-thirds of the \nSenate, two-thirds of the House to override. So it is a very strong \nbill. Again, I think people on both sides of the aisle are beginning to \nembrace this type of thinking.\n  It is my hope, again, as the President tonight, hopefully, talks \nresponsibly about our fiscal state here in the United States, that this \ntype of mechanism, if you will, gains momentum. It is also my hope that \nwe will vote and pass something such as this, along with actual budget \ncuts prior to the debt ceiling vote. I think all of us know it would be \nvery irresponsible not to act responsibly prior to this debt ceiling \nvote which will take place sometime in April, May or possibly June.\n  So I thank my colleagues for the time to talk a little bit about \nthis, again, on the first day of us coming back together. I can't \nimagine anything more important for all of us to focus on than to get \nour fiscal house in order. I know the whole world is watching us.\n  I know people have said we in Washington don't have the courage to \ndeal with this. I know the Presiding Officer has had to deal with this \nas the Governor of a State. I certainly had to deal with this as the \nmayor of a city and a businessman and financial commissioner of my \nState. We all know things are awry here. I think we have a wonderful \nopportunity, in a bipartisan way, to do something that puts our country \nback on strong footing.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, during the recent 2-week recess, I was \ninvited to speak to the Parliament of the nation of Lithuania in the \ncapital of Vilnius. It was a great honor. This country holds a special \nplace in my family. My mother was born in Lithuania. One hundred years \nago this year, my grandmother brought her, her brother, and sister to \nAmerica. My mother was 2 years old. They landed in Baltimore, and \nsomehow our family found its way to meet up with my grandfather in East \nSt. Louis, IL, where a lot of Lithuanian immigrants were coming to take \njobs--hard, manual labor jobs, which immigrants took in those days and \nstill do--manual labor jobs that gave them a chance they did not have \nin the old country.\n  I was asked to speak to the Parliament on the occasion of the 20th \nanniversary of what has come to be known as bloody Sunday. It recalls \nthe time, 20 years ago, when Mikhail Gorbachev, as head of the Soviet \nUnion, made his last, desperate, violent effort to stop Lithuania from \nbreaking away from the Soviet Union.\n  I recall that period because I followed it closely as a Member of \nCongress. You can still see some details of what life was like in \nLithuania under the Soviets. The old police headquarters, the KGB \nheadquarters, has been preserved as a museum--basically, a horror \nmuseum to show and catalog the torture and killings that took place \nduring Soviet rule.\n  In February 1990, the people of this tiny nation on the Baltic \ndecided they had had enough. They swept the ruling Communist Party out \nof power in an open parliamentary election. A month later in March \n1990, the new Parliament voted 124 to 0 to restore the country's \nindependence. They were the first Soviet Republic to do so. It was \nbold. It was historic. That is when Gorbachev turned the screws. He \nordered Soviet tanks and paratroopers to stop the breakaway effort of \nLithuania.\n  In the early morning hours of January 13, 1991, 14 Lithuanians, just \nregular people, common people in the country, were killed and as many \nas 1,000 were rounded up by those the Economist magazine described as \nthe ``bullies of Vilnius.''\n  The crackdown failed. By August of 1991, Lithuania had won its \nindependence again.\n  Today, because of the brave efforts of those ordinary Lithuanians, it \nis a free country, it is democratic, chair of the Community of \nDemocracies, is a member of the European Union, and one of America's \nallies in NATO.\n  Imagine my surprise at what I saw during a stop in the neighboring \ncountry of Belarus. I saw a step back into Soviet times, a step back \ninto the barbarism we found in the KGB Museum in Lithuania. Sadly, \nthough, this was not a museum show. It was real life.\n  Often known as the last dictatorship of Europe, Belarus has defied \nthe democratic transformations that have swept across Europe following \nthe collapse of the Soviet Union. The country has been ruled with an \niron fist for most of the last few decades by a strongman, Alexander \nLukashenko. In Lukashenko's two-decade-old totalitarian nightmare, \nopposition figures--anybody who had courage to step up and defy him--\nhad been subjected to harsh repression and imprisonment. Over the \nyears, those who might have been alternatives to Lukashenko in any \nelection have disappeared or have been thrown in jail.\n  In fact, Lukashenko proudly still calls his police force the KGB.\n  In recent years, there was a glimmer of hope that perhaps Lukashenko \nwas going to move away from his dictatorship. A Presidential election \nwas scheduled for last December 19, one that some hoped would finally \nmeet the most minimum international standards for democracy.\n  Those hopes were dashed when Lukashenko quickly claimed another term \nas President amid elections described by international monitors as \nseriously flawed. He ended up with 80 percent of the vote and said that \nwas a good indication that it was a real election. He did not get 99 \npercent, as usual.\n  Lukashenko ordered his KGB thugs to brutally suppress opposition \ncandidates, activists, and supporters who gathered in protest on \nelection night in Independence Square in downtown Minsk in the nation \nof Belarus on December 19, last year. Six of the seven political \nopponents who ran against Lukashenko and more than 600 of their \nfollowers were arrested. Several of the Presidential candidates who are \nbeing held incommunicado still today face charges that can carry up to \n15 years in jail. Their crime? They ran against him and they lost. They \nget to go to jail now.\n  Since then, Lukashenko's KGB has continued daily raids on the homes \nand offices of those with suspected ties to democratic parties and \norganizations, human rights organizations, and what remains of the \nindependent media in Belarus.\n  Lukashenko has ignored election monitor reports questioning the \ncredibility of the election and international demands to release all \nthese political prisoners. He has pulled the country further into \nisolation and made it the subject of international scorn.\n  He follows the old Soviet playbook. His government has tried to blame \noutside forces in other countries, everyone but himself, for the \nshameful political mess he has created.\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\n  I was in Minsk last week, and I met with Sergey Martynov, who is the \nForeign Minister to Lukashenko. He pleaded with me to give his ``new \ndemocracy'' credit, new democracy in Belarus. He said: Senator, you \nlive in a country that has had democracy for 200 years; we have only \nhad it for 20 years. He said: Give us credit. When we arrested all \nthese people--including seven of the people who ran against him--we \ndidn't use tear gas. There were no rubber bullets, no police dogs. Give \nus credit, he said.\n  No, I said, you didn't use those tools, but you systematically \narrested and threw into jail everybody who ran against you. That is not \neven close to democracy.\n  I had the chance to meet with some of the family members of those who \nare in jail. I could not help but think that just a few hours before I \nhad been in Lithuania, a 3-hour drive from Minsk in Belarus, where 20 \nyears ago ordinary people, such as these families, stepped up and said: \nWe are willing to fight for freedom. Fourteen of them lost their lives \nand 1,000 were injured--just ordinary people. These are not the \npolitical class. These are folks who are sick and tired in Belarus of \nthe authoritarian rule.\n  I wish to show some of the people I met who I think are worth being \npart of the record today.\n  First--and this was in a meeting established by our consulate in \nMinsk, Belarus. They threw out our Ambassador a few years ago. So we \nhave five people trying to represent the United States of America in \nthis country. Bless them for trying. It is a hard job. They are \nconstantly monitored, eavesdropped, followed. Life is not pleasant. \nWhen we start getting down on people working for the United States of \nAmerica, remember these five who are risking their lives for us every \nday so there is an outpost for the United States and for freedom in \nthis authoritarian country.\n  This lady was at the meeting in the consulate. Svyatlana Lyabedzka is \nthe wife of Anatol Lyabedzka, chair of the United Civic Party. Anatol \nhas been regularly harassed, fined, and imprisoned for his political \nactivities. In 2004, he was severely beaten by Lukashenko's police \nforce.\n  His wife told me, in tears, that her husband has been taken away to \njail and she has had no information about him. That has been almost 1 \nmonth. She does not know what is happening to him or where he is being \nheld.\n  The second person I would like to make a part of this record is \nTatsyana Sevyarynets. She is the mother of Paveal Sevyarynets, the head \nof Presidential candidate Vital Rymasheuski's campaign. He has already \nserved several years in jail for protesting previous sham elections in \nBelarus. That is right, thrown in jail while protesting rigged \nelections, when it is those doing the rigging who ought to be in jail. \nHer letters go unanswered. Her complaints filed against the government \nhave been ignored. She has been prevented from traveling, and her \npassport has been taken away for some time. She told me it is \nimpossible to find an explanation for what is happening. ``My son has \nbeen persecuted for 16 years.''\n  This photo shows--forgive me as I struggle with these names. These \npeople deserve better. I will do my best--Kanstantsin Sannikau, Ala \nSannikava, and Lyutsina Khalip. These three were at the meeting.\n  Kanstantsin and Ala are the son and mother of a detained Presidential \ncandidate, Andrei Sannikau.\n  Ala told me, in tears, that she had no contact with her son for 14 \ndays, nor had his lawyers. She had no information on his condition.\n  Lyutsina is the grandmother of the candidate's 3-year-old son Danil. \nYou might have read about this little boy in the newspaper. What \nLukashenko did was arrest this Presidential candidate and his wife and \nthen said the State was going to take custody of his 3-year-old child. \nThe grandmother stepped up and said: I will take custody. I will take \ncare of the boy. For the longest time, it was in doubt whether he would \nremain with the family. They relented yesterday and said the boy could \nremain with the family.\n  This is a picture of him--a cute little fellow, Danil. In Belarus, \nnot only did they arrest the candidate Sannikau but they take the boy \nout of the house and family. That is what they planned on. When they \narrested the wife Irina, a journalist and automatically considered \ndangerous in Belarus, they decided to go after her child. The \ngrandmother fought a winning battle and now has custody of the child.\n  Let's hope America's attention and the world's attention will make a \ndifference.\n  The last one I wish to show is particularly compelling. Milana \nMikhalevich is a 34-year-old mother of two whose husband Alex was also \na Presidential candidate. She told me of her harassment by Belarusian \nofficials since her husband's arrest. Mr. President, 34 years old, and \nthis young woman was standing there with this beautiful little girl, \nscrambling around on the floor all around her. She had a 10-year-old at \nhome. She was trying to describe how she was keeping things together, \nwhile her husband, who had the courage to run for President and lose \nagainst the dictator Lukashenko, sat in prison.\n  Incidentally, they do not get attorneys. That is not part of the \ndeal. Anyone who says they will defend the people arrested is subject \nto disbarment as an attorney and charged with crimes themselves. It is \nnot exactly a fertile field of attorneys stepping up to represent these \npeople. They take their lives in their hands to do so. The families \nhave no access, no communications, no correspondence, no way of \nvisiting those in prison. They have no idea when they are going to be \ncharged or tried. There is no indication that there is going to be a \npublic trial.\n  This is going on in Belarus today, and this woman with her little \ngirl is trying to figure out when and if she will ever see her husband \nand the father of this little girl again.\n  The nightmare she described to me was incredible. She literally has \nhad her house raided by the Belarusian KGB. She has been stopped from \ngoing to Poland, where she was trying to find support for her husband. \nShe doesn't even know how he is, physically.\n  I was so glad to be in Lithuania and to join in the celebration of \ntheir quest for freedom and independence. After 20 years pass, \nsometimes you forget how much courage it took for that to happen. But a \n3-hour drive from Vilnius to this event in Minsk reminded me. These \npeople in Belarus are waging the same battle today that was waged in \nLithuania and so many other places many years ago. They are trying to \nfind the thing we in America take for granted every day--freedom, the \nfreedom to practice the religion of their choice, the freedom to write \na newspaper or do a blog, the freedom to vote for the candidate of \ntheir choice, their freedom to oppose government policy. As a result \nthey have been arrested and imprisoned.\n\n  I am calling on the government of Belarus to immediately and \nunconditionally release these political prisoners. The fact they \ncontinue to languish in jail without access to family, lawyers, or \nmedical care is an outrage and an embarrassment to Europe and the \nworld. These actions show the desperation and fear of a dictator whose \nreign belongs in the dustbin of history.\n  The European Union will decide by the end of January whether Belarus \nshould face renewed sanctions, including targeted travel and asset \nfreezes against Lukashenko and his top elite political figures. The \nUnited States should waste no time joining this effort. I have spoken \ndirectly to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She understands, as I \ndo, what is at stake here is today's fight for freedom. What is in \nquestion is whether the United States will stand and fight with these \nfamilies. The European Union is prepared to lead and we should be by \ntheir side. We should be working together to put the pressure on this \ndictator to tell him in the 21st century there is no place for the \nbully of Belarus and the terrible oppressive tactics in which he has \nengaged.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we look forward to tonight's State of \nthe Union Address, we are hearing a lot of talk about jobs and the \nUnited States being more competitive. Unfortunately, the American \npeople have heard the talk, they have heard the rhetoric, but they do \nnot see the concrete action that is going to make a difference. The \ntime for talk really is over.\n  Today, I am introducing three concrete measures to unleash American \ncompetitiveness and lift barriers to American job creation.\n  First, we must unbridle our job creators from the onerous 1099 tax \npaperwork mandate that is buried in section 9006 of the health care \nbill. Behind the scenes, for the past few weeks there has been growing \nbipartisan support for this important piece of legislation. In fact, \nnow I can report that 50 Senators have signed on as cosponsors, \nincluding, I believe, 10 or 11 of my colleagues from across the aisle. \nSuccessful passage of this repeal would send an enormously powerful \nmessage. It would declare that the 112th Congress will come together to \nremove barriers to job creation. Left unabated, though, this avalanche \nof paperwork will simply bury businesses. If a business purchases more \nthan $600 of goods or services from another business, it will be \nrequired to provide the business and the IRS with a 1099 tax form. This \nnew mandate will affect all kinds of businesses in the country. It also \nwill include nonprofits, churches, local governments. This small \nsection of this 2000-plus page bill is causing massive confusion and, I \nmight add, outrage across the country.\n  Although this mandate was included in the health care law, it has \nabsolutely nothing to do with improving health. Rather, section 9006 \nwas included because it would supposedly generate money to help pay for \nthe bill. But the National Taxpayer Advocate, a division of the IRS, \ndoes not buy it. Their analysis took all the air out of the argument by \nconcluding that the IRS would ``face challenges making productive use \nof this new volume of information.'' The analysis adds that the IRS \nlikely would ``improperly assess penalties that it must abate later, \nafter great expenditure of taxpayer and IRS time and effort.''\n  This mandate was ill-advised, and it is not responsible policy. We \ncan do better, and the time is now. The President himself is talking \nabout ridding the books of outdated regulations. We should not overlook \nthis new regulation that will smack businesses if we fail to repeal it. \nIt will inflict a mountain of paperwork on an estimated 40 million \nbusiness owners across this Nation, and it stands in the way of job \ncreation.\n  It is going to have an impact in Nebraska, there is no doubt about \nthat. In fact, as I have traveled back home, I have been inundated with \nstories about business owners who are bracing for the impact.\n  Jeff Scherer of Smeal Manufacturing Company in Snyder, NB, says the \nbill will lead to an additional $23,000 in accounting costs. Being able \nto invest that $23,000 into a company will go a long way toward helping \njustify business expansion.\n  Another real-life example from Nebraska is a company called \nHayneedle. Hayneedle is an online retailer of home furnishings and \nother home products located in Omaha, NB. Hayneedle employs 400 people. \nPrior to the 1099 tax reporting mandate, Hayneedle issued approximately \n150 1099 forms annually. Now this great company will be required to \nissue thousands more tax forms every year. They will be required to \ntrack payments for everything from a computer to rent to office \nsupplies. Simple expenses such as food purchases for employees would \nhave to be counted and traced. The company estimates that the annual \ncost of compliance will exceed $100,000--useless paperwork. That \n$100,000 would go a long way toward hiring more workers.\n  In addition, the thousands of Hayneedle's vendors will be required to \ncomplete and return to Hayneedle a form W-9. This means Hayneedle will \nbe required to review and process and oftentimes correct those forms \nand then issue a 1099 to the vendors. It is a mad circle for no good \neven.\n  If the 1099 law is not repealed, it will waste vast quantities of \ncapital and human resources. Squandering these resources will stunt \ntheir ability to grow their businesses. Our Nation needs more employers \nlike Hayneedle and Smeal Manufacturing to continue growing and putting \npeople to work. Considering the high unemployment rate plaguing every \nState in the country, it is incomprehensible that we keep this in \nplace.\n  This new 1099 reporting requirement will have an especially \ndetrimental effect on small businesses in our local communities. For \nexample, the new 1099 reporting requirements create a perverse \nincentive to consolidate suppliers, which leaves Main Street businesses \nout in the cold. You see, businesses will likely reduce the number of \nvendors they work with to reduce the paper transactions to avoid the \n$600 limit and avoid the paperwork.\n  When suppliers are consolidated, you can bet that suppliers will lose \nout. Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant owner Dale Black of Grand Island \nsays it best. He says this: He ``wants to be a good corporate citizen \nin the communities I have restaurants, but the 1099 forces me not to \nhire local vendors and tradesmen in my community; instead giving work \nto a single regional contractor.''\n  The IRS's own Taxpayer Advocate appears to agree, saying:\n\n       Small businesses may lose customers, leave the economy with \n     more large national vendors and less local competition.\n\n  Now, I am certain the goal was not to strangle small-town economies, \nbut it is the unintended consequence and reality of this new mandate. \nWe need to look for ways to help small businesses, not hamper them. But \nthere is no way to talk around this provision, to spin it. It is simply \nbrutal for the American business community.\n  Businesses cannot afford the new burden. They are imploring us to \nhelp them. That is why the Small Business Paperwork Mandate Elimination \nAct, introduced today with that many cosponsors, simply needs to become \nthe law. Repealing this mandate is going to be a joint effort of all of \nus in the Senate, and my hope is it will be done.\n  In fact, there is something else we can support to create an \nestimated 27,000 new jobs, and it does not cost taxpayers anything. I \nam referring to the second piece of my American competitiveness and \njobs package, our three pending trade agreements. Unfortunately, with \nour economy struggling, this issue has been given lip service for the \npast couple of years. Although our President mentioned this topic \nalmost 1 year ago, we have seen virtually no action. During last year's \nState of the Union Address, the President boldly stated:\n\n       We have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our \n     competitors are. If America sits on the sidelines while other \n     nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create \n     jobs on our shores.\n\n  I could not agree more with his statement. The next day I offered a \nletter to the President with 17 Senators offering our help and our \nsupport. But, unfortunately, a year later, there has been little \naction. The White House has not sent to us the three trade agreements \nthat are sitting on the shelf collecting dust. It is an unfortunate \nsquandering of a sorely needed opportunity.\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\n  So with 14 million Americans still unemployed, our country will tune \nin to the State of the Union tonight with keen ears for ideas that \ncreate jobs, that boost the economy. But our three negotiated trade \ndeals continue to sit there. It is unacceptable, and it needs to \nchange. By this July, the European Union and South Korea will have \nimplemented their own free-trade agreement, putting U.S. business at a \ncompetitive disadvantage.\n  The Korea-U.S. Free trade Agreement fixes that. Our friends to the \nnorth in Canada and south in Mexico have trade deals in place with \nColombia. While our agreement languishes, their exports are winning the \nmarketplace. Imagine how our exporters feel watching their competition \nmove to the front of the line, knowing that the agreements put them \nahead.\n  If we fail to act on the agreement, it is clear that our U.S. \nproducers will fall behind. It is happening. Thus, today, some of my \ncolleagues and I introduced a resolution pushing for the approval of \nthe Korea, Colombia, and Panama trade agreements. Our President and \nthis Congress hold the keys to unlocking the benefits.\n  According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, these \nagreements would increase new U.S. exports between $10 and $12 billion, \nreducing the U.S. trade deficit and boosting the economy. In addition, \nthese new U.S. goods exported to South Korea, to Colombia, to Panama \nwould yield 27,000 new jobs. Overall this means an estimated gain in \nGDP of over $12 billion from net exports annually.\n  This would be music to the ears of our exporters and those looking \nfor work. Their government should similarly be chomping at the bit to \nget this done. It is within our grasp. American workers and businesses \nare essentially pleading for us to move forward. The folks on the \nproduction line, in our fields, those seeking employment, are the ones \nwith true skin in the game.\n  We need to unleash their potential by unleashing the pending \nagreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. These agreements \nwill level the playing field and eliminate barriers for U.S. goods. Our \nworkers are always ready to roll up their sleeves and do what they can \nto start producing.\n  Recently our Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, said: Our \ncurrent pace of hiring will require 4 to 5 years to reach normal \nunemployment levels. Now, 4 to 5 years is too long to wait. We need to \ndo everything we can to change that picture. So imagine the impact of \nimmediately eliminating tariffs on 80 percent of U.S. exports to South \nKorea. Remember, only 13 percent of our goods and services are \ncurrently exported tariff free. How about immediately eliminating \ntariffs on U.S. exports to Colombia for more than 77 percent of \nagricultural goods and 76 percent of industrial goods. Consider a \nwhopping 90 percent of Colombian imports already enter our country duty \nfree under the Andean Trade Preference Act. This leveling of the \nplaying field is sorely needed.\n  To be clear, I do not oppose helping our neighbors, and the Andean \nagreement was designed to do that. But should we not at least seek the \nsame treatment for our businesses and our workers?\n  Almost 1 year ago today we heard the President speak about \naggressively expanding the marketplace in the international market. \nThese agreements would do that. I hope tonight he reaffirms his \ncommitment.\n  Finally, the third pillar of the competitive package that I \nintroduced today will lower our corporate tax rates 20 percent. For \nmany years, the United States has had the second highest corporate tax \nrate in the world--second highest corporate tax rate in the world--\nsecond only to Japan. Japan has now announced that they will reduce \ntheir corporate rate for 2011. With this reduction, the United States \nwill have the highest corporate tax rate of anyone in the entire world. \nThat means the U.S. tax environment for our job creators will be the \nleast attractive in the entire world.\n  Here is the math: When you take into account a Federal corporate tax \nrate of 35 percent and the average State corporate tax rate, the \ncombined U.S. corporate tax rate totals more than 39 percent, nearly \n40. This combined rate soars above those of other countries with which \nAmerican businesses compete. That makes absolutely no sense. Is it any \nwonder that jobs are leaving this country to go to other competitive \ncountries? Our Nation should be encouraging business creation and \ngrowth, not putting our job creators at a disadvantage with this \nextraordinary, No. 1-in-the-world tax rate.\n  At least 27 of 34 nations in the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development have cut their general corporate income tax \nrates since 2000. These countries have benefitted from increased \ncapital investment, and--get this--they have seen their corporate tax \nrevenues, as a share of GDP, actually increase even with the lower rate \nbecause they are expanding the base.\n  According to a July 2010 analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the U.S. \nwould have to reduce its Federal rate to 20.3 percent to match the \naverage corporate rate of other OECD countries. Thankfully, many \nrecognize the need to bring our corporate tax rate in line with those \nof other industrialized nations. In fact, in December, the President's \nExport Council recommended the corporate tax rate be reduced to 20 \npercent. This will stimulate job creation across the country, all \nsectors of the job market.\n  Washington cannot continue to say one thing and do another. That is \nwhy today I am introducing the Restoring America's Competitiveness in \nEnterprise Act of 2011. This legislative package, the 1099 repeal, the \nresolution supporting the trade agreements, the bill to reduce the \nhighest--soon to be the highest--corporate tax rate in the world will \nprovide a solid foundation for our country to move forward.\n  It will send a powerful message that this 112th Senate supports job \ncreation and is committed to unleashing America's competitiveness. I am \nhopeful that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important \npackage. We are off to a good start, and I thank my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle who have joined me in this effort.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The reason \nthere was a debate that particular year is that in 1973 and 1974, the \nCongress preceding, there were 44 filibusters, each eating up about a \nweek of the Senate's time. There was a tremendous amount of frustration \nover the dysfunction of the Senate. So at the start of the Congress \nthat began in 1975, there was an enormous amount of debate, debate that \nwent on for weeks, with all kinds of motions. The spreadsheet tracking \nthem fills pages. In the end, what this body, the Senate, decided to do \nwas to change the rule that requires 67 Senators to terminate debate \nand have a final vote on a bill and replace it with the decision to \nhave 60 Senators required to end debate and have a final vote on a \nbill. This is for the so-called cloture motion.\n  Now we are in a period immediately preceded by the 2009-2010 \nCongress. In 2009 and in 2010, we didn't have 44 filibusters, we had \n135 filibusters. In other words, the Senate has been three times as \ndysfunctional as it was preceding the last major debate in this Chamber \nover rules. Since each filibuster delays the work of the Senate for \napproximately a week under the rules, if you have 135 objections in a \n2-year period, that would be 135 weeks of delay in a 104-week period. \nObviously, many things are not going to get done with that type of \nobstruction. Indeed, during 2010 this Chamber was unable to pass a \nsingle appropriations bill of the 13 appropriations bills traditionally \ntaken under consideration, debated on this floor, and sent forward. Why \nis that important? Because in the appropriations bills, we make \ndecisions about what the most pressing problems in America are and how \nwe are going to allocate resources to address those pressing problems. \nWe didn't fail to do this in one or two areas; we failed to do it in \nall 13. Furthermore, this body did not pass a budget during the last \nyear, 2010. This body did not proceed to advise and consent on all of \nthe nominations that came before it. In fact, we left over 100 \nnominations pending.\n  This merits a little bit further discussion because under the \nConstitution, it is the Senate, this esteemed Chamber, that weighs in \non the President's nominations to fill key executive branch positions. \nIt is this Chamber that weighs in on the President's recommendations to \nfill judicial positions, to assign judges.\n\n  If we never get to the debate on the floor of the Senate, then we \nhave not fulfilled our constitutional responsibility to advise and \nconsent. In fact, we have wounded the executive branch, and we have \ndamaged the judicial branch. Certainly, under our theory of balance of \npowers, it was never envisioned that the advise-and-consent function of \nthe Senate would be used to damage other branches of government. We \nhave failed in our responsibility.\n  Furthermore, we have left over 400 House bills lying on the floor, \ncollecting dust, unprocessed, unconsidered. The saying in the House of \nRepresentatives is the Senate is where good House bills go to die.\n  It is appropriate that as we start a new 2-year period, we ask \nourselves how we should address this dysfunction. There was a time in \nwhich the Senate was called the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld. Unfortunately, today there is very little deliberation in the \nSenate. No appropriations bills, nominations unprocessed, hundreds of \nHouse bills untouched, an incomplete budget. The main culprit in this \nis the filibuster. A filibuster is kind of street language, if you \nwill, for an objection to the regular order of holding a majority vote \nand triggering about a week's delay in the Senate's process, and it \nalso triggers a supermajority of 60.\n  It has gotten to the point that in this constitutional function as a \nmajority body, a body in which we need 51 votes, it is functionally \nbecoming a supermajority body.\n  The Framers of the Constitution were very clear and they laid out a \nsupermajority required for certain purposes. A supermajority is \nrequired to approve treaties or a supermajority is required to impeach \nbut not to pass legislation. That was not the vision.\n  Today, I rise to say we can do better in the Senate and that we owe \nit under our constitutional responsibilities to do better.\n  There are a series of proposals that have been filed. One of my \ncolleagues has arrived, Senator Udall, who has been a key leader, \nenormously instrumental in this effort to reform the Senate. In a few \nminutes, I am going to ask unanimous consent for one of these rule \nchanges to be considered on the floor. I will do that when my \ncolleagues across the aisle have arrived. I will go further in \ndiscussing how we need to change the Senate.\n  Before I go further, Senator Udall already asked for a colloquy. I \nthought I would stop at this moment and see if he wants to jump in and \nshare some general thoughts before we get into the specifics of the \nvarious resolutions which we might ask unanimous consent to have \nconsidered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, first of all at the \nbeginning, let me thank two of my colleagues who have worked incredibly \nhard with me on the issue of Senate rules reform--Senator Merkley from \nOregon and Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa. Senator Harkin will be joining \nus at some point.\n  I also wish to thank the Chair. One of the very early leaders on the \nconstitutional option on Senate reform of the rules was Senator Jeanne \nShaheen from New Hampshire. She is in the chair today. I know she cares \nabout this a lot. I know she wants to see this move forward.\n  What we are trying to do is follow what has been the history in the \nSenate. At various points in the Senate, there has been respect for \neach other, the ability to get legislation on the floor, to have \ndebate. With the rules, it is pretty extraordinary when we look at the \nhistory.\n  When we look at the history of the Senate rules, one of the things \nthat is very clear in the movements in the fifties, sixties, and \nseventies to consider rules reform, both leaders would allow proposals \nonto the floor, allow these proposals onto the floor to be voted upon.\n  We have the extraordinary situation today--extraordinary, and we will \nsee when our colleagues show up--where our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle are basically saying: We don't want your rules reform on the \nfloor today. We are not going to allow that to happen.\n  As everybody in the Senate knows, we have to have unanimous consent \nto do this. We are not going to get consent today, but we want to lay \nout for people what it is that could happen if we were able to get \nsomething on the floor.\n  It is my belief, I say to Senator Merkley, that the proposals we \nmake--the proposal Senator Merkley and I are on and the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Shaheen, and 26 other Senators are on, S. Res. 10, \nthat we filed on January 10, is a reasonable proposal; it is a \ncommonsense proposal. The five proposals that are contained in the \nresolution have had substantial bipartisan support in the past.\n  I am going to be asking unanimous consent to put S. Res. 10 onto the \nfloor so we can have a debate on it, so we can move forward. What is, \nas I said, extraordinary is we are not going to get that consent. Our \nresearch indicates--and I know Senator Merkley and his staff worked \nvery hard. They had a chart that was three pages long. In the fifties, \nsixties, and seventies, these proposals were on the floor. They were \ndebated on the floor. Sometimes there was a motion to table, sometimes \nthere was an up-or-down vote. But we are having great difficulty \ngetting this reasonable, commonsense proposal on the floor.\n  Let me talk a little bit about S. Res. 10, which 26 other Senators \ncosponsored on the first day. First of all, it deals with a serious \nproblem. There are five parts to this issue. The first one is debate on \nmotions to proceed. It may\n\n[[Page S87]]\n\nsound a little crazy to people out there, but when we try to get \nsomething onto the floor, it does not happen automatically. Actually, \nwhat has to happen is if both sides do not agree, the majority leader \nfiles what is called a motion to proceed. We can end up on the motion \nto proceed, going along for 1 week, have to file cloture, which means \nto cut off debate on the motion to proceed, and then with all the \nripening time it takes about 1 week to get through that. We can get to \nthe end of the week, and if we do not get the 60 votes to cut off \ndebate on the motion to proceed, we are back to square one and have \nwasted a week. That is what we believe is a dilatory tactic. It does \nnot let us get to the point, the people's business.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. If I may interrupt for a moment, I wish to clarify what \nthe Senator from New Mexico just said, which is, a supermajority of the \nSenate, after 1 week of debate, is required just to get to the point \nwhere we might start debate on the bill, and the Senate wastes weeks \nand weeks debating whether to debate rather than doing the people's \nbusiness. That is a problem.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Senator Merkley hit it on the head. That is \na problem, and we have had that consistently in the 2 years that he and \nI have been here. My understanding is, it happened in many of the years \nbefore that time. In fact, Senator Byrd was very upset about the way \nthe motion to proceed was being used. In 1979, he came down to the \nfloor--he was the majority leader--and he did everything he could to \nchange the motion to proceed and try to make sure it was used more \nrationally and more reasonably.\n  What our proposal is, I say to Senator Merkley, and other Senators on \nthis resolution know, we are talking 2 hours of debate on the motion to \nproceed. Rather than wasting a week, if Majority Leader Reid comes down \nand says we are going to proceed to legislation about jobs and he puts \nit on the floor, the side over there gets an hour and our side gets an \nhour and then we are on the legislation, ready to have amendments \nfiled, ready for debate to take place.\n\n  We have saved us what we believe would be 1 week of time. That is \ndealing with the first proposal on the motion to proceed.\n  The second proposal is very simple, but it is going to move the \nSenate along in a dramatic way; that is, section 2, eliminating secret \nholds. I know we have several Senators who have worked for years and \nyears on secret holds. When I talk about the bipartisanship on secret \nholds, Senator Grassley, Senator Wyden, from Senator Merkley's great \nState of Oregon, Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri more recently, \nhave all been working on the issue of secret holds.\n  We very simply do this in one little section. We say:\n\n       No Senator may object on behalf of another Senator without \n     disclosing the name of that Senator.\n\n  That gets right to the heart of secret holds.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, the Senator from New Mexico is telling \nme it has become a common practice on the floor of the Senate for an \nindividual Senator who wants to oppose something to not have the \ncourage to stand here and tell the world their position but instead to \nsecretly object to a particular issue being raised. I cannot imagine \nthe American public can believe that Senators do not have the courage \nof their convictions to come here and say: I am going to hold up this \nlegislation because I disagree with it, and I am going to fight it any \nway I can. So the public can weigh in if they agree with them or not. \nThey will be accountable to the U.S. citizens.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. One of the things that happens--and we have \nseen a lot of this--we know some Senator is objecting, for example, to \na nomination, a high nomination in an executive department and does it \nsecretly so we do not know on the Senate floor, the press who covers \nthis does not have an idea, and the people do not know. Then, the same \nSenator goes to the department and negotiates policy, national policy \nabout a particular issue that concerns the whole Nation, all our \nStates, and tries to get an agreement, a backroom deal and an \nagreement. That is not the way we should be doing business, and that is \nwhy this very simple proposal: ``No Senator may object on behalf of \nanother Senator without disclosing the name of the Senator.''\n  You own the hold.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I wish to note, as Senator Udall observed, Senator \nWyden, Senator Grassley, and Senator McCaskill have worked hard on a \nmuch more detailed version than we have in S. Res. 10, but the basic \nnotion is the same. If a colleague is going to place a hold, they are \ngoing to do so in a public and accountable fashion and that would \ngreatly improve the quality of ballot.\n  I have been in the position of trying to get help for the Klamath \nBasin in Oregon because they have had little rainfall. I eventually did \nfind out, but it took me quite a while, asking a lot of questions about \nwho had the hold so I could ask them to release the hold so we would \nhave a chance of moving that assistance for this drought-impacted \nportion of my State.\n  With this change, those holding up assistance to Klamath or any other \narea would have to come to the floor and make clear where they stand.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Then it is transparent, then if you as a \nSenator on the Klamath Basin want to do something, you can go to that \nSenator--whoever it is--and say: I have an issue with my State. Can we \nwork together to try to work it out?\n  Right now the problem we have is that some Senator is putting on a \nsecret hold and we do not know who it is and we do not have the ability \nto clear that away. This is a good, solid proposal.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. It is not only secret to the public, it is often secret \nto fellow Senators, greatly complicating our effort to dialog with \nfellow Senators as to why we are pursuing something and get their \npartnership in it.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I am going to move on to the third section \nof S. Res. 10, which is the right to offer amendments. As Senator \nMerkley knows very well and our Presiding Officer, one of the big \nissues around here--and this is getting into a little bit of the weeds, \nbut one of the big issues that can help us function better is if we \njust agree, whether we are in the majority or in the minority, that we \nwant both sides to have the opportunity to debate and to offer \namendments. And so we are trying to protect that right. Many of us are \nthinking in terms of these rulings, and we are saying we want them to \nbe fair to both sides. So the provision on the right to offer \namendments is in the legislation. It talks about them being majority \nand minority amendments. It doesn't talk about parties because a lot of \nthe pundits are saying we are going to be in the minority in 2 years, \nand I think it is only fair in the Senate that we have that kind of \nrelationship.\n\n  Senator Merkley.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I want to note this is important to both the majority \nand the minority. For example, we recently had a bill on the floor of \nthe Senate which was a major bill regarding the compromise struck by \nPresident Obama with our Republican colleagues to spend almost $1 \ntrillion. I had an amendment I wanted to present that would have taken \nsome of the money in that bill that was being spent in a fashion which \ncreated very few jobs and to spend it in a fashion which would create a \nlot of jobs. I had another proposal to take money that wasn't being put \nto good use and to proceed to fill in and support the solvency of \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  Now, people can argue about whether these were good ideas, but if I \nhad been able to offer one or both of those amendments, I think it \nwould have improved the debate and dialogue and perhaps have resulted \nin a better piece of legislation.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. The fourth provision--and I think the \nSenator is very right on section 3, but section 4 is the issue of \nextended debate, and I would like to have the Senator talk about that \nissue because that is the issue on which you worked the most closely.\n  The Senator from Oregon has raised the issue of what we have going on \nright now is what we call a silent debate. It is a silent filibuster. \nWe have people who say they want to filibuster and object, but then \nthey go home or they go on vacation or something like that. So my \ncolleague has drafted a\n\n[[Page S88]]\n\nprovision--he is the architect of this provision in S. Res. 10, if he \ncould just go through that and talk about that section on extended \ndebate, what it does and why it is important to what we are dealing \nwith today.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Certainly. This provision about a talking filibuster \nsays rather than having a situation where a Senator objects to a \nmajority vote and then we delay the work of the Senate for a week, \nthough nobody is here explaining their position to the American public, \ninstead we would switch to a provision that says if 41 Senators want \ncontinued debate on a bill, we will get continued debate on a bill. We \nwill have debate on a bill, not silence.\n  Currently, we have the hidden or the silent filibuster. With this, we \nwould create the public or the talking filibuster. To give a sense of \nthe numbers on this, these blue bars represent filibusters during the \nlast 2-year period. During the first 6 months 33, 34 in the second 6 \nmonths, 36 in the third 6 months, and then 33. I think that is 136 \ntotal filibusters in a 2-year period.\n  This is why we didn't have any appropriations bills. This is why we \ndidn't have a budget. This is why we didn't deal with hundreds of House \nbills. And this is why we didn't get nominations done and advice and \nconsent on them.\n  Is this the way the Senate has always operated? Absolutely not. In \nthe last few decades there has been a huge change in how the Senate has \nfunctioned. So let's take a look at the average per year.\n  In the 1900-1970 period, the average was one filibuster per year. In \nthe 1970s, the average was 16 filibusters per year. In the 1980s, 21 \nfilibusters per year, average; in the 1990s, 36 filibusters per year, \naverage; in the 2000s, 2000-2010, 48 filibusters per year; and from \n2009 to 2010, this last session, an average of 68. There were 136 \ntotal.\n  So you can see from this chart the growing dysfunction. There was \nalways a social contract that existed in which an individual Senator \ndidn't exercise his or her power to object to a simple majority vote \nunless they thought it was an issue of huge consequence. Maybe that \nwould occur once or twice in a career, but not routinely week after \nweek. But that social contract has been eliminated. The filibuster was \nhonoring the right of every Senator to be heard; that we were not going \nto hold a vote until every Senator had his or her say so we could be \nfully informed and have a full dialogue. It is that reciprocal respect \nthat is being routinely disregarded and abused on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Many of us have an image of the filibuster that comes from the movie, \n``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' Here is Jimmy Stewart playing the \ncharacter of Jefferson Smith, and he comes to defend a corrupt action \nand to stop it regarding a camp for children. He talks through the \nnight, and there are many forces assaulting him, but Jimmy Stewart is \ngoing to stay on the Senate floor and he is going to tell the American \npeople what he is fighting for and why. This is the talking filibuster, \nwhere you don't object and go away and leave the Senate suspended. You \ndon't vote for additional debate and then not have that debate. You \ncome to this floor and you hold the floor and you join with other \npartners to hold the floor in order to explain why you are holding up \nthe Senate and to carry on the debate, to have that additional debate \nyou have voted for.\n  So the talking filibuster is almost that simple--it replaces the \nsilent filibuster with the talking filibuster. The result is two \ncritical things: First of all, transparency and accountability with the \nAmerican public. The public can see what you are saying on the floor of \nthe Senate and can say you are a hero or you are a bum. They can agree \nwith you or they can disagree, but it is visible, not hidden.\n  The second thing is each Senator has to expend time and energy to \ncarry out a filibuster, so this will strip away all these frivolous \nfilibusters that are done for no other reason than to prevent the \nSenate from being able to carry on with its responsibilities.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Let me also say one thing about the talking \nfilibuster that hit me, and that is bipartisanship. As we know, both of \nus, I think, were on the Senate floor when Senator Arlen Specter gave \nhis farewell address. I believe the Presiding Officer was also here. \nSenator Specter served in the minority for 2 years and then was in the \nmajority for almost 2 years and both times he came forward with a \nproposal where he was calling for the same thing--a talking filibuster, \nwhether he was on the minority side or the majority side.\n  So I think, once again, that just demonstrates that each of these \nprovisions has bipartisan support in it.\n  We don't think this debate is about partisanship. We don't think it \nis about a power grab. We don't think it is about those kinds of \nthings. It is about, as the Senator has elucidated, making the Senate \nwork better. When we say ``make the Senate work better,'' we are \ntalking about it working better for the American people.\n  I think if we did the oversight of government when it comes to \nappropriations bills, a budget, getting the budget out on time, getting \nappropriations bills done on time, that does a lot to make sure the \npublic's money is well spent, and that is something I hear a lot about \nback home.\n  I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nRepublican Policy Committee paper titled ``The Constitutional Option: \nThe Senate's Power To Make Procedural Rules by Majority Vote,'' dated \nApril 25, 2005.\n  We keep hearing that any use of the constitutional option is simply a \npower grab by Democrats. That is simply not true--and a 2005 Republican \nPolicy Committee memo provides some excellent points to rebut the power \ngrab argument.\n  Let me read part of the 2005 Republican memo and I will ask that the \nentire memo be printed in the Record:\n\n       This constitutional option is well grounded in the U.S. \n     Constitution and in Senate history.\n       The Senate has always had, and repeatedly has exercised, \n     the constitutional power to change the Senate's procedures \n     through a majority vote. Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd used \n     the constitutional option in 1977, 1979, 1980, and 1987 to \n     establish precedents changing Senate procedures during the \n     middle of a Congress. And the Senate several times has \n     changed its Standing Rules after the constitutional option \n     had been threatened, beginning with the adoption of the first \n     cloture rule in 1917. Simply put, the constitutional option \n     itself is a longstanding feature of Senate practice.\n       The Senate, therefore, has long accepted the legitimacy of \n     the constitutional option. Through precedent, the option has \n     been exercised and Senate procedures have been changed. At \n     other times it has been merely threatened, and Senators \n     negotiated textual rules changes through the regular order. \n     But regardless of the outcome, the constitutional option has \n     played an ongoing and important role.\n\n  The memo goes on to address some ``Common Misunderstandings of the \nConstitutional Option.'' Let me read some of those.\n  Again, this is a direct quote:\n\n       Senate procedures are sacrosanct and cannot be changed by \n     the constitutional option. This misunderstanding does not \n     square with history. As discussed, the constitutional option \n     has been used multiple times to change the Senate's practices \n     through the creation of new precedents. Also, the Senate has \n     changed its Standing Rules several times under the threat of \n     the constitutional option.\n\n  The next misunderstanding addressed in the memo is that ``Exercising \nthe constitutional option will destroy the filibuster for \nlegislation.''\n  The Republican rebuttal is:\n\n       The history of the use of the constitutional option \n     suggests that this concern is grossly overstated. Senators \n     will only exercise the constitutional option when they are \n     willing to live with the rule that is created, regardless of \n     which party controls the body.\n\n  And a final misunderstanding in the memo, and one which the \nRepublicans are happy to use now, is that ``the essential character of \nthe Senate will be destroyed if the constitutional option is \nexercised.''\n  The memo rebuts this by stating:\n\n       When Majority Leader Byrd repeatedly exercised the \n     constitutional option to correct abuses of Senate rules and \n     precedents, those illustrative exercises of the option did \n     little to upset the basic character of the Senate. Indeed, \n     many observers argue that the Senate minority is stronger \n     today in a body that still allows for extensive debate, full \n     consideration, and careful deliberation of all matters with \n     which it is presented.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the memo be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S89]]\n\n         [From the Republican Policy Committee, Apr. 25, 2005]\n\n      The Senate's Power To Make Procedural Rules by Majority Vote\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The filibusters of judicial nominations that arose during \n     the 108th Congress have created an institutional crisis for \n     the Senate.\n       Until 2003, Democrats and Republicans had worked together \n     to guarantee that nominations considered on the Senate floor \n     received up-or-down votes.\n       The filibustering Senators are trying to create a new \n     Senate precedent--a 60-vote requirement for the confirmation \n     of judges--contrary to the simple-majority standard presumed \n     in the Constitution.\n       If the Senate allows these filibusters to continue, it will \n     be acquiescing in Democrats' unilateral change to Senate \n     practices and procedures.\n       The Senate has the power to remedy this situation through \n     the ``constitutional option''--the exercise of a Senate \n     majority's constitutional power to define Senate practices \n     and procedures.\n       The Senate has always had, and repeatedly has exercised, \n     this constitutional option. The majority's authority is \n     grounded in the Constitution, Supreme Court case law, and the \n     Senate's past practices.\n       For example, Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd used the \n     constitutional option in 1977, 1979, 1980, and 1987 to \n     establish precedents that changed Senate procedures during \n     the middle of a Congress.\n       An exercise of the constitutional option under the current \n     circumstances would be an act of restoration--a return to the \n     historic and constitutional confirmation standard of simple-\n     majority support for all judicial nominations.\n       Employing the constitutional option here would not affect \n     the legislative filibuster because virtually every Senator \n     supports its preservation. In contrast, only a minority of \n     Senators believes in blocking judicial nominations by \n     filibuster.\n       The Senate would, therefore, be well within its rights to \n     exercise the constitutional option in order to restore up-or-\n     down votes for judicial nominations on the Senate floor.\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       In recent months, there has been growing public interest in \n     the Senate's ability to change its internal procedures by \n     majority vote. The impetus for this discussion is a Senate \n     minority's use of the filibuster to block votes on 10 \n     judicial nominations during the 108th Congress. Until then, a \n     bipartisan majority of Senators had worked together to \n     guarantee that filibusters were not to be used to permanently \n     block up-or-down votes on judicial nominations. For example, \n     as recently as March 2000, Majority Leader Trent Lott and \n     Minority Leader Tom Daschle worked together to ensure that \n     judicial nominees Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon received up-\n     or-down votes, even though Majority Leader Lott and most of \n     the Republican caucus ultimately voted against those \n     nominations. But that shared understanding of Senate norms \n     and practices--that judicial nominations shall not be blocked \n     by filibuster--broke down in the 108th Congress.\n       This breakdown in Senate norms is profound. There is now a \n     risk that the Senate is creating a new, 60-vote confirmation \n     standard. The Constitution plainly requires no more than a \n     majority vote to confirm any executive nomination, but some \n     Senators have shown that they are determined to override this \n     constitutional standard. Thus, if the Senate not act during \n     the 109th Congress to restore the Constitution's simple-\n     majority standard, it could be plausibly argued that a \n     precedent has been set by the Senate's acquiescence in a 60-\n     vote threshold for nominations.\n       One way that Senators can restore the Senate's traditional \n     understanding of its advice and consent responsibility is to \n     employ the ``constitutional option''--an exercise of a Senate \n     majority's power under the Constitution to define Senate \n     practices and procedures. The constitutional option can be \n     exercised in different ways, such as amending Senate Standing \n     Rules or by creating precedents, but regardless of the \n     variant, the purpose would be the same--to restore previous \n     Senate practices in the face of unforeseen abuses. Exercising \n     the constitutional option in response to judicial nomination \n     filibusters would restore the Senate to its longstanding \n     norms and practices governing judicial nominations, and \n     guarantee that a minority does not transform the fundamental \n     nature of the Senate's advice and consent responsibility. The \n     approach, therefore, would be both reactive and restorative.\n       This constitutional option is well grounded in the U.S. \n     Constitution and in Senate history. The Senate has always \n     had, and repeatedly has exercised, the constitutional power \n     to change the Senate's procedures through a majority vote. \n     Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd used the constitutional option \n     in 1977, 1979, 1980, and 1987 to establish precedents \n     changing Senate procedures during the middle of a Congress. \n     And the Senate several times has changed its Standing Rules \n     after the constitutional option had been threatened, \n     beginning with the adoption of the first cloture rule in \n     1917. Simply put, the constitutional option itself is a \n     longstanding feature of Senate practice.\n       This paper proceeds in four parts: (1) a discussion of the \n     constitutional basis of the Senate's right to set rules for \n     its proceedings; (2) an examination of past instances when \n     Senate majorities acted to define Senate practices--even \n     where the written rules and binding precedents of the Senate \n     dictated otherwise; (3) an evaluation of how this history \n     relates to the present impasse regarding judicial nomination \n     filibusters; and (4) a clarification of common \n     misunderstandings of, the constitutional option. The purpose \n     of this paper is not to resolve the political question of \n     whether the Senate should exercise the constitutional option, \n     but merely to demonstrate the constitutional and historical \n     legitimacy of such an approach.\n\n\n      The Constitution: the Senate's Right to Set Procedural Rules\n\n       ``Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.'' \n     --U.S. Constitution, art. I, sec. 5., cl. 2.\n       The Senate's constitutional power to make rules is \n     straightforward, but two issues do warrant brief \n     elaboration--the number of Senators that are constitutionally \n     necessary to establish procedures and whether there are any \n     time limitations as to when the rulemaking power can be \n     exercised.\n       The Supreme Court addressed both of these questions in \n     United States v. Ballin, an 1892 case interpreting Congress's \n     rulemaking powers.\\1\\ First, the Court held that the powers \n     delegated to each body are held by a simple majority of the \n     quorum, unless the Constitution expressly creates a \n     supermajority requirement.\\2\\ The Constitution itself sets \n     the quorum for doing business--a majority of the Senate.\\3\\ \n     Second, the Supreme Court held that the ``power to make rules \n     is not one which once exercised is exhausted. It is a \n     continuous power, always subject to be exercised by the \n     house.'' \\4\\ Thus, the Supreme Court has held that the power \n     of a majority of Senators to define the Senate's procedures \n     exists at all times--whether at the beginning, middle, or end \n     of a Congress.\n       The Senate majority exercises this constitutional \n     rulemaking power in several ways:\n       First, it has adopted Standing Rules to govern some Senate \n     practices and procedures. Those rules formally can be changed \n     by a majority vote. Any motion to formally amend the Standing \n     Rules is subject to debate, and Senate Rule XXII creates a \n     special two-thirds cloture threshold to end that debate.\n       Second, the Senate operates according to Senate precedents, \n     i.e., rulings by the Chair or the Senate itself regarding \n     questions of Senate procedure. A precedent is created \n     whenever the Chair rules on a point of order, when the Senate \n     sustains or rejects an appeal of the Chair's ruling on a \n     point of order, or when the Senate itself rules on a question \n     that has been submitted to it by the Chair.\\5\\ As former \n     parliamentarian and Senate procedural expert Floyd M. Riddick \n     has said, ``The precedents of the Senate are just as \n     significant as the rules of the Senate.'' \\6\\\n       Third, the Senate binds itself through rule-making statutes \n     that constrain and channel the consideration of particular \n     matters and guarantee that the Senate can take action on \n     certain matters by majority vote. At least 26 such rule-\n     making statutes govern Senate procedure and limit the right \n     to debate, dating back to the 1939 Reorganization Act and \n     including, most prominently, the 1974 Budget Act.\\7\\\n       Finally, the Senate can modify the above procedures through \n     Standing Orders, which can be entered via formal legislation, \n     Senate resolutions, and unanimous consent agreements.\n       It is important to emphasize, however, that these rules are \n     the mere background for day-to-day Senate procedure. As any \n     Senate observer knows, the institution functions primarily \n     through cooperation and tacit or express agreements about \n     appropriate behavior. Most business is conducted by unanimous \n     consent, and collective norms have emerged that assist in the \n     protection of minority rights without unduly hindering the \n     Senate's business.\n       Consider, for example, the Senate's contrasting norms \n     regarding the exercise of individual Senators' procedural \n     rights. Under the rules and precedents of the Senate, each \n     Senator has the right to object to consent requests and, with \n     a sufficient second, to demand roll call votes on customarily \n     routine motions. If Senators routinely exercised those \n     rights, however, the Senate would come to a standstill. Such \n     wholesale obstruction is rare, but not because the Senate's \n     standing rules, precedents, and rulemaking statutes prohibit \n     a Senator from engaging in that kind of delay. Rather, \n     Senators rarely employ such dilatory tactics because of the \n     potential reaction of other Senators or the possibility of \n     retaliation. As a result, informed self enforcement of \n     reasonable behavior is the norm.\n       At the same time, some ``obstructionist'' tactics have long \n     been accepted by the Senate as features of a body that \n     respects minority rights. Most prominent is the broadly \n     accepted right of a single Senator to speak for as long as he \n     or she wants on pending legislation, subject only to the \n     right of the majority to invoke cloture and shut off debate. \n     Indeed, an overwhelming and bipartisan consensus in support \n     of the current legislative filibuster system has existed for \n     30 years.\\8\\ Thus, the norms of the Senate tolerate some, but \n     not all, kinds or degrees of obstruction.\n       Thus, while written rules, precedents, and orders are \n     important, common understandings of self-restraint, \n     discretion, and\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\n     institutional propriety have primarily governed acceptable \n     Senatorial conduct. It is the departures from these norms of \n     conduct that have precipitated institutional crises that \n     require the Senate to respond.\n\n\n  The History: the Senate's Repeated Use of the Constitutional Option\n\n       The Senate is a relatively stable institution, but its \n     norms of conduct have sometimes been violated. In some \n     instances, a minority of Senators has rejected past practices \n     and bipartisan understandings and exploited heretofore ``off \n     limits'' opportunities to obstruct the Senate's business. At \n     other times, a minority of Senators has abused the rules and \n     precedents in a manner that violates Senators' reasonable \n     expectations of proper procedural parameters. These are \n     efforts to change Senate norms and practices, but they do not \n     necessarily have the support of a majority.\n       Such situations create institutional conundrums: what \n     should be done when a mere minority of Senators changes \n     accepted institutional norms? One option is to acquiesce and \n     allow ``rule by the minority'' so that the minority's norm \n     becomes the Senate's new norm. But another option has been \n     for the majority of Senators to deny the legitimacy of the \n     minority Senators' effort to shift the norms of the entire \n     body. And to do that, it has been necessary for the majority \n     to act independently to restore the previous Senate norms of \n     conduct.\n       This section examines those illustrative instances--\n     examples of when the Senate refused to permit a minority of \n     Senators to change norms of conduct or to otherwise exploit \n     the rules in ways destructive to the Senate, and, instead, \n     exercised the constitutional option.\n     Then-Majority Leader Byrd's Repeated Exercise of the \n         Constitutional Option\n       When Senator Robert C. Byrd was Majority Leader, he faced \n     several circumstances in which a minority of Senators (from \n     both parties) began to exploit Senate rules and precedents in \n     generally unprecedented ways. The result was obstruction of \n     Senate business that was wholly unrelated to the \n     institution's great respect for the right to debate and \n     amend. Majority Leader Byrd's response was to implement \n     procedural changes through majoritarian votes in order to \n     restore Senate practices to the previously accepted norms of \n     the body.\n     1977--Majority Leader Byrd Exercised the Constitutional \n         Option to Alter Operation of Rule XXII and Prevent Post-\n         Cloture Filibusters\n       In 1977, two Senators attempted to block a natural gas \n     deregulation bill after cloture had already been invoked.\\9\\ \n     A ``post-cloture filibuster'' should seem counterintuitive \n     for anyone with a casual acquaintance with Senate rules, but \n     these obstructing Senators had found a loophole. Although \n     further debate was foreclosed by Rule XXII once post-cloture \n     debate was exhausted, the Senators were able to delay a final \n     vote by offering a series of amendments and then forcing \n     quorum calls and roll call votes for each one. Even if the \n     amendments were ``dilatory'' or ``not germane'' (which Rule \n     XXII expressly prohibits), Senate procedure provided no \n     mechanism to get an automatic ruling from the Chair that the \n     amendments were defective. A Senator could raise a point of \n     order, but any favorable ruling could be appealed, and a roll \n     call vote could be demanded on the appeal. Moreover, in 1975, \n     before a point of order could even be made, an amendment \n     first must have been read by the clerk. While the reading of \n     amendments is commonly waived by unanimous consent, anyone \n     could object and require a reading that could further tie up \n     Senate business. Thus, the finality that cloture is supposed \n     to produce could be frustrated.\n       These practices were proper under Senate rules and \n     precedents, but Majority Leader Byrd concluded in this \n     context that these tactics were an abuse of Senate Rule XXII. \n     His response was to make a point of order that ``when the \n     Senate is operating under cloture the Chair is required to \n     take the initiative under rule XXII to rule out of order all \n     amendments which are dilatory or which on their face are out \n     of order.'' \\10\\ The Presiding Officer, Vice President Walter \n     Mondale, sustained the point of order, another Senator \n     appealed, and Majority Leader Byrd immediately moved to \n     table. The Senate then voted to sustain the motion to table \n     the appeal. In so doing, the Senate set a new precedent that \n     ran directly contrary to the Senate's longstanding procedures \n     which required Senators to raise points of order to enforce \n     Senate rules. Now, under this precedent, the Chair would be \n     empowered to take the initiative to rule on questions of \n     order in a post-cloture environment.\n       The reason for Majority Leader Byrd's tactic immediately \n     became clear. He began to call up each of the dilatory \n     amendments that had been filed post-cloture, and the Chair \n     instantly ruled them out of order. There was no reading of \n     the amendments (which would have been dilatory in itself) and \n     there were no roll call votes. The Majority Leader then \n     exercised his right of preferential recognition to call up \n     numerous remaining amendments, and similarly disposed of \n     them. No appeals could be taken because any appeal was mooted \n     when Majority Leader Byrd secured his preferential \n     recognition to call up additional amendments.'' \\11\\\n       This was the constitutional option in action. Majority \n     Leader Byrd did not follow the regular order and attempt to \n     amend the Senate Rules in order to block these tactics. \n     Instead, he used a simple point of order that cut off the \n     ability of a minority of Senators to add a new layer of \n     obstruction to the legislative process. His method was \n     consistent with the Senate's constitutional authority to \n     establish procedure.\n     1979--Majority Leader Byrd Exercised the Constitutional \n         Option to Change Operation of Rule XVI (Limiting \n         Amendments to Appropriations Bills)\n       Majority Leader Byrd used the constitutional option again \n     in 1979 in order to block legislation on appropriations \n     bills.\\12\\ Standing Rule XVI barred Senate legislative \n     amendments to appropriations bills. By precedent, however, \n     such amendments were permissible when offered as germane \n     modifications of House legislative provisions. Thus, when the \n     House acted first and added legislative language to an \n     appropriations measure, Senators could respond by offering \n     legislative amendments to the House's legislative language. \n     While another Senator might make a point of order, the \n     Senator offering the authorizing language could respond with \n     a defense of germaneness. And, by the express language of \n     Rule XVI, that question of germaneness must be submitted to \n     the Senate and decided without debate. By enabling the full \n     Senate to vote on the germaneness defense without getting a \n     ruling from the Presiding Officer first, the legislative \n     amendment's sponsor avoided having to overturn the ruling of \n     the Chair and create any formal precedents in doing so. The \n     result was a breakdown in the appropriations process due to \n     legislative amendments, and it was happening pursuant to \n     Senate rules that plainly permitted these tactics.\n       Majority Leader Byrd resolved to override the plain text of \n     Rule XVI and strip the Senate of its ability to decide \n     questions of germaneness in this context. Senator Byrd's \n     mechanism was similar to the motion he employed in 1977: he \n     made a point of order that ``this is a misuse of precedents \n     of the Senate, since there is no House language to which this \n     amendment could be germane, and that, therefore, the Chair is \n     required to rule on the point of order as to its being \n     legislation on an appropriation bill and cannot submit the \n     question of germaneness to the Senate.'' \\13\\ The Chair \n     sustained the point of order, and the Senate rejected the \n     ensuing appeal, 44-40.\n       The result of Majority Leader Byrd's exercise of the \n     constitutional option was a binding precedent that caused the \n     Senate to operate in a manner directly contrary to the plain \n     language of Rule XVI.\\14\\ Moreover, the method was contrary \n     to past Senate practices regarding germaneness. But the \n     process employed, as in 1977, was nonetheless constitutional \n     because nothing in the Senate's rules, precedents, or \n     practices can deny the Senate the constitutional power to set \n     its procedural rules.\n     1980--Majority Leader Byrd Changed Procedures Governing \n         Executive Session and the Treatment of Judicial \n         Nominations\n       The Senate's Executive Calendar has two sections--treaties \n     and nominations. Prior to March 1980, a motion to enter \n     Executive Session, if carried, would move the Senate \n     automatically to the first item on the Calendar, often a \n     treaty. Rule XXII provides (then and now) that such a motion \n     to enter Executive Session is not debatable. However, unlike \n     the non-debatable motion to enter Executive Session, any \n     motion to proceed to a particular item on the Executive \n     Calendar was then subject to debate. In practice, then, the \n     Senate could not proceed to consider any business other than \n     the first Executive Calendar item without a Senator offering \n     a debatable motion, which then would be subject to a possible \n     filibuster.\\15\\\n       Majority Leader Byrd announced his objection to this \n     potential ``double filibuster'' (once on the motion to \n     proceed to a particular Executive Calendar item, and again on \n     the Executive Calendar item itself), and exercised another \n     version of the constitutional option. This time he moved to \n     proceed directly to a particular nomination on the Executive \n     Calendar and sought to do so without debate. Senator Jesse \n     Helms made the point of order that Majority Leader Byrd could \n     only move by a non-debatable motion into Executive Session, \n     not to a particular treaty or nomination.\\16\\ The Presiding \n     Officer upheld the point of order given that it was grounded \n     in Rule XXII and longstanding understandings of Senate \n     practices and procedures. But Majority Leader Byrd simply \n     appealed the ruling of the Chair and prevailed, 38-54. Thus, \n     even though there was no basis in the Senate Rules, and even \n     though Senate practices had long preserved the right to \n     debate any motion to proceed to a particular Executive \n     Calendar item, the Senate exercised its constitutional power \n     to ``make rules for its proceedings'' and created the \n     procedure that the Senate continues to use today.\n       As an historical sidenote, Majority Leader Byrd used this \n     new precedent to great effect in December 1980 when he \n     bypassed several items (including several nominations) on the \n     Executive Calendar to take up a single judicial nomination--\n     that of Stephen Breyer, then Chief Counsel to the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, to be a judge on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the First Circuit. Judge Breyer was later \n     nominated and confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1994. \n     Without Majority Leader Byrd's exercise of the constitutional \n     option earlier that year, it is almost certain that Justice \n     Breyer would not be on the Supreme Court today.\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\n     1987--Majority Leader Byrd Forced Change to Rule XII's Voting \n         Procedures through Execution of the Constitutional Option\n       A fourth exercise of the constitutional option came in 1987 \n     when Senator Byrd was once again Majority Leader. The \n     controversy in question involved an effort by Majority Leader \n     Byrd to proceed to consider a particular bill, an effort that \n     had been frustrated because a minority of Senators objected \n     each time he moved to proceed. To thwart his opponents, \n     Majority Leader Byrd sought to use a special feature of the \n     Senate Rules--the Morning Hour (the first two hours of the \n     Legislative Day).\n       Under Rule VIII, a motion to proceed to an item on the \n     Legislative Calendar that is made during the Morning Hour is \n     non-debatable. This feature of the rules gives the Majority \n     Leader significant power to set the Senate agenda due to his \n     right to preferential recognition (which is, itself, a \n     creature of mere custom and precedent). Such a motion cannot \n     be made, however, until the Senate Journal is approved and \n     Morning Business is thereafter concluded (or the first of the \n     two hours has passed). Meanwhile, the clock runs on the \n     Morning Hour while that preliminary business takes place. \n     When the Morning Hour expires, a motion to proceed once again \n     becomes debatable and subject to filibuster.\\17\\ It was this \n     feature of the Morning Hour that Senator Byrd believed would \n     enable him to proceed to the bill in question.\n       Majority Leader Byrd's plan was complicated, however, when \n     objecting Senators forced a roll call vote on the approval of \n     the Journal, as was their right under the procedures and \n     practices of the Senate. Rule XII provides that during a roll \n     call vote, if a Senator declines to vote, he or she must \n     state a reason for being excused. The Presiding Officer then \n     must put a non-debatable question to the Senate as to whether \n     the Senator should be excused from voting. When Majority \n     Leader Byrd moved to approve the Journal, one Senator \n     declined to vote and sought to be excused. Following Rule \n     XII, the Presiding Officer put the question directly to the \n     Senate--should the Senator be excused?--but during the roll \n     call on whether the first Senator should be excused, another \n     Senator announced that he wished to be excused from voting on \n     whether the first Senator should be excused. The Chair was \n     likewise obliged to put the question to the Senate. At that \n     point, yet another Senator announced he wished to be excused \n     from that vote. There were four roll call votes then \n     underway--the original motion to approve the Journal and \n     three votes on whether Senators could be excused. If Senators \n     persisted in this tactic, the time it took for roll call \n     votes would cause the Morning Hour to expire, and the \n     Majority Leader would lose his ability to move to proceed to \n     his bill without debate. All this maneuvering was wholly \n     consistent with the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n       Majority Leader Byrd countered with a point of order, \n     arguing that the requests to be excused were, in fact, little \n     more than efforts to delay the actual vote on the approval of \n     the Journal. His solution was to exercise the constitutional \n     option: to use majority-supported Senate precedents to change \n     Senate procedures, outside the operation of the Senate rules. \n     In three subsequent party-line votes, three new precedents \n     were established: first, that a point of order could be made \n     declaring repeated requests to be excused from voting on a \n     motion to approve the Journal (or a vote subsumed by it) to \n     be ``dilatory;'' second, that repeated requests to be excused \n     from voting on a motion to approve the Journal (or a vote \n     subsumed by it) ``when they are obviously done for \n     the purpose of delaying the announcement of the vote on \n     the motion to approve the Journal, are out of order;'' and \n     third, that a Senator has a ``limited time'' to explain \n     his reason for not voting, i.e., he cannot filibuster by \n     speaking indefinitely when recognized to state his reason \n     for not voting.\\18\\ Majority Leader Byrd had crafted these \n     new procedures completely independently of the Senate \n     Rules, and they were adopted by a partisan majority \n     without following the procedures for rule changes provided \n     in Rule XXII. Yet the tactics were wholly within the \n     Senate's constitutional power to devise its own \n     procedures.\n       This 1987 circumstance offers a very important precedent \n     for the present difficulties. Majority Leader Byrd \n     established that a majority could restrict the rights of \n     individual Senators outside the cloture process if the \n     majority concluded that the Senators were acting in a purely \n     ``dilatory'' fashion. Previous to that day, dilatory tactics \n     were only out of order after cloture had been invoked.\n     Additional Senate Endorsements of the Constitutional Option\n       The Senate also has endorsed (or acted in response to) some \n     version of the constitutional option several other times over \n     the past 90 years--in 1917, 1959, 1975, and 1979.\n       The original cloture rule, adopted in 1917, itself appears \n     to be the result of a threat to exercise the constitutional \n     option. Until 1917, the Senate had no cloture rule at all, \n     although one had been discussed since the days of Henry Clay \n     and Daniel Webster. The ability of Senators to filibuster any \n     effort to create a cloture rule put the body in a quandary: \n     debate on a possible cloture rule could not be foreclosed \n     without some form of cloture device.\n       The logjam was broken when first term Senator Thomas Walsh \n     announced his intention to exercise a version of the \n     constitutional option so that the Senate could create a \n     cloture rule. His method was to propose a cloture rule and \n     forestall a filibuster by asserting that the Senate could \n     operate under general parliamentary law while considering the \n     proposed rule. Doing so would permit the Senate to avail \n     itself of a motion for the previous question to terminate \n     debate--a standard feature of general parliamentary law.\\19\\ \n     In this climate, Senate leaders quickly entered into \n     negotiations to craft a cloture rule.\\20\\ Negotiators \n     produced a rule that was adopted, 76-3, with the opposing \n     Senators choosing not to filibuster.\\21\\ But it was only \n     after Senator Walsh made clear that he intended to press the \n     constitutional option that those negotiations bore fruit. As \n     Senator Clinton Anderson would remark in 1953, ``Senator \n     Walsh won without firing a shot.'' \\22\\\n       The same pattern repeated in 1959, 1975, and 1979. In each \n     case, the Senate faced a concerted effort by an apparent \n     majority of Senators to exercise the constitutional option to \n     make changes to Senate rules. In 1959, some Senators \n     threatened to exercise the constitutional option in order to \n     change the cloture requirements of Rule XXII. Then-Majority \n     Leader Lyndon Johnson preempted its use by offering a \n     modification to Rule XXII that was adopted through the \n     regular order.\\23\\ In 1975, the Senate three times formally \n     endorsed the constitutional option by creating precedents \n     aimed at facilitating rule changes by majority vote, although \n     the ultimate rule change (also to Rule XXII) was implemented \n     through the regular order after off-the-Floor \n     negotiations.\\24\\ And in 1979, Majority Leader Byrd \n     threatened to use the constitutional option unless the Senate \n     consented to a time frame for consideration of changes to \n     post-cloture procedures. The Senate acquiesced, and the \n     Majority Leader did not need to use the constitutional option \n     as he had in the other cases discussed above.\\25\\\n       The Senate, therefore, has long accepted the legitimacy of \n     the constitutional option. Through precedent, the option has \n     been exercised and Senate procedures have been changed. At \n     other times it has been merely threatened, and Senators \n     negotiated textual rules changes through the regular order. \n     But regardless of the outcome, the constitutional option has \n     played an ongoing and important role.\n     The Judicial Filibuster and the Constitutional Option\n       The filibusters of judicial nominations during the 108th \n     Congress were unprecedented in Senate history.\\26\\ While \n     cloture votes had been necessary for a few nominees in \n     previous years, leaders from both parties consistently worked \n     together to ensure that nominees who reached the Senate floor \n     received up-or-down votes. The result of this bipartisan \n     cooperation was that, until 2003, no judicial nominee with \n     clear majority support had ever been defeated due to a \n     refusal by a Senate minority to permit an up-or-down floor \n     vote, i.e., a filibuster.\\27\\\n       The best illustration of this traditional norm is the March \n     2000 treatment of President Bill Clinton's nominations of \n     Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon to the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the Ninth Circuit. When those nominations reached the \n     Senate floor, Majority Leader Trent Lott, working with \n     Democrat Leader Tom Daschle, filed cloture before any \n     filibuster could materialize. Republican Judiciary Chairman \n     Orrin Hatch likewise fought to preserve Senate norms and \n     traditions, arguing that it would be ``a travesty if we \n     establish a routine of filibustering judges.'' \\28\\ Moreover, \n     as a further testament to the bipartisan opposition to \n     filibusters for judicial nominations, more than 20 \n     Republicans who opposed the nominations and who would vote \n     against them nonetheless supported cloture for Mr. Paez and \n     Ms. Berzon, and cloture was easily reached.\\29\\ Had every \n     Senator who voted against Mr. Paez's nomination likewise \n     voted against cloture, cloture would not have been invoked. \n     Thus, as recently as March 2000, more than 80 Senators were \n     on record opposing the filibuster of judicial \n     nominations.\\30\\ If the new judicial nomination \n     filibusters are accepted as a norm, then the Senate will \n     be rejecting this history and charting a new course.\n       It is not only the Senate norm regarding not filibustering \n     judicial nominations that risks being transformed, but the \n     effective constitutional standard for the confirmation of \n     judicial nominations. There can be no serious dispute that \n     the Constitution requires only a Senate majority for \n     confirmation. Indeed, many judicial nominees have been \n     confirmed by fewer than 60 votes in the past--including three \n     Clinton nominees and two Carter nominees.\\31\\ Never has the \n     Senate claimed that a supermajority is necessary for \n     confirmation.\n       Recently, however, some filibustering Senators have \n     suggested that a failed cloture vote is tantamount to an up-\n     or-down vote on a judicial nomination. The new Senate \n     Minority Leader, Harry Reid, has stated that the 10 \n     filibustered judges have been ``turned down.'' \\32\\ Senator \n     Charles Schumer has repeatedly stated that a failed cloture \n     vote is evidence that the Senate has ``rejected'' a \n     nomination.\\33\\ Senator Russell Feingold described the \n     filibustered nominees from the 108th Congress as having \n     ``been duly considered by the Senate and rejected.'' \\34\\ \n     Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Patrick Leahy has referred \n     to the filibustered nominees as having been ``effectively \n     rejected.'' \\35\\ And in April 2005, Senator Joseph Lieberman\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\n     claimed that 60 votes should be the ``minimum'' for \n     confirmation.\\36\\ These characterizations illustrate the \n     extent to which the Senate has lost its moorings.\n       Without restoration of the majority-vote standard, judicial \n     nominations will require an extra-constitutional \n     supermajority to be confirmed, without any constitutional \n     amendment--or even a Senate consensus--supporting that \n     change. Any exercise of the constitutional option would, \n     therefore, be aimed at restoring the Senate's procedures to \n     conform to its traditional norms and practices in dealing \n     with judicial nominations. It would return the Senate to the \n     Constitution's majority-vote confirmation standard. And it \n     would prevent the Senate from abusing procedural rules to \n     create supermajority requirements. Instead, it would be \n     restorative, and Democrats and Republicans alike would \n     operate in the system that served the nation until the 108th \n     Congress.\n\n\n         Common Misunderstandings of the Constitutional Option\n\n     Senate procedures are sacrosanct and cannot be changed by the \n         constitutional option.\n       This misunderstanding does not square with history. As \n     discussed, the constitutional option has been used multiple \n     times to change the Senate's practices through the creation \n     of new precedents. Also, the Senate has changed its Standing \n     Rules several times under the threat of the constitutional \n     option.\n     Exercising the constitutional option will destroy the \n         filibuster for legislation.\n       The history of the use of the constitutional option \n     suggests that this concern is grossly overstated. Senators \n     will only exercise the constitutional option when they are \n     willing to live with the rule that is created, regardless of \n     which party controls the body. For the very few Senators (if \n     any) who today want to eliminate the legislative filibuster \n     by majority vote, the roadmap has existed since as early as \n     1917. Moreover, an exercise of the constitutional option to \n     restore the norms for judicial confirmations would be just \n     that--an act of restoration. To eliminate the legislative \n     filibuster would not be restorative of Senate norms and \n     traditions; it would destroy the Senate's longstanding \n     respect for the legislative filibuster as a vehicle to \n     protect Senators' rights to amend and debate. It is also \n     worth noting that the Senate is now entering its 30th year of \n     bipartisan consensus as to the cloture threshold (three-\n     fifths of those duly chosen and sworn) for legislative \n     filibusters.\\37\\\n     All procedural changes must be made at the beginning of a \n         Congress.\n       Again, this claim, does not square with history. In fact, \n     there is nothing special about the beginning of a Congress \n     vis-a-vis the Senate's right to establish its own practices \n     and procedures, or even its formal Standing Rules. As \n     discussed above, Majority Leader Byrd used the constitutional \n     option to create a precedent that overrode Rule XVI's plain \n     text--and not at the beginning of a Congress. Moreover, as \n     the Supreme Court held in Ballin, each House of Congress's \n     constitutional power to make procedural rules is of equal \n     value at all times.\\38\\\n     The essential character of the Senate will be destroyed if \n         the constitutional option is exercised.\n       When Majority Leader Byrd repeatedly exercised the \n     constitutional option to correct abuses of Senate rules and \n     precedents, those illustrative exercises of the option did \n     little to upset the basic character of the Senate. Indeed, \n     many observers argue that the Senate minority is stronger \n     today in a body that still allows for extensive debate, full \n     consideration, and careful deliberation of all matters with \n     which it is presented.\n     Exercising the constitutional option would turn the Senate \n         into a ``rubber stamp.''\n       Again, history proves otherwise. The Senate has repeatedly \n     exercised its constitutional power to reject judicial \n     nominations through straightforward denials of ``consent'' by \n     up-or-down votes. For example, the Senate defeated the \n     Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork (1987), G. Harold \n     Carswell (1970), and Clement Haynsworth (1969) on up-or-down \n     votes.\\39\\ Even in the 108th Congress, when the Senate voted \n     on the nomination of J. Leon Holmes to a federal district \n     court in Arkansas, five Republicans voted against \n     President Bush's nominee. Had several Democrats not voted \n     for Mr. Holmes, he would not have been confirmed.\\40\\ In \n     other words, the Senate still has the ability to work its \n     will in a nonpartisan fashion as long as the minority \n     permits the body to come to up-or-down votes. Members from \n     both parties will ensure that the Senate does its \n     constitutional duty by carefully evaluating all nominees.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Can the Senate restore order when a minority of its members \n     chooses to upset tradition? Does the Constitution empower the \n     Senate to act so that it need not acquiesce whenever a \n     minority decides that the practices, procedures, and rules \n     should be changed? Can the Senate majority--not necessarily a \n     partisan majority, but simply a majority of Senators--act to \n     return the Senate to its previously agreed-upon norms and \n     practices? The answer to all these questions is a clear yes. \n     The Senate would be acting well within its traditions if it \n     were to restore the longstanding procedural norms so that the \n     majority standard for confirmation is preserved and nominees \n     who reach the Senate floor do not fall victim to filibusters.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       \\1\\ 144 U.S. 1 (1892).\n       \\2\\ Ballin, 144 U.S. at 6.

I think this shows this isn't about a power \ngrab; this is about trying to work to make sure the Senate is going to \nwork better for the American people.\n  The fifth provision of S. Res. 10--and as Senator Merkley knows, we \nare down here today to try to get S. Res. 10, rules changes, onto the \nSenate floor, and so we are going to be asking unanimous consent for \nthat. But the fifth provision is called postcloture debate on \nnominations.\n  Now, what are we talking about? Well, when we have a nomination that \ncomes to the floor--a judicial nomination, an executive nomination--in \nthe rule nominations have 30 hours of postcloture debate. So when you \ndecide to cut off debate, when you get to the point that you say we are \ngoing to cut off debate, that 30 hours is normally used for amendments \nand to work through the amendment process.\n  Well, when you have a nomination, you are not amending a nomination. \nYou are trying to either move forward with an up-or-down vote on the \nnomination--the person is either voted up or down. It makes no sense to \nhave 30 hours. So the other commonsense proposal we have is to shorten \nthat postcloture time to 2 hours, from 30 hours, because there is no \nreason to amend in that phase.\n  I know Senator Merkley is also familiar with this provision.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I think what the Senator from New Mexico has set forward \nis that we would save 28 hours on each nomination. If the Senate goes \naround the clock, that is a bit more than a day. If we are doing 10-\nhour days, that is almost 3 days. We save 3 days of Senate time that is \nput to no purpose right now since by the time you have a 60-vote \ncloture you already have 60 Members saying they are ready to vote and \nwant to go forward.\n  So letting people wrap up over a couple of hours, restating their key \npoints for other Members, makes sense. That is why the 2 hours are \nthere. But rather 2 hours than 3 days.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. That is correct. So what we are doing \ntoday--and I know Senator Merkley has introduced a freestanding \nproposal on the talking filibuster, and we have joined together; I have \nalso signed on to that--we have S. Res. 10, filed on January 5, which \nhas the five solid provisions for reforming the rules. I think if you \nlook at these in history, they have had broad bipartisan support.\n  I would at this point recognize our colleague in this rules debate, \nour partner and hard worker and more senior in experience on these \nrules matters, who has joined us--Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa. We are \nin a colloquy situation, so I will yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield for an observation.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. You bet.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleagues, Senator \nUdall of New Mexico and Senator Merkley of Oregon, because they are \ngreat leaders on this issue. I think they have brought a breath of \nfresh air to the Senate in exposing what has become gridlock that has \nmade the Senate almost dysfunctional.\n  I say to my friend, Senator Udall, especially in focusing on what the \nConstitution says and doesn't say, I believe--and I am only speaking \nfor myself--that we are not living up to the oath we took as we stood \nby the well when we were sworn into the Senate. We took an oath that we \nwould uphold and defend the Constitution and that we would bear true \nfaith and allegiance to the same.\n  Well, quite frankly, the Constitution, I believe, is quite clear in \nthe way it is written, in the verbiage that is used. If you look to \nwhat the Founders wanted in the Constitution, they were very clear that \nbut for a few instances, which they clearly spelled out in the \nConstitution requiring a supermajority of votes--such as treaties, for \nexample, and impeachments, or expelling a Member--everything else is a \nmajority vote.\n  But the Senate has adopted rules in the past that I believe are, \nquite frankly, bordering on unconstitutional by requiring that in order \nto change the rules, it requires a two-thirds vote--67 votes. Well, \nthat might be OK for one Congress, if they wanted to adopt that kind of \nrule, but how can one Congress bind another? I think it is quite clear \nfrom Parliaments of old and other legislative bodies, court rulings in \nthis country, that one legislative body cannot burden a subsequent \nlegislative body. Yet in the Senate, because of a change in the rules \nthat happened some years ago, they say it binds every Senate \nthereafter.\n  I believe that is unconstitutional. My friend from New Mexico, \nSenator Udall, has pointed this out time and time again, that really we \nhave not only a constitutional right but a constitutional obligation \nthat, on the first convening day of the Senate of any Congress, we \nadopt rules, and we can adopt those rules by majority vote. If the \nmajority wants to adopt a rule that says that for this Congress we have \nto abide by a certain number, that is OK, but it cannot bind another \nCongress.\n  Senator Udall has been quite eloquent on this issue. He has been very \nforthright and has fought very hard for what is known as the \nconstitutional option. That is just a fancy word for saying ``live up \nto the Constitution.'' We took an oath to bear true faith and \nallegiance to the same--the Constitution. Senator Udall is constantly \nreminding us of what that Constitution says and does not say. As the \nSenator has pointed out many times, the Constitution says each body \nshall adopt its rules. So the Senate can adopt its rules. It does not \nsay in the Constitution that each body shall adopt its rules but it \nrequires a two-thirds vote to change those rules. It doesn't say that. \nIt says each body shall adopt the rules, and it does not specify that \nwe have to have a supermajority to do so. I think it only specifies a \nsupermajority, if I am not mistaken, in five cases. Obviously, the \nFramers of the Constitution were quite clear that each Congress could \nadopt its rules and it could adopt them by a majority vote. Now we have \na situation in the Senate whereby we are throttled by rules that do not \npermit us to change those rules except by a two-thirds vote.\n  As I said many times, what if the voters of this country decided to \nelect 90 Senators from the same party, say, the Republican Party. Could \nthey come in and say: We are going to adopt new rules, and from \nhenceforth it is going to take 90 votes to change those rules, knowing \nthat may never happen again in the history of this country that we \nwould ever have 90 Senators from one party. Could they do that? If you \naccept the logic of what we are working with right now, the answer is \nyes, we could do that and bind every Senate from then on in perpetuity \nthat the only way they could change the rules would be with 90 votes. \nWe say that wouldn't happen. Well, what about 67 votes or 75 votes or \n78 votes? What is so magic about 67? Where does that magic number come \nfrom? It was plucked out of thin air.\n  That is why I address myself to the issue Senator Udall has worked so \nhard on; that is, focusing on the constitutional issue.\n  Senator Merkley, from Oregon, has focused on rule XXII--it is called \nthe filibuster rule--which provides basically that we do not even have \nto filibuster. In a filibuster, people think they come on the Senate \nfloor, like ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' and they speak and they \nhold the floor and they can hold the floor until they drop or, if \nsomebody else wants to speak, they can speak. That is what people\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\nimagine a filibuster to be, and that is what a filibuster used to be. \nWhat a filibuster has become is a means whereby the minority can stop \nus from debating anything. So what has happened to the Senate, \nsupposedly the greatest deliberative body in the world, is we have now \nbecome the greatest nondeliberative body because we do not debate \nbecause now a minority can decide what we take up and what we do not \ntake up.\n  Think about it this way. Under rule XXII, as it is now being used, 41 \nSenators can decide what this body does. They have the veto right--the \nveto right over anything we bring up, that the majority wants to bring \nup. Again, when I say ``majority,'' I am not saying Democrats or \nRepublicans; I am saying any majority. That is why I first brought up \nmy proposal in 1995, when we were in the minority, because I wanted to \nmake it clear that this was not a means whereby we were trying to grab \npower or anything. I said, no, this is for the smooth functioning of \nthis place. I predicted at that time, in 1995, and the record is \nclear--it is in the Record--I predicted that unless we do something, \nthe number of filibusters would escalate, it would be an arms race, and \nthat is exactly what has happened--135 last year.\n  So the Senator from Oregon has said that if we are going to have a \nfilibuster, at least people ought to come on the floor and talk. At \nleast, if you are going to filibuster, if you are so opposed to a bill \nand you have a group who is opposed to it, at least stand out here and \nspeak. They don't have to do that now. They put in quorum calls and \nwalk off the floor, and a minority--41 Senators--decides what we take \nup. They can stop anything.\n  Think about it this way. For a bill to become law in this country, it \nrequires that it pass the House and the Senate in the same form, and \nthe President has to sign it. Right now, the way we are constituted and \nthe way we operate in the Senate, 41, a minority in the Senate--\nregardless of what the House wants to do, regardless of what the \nPresident wants to do, and regardless of what the voters may want--can \nstop it. That turns the whole concept of democracy on its head. I \nthought the majority rules, with rights to protect the minority. So the \nminority can offer amendments. I don't even mind if the minority wants \nto slow things down. That should be their right, to be able to do that \nas a minority. They should have the right to offer amendments, to \nchange a bill as they see fit. But I do not believe a minority ought to \nhave the right to absolutely stop and veto a bill or an amendment from \ncoming to the Senate floor. We have a situation where the power resides \nwith the minority.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, said \nthe other day that this is a power grab by the Democrats. No, no; the \npower grab is by the minority, whatever minority. The power grab is by \nthe minority to insist that they have the right to veto anything here. \nThat is the power grab. So now the power lies with the minority, but \nthe responsibility lies with the majority. So the majority in the \nSenate has the responsibility to act, but we do not have the authority. \nThe minority has the authority, the right to veto things, but they \ndon't have the responsibility. That is why we have such a dysfunctional \nsystem. This is what the people of America are opposed to.\n  I will have more to say about this tomorrow as I think we will get \ninto a longer debate on this issue. I think the people have the right \nto understand that if a majority of the House and a majority of the \nSenate pass something and the President agrees, it ought to become law. \nThat is not the way it is. We used to have a system on the Senate floor \nwhere, if you offered an amendment and you got 51 votes, you agreed to \nthe amendment. You can't do that anymore. You cannot get an amendment \noffered on the Senate floor unless you have 60 votes. That is what \nhappened over the last 4 or 5 years. I know I myself tried to get an \namendment offered on the financial regulation bill. I thought I had \nover 51 votes on it. I don't know if I did or not, but I was not able \nto offer it because there was a 60-vote threshold. I might have had 52 \nor 53 or 54 or 55, but I did not have 60. Now in the Senate we require \na supermajority to do anything because 41 Senators--a minority--have \nthe right to veto anything the majority wants to bring up.\n  As I said, I will have more to say about this, but it seems to me \nthis stands democracy on its head and the idea of majority rule on its \nhead. I think the majority ought to have the right. Elections ought to \nhave consequences. If people vote for a certain party to be in power, \nthat party, regardless of what it is, ought to have the authority to \nact. There ought to be rights for the minority to amend, discuss, \ndebate, slow things down--fine. But the minority should not have the \nabsolute power of a veto, and that is what the minority has in the \nSenate today.\n  That is the issue Senator Merkley has been going after. At least if \nyou are going to have a filibuster, there ought to be some consequences \nto it, and the consequences are that you ought to have to be here and \ntalk and not hide behind quorum calls where we sit here for days on end \ndoing nothing because someone has objected to bringing up a bill but \nthey do not have to be here to discuss it.\n  I thank my two colleagues for their great leadership on this issue. \nAs I said, they brought a breath of fresh air here. The average person \nout there watching probably thinks: Bring it up for a vote. Things are \nnot quite that simple in the Senate, as we are about to find out. So we \nare going to do whatever we can to bring this to the forefront, but I \ndaresay that the way the rules are set up right now--requiring a \nsupermajority to change those rules--makes it nearly impossible for a \nmajority of the Senate to act.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues, Senators Merkley and Udall, for their \nleadership. I look forward to being in league with them to do whatever \nwe can to make this place function a little bit better and a little bit \nmore in accordance with the principles of democracy, of majority rule, \nand respecting the rights and wishes of the voters of this country.\n  I thank my colleague from Oregon for his leadership--I see he is \nstanding there--and I thank my colleague, Senator Udall, for yielding \nto me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I would certainly like to thank Senator Harkin for the \nmany years he has pursued reforming the rules of the Senate, especially \nfrom the perspective of being in the minority and then maintaining that \nsame effort in the majority. I believe it is important to recognize \nthat the issues we are presenting and bringing to the floor are to make \nthe Senate work better as a deliberative body for both the minority and \nmajority.\n  If we were to turn the clock back several decades, we would not be \nhere right now carrying on this colloquy. Instead, there would have \nbeen a unanimous consent to put a rule proposal on the floor of the \nSenate, and we would be debating that proposal. That is the way the \nSenate worked for most of its first two centuries.\n  In 1953, Senator Anderson put forward a resolution to adopt new rules \nat the start of Congress. There was a debate on it. Then, eventually, \nit was tabled. It was tabled by 51. That is what the rule said--51 \ncould table, they could set it aside. He did not win his debate, but he \ngot it on the floor of the Senate, and it was debated.\n  The same thing in 1957, and in 1959, he again did this.\n  In 1961, he did this again, and in that case it was debated on the \nfloor of the Senate. Everyone said: Let's get the rule out there, let's \nhold a debate. Eventually, they referred it to the Rules Committee. \nFinally, near the end of the cycle, it was moved out of the Rules \nCommittee, back to the floor, and they held another debate on Senator \nAnderson's proposal. The result of that debate was that it was tabled, \nthe resolution was tabled. It did not pass. To have the debate is not \ngoing to guarantee you are going to win the debate but it is to engage \nin the deliberation, the exchange of ideas that enables us to capture \nthe challenges we see, the challenges in our country and in this case \nthe challenges with making the Senate function and making things work \nbetter.\n  This goes on. Here we have five times in the course of 12 years that \na rule proposal was put on the floor and was debated. It was defeated, \nbut it was put\n\n[[Page S95]]\n\non the floor under the framework that 51 Members could adopt rules \nunder the Constitution, the constitutional power you have been speaking \nto so eloquently for Congress to organize itself--for the House of \nRepresentatives to organize itself and for the Senate to organize \nitself.\n  I wanted to go over a little bit of that history to say the very fact \nthat we are not at this moment debating a rule proposal is a reflection \nof the dysfunction of the Senate. A debate on the rule to fix the \nSenate itself reflects the dysfunction of the Senate.\n  I want to thank you for having engaged in so many years of effort to \nbring these issues forward. The challenge of fixing the Senate has been \nengaged in by so many names that I was familiar with growing up, folks \nsuch as Senator McGovern, Senator Mondale, Senator Church, Senator \nPearson. They all brought their effort to make this body work better. \nWe did have a major reform in 1975.\n  But as a chart I put up earlier showed, the congestion and the \nparalysis from the abuse of the privilege of having yourself heard, \nmaking yourself heard before your colleagues, has now compromised the \nability for us to fulfill our constitutional responsibilities and we \nneed to fight hard to try to fix the broken Senate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question on \nthat point?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I would be delighted to do so.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is a student of the Constitution. We have all \nlooked at it. We know what it says. I mentioned earlier about the fact \nthat when we come in here, we take an oath of office to uphold and \ndefend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, to \nbear true faith and allegiance to the same. That is our oath of office, \nto bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution.\n  Is it the Senator's view that perhaps the way the Senate is \nconstructed right now may in some way--I just throw this out--take away \nmy constitutional right to adequately represent my constituents? If it \ntakes a supermajority or if we cannot even change the rules, as the \nSenator has pointed out, does not this kind of take away some of the \nconstitutional rights and obligations, obligations of a Senator, I ask \nthe Senator?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Well, certainly I will tell you that Senator Byrd stood \non this floor and said the Senate cannot be bound by the dead hand of \nthe past. You can imagine that any particularly bizarre rule that might \nhave been passed by our predecessors that damaged our ability to \nfulfill our constitutional responsibilities would be inappropriate, and \nwe would need to change it. The Constitution empowers us to change it \nwith a simple majority.\n  So when the point comes that the Senate is not functioning in the \nfashion it was constitutionally intended to function--that is, a simple \nmajority to pass legislation--then we certainly have to wrestle with \nwhether we are doing our responsibility if we do not fight to make the \nSenate work better. We have an obligation to this Chamber, and we have \nan obligation to our responsibilities under the Constitution.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his response on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I know the Presiding Officer \nhas also been a part of this rules reform effort. We very much \nappreciate that.\n  It was mentioned here about Senator Byrd. I think one of the most \ninteresting stories about Senator Byrd, I say to Senator Harkin and \nSenator Merkley, in 1979 when he came to the floor, he was talking \nabout--and we have used this quote many times--the dead hand of the \npast, not being ruled by the dead hand of the past.\n  What was he talking about? He was talking about the idea that one \nSenate could establish a set of rules and bind future Senates. He gave \na passionate speech. We are in the situation that he talked about right \nnow. He said, now we are at the beginning of Congress. This Congress is \nnot obliged to be bound by the dead hand of the past.\n  Take rule XXXII, which is a different numbered rule today. But, for \nexample, the second paragraph thereof says that: The rules of this \nSenate shall continue from Congress to Congress until changed in \naccordance with these rules.\n  That rule was written in 1959, by the 86th Congress. The 96th \nCongress is not bound by the dead hand of the 86th Congress. The first \nSenate--now he talks a little bit about history here, which is very \nimportant. The first Senate, which met in 1789, approved 19 rules by a \nmajority vote. First Senate.\n  Those rules have been changed from time to time, and that portion of \nthe Senate rule XXXII I quoted was instituted in 1959. The members of \nthe Senate who met in 1789 and approved that first body of rules did \nnot for one moment think or believe or pretend that all succeeding \nSenates would be bound by that Senate. The Senate of the 86th Congress \ncould not pretend to believe that all future Senates would be bound by \nthe rules it had written. It would be just as reasonable to say that \none Congress can pass a law providing that all future laws have to be \npassed by a two-thirds vote.\n  Any member of this body knows that the next--any member of the body \nknows that the next Congress would not heed that law and would proceed \nto change it and would vote to repeal it by a majority vote, no doubt \nabout it.\n  So he says: I am not going to argue the case any further today except \nto say that it is my belief, which has been supported by rulings of \nthree Vice Presidents of both parties and by votes of the Senate, in \nessence upholding this power and the right of a majority of the Senate \nto change the rules of the Senate at the beginning of a new Congress.\n  That is the essence of where we are right today--that we are able, if \nwe have a majority, to move forward with adopting our rules that are \ngoing to function for this session of Congress. That is why we are in \nsuch a battle here to try to get those proposals onto the floor. We \nwant to get S. Res. 10. We want to get the talking filibuster proposal. \nWe want to get those put onto the floor so we can have debate, we can \nhave votes. And our understanding is there is going to be objection \nfrom the other side.\n  As Senator Harkin said earlier, we function here by unanimous \nconsent, and they apparently are not going to give us that consent. I \nknow that Senator Harkin--changing the subject a little bit here--but \nboth Senators Harkin and Merkley mentioned earlier the whole issue of \nwhy we want the Senate to function better, that we have pressing \nnational problems and challenges.\n  I think one of the Senators who said it best made a comment back in \n1971. This is Senator Hart, Senator Phil Hart of Michigan. It still \nresonates decades later.\n\n       The apparent inability of the Senate to take action on our \n     domestic ills, when the needs are so painfully clear, is a \n     basic cause of unrest and disaffection among the citizenry. \n     The imperative of change is obligatory if institutions such \n     as the Senate are to have the capacity to respond well to the \n     complex array of overlapping domestic and international \n     issues.\n\n  Long ago Thomas Jefferson said: As new discoveries are made and new \ntruths discovered and manner and opinions change with the change of \ncircumstances, institutions must advance also and keep pace with the \ntimes. Institutions must advance also and keep pace with the times.\n  That is why we are here. We have rules that were adopted long ago \nthat are not working today. You and I have talked several times about, \nif you want your government to spend money wisely, you want it to be \nefficient, why do we not give them a budget until half way through the \nfiscal year? It makes absolutely no sense.\n  That is the situation we are in right now. We hold hearings, we bring \nthe agency in, we think we are going to have an appropriations bill on \nthe floor--by the way, this year we did not have--but last year we did \nnot have a single appropriations bill on the floor. So they think they \nare going to get one budget. Then when we pass the fiscal year, last \nOctober 1, we start the fiscal year, we start into it, we have done a \ncouple of continuing resolutions. A continuing resolution just gives \nthem month-by-month funding. The next continuing resolution does not \nexpire until March. So who would tell any agency, nonprofit government \nagency, that we are going to give you a budget but we are not going to \nquite tell you what it is, and maybe go month to\n\n[[Page S96]]\n\nmonth, and then about halfway through the year we are going to give you \nthe rest of the budget.\n\n  That is not the way to take care of the people's money. It is not the \nway to be efficient. It is not the way to make sure the people's money \nis very well spent. I think it is important that we do that work, the \nwork of appropriations bills.\n  Of the Senators who are on the floor right now, Senator Harkin is an \nappropriator. When you bring an appropriations bill to the floor and \nhave all 100 Senators take a look at the appropriations bill, take a \nlook at what is working in that department and what is not, and how we \nmove down the road with that particular set of policy initiatives and \nprograms, that is something the agency pays tremendous attention to, \nthose amendments that are put in, the arguments that are made. And we \nare neglecting all of that now.\n  Last year we did not do a single appropriations bill. In my \nunderstanding, the House--and I know we were very frustrated when I was \nover in the House. We would say: Well, why are we even passing the \nappropriations bills? The Senate does not do them. We are going to end \nup, at the end of the year, doing one of these continuing resolutions \nor an omnibus bill.\n  For the first time in I do not know how long, last year the House \ngave up doing appropriations bills. So here, one of our core functions \nas a legislative body, what we all call the power of the purse, \ntremendously important, that power of the purse has been emasculated, \nit has been warped beyond recognition to the point where I think we are \ndysfunctional, the agencies are dysfunctional, and we have got to get \nit all back.\n  I know the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has outlined a number \nof times--and I find it appalling that we do not have the judicial \npeople in place to do the job for the country. Right now the Federal \ncourts are looking at fraud on Wall Street. They are looking at all \nsorts of major cases that have to do with financial reform and insider \ntrading and all of those kinds of things.\n  Guess what. If you do not have judges to hear those cases, then all \nof that justice is going to be delayed. There is an old saying in the \nlaw: Justice delayed is justice denied. Today we have 94 judicial \nvacancies. The Judicial Conference of the United States has weighed in \nwith the Senate and the House and said: These are judicial emergencies. \nOf 94 vacancies, 44 of them they consider emergencies. They need \nsomebody in there immediately. Yet, still, because of this constant \nfilibuster we are in--it is a filibuster without real debate--it wastes \na lot of time, it prevents our ability to put those judicial \nnominations on the floor and to get an up-or-down vote.\n  The same thing is true of the executive branch.\n  I know Senator Merkley saw the article in the Washington Post which \nwas at the end of the first year of the Obama Presidency. He only had \n55 percent of his team in place of the top people in the agencies to \nrun the government. And it is not all our fault. I think they were slow \nin sending some things up, but it is a pretty appalling number when you \nthink of the job of a President to put his people in place in the \nagencies so his policies can be carried out. What has happened is that \nhas been delayed and slowed down.\n  I harken back when I was a youngster here in Washington growing up. I \nwas about 12 years old when my father became Secretary of the Interior. \nHere you have only half of the people in place in the Federal \nGovernment. I remember my dad, as Secretary of the Interior, telling me \nwhen I would travel home: Tom, I have my whole team in place, virtually \nwhole team in place in 2 weeks.\n  So he had his top people. He was ready to carry out policy, ready to \nmove forward with the President's policies at the Department of \nInterior. I remember, we had holes, we had a variety of things going in \nthe Department of Interior.\n  We had a very talented woman from New Mexico who was going to become \nthe Solicitor, who had moved her young family to Washington. They had a \n3-month hold on her nomination. Nobody could ever figure out why. But \nshe was finally allowed to become the Solicitor of the Interior \nDepartment.\n  With all of these kinds of things, from holds to the constant \nfilibuster without any real debate, have slowed down the government in \na significant way and prevented us from doing the important oversight \njob we need to do.\n  I know the Senator from Oregon has other comments he would like to \nmake.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, it is quite a contrast that the Senator \nis drawing between an era in which in a 2-week period the bulk of the \nteam was in place, ready to do the work they were elected by the people \nto do--the executive branch, headed by the President, had his \nSecretaries, and the Secretaries had their teams in place, and they \nwere ready to go forward to make sure they were working hard on the \nagenda they had laid out during the election cycle.\n  As my colleague said, elections have consequences. The vision of our \nRepublic is one in which we elect a President, and the President says: \nHere is my agenda. Then he puts together a team to get it done. It is \nnot in the spirit of our Constitution, it is certainly not in the \nspirit of our democratic souls, after the people have elected a \nPresident, to try to damage and inflict pain and obstruction upon that \nPresident. That is essentially saying one does not accept the judgment \nof U.S. citizens about electing the President.\n  This process has to change. We have to find a way that folks can be \nbrought to the floor. It is not that this Chamber will approve every \nsingle nomination. It is that it will hold a debate and have a vote. If \nthere is no controversy surrounding someone, then that will probably be \nreduced to a unanimous consent request. Some will be waived through to \nnot take up the time on the floor of the Chamber.\n  There is more than 1,000 executive branch positions that have to be \nconfirmed under statute. That, too, should be changed. There is far too \nmany positions that are basically set up so that they have to come to \nthis Chamber. That is certainly a subject of conversation. But for \nthose that under the law need to come for advice and consent, then we \nneed to exercise that responsibility in a manner that is consistent \nwith advise and consent but not with attempting to damage the President \nand his team.\n  I was looking at a speech by one of my colleagues from Tennessee, Mr. \nAlexander. He titles it, ``The Filibuster, Democracy's Finest Show, the \nRight to Talk Your Head Off.'' That quote at the top of his paper is \nfrom a speech before the Heritage Foundation and is taken directly from \nthe film ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' In other words, the premise \nthat my colleague put in his paper is that there needs to be the right \nof the people elected by the citizens to have their voices heard on the \nfloor of the Senate. That is what the talking filibuster is about. It \nis about the people being able to see their Senators, when they are \nsaying there needs to be additional debate, to actually debate.\n  There is a tremendous amount of bipartisan support for this notion \nthat Senators should not hide from the American people, that they \nshould not be engaging in secret holds, but instead, if they are going \nto place a hold on a piece of legislation, to do it publicly and have \naccountability. There is tremendous support for the notion that when we \nproceed to vote that we want additional debate, we are actually going \nto debate so we utilize the time of the Senate to weigh the pros and \ncons, to hear all colleagues. Not that folks say: We want additional \ndebate and then go off to dinner. Not that Senators say: We want \nadditional debate and then go off on vacation.\n  If they ask for additional debate, then we should have additional \ndebate, laying out the pros and cons, arguing the merits, considering \namendments--in short, the talking filibuster.\n  I have a unanimous consent request that I gave notice of half an hour \nago. We are standing by waiting for one of our colleagues from the \nother side to come, extending the courtesy for them to come and object \nto this request. I am saying this out loud and looking across the aisle \nand saying we have been waiting half an hour. I think it is time for \none of our colleagues who wishes to object to get here on the floor \nand, just as we have been talking about, make their case visibly in \nfront of the citizens of the United States as to why they wish to \nobject to having a\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\nfull debate on the talking filibuster. I know my colleague is waiting \nto offer a unanimous consent request to have resolution No. 10 \nconsidered before this Chamber. I think we have pretty well laid out \nthe reasons we think this debate is important. But we can't get to that \ndebate without putting forward a unanimous consent request and having \nit concurred in or blocked by objection.\n  I will see if my colleague from New Mexico wishes to make any more \ncomments. If not, I will offer my unanimous consent request and await \nour colleagues to come and either endorse or object.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I am also waiting. Senator \nMerkley is waiting to put in his unanimous consent request on the \ntalking filibuster proposal which goes to the heart of the problem we \nhave today. One of the things I have learned the last 2 years in the \nSenate is that when 41 Senators vote for more debate, that is basically \nwhat is happening. When Senators vote for more debate, 41 of them, then \nwe don't get more debate. A lot of times we are in quorum calls. A lot \nof times if we have a live quorum, we pull 51 Senators over to the \nfloor to try to get through that, there are a series of dilatory \nmotions, and it is very difficult in the modern Senate to keep 51 \nSenators here surrounding the floor. In the old days, they used to pull \nout cots and stay through the night so that Senators would be able to \nsleep someplace to keep that live quorum going. But in the modern \nSenate, with everything going on, it is a tremendously unfair advantage \nfor one side to have one Senator and the other side have to have 51 in \norder to try to conduct any business. That is the situation we are in \ntoday. That is what the talking filibuster goes to. It goes to dealing \nwith that situation.\n  How does it deal with it? If 41 Senators request more debate, if they \nsay to the other 59 Senators they want more debate, we very simply say, \njust as Senator Alexander said, quoting Jimmy Stewart in ``The Right to \nTalk Your Head Off'' from ``Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,'' then come \ndown and debate. We are going to have a debate period where nothing \nelse is brought up but debate. The job of the Chair, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, will be in that period to ask the question: Are there \nany other Senators on the floor who wish to debate?\n  At that particular point, the American people could look down and be \nable to make an observation: Is this debate educating the public? Is it \nmoving things forward, or is it just a filibuster to waste time?\n  One of the old-time Senators from California made a comment about the \nfilibuster wasting time. This is from Senate Republican whip Tom Kuchel \nof California. He asked the question on the floor: What is a \nfilibuster? My definition would be that it is irrelevant speech making \nin the Senate designed solely and simply to consume time and thus to \nprevent a vote from being taken on pending legislation.\n  He is pretty condemning of that kind of filibuster. But that is a \njudgment. We don't want to take people's right to debate away. We just \nwant to make sure there is an honest, fair debate on the floor. That is \nwhat I compliment Senator Merkley on. He has drafted a proposal, worked \nlong and hard on it. What it ends up doing is, at the end of the \ndebate, when 41 Senators call for debate, we go into a period of \nextended debate. They talk and they talk. At some point, when the Chair \nasks: Are any other Senators on the floor who wish to debate, and there \nis silence, they are then rolled over into what is called postcloture \n30 hours.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. So if I might explain, if there is something critical to \nmy State, the talking filibuster enables me to find a couple of other \nSenators who share my views. Perhaps they have similar issues in their \nStates.\n  For example, the citizens of Oregon don't want oil companies drilling \noff our coast. We have a tremendous business in salmon, in ground fish, \nrock fish. We have a river economy that depends on the migration of \nsalmon upstream. We have a crab industry. We have a tourist industry, \nthe most spectacular coastline anywhere in the world, the coast of \nOregon. The last thing we want is an accident that puts oil all over \nour beaches and destroys multiple aspects of our economy.\n  So if there was a bill on the floor that said we are going to drill \nfor oil off the coast of Oregon, and if I believed that was a huge \nmistake, then I could organize with other Senators and be here day and \nnight to block that misguided legislation. In that sense we are not \nchanging the number. It still takes 60 Members to close debate.\n  We protect the voice of the minority. We say two Members could \ncontinue a debate day and night. For that matter, one could, but \neventually one is going to collapse on the floor like Jimmy Stewart \ndid. This is important to note because the talking filibuster is about \ntaking away frivolous obstructions that paralyze the Senate and prevent \nit from doing its responsibilities on advise and consent and \nconsidering regular bills from the House and certainly to be able to \nget the appropriations bills done, to get the authorization bills done, \nand so on and so forth.\n  There may be those who say we oppose the talking filibuster because \nit takes away the power of the minority to block legislation. Actually, \nthe talking filibuster doesn't do anything of the kind. It just says \nthat when you block legislation, you have to do it in front of the \nAmerican people. You have to stand on the floor and make your case.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, that is the essence of it. \nWhat we have now is Senators leaving. We actually had the case where a \nSenator wanted the cloture vote to take place but then left and went \nhome. That is a pretty disgraceful situation. I have heard that our \ngood friend, Senator Alexander, is going to join us in a little bit. I \nknow the Senator from Oregon was quoting from a speech he recently gave \nat the Heritage Foundation on January 4, 2011.\n  One of the things Senator Alexander said in there that I think we, \nall three of us, have echoed--Senator Harkin, Senator Merkley, and \nmyself--is:\n\n       Now there is no doubt the Senate has been reduced to a \n     shadow of itself as the world's greatest deliberative body, a \n     place which, as Sen. Arlen Specter said in his farewell \n     address, has been distinctive because of ``the ability of any \n     Senator to offer virtually any amendment at any time.\n\n  I say to Senator Harkin, I know he has spoken passionately about the \nidea of offering amendments, how our democracy has deteriorated in the \nSenate because it takes now 60 votes--every amendment. I say to the \nSenator, it did not always used to be like that, did it? I would ask \nthe Senator, did it? The Senator has been here a while. What was the \nSenate like 10, 15 years ago? Could you get an amendment through with a \nmajority vote?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, if my friend will yield for a response.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Of course.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, literally up until 4 or 5 years ago you could offer \nan amendment on the floor, and if you got 51 votes, you won. That \nhappened for--well, I have been here, what, 25, 26 years I guess now, \nand that is the way it has always been. Sometimes there were tough \namendments. Sometimes there were tough amendments by Democrats; \nsometimes there were tough amendments by Republicans. It did not make \nany difference who was in the majority or the minority.\n  I do not think people elected us just to have an easy time of it here \nand not to ever cast tough votes. Sometimes these are tough votes. But \nI think the Senator from New Mexico is right. We always operated under \nthe fact that a Senator could offer an amendment. Usually you would \nenter a time agreement. You would say: How much time do you want? Well, \nyou would have an hour or an hour and a half or 2 hours, something like \nthat. You would have a reasonable time agreement, and you would have \ndebate and then a vote. Sometimes people would move to table it, and \nthat was fine, but at least 51 votes decided that.\n  Now, as the Senator pointed out, you have to have 60 votes for any \namendment, a supermajority. For any single amendment you want to bring \nup on the Senate floor, you now have to have 60 votes. I say to my \nfriend, it was not always like that.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I say to Senator Harkin, one of the things \nthat happened to us right at the end of the Congress was when we had a \nvote on a piece of legislation called the DREAM Act. I believe the \nmajority had 55 votes for the DREAM Act.\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Here is a piece of legislation where we were \ntalking about inmigrant children--through no fault of their own; they \nwere probably brought in as tiny babies--who have grown up in the \nUnited States and have reached the age of adulthood and they have a \nceiling on them. They cannot go to college. They do not have Social \nSecurity numbers. So we were basically trying to give them a dream they \ncould go out and be Americans. They could join the military, and after \nthey did their military service get in line for citizenship. They could \ngo to college, and if they did well, get in line for citizenship.\n  In any other country, if you had the two legislative bodies--the \nHouse passed it by a majority; we passed it by a big majority, 55 \nvotes--you would have a law. The President would be signing it, and it \nwould be law today.\n  That is what has happened to this filibuster rule. A lot of the steps \nwe are taking do not necessarily get right to the heart of that, but I \nthink the people understand that part of it. When I have gone home, \npeople say: What happened? What is going on? Fifty-five Senators voted \nfor the DREAM Act and it did not become law.\n  Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, the Senator is absolutely \nright. I will give another example. As the Senator knows, the Supreme \nCourt decided a case last year that allows certain entities to \ncontribute money to political campaigns, and they do not even have to \ndisclose who they are or how much they give. It is a Supreme Court \ndecision.\n  Well, the House passed a bill, and public opinion polls show that 80 \npercent of the American people were in favor of what we called the \nDISCLOSE Act. We did not say they could not give the money. We just \nsaid they ought to file: Who are you, and how much money are you \ngiving, and where are you getting that money from?\n  It passed the House. It came to the Senate. I believe we had 57 votes \nfor that, if I am not mistaken. I could be corrected, but I think it \nwas over 55 votes for that. But it did not pass.\n  The average American out there would say: Wait a minute. I thought if \nyou got 51 votes, you won. No, no, no. Again, we had to have 60 votes \nin order to pass the DISCLOSE Act. The President would have signed it \ninto law. The House passed it. Eighty percent of the American people \nwere for it. But because there was this 60-vote threshold, we did not \nget it passed.\n  I see the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Well, I say to Senator Harkin, I think that is a \ntremendous example. I believe we actually had 59 votes twice----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I stand corrected.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I believe, one vote short needed to close debate on the \nmotion to proceed to get to the DISCLOSE Act. So we could not even get \nonto the bill.\n  So here is a Supreme Court decision that allows unlimited--\nunlimited--secret foreign donations. I will tell you, as a red-blooded \nAmerican, the idea of foreign companies secretly influencing American \nelections is outrageous, and we should have had a debate on that bill. \nBut, instead, we had 41 Senators who said they wanted further debate, \nand then they were not willing to stand up on the floor to make their \ncase before the American people. And why did they want to hide from the \nAmerican people? Because the American people do not support secret \nforeign donations influencing American elections. That is why.\n  Under the talking filibuster, folks could not have filed an objection \nand left this Chamber and hid. They would have had to make their case, \nand the American people could have weighed in and said: You are a hero \nor you are a bum. In this case certainly most Americans, I believe, \nwould have weighed in and said: Get to that bill. Get to a debate on it \nand get it done because it is the American tradition for Americans to \nmake their decisions about who they elect, not foreign corporations to \nsecretly spend money on American campaigns.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. The Senator pointed out correctly--I \nwas mistaken; I thought it was 57--it was 59 votes. You would think \nnormally that bill would pass and it would go to the President for his \nsignature. It was supported overwhelmingly by the American people, yet \nthwarted because we have the right--as I said earlier, the minority in \nthe Senate has a right of veto. They can veto whatever they want to \nbring up. What sense does that make in a democracy?\n  I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank the Senator.\n  We see our good friend, Senator Alexander from Tennessee, has \narrived, and we very much appreciate that.\n  I say to Senator Alexander, one of the things we have been \ndiscussing--and Senator Merkley had a chart and had the history of what \nhad happened as far as rules debates. There have been a lot of rules \ndebates--in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and always--always--the two \nleaders would allow a rules proposal to be on the Senate floor and be \ndebated and be disposed of.\n  We now have a situation today where we cannot get our rules proposals \nonto the floor. Senator Merkley is here with a talking filibuster \nproposal. I say to the Senator, I believe he has been talking with you. \nI say to Senator Alexander, you have been very open with us in saying: \nLet's have discussions. And your theme has really been, like you say in \nyour speech at the Heritage Foundation:\n\n       [T]he Senate needs to change its behavior, not to change \n     its rules.\n\n  That has been the Senator's function. But the Senator is also working \non rules changes with Senator Schumer, and we very much appreciate \nthat.\n  But I know Senator Harkin has a proposal. Senator Merkley has a \nproposal. I have S. Res. 10. I say to the Senator, he was here on the \nfirst day of the Senate session on January 5 when we put in, with my \ntwo friends, S. Res. 10. We are just trying to get it to the floor, and \nthat is what I am going to ask right now, with my unanimous consent \nrequest. We very much appreciate the Senator being here.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 10, a resolution to improve the \ndebate and consideration of legislative matters and nominations in the \nSenate; that there be 6 hours for debate equally divided and controlled \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, with no amendments in \norder; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote on adoption of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want \nto congratulate the Senator from New Mexico. He has been persistent and \ndiligent and enormously well intentioned in this effort throughout the \nRules Committee hearings and throughout the floor debate in seeking a \nway to help make the Senate function better, at the same time \npreserving the Senate as a forum for deliberation and protection of \nminority rights.\n  We have a difference of opinion about whether that is best done by \nallowing changes of rules by 51 votes or by 67, which is the way the \nSenate rules currently prescribe. His proposal to change the rules \ncertainly can be considered on the Senate floor in the regular order, \nand we would be happy to work with him to do that as long as it was by \n67 votes.\n  So because of that difference of opinion, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S98-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S98-S99]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S.

RES. 21\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, it has been the tradition of this \nChamber, when there are rules proposals, to put them on the floor for \ndebate and to hold that debate. Then if the body does not like that, \neither to defeat them outright or to table them or refer them to \ncommittee for further work.\n  Indeed, under the Constitution, it is in order for us to have a \ndebate now as a simple majority to amend our rules. The Constitution \ncalls for a supermajority for impeachments, a supermajority for \ntreaties, but it calls for a simple majority to amend our rules and to \norganize ourselves.\n  Many Members of this body often talk about the Constitution, and it \nis the Constitution we are talking about right now when it calls for a \nsimple majority to be able to organize.\n  So that is why, in 1953, the Senate debated Senator Anderson's \nresolution, eventually defeating it by tabling it. That is why, in 1957 \nand in 1959, they proceeded to put it on the floor--both sides agreeing \nthat it was appropriate under the Constitution to have the debate in \nthis Chamber--and then to either approve or to vote down or to table or \nto refer to committee. Then, in 1961, Anderson's rule proposal to make \ncloture three-fifths present and voting was referred to committee. So \nit was defeated again, but it was debated and referred to committee. \nThen the committee returned it to the floor for further debate. No one \nobjected to us holding a debate.\n  In fact, here is the irony. We are talking about fixing the broken \nSenate because debate is unable to take place, and this very \nconversation we are having right now, with proposals to be put on the \nfloor, is being objected to by the other side because they are saying \nit is not appropriate. But the Constitution says it is appropriate. The \ntradition of the Senate says it is appropriate.\n  So I too have a resolution to put on the floor, a proposal for \ndebate. It is the talking filibuster proposal. It is important that \nSenators not be able to object to the regular order of 51 and then go \nhome or go on vacation and hide from the American people, but that if \nthey believe there should be additional debate, they come to this floor \nand debate. The people of America believe that is what the filibuster \nis about: making your case before the American people. Let's make it \nso.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 21, a resolution to amend rule XIX \nand rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate to enact the talking \nfilibuster; that there be 6 hours for debate equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees, with no \namendments in order; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, \nthe Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nSenator from Oregon is a former speaker of the house in Oregon, and he \nhas been a long observer of the Senate, having come here first working \nfor Senator Hatfield, and he has been effective and passionate in his \nviews.\n  Today, I was reviewing some remarks made by largely Democratic \nSenators, from 4 or 5 years ago, when some Republicans got the idea \nthat it might be a good idea to make this a more majoritarian body, and \nSenator Schumer, Senator Reid, Senator Clinton, and Senator Obama all \nsaid it would be a mistake.\n  So although I greatly respect the Senator from Oregon, we have a \ndifference of opinion about whether it is in the best interest of the \nSenate and of the country to change the rules in this way, so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for \ncoming to the floor. I applaud his long service.\n  When I first came to the Senate, Senator Hatfield asked me to bring \ngreetings to his former colleagues, and I had the chance to sit down \nwith Senator Alexander to convey those greetings and to work with him \non some projects, including the advocacy for electric vehicles. It is \ngood for the American economy, good for the strategic positioning of \nAmerica in terms of our consumption of energy, and certainly good for \nthe environment.\n  I wish to note that while we disagree on this, this is actually the \nway it should happen. We should come to the floor and share our \nrespective views, disagree with each other, make our points. I believe, \nat this moment, we should be on a rule. We should be debating it. My \ncolleague has expressed his difference of opinion in a very gracious \nand respectful manner, and that, too, should be a factor of Senate \ndialog, so I thank the Senator.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Congressional Accountability Act \nrequires this notice be printed in the Congressional Record; therefore \nI ask unanimous consent that the notice be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Office of Compliance Text of Regulations for the Veterans Employment \n                       Opportunities Act of 1998\n\n       When approved by the House of Representatives for the House \n     of Representatives, these regulations will have the prefix \n     ``H.''

PURPOSE AND SCOPE.\n\n       (a) Section 4(c) of the VEOA. The Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act (VEOA) applies the rights and protections \n     of sections 2108, 3309 through 3312, and subchapter I of \n     chapter 35 of title 5 U.S.C., to certain covered employees \n     within the Legislative branch.\n       (b) Purpose of regulations. The regulations set forth \n     herein are the substantive regulations that the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance has promulgated \n     pursuant to section 4(c)(4) of the VEOA, in accordance with \n     the rulemaking procedure set forth in section 304 of the CAA \n     (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384). The purpose of subparts B, C and D of \n     these regulations is to define veterans' preference and the \n     administration of veterans' preference as applicable to \n     Federal employment in the Legislative branch. (5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2108, as applied by the VEOA). The purpose of subpart E \n     of these regulations is to ensure that the principles of the \n     veterans' preference laws are integrated into the existing \n     employment and retention policies and processes of those \n     employing offices with employees covered by the VEOA, and to \n     provide for transparency in the application of veterans' \n     preference in covered appointment and retention decisions. \n     Provided, nothing in these regulations shall be construed so \n     as to require an employing office to reduce any existing \n     veterans' preference rights and protections that it may \n     afford to preference eligible individuals.\n       H Regs: (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch. The term ``covered employee'' excludes any employee: \n     (1) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate; (2) whose appointment is \n     made by a Member of Congress within an employing office, as \n     defined by Sec. 101 (9)(A-C) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1301 \n     (9)(A-C) or; (3) whose appointment is made by a committee or \n     subcommittee of either House of Congress or a joint committee \n     of the House of Representatives and the Senate; or (4) who is \n     appointed to a position, the duties of which are equivalent \n     to those of a Senior Executive Service position (within the \n     meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of title 5, United States \n     Code). Accordingly, these regulations shall not apply to any \n     employing office that only employs individuals excluded from \n     the definition of covered employee.\n       S Regs: (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch. The term ``covered employee'' excludes any employee: \n     (1) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate; (2) whose appointment is \n     made or directed by a Member of Congress within an employing \n     office, as defined by Sec. 101(9)(A-C) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1301 (9)(A-C) or; (3) whose appointment is made by a \n     committee or subcommittee of either House of Congress or a \n     joint committee of the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate; (4) who is appointed pursuant to section 105(a) of \n     the Second Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1978; or (5) who \n     is appointed to a position, the duties of which are \n     equivalent to those of a Senior Executive Service position \n     (within the meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of title 5, United \n     States Code). Accordingly, these regulations shall not apply \n     to any employing office that only employs individuals \n     excluded from the definition of covered employee.\n       C Regs: (c) Scope of Regulations. The definition of \n     ``covered employee'' in Section 4(c) of the VEOA limits the \n     scope of the statute's applicability within the Legislative \n     branch. The term ``covered employee'' excludes any employee: \n     (1) whose appointment is made by the President with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate; (2) whose appointment is \n     made by a Member of Congress or by a committee or \n     subcommittee of either House of Congress or a joint committee \n     of the House of Representatives and the Senate; or (3) who is \n     appointed to a position, the duties of which are equivalent \n     to those of a Senior Executive Service position (within the \n     meaning of section 3132(a)(2) of title 5, United States \n     Code). Accordingly, these regulations shall not apply to any \n     employing office that only employs individuals excluded from \n     the definition of covered employee.\n\n     SEC. 1.102.

ADOPTION OF REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Adoption of regulations. Section 4(c)(4)(A) of the VEOA \n     generally authorizes the Board to issue regulations to \n     implement section 4(c). In addition, section 4(c)(4)(B) of \n     the VEOA directs the Board to promulgate regulations that are \n     ``the same as the most relevant substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the Executive branch) \n     promulgated to implement the statutory provisions referred \n     to in paragraph (2)'' of section 4(c) of the VEOA. Those \n     statutory provisions are section 2108, sections 3309 \n     through 3312, and subchapter I of chapter 35, of title 5, \n     United States Code. The regulations issued by the Board \n     herein are on all matters for which section 4(c)(4)(B) of \n     the VEOA requires a regulation to be issued. Specifically, \n     it is the Board's considered judgment based on the \n     information available to it at the time of promulgation of \n     these regulations, that, with the exception of the \n     regulations adopted and set forth herein, there are no \n     other ``substantive regulations (applicable with respect \n     to the Executive branch) promulgated to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in paragraph (2)'' of \n     section 4(c) of the VEOA that need be adopted.\n       (b) Modification of substantive regulations. As a \n     qualification to the statutory obligation to issue \n     regulations that are ``the same as the most substantive \n     regulations (applicable with respect to the Executive \n     branch)'', section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEOA authorizes the \n     Board to ``determine, for good cause shown and stated \n     together with the regulation, that a modification of such \n     regulations would be more effective for the implementation of \n     the rights and protections under'' section 4(c) of the VEOA.\n       (c) Rationale for Departure from the Most Relevant \n     Executive Branch Regulations. The Board concludes that it \n     must promulgate regulations accommodating the human resource \n     systems existing in the Legislative branch; and that such \n     regulations must take into account the fact that the Board \n     does not possess the statutory and Executive Order based \n     government-wide policy making authority underlying OPM's \n     counterpart VEOA regulations governing the Executive branch. \n     OPM's regulations are designed for the competitive service \n     (defined in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2102(a)(2)), which does not exist \n     in the employing offices subject to this regulation. \n     Therefore, to follow the OPM regulations would create \n     detailed and complex rules and procedures for a workforce \n     that does not exist in the Legislative branch, while \n     providing no VEOA protections to the covered Legislative \n     branch employees. We have chosen to propose specially \n     tailored regulations, rather than simply to adopt those \n     promulgated by OPM, so that we may effectuate Congress' \n     intent in extending the principles of the veterans' \n     preference laws to the Legislative branch through the VEOA.\n\n     SEC. 1.104. COORDINATION WITH SECTION 225 OF THE \n                   CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.\n\n       Statutory directive. Section 4(c)(4)(C) of the VEOA \n     requires that promulgated regulations must be consistent with \n     section 225 of the CAA. Among the relevant provisions of \n     section 225 are subsection (f)(1), which prescribes as a rule \n     of construction that definitions and exemptions in the laws \n     made applicable by the CAA shall apply under the CAA, and \n     subsection (f)(3), which states that the CAA shall not be \n     considered to authorize enforcement of the CAA by the \n     Executive branch.\n\n          Subpart B--Veterans' Preference--General Provisions\n\nSec.\n1.105 Responsibility for administration of veterans' preference.\n1.106 Procedures for bringing claims under the VEOA.\n\n     SEC. 1.105.

For the purpose of applying \n     veterans' preference in reductions in force, except with \n     respect to the application of section 1.114 of these \n     regulations regarding the waiver of physical requirements, \n     the following shall apply:\n       (1) ``active service'' has the meaning given it by section \n     101 of title 37;\n       (2) ``a retired member of a uniformed service'' means a \n     member or former member of a uniformed service who is \n     entitled, under statute, to retired, retirement, or retainer \n     pay on account of his/her service as such a member; and\n       (3) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is considered a preference \n     eligible only if (A) his/her retirement was based on \n     disability--\n       (i) resulting from injury or disease received in line of \n     duty as a direct result of armed conflict; or\n       (ii) caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in \n     the line of duty during a period of war as defined by \n     sections 101 and 1101 of title 38;\n       (B) his/her service does not include twenty or more years \n     of full-time active service, regardless of when performed but \n     not including periods of active duty for training; or\n       (C) on November 30, 1964, he/she was employed in a position \n     to which this subchapter applies and thereafter he/she \n     continued to be so employed without a break in service of \n     more than 30 days.\n       The definition of ``preference eligible'' as set forth in 5 \n     U.S.C 2108 and section 1.102(p) of these regulations shall \n     apply to waivers of physical requirements in determining an \n     employee's qualifications for retention under section 1.114 \n     of these regulations.\n       H Regs:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis, or (3) attributable to \n     a change in party leadership or majority party status within \n     the House of Congress where the employee is employed.\n       C Regs:  (e) Reduction in force is any termination of a \n     covered employee's employment or the reduction in pay and/or \n     position grade of a covered employee for more than 30 days \n     and that may be required for budgetary or workload reasons, \n     changes resulting from reorganization, or the need to make \n     room for an employee with reemployment or restoration rights. \n     The term ``reduction in force'' does not encompass a \n     termination or other personnel action: (1) predicated upon \n     performance, conduct or other grounds attributable to an \n     employee, or (2) involving an employee who is employed by the \n     employing office on a temporary basis.\n       (f) Undue interruption is a degree of interruption that \n     would prevent the completion of required work by a covered \n     employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a \n     different position under this part. The 90-day standard \n     should be considered within the allowable limits of time and \n     quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, \n     deadlines, and other demands. However, work generally would \n     not be considered to be unduly interrupted if a covered \n     employee needs more than 90 days after the reduction in force \n     to perform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-\n     day standard may\n\n[[Page S103]]\n\n     be extended if placement is made under this part to a program \n     accorded low priority by the employing office, or to a vacant \n     position.\n\n     SEC. 1.112. APPLICATION OF PREFERENCE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       Prior to carrying out a reduction in force that will affect \n     covered employees, employing offices shall determine which, \n     if any, covered employees within a particular group of \n     competing covered employees are entitled to veterans' \n     preference eligibility status in accordance with these \n     regulations. In determining which covered employees will be \n     retained, employing offices will treat veterans' preference \n     as the controlling factor in retention decisions among such \n     competing covered employees, regardless of length of service \n     or performance, provided that the preference eligible \n     employee's performance has not been determined to be \n     unacceptable. Provided, a preference eligible employee who is \n     a ``disabled veteran'' under section 1.102(i) above who has a \n     compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or \n     more and whose performance has not been determined to be \n     unacceptable by an employing office is entitled to be \n     retained in preference to other preference eligible \n     employees. Provided, this section does not relieve an \n     employing office of any greater obligation it may be subject \n     to pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \n     Notification Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 2101 et seq.) as applied by \n     section 102(a)(9) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(a)(9).\n\n     SEC. 1.113. CREDITING EXPERIENCE IN REDUCTIONS IN FORCE.\n\n       In computing length of service in connection with a \n     reduction in force, the employing office shall provide credit \n     to preference eligible covered employees as follows:\n       (a) a preference eligible covered employee who is not a \n     retired member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit \n     for the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces;\n       (b) a preference eligible covered employee who is a retired \n     member of a uniformed service is entitled to credit for:\n       (1) the length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which \n     a campaign badge has been authorized; or\n       (2) the total length of time in active service in the armed \n     forces if he is included under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 3501(a)(3)(A), \n     (B), or (C); and\n       (c) a preference eligible covered employee is entitled to \n     credit for:\n       (1) service rendered as an employee of a county committee \n     established pursuant to section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation \n     and Allotment Act or of a committee or association of \n     producers described in section 10(b) of the Agricultural \n     Adjustment Act, reenacted with amendments by the Agriculture \n     Marketing Agreement Act of 1937; and\n       (2) service rendered as an employee described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c) if such employee moves or has moved, on or after \n     January 1, 1966, without a break in service of more than 3 \n     days, from a position in a nonappropriated fund \n     instrumentality of the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard to a position in the Department of Defense or the Coast \n     Guard, respectively, that is not described in 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2105(c).\n\n     SEC. 1.114. WAIVER OF PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS IN REDUCTIONS IN \n                   FORCE.\n\n       (a) If an employing office determines, on the basis of \n     evidence before it, that a covered employee is preference \n     eligible, the employing office shall waive, in determining \n     the covered employee's retention status in a reduction in \n     force:\n       (1) requirements as to age, height, and weight, unless the \n     requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of \n     the position; and\n       (2) physical requirements if, in the opinion of the \n     employing office, on the basis of evidence before it, \n     including any recommendation of an accredited physician \n     submitted by the employee, the preference eligible covered \n     employee is physically able to perform efficiently the duties \n     of the position.\n       (b) If an employing office determines that a covered \n     employee who is a preference eligible as a disabled veteran \n     as described in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2108(3)(c) and has a \n     compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or \n     more is not able to fulfill the physical requirements of the \n     covered position, the employing office shall notify the \n     preference eligible covered employee of the reasons for the \n     determination and of the right to respond and to submit \n     additional information to the employing office within 15 days \n     of the date of the notification. Should the preference \n     eligible covered employee make a timely response, the highest \n     ranking individual or group of individuals with authority to \n     make employment decisions on behalf of the employing office, \n     shall render a final determination of the physical ability of \nthe preference eligible covered employee to perform the duties of the \ncovered position, taking into account the evidence before it, including \nthe response and any additional information provided by the preference \neligible. When the employing office has completed its review of the \nproposed disqualification on the basis of physical disability, it shall \nsend its findings to the preference eligible covered employee.\n\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall relieve an employing \n     office of any obligation it may have pursuant to the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et \n     seq.) as applied by section 102(a)(3) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1302(a)(3).\n\n     SEC. 1.115. TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS.\n\n       (a) When a function is transferred from one employing \n     office to another employing office, each covered employee in \n     the affected position classifications or job classifications \n     in the function that is to be transferred shall be \n     transferred to the receiving employing office for employment \n     in a covered position for which he/she is qualified before \n     the receiving employing office may make an appointment from \n     another source to that position.\n       (b) When one employing office is replaced by another \n     employing office, each covered employee in the affected \n     position classifications or job classifications in the \n     employing office to be replaced shall be transferred to the \n     replacing employing office for employment in a covered \n     position for which he/she is qualified before the replacing \n     employing office may make an appointment from another source \n     to that position.\n\n Subpart E--Adoption of Veterans' preference policies, recordkeeping & \n                      informational requirements.\n\nSec.\n1.116  Adoption of veterans' preference policy.\n1.117  Preservation of records made or kept.\n1.118  Dissemination of veterans' preference policies to applicants for \n              covered positions.\n1.119  Information regarding veterans' preference determinations in \n              appointments.\n1.120  Dissemination of veterans' preference policies to covered \n              employees.\n1.121  Written notice prior to a reduction in force.\n\n     SEC. 1.116. ADOPTION OF VETERANS' PREFERENCE POLICY.\n\n       No later than 120 calendar days following Congressional \n     approval of this regulation, each employing office that \n     employs one or more covered employees or that seeks \n     applicants for a covered position shall adopt its written \n     policy specifying how it has integrated the veterans' \n     preference requirements of the Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act of 1998 and these regulations into its \n     employment and retention processes. Each such employing \n     office will make its policies available to applicants for \n     appointment to a covered position and to covered employees in \n     accordance with these regulations. The act of adopting a \n     veterans' preference policy shall not relieve any employing \n     office of any other responsibility or requirement of the \n     Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998 or these \n     regulations. An employing office may amend or replace its \n     veterans' preference policies as it deems necessary or \n     appropriate, so long as the resulting policies are consistent \n     with the VEOA and these regulations.\n\n     SEC. 1.117. PRESERVATION OF RECORDS MADE OR KEPT.\n\n       An employing office that employs one or more covered \n     employees or that seeks applicants for a covered position \n     shall maintain any records relating to the application of its \n     veterans' preference policy to applicants for covered \n     positions and to workforce adjustment decisions affecting \n     covered employees for a period of at least one year from the \n     date of the making of the record or the date of the personnel \n     action involved or, if later, one year from the date on which \n     the applicant or covered employee is notified of the \n     personnel action. Where a claim has been brought under \n     section 401 of the CAA against an employing office under the \n     VEOA, the respondent employing office shall preserve all \n     personnel records relevant to the claim until final \n     disposition of the claim. The term ``personnel records \n     relevant to the claim'', for example, would include records \n     relating to the veterans' preference determination regarding \n     the person bringing the claim and records relating to any \n     veterans' preference determinations regarding other \n     applicants for the covered position the person sought, or \n     records relating to the veterans' preference determinations \n     regarding other covered employees in the person's position or \n     job classification. The date of final disposition of the \n     charge or the action means the latest of the date of \n     expiration of the statutory period within which the aggrieved \n     person may file a complaint with the Office or in a U.S. \n     District Court or, where an action is brought against an \n     employing office by the aggrieved person, the date on which \n     such litigation is terminated.\n\n     SEC. 1.118. DISSEMINATION OF VETERANS' PREFERENCE POLICIES TO \n                   APPLICANTS FOR COVERED POSITIONS.\n\n       (a) An employing office shall state in any announcements \n     and advertisements it makes concerning vacancies in covered \n     positions that the staffing action is governed by the VEOA.\n       (b) An employing office shall invite applicants for a \n     covered position to identify themselves as veterans' \n     preference eligible applicants, provided that in doing so:\n       (1) the employing office shall state clearly on any written \n     application or questionnaire used for this purpose or make \n     clear orally, if a written application or questionnaire is \n     not used, that the requested information is intended for use \n     solely in connection with the employing office's obligations \nand efforts to provide veterans' preference to preference eligible \napplicants in accordance with the VEOA;\n\n       (2) the employing office shall state clearly that disabled \n     veteran status is requested on a voluntary basis, that it \n     will be kept confidential in accordance with the Americans\n\n[[Page S104]]\n\n     with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C.

Mr. President, on January 5, 2011, Senator Barbara \nMikulski of Maryland became the longest-serving female Senator in the \nhistory of our country. Breaking this record, which was set by an \nextraordinary woman in her own time Margaret Chase Smith of Maine--is \nonly one of many milestones Barbara Mikulski has reached during her \ntenure in elective office. Additional milestones are: first female \nDemocrat to serve in both Chambers of Congress; the first female \nDemocrat elected to the Senate without succeeding a husband or a \nfather; and the first female to chair one of the most sought-after \nAppropriations subcommittees. The history books will rightly mark these \nachievements for the benefit of generations to come.\n  In addition, Barbara Mikulski is known and will be remembered as a \nfierce fighter for the people of Maryland, an advocate for working \nfamilies, the small business owner, and seniors looking for help and \nsupport in their later years. Her advocacy for and in defense of \nFederal workers is legendary. They may be faceless bureaucrats to some, \nbut to Senator Mikulski they are her friends and neighbors. And they \nmost certainly have found a champion in Barbara Mikulski. Every day, \nshe brings that definitive fighting spirit to the Senate, championing \nthe causes she holds dear--women's health, extended access to higher \neducation, the concerns of our Nation's veterans and the advancement of \nour space program, to name just a few. She is renowned in the Halls of \nCongress for her toughness and tenacity, commanding the respect and \nappreciation of her constituents and people across the country.\n  Besides these milestones and significant legislative accomplishments, \nit is also important to note Senator Mikulski's unique willingness and \nenthusiasm for mentoring others. I have been the beneficiary of her \nspecial attention, guidance and sage advice, as have many of my peers. \nShe has helped us find our footing and navigate the peculiar ways of \nthe Senate. It is truly extraordinary--and one of her most admirable \nqualities--that someone of her stature, who wields so much influence, \nalways seems to be able to find the time to help and take interest in \nothers, women in particular. Senator Mikulski is a remarkable leader in \nthat way. She continues to serve as an inspiration to us all. I know \nshe will remain a pathfinder, a visionary and a courageous leader for \nthe people of Maryland and for our Nation. Another Barbara--Barbara \nColoroso, the international bestselling author on parenting and \nteaching--once observed that ``the beauty of empowering others is that \nyour own power is not diminished in the process.'' That truth holds \nspecial meaning for those of us fortunate enough to have been empowered \nthrough our association and friendship with the senior Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as we embark on a new year and a new \nCongress, I stand here today to congratulate my colleague, Barbara \nMikulski, on becoming the longest serving female Senator in our \nNation's history. Her work in these Halls has made our country \nstronger. And in a place where partisan rancor too often rules the day, \nshe has established a legacy of\n\n[[Page S105]]\n\nservice that stands as an example to us all.\n  Her political career began in the late 1960s when she launched a \ncampaign to stop the construction of a highway over historic \nneighborhoods in Baltimore. Once she won that battle, she decided to \nrun for the Baltimore City Council in 1971. Forty years later, and \nfollowing a successful stint in the U.S. House of Representatives, \nBarbara Mikulski continues to blaze an impressive trail. During her 26 \nyears in the Senate, she became the first woman to sit on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, the first Democratic woman elected to Senate \nleadership, and now has crossed yet another milestone, passing Senator \nMargaret Chase Smith of Maine as the longest serving female Senator.\n  It is not just the length of her service that we celebrate, it is its \nquality. No one is better at drilling down to the gist of an issue, and \nexpressing it in punchy unforgettable terms. No one cheers us more than \nwhen she tells us to ``stand tall, square our shoulders, put on our \nlipstick and rise to the occasion.'' No one better combines the \nidealism of politics with the proactive abilities of government. As she \ntold me once with a twinkle in her eye, ``I'm a reformer, and a bit of \na ward heeler too.'' More than anything, she never forgot her roots as \na champion for those who need one.\n  In her years in the Senate, Barbara Mikulski's dedication to her \nconstituents and women's rights has been clear: from becoming a \nchampion of women's health issues and abortion rights, to organizing \ntraining seminars for woman of both parties elected to the Senate, to \nsponsoring and pushing through the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of \n2009.\n  During my 4 years as a U.S. Senator, I have had the great privilege \nto work with her to pass landmark health care reform legislation out of \nthe HELP Committee. I also serve with her on the Intelligence \nCommittee, and worked closely with her on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee's Cyber Task Force to evaluate cyber threats and issue \nrecommendations to the full committee.\n  And, while Rhode Island and Maryland are hundreds of miles apart, \nBarbara and her staff are truly my neighbors here in the Senate. Her \noffice is next door to mine in the Hart Building. From a friendly hello \nto each other as we pass in the hall, to accompanying each other as we \nwalk to the Senate floor, to the delicious treats her wonderful \nreceptionist Mrs. O'Malley occasionally makes for our office, it has \ntruly been a pleasure to share our little corner of the Hart Building.\n  I know that all of us here in this Chamber are proud to call \n``Senator Barb'' our colleague and friend as she makes history. Her \nhard work and independent spirit have enriched the Senate and I wish \nher all the best in the years to come. On behalf of all Rhode \nIslanders, I congratulate you for this milestone in our Nation's \nhistory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S105-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REFORM AMERICA'S BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, once again, at the beginning of a new \nCongress, Majority Leader Reid has signaled his intent to improve our \nNation's immigration system with a plan to transform and modernize our \nlaws to meet the needs of the country.\n  I support the majority leader in this effort, as I have now for \nseveral Congresses. The American people recognize that our current \nimmigration system is deeply flawed. It is far too easily exploited by \nunscrupulous employers and others who seek to profit from the \nvulnerabilities of those seeking work and a new life. We can and should \nput an end to the too common abuses and transform our system into an \norderly, secure, and efficient way to strengthen our economy and \nfulfill our humanitarian traditions.\n  We must also confront the situation created by the millions of \nundocumented people who are living and working in the shadows in the \nUnited States--the vast majority of whom are otherwise following our \nlaws and making positive contributions to our economy. We can all agree \nthat we have arrived at a point that is not sustainable, and we must \nface up to it with a solution that is achievable. As both President \nBush and President Obama, along with their Secretaries of Homeland \nSecurity, have acknowledged, we cannot simply enforce our way out of a \nbroken immigration system. I agree.\n  We must reject the easy slogans that reduce this highly complex \nproblem to a bumper sticker solution--something the late Senator Ted \nKennedy spoke against so passionately. When we talk about the millions \nof immigrants living and working in the United States as a mass of \n``illegals'' to be sent out of the United States, we denigrate their \nhumanity. As a nation, we can agree that we will have no tolerance for \nthose who are out of status and go on to commit crimes. But for those \nwhose only transgression was entering the United States unlawfully in \nsearch of a better life for themselves and their families, we should \nproceed in a manner that is consistent with our best qualities as a \nhumanitarian and compassionate nation.\n  Achieving what the majority leader has proposed will not be easy. We \nhave experienced the difficulty again and again in recent years. I am \nheartened that the legislation the majority leader introduced includes \nreference to the DREAM Act and to AgJOBS, both of which I have strongly \nsupported for many years. Even if our progress is incremental, I \nbelieve that working on behalf of America's farmers and individuals \nwhose undocumented status is not a result of their own volition is a \nsound starting place.\n  Among other important goals, the legislation calls on Congress to \n``support our national and economic security.'' Along with AgJOBS and \nthe DREAM Act, I hope Senators will also recognize the fundamental \nunfairness that exists in our immigration laws for gay and lesbian \nAmericans and that this is also an economic issue. I have said many \ntimes that no American should be forced to choose between their loved \nones and their country. But this is the reality many Americans face, \nand it is wrong. Due to this false choice, many talented Americans \nchoose to leave their country for nations that treat binational, same-\nsex couples fairly, often at a cost to their employers and our Nation's \neconomic growth.\n  There are existing immigration programs that Congress should strongly \nsupport and improve, such as the EB-5 Regional Center Program, which \nhas a proven record as an engine to promote job creation and capital \ninvestment in American communities. With permanence, added \nefficiencies, and strong oversight, this program can continue to \noperate as an economically productive part of our overall immigration \nsystem. We must also reform our refugee laws to ensure that those in \nneed of protection find safety in the United States.\n  Americans have endured the bitter politics of immigration for far too \nlong. The hurtful rhetoric has obstructed progress and has deepened the \ndivisions on an issue that will require bipartisanship and compromise \non all sides. It is my sincere hope that the divisions are not too deep \nto be repaired and that we can make progress on fixing our struggling \nsystem. A rational, economically productive, and humane immigration \nsystem should be a cornerstone of our democracy; a source of pride \ninstead of anger, frustration or intolerance. Our history demonstrates \nthat immigration to the United States and the tremendous diversity that \nhas resulted, has set us apart as an example of freedom and unity for \nthe rest of the world. I hope as the 112th Congress begins, we will \nwork together toward a better system for America and all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S105-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S105-S106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    APPOINTMENT OF JEFFREY R. IMMELT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to salute Jeffrey R. Immelt \nfor agreeing to chair the President's new Council on Jobs and \nCompetitiveness.\n  Mr. Immelt knows quite a bit about creating jobs, promoting \ninnovation, and competing in the marketplace. As the chairman and chief \nexecutive officer of General Electric, Mr. Immelt has led the company \nthrough a major expansion into growth markets overseas and made GE a \nleader in manufacturing a new generation of environmentally friendly \ntechnologies. Now, as we transition from stabilizing our economy to \nincreasing employment and growth, Mr. Immelt's experience leading GE \nwill help him counsel the President through our long-term recovery.\n  Mr. Immelt knows that innovation is the key to America's economic \ngrowth.\n\n[[Page S106]]\n\nConsequently, GE relies heavily on the U.S. patent system. I have been \nvery happy to work with Mr. Immelt and GE as strong proponents of \nbipartisan patent reform legislation.\n  I recently met with Mr. Immelt and was impressed by his determination \nto make GE even more competitive in the future than it has been in the \npast. He has original ideas on investing in research and development \nand understands that reviving and updating America's manufacturing \neconomy is critical to creating jobs in this country. I have always \nbeen impressed with his commitment to manufacturing in Rutland, VT, \nwhere GE Aviation has a major plant.\n  In honor of his willingness to serve in this new capacity, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record Mr. Immelt's recent op-\ned, ``A blueprint for keeping America competitive.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 21, 2011]\n\n              A blueprint for Keeping America Competitive\n\n                         (By Jeffrey R. Immelt)\n\n       President Obama has asked me to chair his new President's \n     Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. I have served for the \n     past two years on the President's Economic Recovery Advisory \n     Board, and I look forward to leading the next phase of this \n     effort as we transition from recovery to long-term growth. \n     The president and I are committed to a candid and full \n     dialogue among business, labor and government to help ensure \n     that the United States has the most competitive and \n     innovative economy in the world.\n       Business leaders should provide expertise in service of our \n     country. My predecessors at GE have done so, as have leaders \n     of many other great American companies. There is always a \n     healthy tension between the public and private sectors. \n     However, we all share a responsibility to drive national \n     competitiveness, particularly during economic unrest. This is \n     one of those times.\n       My hope is that the council will be a sounding board for \n     ideas and a catalyst for action on jobs and competitiveness. \n     It will include small and large businesses, labor, economists \n     and government. Areas that we will focus on include:\n       Manufacturing and exports: We need a coordinated commitment \n     among business, labor and government to expand our \n     manufacturing base and increase exports. The assumption made \n     by many that the United States could transition from a \n     technology-based, export-oriented economic powerhouse to a \n     services-led, consumption-based economy without any serious \n     loss of jobs, prosperity or prestige was fundamentally wrong. \n     But there is nothing inevitable about America's declining \n     manufacturing competitiveness if we work together to reverse \n     it. For example, we have returned many GE appliance \n     manufacturing jobs to the States by collaborating with our \n     unions and making our operations more efficient.\n       Working with Boeing CEO Jim McNerney, who leads the \n     President's Export Council, the Council on Jobs and \n     Competitiveness will look for ways to harness the power of \n     international markets--home to more than 95 percent of the \n     world's consumers. Currently, the United States ranks lowest \n     among the world's largest manufacturing nations in the ratio \n     of domestically produced goods sold overseas, or export \n     intensity. We must set as our highest economic priority not \n     just increasing our exports, as the president has pledged, \n     but also making the United States the world's leading \n     exporter in the 21st century.\n        Free trade: America cannot expand its manufacturing base \n     without reatly increasing the volume of goods it sells \n     overseas. That is why I applaud the free-trade agreement \n     recently concluded between the United States and South Korea, \n     which will eliminate barriers to U.S. exports and support \n     export-oriented jobs. We should seek to conclude trade and \n     investment agreements with other fast-growing markets and \n     modernize our systems for export finance and trade control. \n     Those who advocate increasing domestic manufacturing jobs by \n     erecting trade barriers have it exactly wrong.\n       Innovation: Businesses should invest more of their cash and \n     resources in advanced products and technologies that will \n     create jobs in the United States, and government should \n     incentivize this investment in innovation. Today, GE is \n     investing more than ever in research and development--about 6 \n     percent of revenue--aimed at solving challenges in \n     transportation, energy and health care. As one of America's \n     largest exporters, GE remains committed to producing more \n     products in the United States, which is our home and largest \n     market. In the past two years, GE has created about 6,000 \n     manufacturing jobs in the States, many resulting from \n     investments in innovations such as advanced batteries, which \n     we will make at our 100-year-old plant in Schenectady, N.Y.\n       GE sells more than 96 percent of its products to the \n     private sector, where America's future must be built. But \n     government can help business invest in our shared future. A \n     sound and competitive tax system and a partnership between \n     business and government on education and innovation in areas \n     where America can lead, such as clean energy, are essential \n     to sustainable growth.\n       It is possible to be a competitive global enterprise and \n     still care about your home. In fact, it is not just possible \n     but imperative. There is no easy solution to ``fix'' the \n     American economy. Persistent and high unemployment--and the \n     pessimism it breeds--should not be accepted. We must work \n     together to construct an economy that creates more \n     opportunity for more people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S106-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Lance Corporal Michael Geary\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, it is with deep sadness that I rise to \nhonor the life of LCpl Michael Geary, who died on December 8, 2010, \nfrom wounds received in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, while supporting \nOperation Enduring Freedom. He was just 20 years old at the time of his \ndeath, and 5 months into his first tour of duty as a Marine. Michael \nwas a member of the 2nd Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine \nDivision, II Marine Expeditionary Force, based at Camp Lejeune, NC.\n  A native of Derry, NH, Michael graduated from Pinkerton Academy in \nJune 2009. As early as age 14, he wanted to join the Marines. Michael \nleft for boot camp in North Carolina just 1 month after graduating high \nschool to fulfill his life-long dream.\n  Admirably, Michael wished to represent our country to the best of his \nability--so much so that, prior to his deployment, he studied Afghan \nculture in order to increase his cultural awareness and to communicate \nmore effectively with the people of Afghanistan, especially Afghan \nyouth.\n  Michael is described by his loved ones as loyal, good-natured, and \ndriven. From attaining his black belt in karate to competing on the \ngridiron for the Pinkerton Astros, his drive was truly inspiring. His \nfamily attributes the personal growth of his younger cousin, Luke, to \nMichael's relentless drive and his dedication to the ones he loved. \nMichael is Luke's hero. This young patriot is also a hero to the State \nof New Hampshire and our entire country.\n  LCpl Michael Geary made the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of the \ncountry he loved and for that he has earned our enduring gratitude. I \nhope his family can find comfort in knowing that all Americans share a \ndeep appreciation for his heroic service.\n  Michael is survived by his parents, Timothy and Nancy Geary of Derry, \nNH. He also leaves behind a caring extended family and many dear \nfriends. This young hero will be missed by all.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to please join me in honoring \nthe life, service and sacrifice of LCpl Michael Geary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S106-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S106-S107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, tonight's State of the Union Address is a \nunique opportunity for the President to speak directly to the American \npeople and offer his course for the country. The President is promoting \ntrade as part of his agenda and I commend him for highlighting global \ncompetitiveness as an economic imperative. With the upcoming debate on \nthe U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, the President has an opportunity \nto speak candidly with the American people about the benefits and \nchallenges posed by trade. Doing this supports the case that the United \nStates needs new policies to rise to the challenges of a global \neconomy.\n  In order to avoid a divisive, ugly fight over trade, I would like to \nhear the President say in his speech that he will seek to establish a \nnew compact between workers, business, and government about how to \nincrease our competitiveness in the global economy. It is important to \ntry to reach this consensus before Congress is asked to consider the \ncontroversial free-trade agreements, FTAs, reached with Korea, \nColombia, and Panama.\n  The President has already begun down this path by ramping up efforts \nto combat unfair trade practices and establishing the National Export \nInitiative with the goal of doubling exports over the next 5 years. \nThese are both important strategies. In approaching the pending FTAs, \nit is vital that he talk about more than just exports; he must also \nhighlight the value of imports, two-way trade, and the\n\n[[Page S107]]\n\nglobal supply chain. This can only be done through candid conversation, \none the Nation richly deserves. If our debate draws only from the same \ntalking points that both sides have been using for the last 20 years, \nthe truth will be sidelined as proponents oversell the potential merits \nof the agreements and opponents oversell the potential pitfalls. That \nwould be a disservice to the country and represent a profound missed \nopportunity for the President.\n  Take the pending trade agreement with Korea as an example. This is \nthe most economically meaningful FTA since NAFTA. To help understand \nthe impact of this agreement, I sought the help of the staff of the \nindependent International Trade Commission, ITC. In 2007, the ITC found \nthat the agreement would have a limited impact on job creation, partly \nbecause of the assumptions the ITC made in its analysis. Because the \neconomic landscape in 2010 is profoundly different than it was in 2007, \nI asked staff of the ITC to provide an updated assessment of the \nagreement using conditions that reflect today's economic reality. Based \non these updated results, the FTA has the potential to create about \n280,000 new American jobs and boost U.S. economic output by $27 billion \neach year.\n  At the same time, these projections show that thousands of Americans \ncurrently employed in manufacturing could lose their jobs. Neither the \nPresident nor Congress can ignore these families, and it is our job to \nenlarge what I call the Winners' Circle to ensure that trade is a \nbenefit to Americans in all our communities.\n  When American firms and their workers are as competitive as they can \nbe, they can better tap foreign markets opened by trade agreements to \nspur the domestic economy and produce more good-paying jobs here at \nhome. The Department of Labor's chief economist recently testified that \njobs related to international trade typically pay more and offer better \nbenefits. However, when I talk with leading CEOs and labor economists, \nI hear the same concern: If we want our economy to grow at its full \npotential, we need more workers with the tools to compete.\n  In tonight's speech I would like to hear the President talk about \nproposals that will guarantee workers' career-long, affordable access \nto continuing education and skills upgrading so that businesses always \nhave the most productive and trained workforce they need. We expand the \nWinners' Circle by making it easier for workers to move from one job or \ncareer to the next and by making America the most attractive place to \nwork and live for anyone who has the skills, the brains, and the \nambition to succeed. Making it easier for companies with obsolete \ntechnology to retool to meet 21st-century global competition further \nexpands the Winner's Circle. This means a tax system that rewards the \nglobal growth of American firms while fostering investment in \nproduction and employment here at home.\n  In the coming months, President Obama has an opportunity to forge a \nnew, bipartisan consensus about trade and increasing foreign \ncompetitiveness. If he succeeds at this, not only does he succeed in \npassing these trade agreements but, far more importantly, he equips \nAmericas workers and businesses to drive the economy forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S107-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NORTHERN CYPRUS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to return to the issue of the \nlegacy of the invasion and ongoing occupation of Northern Cyprus and \nrelated human rights violations in the region. The disruption of a \nChristmas liturgy at the Orthodox Church of Agios Synesios, in \nRizokarpaso, by the security services is appalling and should be \nroundly condemned by people of good will. The town, located in the \nKarpas region, is an anchor for the remnant of the once thriving Greek \nCypriot community, now numbering several hundred mainly aged souls. The \nfaithful had gathered at the church one of only a handful of Orthodox \nplaces of worship in the occupied area to have survived intact for a \nrare service. According to reports, members of the security services \nentered the church while the liturgy was being celebrated, ordered a \nhalt to the religious service, and forced the worshipers and the priest \nout of the building before locking the doors.\n  This sad turn of events has become all too familiar in a region under \nthe effective control of the Turkish military. Of the 500 Orthodox \nChristian churches, monasteries, chapels and other sacred sites in the \nnorth, nearly all have sustained heavy damage, with most desecrated and \nplundered, including cemeteries. A mere handful, including the Church \nof Agios Synesios, may occasionally be used for religious services \ndepending upon the whims of the local authorities and the military. The \ndisruption of the Christmas Day liturgy is an affront to the dignity of \nthose attending the service and is part of a disturbing pattern of \nviolation of OSCE commitments on the fundamental freedom of religion, \nincluding the right of religious communities to maintain freely \naccessible places of worship.\n  A related concern has been the tendency of State Department reports \nto downplay the difficulties faced by Orthodox Christians seeking to \nconduct services in northern Cyprus as well as the extent of the \nregion's rich religious cultural heritage. I raised my concerns over \nthe denial of religious freedom in occupied Cyprus when the Committee \non Foreign Relations held a nomination hearing for the position of \nAmbassador-At-Large for International Religious Freedom and will \ncontinue to closely monitor the situation in that part of Cyprus.\n  Under my chairmanship of the Commission on Security and Cooperation \nin Europe we undertook an examination of the destruction of religious \ncultural heritage in that part of Cyprus. Our findings, along with \nexpert testimony were presented at a Commission briefing, ``Cyprus' \nReligious Cultural Heritage in Peril'' held on July 21, 2009. I \nencourage my colleagues and other interested parties to review the \nmaterials from that event, available on the Commission's Web site, \nwww.csce.gov. A Law Library of Congress report: ``Cyprus: Destruction \nof Cultural Property in the Northern Part of Cyprus and Violations of \nInternational Law'' was also released at the briefing. In addition to \ndocumenting the extensive destruction of such sites, the briefing also \ntouched on infringements of the rights of Orthodox Christians in \nNorthern Cyprus to freely practice their religion.\n  Those responsible for the interruption and abrupt forcible ending of \nthe Christmas service at the Church of Agios Synesios should issue a \nformal apology for the boorish act of repression and I call upon all \nauthorities in northern Cyprus to remove restrictions on the free \nexercise of freedom of religion and other basic human rights in this \npart of the country under their control.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S107-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S107-S108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING BRAD BROOKS\n\n Mr. BEGICH.

He was 58.\n  Born on October 25, 1952, Brad was a lifelong Fairbanksan who \ngraduated from Lathrop High School in 1970. Brad was always proud he \nwas a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \nLocal 1547 and the Public Employees Local 71 unions. During his career, \nhe worked on building the Trans-Alaska pipeline and maintained \ncommunication infrastructure across the entire State of Alaska.\n  Brad fully embraced the spirit of volunteerism as he tirelessly \nhelped make Fairbanks a better place. As a founding member of the \nInterior Democrats, Brad helped shape the political atmosphere of \nInterior Alaska for the Alaska Democratic Party for over 30 years. At \nthe time of his passing, Brad was serving on the Executive Committee as \ncommunications secretary.\n  Coming from a family of Eagle Scouts, Brad earned the rank and \ncontinued a life of service to the Boy Scouts of America. Thousands of \nvolunteer hours, community service projects and laughs were shared with \nthe boys of Troop 10, the Midnight Sun Council and Lost Lake Scout \nCamp. Several awards were presented to Brad for his Scouting service \nincluding awards from the AFL-CIO and the local Silver Beaver Award. \nMany young men were mentored, enriched, and encouraged to participate \nin a life of service to community by Brad's example.\n\n[[Page S108]]\n\n  Every year, Brad would lend many hours of his communications \nexpertise assisting the Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race between \nWhitehorse, British Columbia, Canada, and Fairbanks, AK. Brad assisted \nwith the set up and coordination of trail communication necessary to \nallow mushers in remote areas to communicate with race officials and \nemergency responders.\n  Lastly, but most importantly, Brad was devoted to his wife of 32 \nyears, Drena McIntyre, and his son Tyler, daughter Graehl, and \ngranddaughter Sylvia-Lei.\n  A final farewell to Brad included a rock n roll wake at Big Daddy's \nBar-B-Q in Fairbanks.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor \nthe life of Rebecca ``Becky'' Wood Watkin, a dedicated progressive \nadvocate for the environment and affordable housing. Ms. Watkin passed \naway peacefully on December 19, 2010. She was 97 years old.\n  Born in 1913 in Portland, OR, to Erskine Wood and Rebecca Biddle \nWood, Becky earned a bachelor of arts from Bryn Mawr College in 1933. \nFour years later, she earned a bachelor of architecture from the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania's School of Architecture. At the time, Penn \ndid not admit women to its Architecture School, so Becky and two other \nwomen blazed a trail--they took all the courses required for an \narchitecture degree, and then insisted that the school confer a \nbachelor of architecture degree. They became the first women to receive \nthat degree from the University of Pennsylvania's Architecture School.\n  After receiving her degree in architecture, Becky moved to Sausalito, \nCA, where she found work as a draftswoman. In 1944, after the required \n4 years of drafting work, she received her California architectural \nlicense. At the time, there were very few women licensed to practice \narchitecture in California; however, blazing another trail, Becky \nopened her own architecture practice in 1951.\n  Becky dedicated herself to helping those less fortunate than she was. \nIn 1968, she helped found the Marin Ecumenical Association for Housing, \nwhich has provided hundreds of low-income housing units in Marin \nCounty. EAH, as it is now known, has successfully developed, managed \nand promoted quality affordable housing for 42 years. In addition to \nher work with EAH, Becky also served on the Marin County Planning \nCommission in the 1970s, where she was a leading advocate for \nenvironmentally sensitive development and affordable housing.\n  Becky also believed strongly in civic participation, and was very \nactive with the Marin County Democratic Party. She cochaired Adlai \nStevenson's local campaign in 1952 and 1956, and in 1960, she was John \nKennedy's precinct chairwoman in Marin. In 1968, Becky cochaired Marin \nCounty's Eugene McCarthy for President Committee, and in 1972 she \nheaded George McGovern's local Presidential campaign. Breaking a losing \nstreak, Becky ran Jimmy Carter's primary campaign in 1976, also serving \nas a delegate to the National Convention.\n  In fact, Becky was one of the first people to give me a start in \nlocal politics: when I went to volunteer at the local Marin County \nDemocratic campaign office in 1968, Becky put me to work typing address \nlabels!\n  Becky left a deep impression on all who knew her. Whether in \nPortland, Marin, or San Diego, where she moved in 2003, her life was \nfull of activity. She loved the outdoors, and was an avid hiker and \nskier. Always a lover of music, she sang with the Marin Chorus until \nshe was in her eighties, and regularly attended and supported the \nsymphony and opera both in San Francisco and in San Diego.\n  Throughout her life, Becky's commitment to her community was evident \nin the work she did every day. She was a true trailblazer and \nprogressive advocate, working tirelessly to better her community. Her \nlifetime of contributions will not soon be forgotten.\n  Becky is survived by her daughter Lisa; sons Joseph and Peter, and \ntheir spouses Ye Wa and Trylla; grandchildren Joseph Scott, \nChristopher, Milena, Katrina, and Lisl; and five great-grandchildren. I \nextend my deepest sympathies to her family and I feel blessed that \nBecky was a mentor, and most important, a dear friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S108-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S108-S109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING WALTER L. KUBLEY, SR.\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I honor Walter L. Kubley, \nSr. On December 14, 2010, Alaska lost this shining star who truly \npossessed the legendary ``Pioneer Alaskan Spirit.'' Walter, who we \ncalled Wally, served Alaska in a long diverse career that ranged from \nwork at the Ketchikan Volunteer Fire Department to the Alaskan \nSecretary for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. When Wally was \nCommissioner of Commerce under Governor Keith Miller, he worked \nalongside his good friend and Commissioner of Revenue, George Morrison, \nand took revenues generated from the first oil lease sale in Prudhoe \nBay and invested it to create the seeds of what is now known as the \n``Permanent Fund.'' This fund evolved and allowed the citizens of our \nState to share in the bounty of our natural resources. Wally also made \nan indelible mark on the infrastructure and transportation system of \nAlaska. His tireless efforts as one of the authors of the legislation \nthat created the Alaska Marine Highway System have continued to act as \nthe integral yarn of the socioeconomic fabric of southeast Alaska. I \nmyself have spent many hours on the beautiful ``roads'' that can be \nattributed to this caring man. As the ``Father of the Alaskan Highway \nSystem,'' Wally often talked of bringing his family along on the maiden \nvoyage of the M/V Malaspina mainline ferry from Seattle to Ketchikan \nthat launched in 1963. Wally also served in the State legislature with \nSenator Ted Stevens, who he remained close with until his death and \nserved as an honorary pallbearer along with Representative Don Young. \nWhether his title was as an Alaskan House Representative, Commissioner \nof Commerce, or Commissioner of Transportation, his lone goal was to \nhelp his region, his State, and its people.\n  Wally was born and raised in Ketchikan in 1921 as the third \ngeneration of his family in Alaska. After graduating from high school, \nhe studied at Whitman College but withdrew from school and joined the \nU.S. Coast Guard after the tragic events at Pearl Harbor. With his \nextraordinary childhood knowledge of the Alaskan coast, he served as \ncaptain of a submarine chaser out of Prince Rupert on the lookout for \nenemy submarines in the waters of southeast Alaska. After the war, he \nmarried his beautiful fiancee and the love of his life, Fern, who \nserved as Mrs. Alaska in 1962. They spent 60 wonderful years of \nmarriage together. At a young age, Wally left a cultural mark in the \ncommunity as he built the world famous Sourdough Bar, the first bowling \nalley in Ketchikan, the Billiken Bowl, and the Sportsman Bar and Cafe \nin Ward Cove. Wally's grandson, Wally Jr., is now the owner of the \nSourdough Bar and has continued the traditional weekly coffee forum \nheld every Thursday morning up until his passing.\n  As the patriarch of a sixth generation Ketchikan family, Wally will \nbe missed deeply by his loving family and all those who have known his \ncaring nature. Wally's grandfather came to Alaska during the Gold Rush \nand after a few years prospecting in Hyder moved to Ketchikan in 1904 \nand set his family's roots. Wally owned a cabin built with hand hewn \nyellow cedar at Mirror Lake in the Misty Fjords. This later became the \nMirror Lake Sportsman's Club where Wally enjoyed relaxing times fishing \nwith his children, grandchildren, and friends. He was never without a \nsmile and his own brand of creative thoughtfulness always shined \nbright. He is survived by his sons Don and Larry, daughter Kaaren, and \nhis grandchildren.\n  Wally and I shared a common birthplace in Ketchikan and a love for \nour homeland of Alaska. Without the work that he has done, the state of \nAlaska would be a different place. I can easily\n\n[[Page S109]]\n\nsay that Wally helped create the Alaska that future generations will \nhappily inherit. He was the driving force for many Alaskan traditions \nand we owe him immense gratitude. May he rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S109-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S109-S112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             VERMONT ESSAYS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today I wish to share the powerful \nwords of 12 Vermont students. As I toured the schools of Vermont, I \nencouraged students to write me focusing on issues of concern to young \npeople and to recommend short- and long-term priorities for the \nPresident. I received more than 225 State of the Union essays about the \ndeclining middle class, climate change, and health care reform. These \nstudents truly answered, what is the state of our Union?\n  It is important to remember that part of our jobs is to represent the \nyoung people of our States and not just their parents. We all know that \nwhat happens in Washington, DC, impacts every American and all of us, \nincluding young people, should be thinking about these issues. Although \nVermont is doing a better job than most States, there is certainly a \nlegitimate concern that young people are not learning enough about \ncivics. I think these essays demonstrate that students do understand \nthe role they can play in American democracy.\n  As President Barack Obama presents his State of the Union Address to \na joint session of Congress tonight, I think it is appropriate that the \ntop dozen essays are printed in the Record, so that the entire country \ncan see the excellent work that Vermont students are doing. I also want \nto thank the teachers--Jennie Gartner from Rutland High School; \nElizabeth Lebrun, of Poultney High School; Joe Maley of South \nBurlington High School; and Terri Vest of Twinfield Union High School \nin Plainfield--who helped me select these essays.\n  Keenan Villani-Holland from Vermont Commons School was the teachers' \ntop choice. In addition to Keenan, the other finalists, in alphabetical \norder, are: Iain Axworthy, Essex High School; Emily Berk, South \nRoyalton School; Molly Burke, Champlain Valley Union High School; Jonah \nCantor, Champlain Valley Union High School; Molly Cantore, St. \nJohnsbury Academy; Kristen Donaldson, Champlain Valley Union High \nSchool; Susannah Johnson, Vermont Commons School; Ingrid Klinkenberg, \nEdmunds Middle School; Ezra Mount-Finette, Champlain Valley Union High \nSchool; Lisa Ogorzalek of Rutland High School; and Bryn Philibert, \nChamplain Valley Union High School.\n  I am pleased the students of Vermont are thinking about these complex \nissues, which are of critical importance to not only our State but \nindeed the Nation. The decisions that we make on the Senate floor today \nwill impact generations of Americans to come. That is why I would like \nto share with you what these students' wrote. I ask that they be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n\n             Keenan Villani-Holland, Vermont Commons School\n\n       The world is changing, and the United States has the \n     opportunity to lead that change. Oil is running out, global \n     warming is reaching or has already passed a significant \n     tipping point and tensions with North Korea and Iran are \n     escalating. On the home front, the middle class is rapidly \n     disappearing due to an economic crisis that has been \n     festering for years, we are losing out in education to China \n     and our people have completely lost touch with the government \n     and vice versa.\n       In older times, nations would go through major catastrophes \n     often: devastating wars, plagues, bloody revolutions, etc. \n     often enough to keep them new. In this day and age, these \n     enormous crises are largely averted in the western world. \n     Make no mistake, this is a great thing. However, it means we \n     need to take it upon ourselves to renew our Nation, rather \n     than waiting for a catastrophe that won't come.\n       We need to change quickly on three main fronts: The \n     environment, the economy, and education. It is time to \n     realize that fighting to save the environment is not in the \n     least altruistic. The planet doesn't care about global \n     warming or melting ice caps. We, on the other hand, should. \n     Our current economic model is failing all but the richest of \n     our Nation, as it slowly squeezes the middle class dry to \n     supply the rich. Finally, our educational system clearly \n     isn't working when China is easily surpassing us in education \n     and our students feel more overworked and overstressed every \n     day.\n       Let me first talk about the environmental front. Once we \n     realize that it is no longer a fight to save polar bears, and \n     that it is a fight to save ourselves, it will be easy. \n     However, that realization will not come quickly. We need a \n     huge-scale public awareness campaign to bring that point home \n     to American people. After that, we need to start with large \n     scale energy reform, focusing on renewables and following a \n     European model.\n       On the economy, we need to throw away our preconceptions \n     about the free market and start over. Heavy regulation to \n     ensure the economic safety of the American people, and \n     measures to start moving wealth back down the ladder to the \n     middle and lower classes are essential.\n       Finally, our educational system needs deep reforms to focus \n     on actually teaching children, rather than preparing them to \n     do well on tests. Children want to learn. That's what they \n     are supposed to be doing at that point in their life. It's \n     just a matter of taking the time for each individual and \n     giving them the attention they need and actually being \n     invested in them learning new material.\n       All of these ideas are fluid and adaptable, as any part of \n     government should be. We should never be afraid to change the \n     course we are taking in favor one that may be more \n     beneficial. The past decade was one about ``Staying the \n     course.'' This next one will be known as the one when we \n     ``Changed the course.''\n\n\n                    Iain Axworthy, Essex High School\n\n       Our Nation faces many challenges entering into the new \n     year. A recession has about 9.4 percent of our population out \n     of work, we have a government deficit that must be paid off, \n     and a tarnished image of America abroad must be mended. \n     Though these challenges are great they present us with what I \n     see as an opportunity unparalleled in recent history. Our \n     role as a world leader has come into question as of late and \n     good times provide little opportunity to change that view. \n     When times are hard real leaders take it upon themselves to \n     set the tone of the moment and show others how to react. It \n     is time for America to lead once again.\n       Our troubles at home and our troubles abroad are \n     tremendous. Our economy is in a weak phase of recovery, our \n     federal deficit is larger than it ever has been, and our \n     armed forces are engaged in a costly war. Relations have \n     become strained between the United States and much of the \n     world. The policies we enact in the coming months and years, \n     both domestically and overseas, must be exemplary. The US has \n     been the center of world commerce and culture for so long \n     that we almost seem to fear up-and-comers. Instead viewing \n     the coming shift of power as a loss we must view it as a win. \n     In the wake of World War II the US helped set up a system of \n     commerce that allowed many countries to develop into world \n     powers. The fact that countries other than ours are realizing \n     their potential should be seen as a great victory.\n       As we watch new world powers emerge we must see too that \n     they will look to us as a role model. It is our duty and our \n     privilege to set the right example in all areas, both in and \n     out of the government. The private sector must become more \n     responsible for its actions and create shared value within \n     its partner communities. Our consumers must spend and save \n     responsibly. Finally the people who represent us in Congress \n     and our state legislatures must depolarize and find the \n     mutual respect that has lately been non-existent. Once the \n     correct tone is set and our leaders act as they would have us \n     act, then we can look forward to a better tomorrow.\n       While our Nation sets an example on the world stage, \n     Vermont has the ability to set an example on a national \n     level. Vermont has powered though this recession with some of \n     the lowest unemployment figures in the Union, and though we \n     face our own issues we must acknowledge that we are much \n     better off than many other states. As such, we ought to make \n     concessions in Congress to aid those states hit hardest by \n     the recession. Though Vermonters may be few in number we can \n     show the rest of the country how citizens ought to act and \n     put the good of the nation before our own comfort.\n\n\n                   Emily Berk, South Royalton School\n\n       Growing up in rural, Middle Class America in the 21st \n     century hasn't impacted my life or my immediate family's \n     life. The current state of the union is coming out of a \n     recession. Personally, I've been very lucky. Both of my \n     parents are educated professionals that have stable jobs, \n     which they were able to keep through this economic downfall. \n     But it didn't mean that we weren't using more of our \n     disposable income to afford our basic needs, such as food, \n     health insurance, medications, fuel, oil, and utilities. \n     Meaning, we weren't able to go on as many vacations, but we \n     weren't losing our house. But I have family and friends that \n     have been affected by the economic downfall. With the \n     relations that I have with the people whom I know that are \n     being affected by this, I believe that the Presidents \n     ultimate goal should be to stabilize the economy, and support \n     our own.\n       I believe that in order for the economy to become \n     stabilized, a short-term goal should be that more jobs become \n     available. Jobs will stimulate the economy and let people who \n     are on unemployment to go back to work and earn more money. \n     And to allow people under employed to have better employment \n     for their education and ability. I believe by creating more \n     jobs, people will make more money, and more money will then \n     be spent, going to the government to start getting us more \n     and more out the recession. ``Creating jobs in the United \n     States\n\n[[Page S110]]\n\n     and ensuring a return to sustainable economic growth is the \n     top priority for my Administration,'' Barrack Obama said in \n     an Executive Order last March on his National Export \n     Initiative. With little short-term goals such as more jobs, \n     it will help start to stabilize the economy.\n       Another priority that I believe that should be on the \n     Presidents list is to support military families. Families \n     with family members in the military struggle with every day \n     life. I personally have a family being affected by it. My \n     cousin's father is in the war. He is on his second tour. He \n     has missed his children grow up, with a daughter who is now \n     15 and a 10 year old son. His wife is forced to be a single \n     parent. With support through programs, financial support and \n     counseling we could help the families being affected by war. \n     With programs set up for single parents with their partner in \n     the war nobody can understand better then another parent with \n     their partner in war. They would be able to share stories and \n     understand how one and another copes with them gone. And more \n     appreciation for those serving our country. They're fighting \n     for their lives, causing their families live's to become \n     difficult and change the way they live. Another priority \n     should be Student Loan Reforms.\n       Student Loan Reforms are important because the change will \n     eliminate private banks, the ``middlemen'' in the loan \n     process and will save the US government about $68 billion \n     dollars over a span of 11 years, according to the White \n     House. Because fewer fees will be paid to the local banks and \n     more money will be available to lend to students because the \n     money's coming directly from the government. The banks also \n     charge the government money for each loan because they're not \n     going to give students money for free. But for students, the \n     loans will look relatively the same--same terms, same fees, \n     same interest rates. The loans will most likely become more \n     accessible to students as well.\n       These are some of the short-term goals I believe should be \n     considered to help our country. I believe that this economic \n     downfall, can, with work, be fixed. If we really want \n     something we can achieve it. If people in our Nation come \n     together and act as one, we can do it. I hope that I was able \n     to give you good ideas about what goals I believe can help \n     our nation. Even though I am just a 15 year-old girl living \n     in a small town in Vermont, I still have a voice, and it will \n     be up to my generation to keep us out of another depression.\n\n\n            Molly Burke, Champlain Valley Union High School\n\n       Fellow Americans,\n       I'm writing to inform you of the current state of the \n     Nation and concerns I feel must be addressed in 2011.\n       The overuse of fossil fuels and its impact on the \n     environment is an issue I feel should be more extensively \n     addressed. The United States of America needs to end its \n     dependency on foreign oil and begin looking into alternative \n     energy sources. Wind energy, and solar energy are infinite \n     commodities that will steer the nation towards self-\n     dependency, sustainability and a cleaner environmental \n     future. The development of alternative energy sources may \n     also create jobs.\n       Since June 2009, the United States has been slowly \n     recovering from a severe economic recession. With an \n     unemployment rate greater than 9 percent, it is clear we must \n     focus our energies on job creation. Generating jobs in the \n     environmental field and re-building our nations \n     infrastructure including roads, bridges, and rail networks, \n     which are deteriorating, will provide job opportunities. In \n     order to meet many of these objectives, we need to take a \n     look at our current educational system to ensure we are \n     providing the necessary tools and training for the youth of \n     this country and accurately preparing them for the work \n     force. In particular, we must stress the importance of math \n     and science to remain at the forefront of innovation and \n     technology.\n       The United States has a $1.4 trillion deficit. This issue \n     relates directly to the amount of overspending in this \n     country. The proposal by the Republican Party, requesting to \n     keep the Bush-era tax rates to aid job creation instead of \n     placing higher taxes on affluent citizens is not enough to \n     reduce the national debt. Raising taxes on the wealthiest \n     people in this country will help decrease the national \n     deficit without severely impacting their financial situation. \n     We need to make hard choices, we need to cut spending and \n     raise taxes in order to reduce the deficit.\n       Healthcare is a benefit that should be given to each \n     citizen of the United States. In the Declaration of \n     independence, each person was guaranteed the unalienable \n     right to ``Life.'' This right should be protected by \n     universal healthcare, which provides citizens with the \n     medical care and treatment necessary for their survival and \n     well-being. Universal healthcare is a basic right for each \n     citizen.\n       The United States needs to continue to be a world leader, \n     however it no longer has the resources to be the ``worlds \n     policeman.''The United States needs to work more effectively \n     with other emerging superpowers like China, and Russia to \n     solve large global issues. Collectively, we have a \n     responsibility and duty to solve global problems.\n       To accomplish these goals and create a more effective \n     government, there needs to be a more civil discourse between \n     the Democratic and Republican Parties. As the leader of this \n     Nation, I strive to make positive progress towards these \n     goals however this can only be achieved if both parties are \n     willing to make compromises. Working together as one Nation \n     will strengthen the union. Thank you. God bless you. And God \n     bless the United States of America.\n\n\n            Jonah Cantor, Champlain Valley Union High School\n\n       My fellow Americans, today I will address issues you and I \n     are facing as a country. Our country's trade deficit with \n     foreign nations, the flaws of our education system, and the \n     need for healthcare reform are the problems I will present \n     and propose solutions for. It is important to attend to these \n     issues so we can resolve them efficiently as a country.\n       There is an obvious issue with how disproportionate the \n     amount our country imports compared to exports. It is time \n     for America to not only supply itself with a sufficient \n     amount of goods, but also foreign countries. Of course, this \n     increase in exports will require more factories to operate. \n     This increase in factories will affect the economy in \n     positive ways, mainly through the creation of jobs. More jobs \n     leads to less poverty and more money flowing throughout the \n     country. A healthy economy needs money and power distributed \n     among its citizens.\n       A successful democracy is dependent on a well-informed and \n     educated public. The education system in this country has \n     been slipping in recent years, letting down the citizens. It \n     is time to give children and young adults opportunities to \n     experience an excellent education program. More money will be \n     invested in the educational system, the overall quality of \n     the education being received will be higher, the equipment in \n     the classrooms will be up-to-date, and lastly, public \n     colleges and universities will become affordable. An educated \n     public leads to more politically-active citizens and a \n     healthier society. It is critical to give every citizen an \n     education that will help lead him or her and our country to \n     success.\n       There are millions of Americans who currently don't have \n     healthcare and millions more who are under insured. In the \n     long run, this fact costs everyone money. These people with \n     inadequate or no healthcare do not tend to take care of \n     themselves. Going to see a doctor costs money that they don't \n     have, so many simply don't go at all. But when one of these \n     people needs care because of an emergency, everyone pays for \n     it.\n       These are all large problems, but they are not \n     surmountable. We will need to be determined to put in hard \n     work to accomplish these goals, but the rewards we will have \n     earned will be great. I hope we can work as a country to \n     achieve our goals to make a more perfect society.\n\n\n                  Molly Cantore, St. Johnsbury Academy\n\n       Each year, the president of the United States addresses \n     issues the people want to be addressed. While the president \n     tackles many topics in the State of the Union Address, an \n     important question arises about one topic in particular \n     within the economy. Should reducing unemployment become a \n     short-term goal as the national deficit grows, to be dealt \n     with on a long-term basis, or vice versa? Another important \n     topic of discussion and worthy of being addressed is the \n     encouragement of civic responsibility.\n       The economy encompasses two closely related topics of much \n     debate: unemployment and the national deficit. Two points are \n     more than clear, however. People remain unemployed and the \n     Nation remains in trillions of dollars in debt. Which concern \n     takes priority? While creating jobs is excellent for the \n     economy, it is also hurtful. In order to fight unemployment, \n     we are dragged further into debt, as the government provides \n     stimulus money to create more jobs. As the national debt \n     continues to grow, its triple-A credit rating is at risk of \n     dropping, which could hinder the U.S.'s ability to borrow \n     money to finance the deficit. However, if the government \n     focuses on lessening the deficit, unemployment will increase. \n     While climbing out of debt pleases the government, the \n     shrinking job pool displeases the people. The president, \n     elected by the people, does everything in his power to please \n     the people, in order to get reelected. Creating more jobs may \n     put the U.S. in jeopardy of losing its ability to borrow \n     money in order to finance its deficit, and focusing on \n     lessening the deficit cuts jobs which displeases the people, \n     who play a very important role in the democratic government. \n     Thus, this growing debate should be focused on in the State \n     of the Union Address.\n       The people are pertinent to a democratic government. They \n     have responsibilities as citizens to play that role, called \n     civic responsibility. In order to participate in and take \n     action in the government, a citizen must first be informed of \n     the issues, problems, and challenges that face the country. A \n     very important part of civic responsibility is voting. People \n     have a right to vote, and voters, especially young and new \n     voters, are responsible for being informed of the candidate's \n     stances and goals. An informed voter will elect the candidate \n     best fit for guiding the United States to recovery and \n     prosperity. As the article, ``Mr Obama's unpromising year'' \n     in The Economist states, young and first time voters, ``who \n     in 2008 were electrified by his person rather than his \n     policies'' should have instead been informed and should have \n     voted for President Obama because of his stances and \n     policies. Therefore, encouragement of civic responsibility, \n     especially being an informed voter, is a very important issue \n     that should be addressed in the State of the Union Address.\n\n[[Page S111]]\n\n       The State of the Union Address is an important opportunity \n     in which the voices of the people can be heard. Two important \n     topics that should be addressed include the encouragement of \n     civic responsibility and the ever-growing debate of \n     unemployment versus the deficit.\n\n\n         Kristen Donaldson, Champlain Valley Union High School\n\n       My fellow Americans, our history as a country has had its \n     ups and downs. We've seen hardships like most nations have \n     never seen before, but also we've seen prosperity that most \n     nations do not even deem possible. At this point, our Nation \n     is struggling in one of these ``lows''. However, because of \n     our proud ``high'' moments that we have in this country, I \n     know that change is possible with just a few alterations.\n       Although the unemployment rate has dropped from 10.6 \n     percent to 9.3 percent, that still means 21,830,360 Americans \n     are unemployed. No way to pay their rent that is riding over \n     their heads, not sure if they will make it through the \n     winter, and still have a house to their name. That is the \n     reality for almost 1 in 10 Americans. We need to create more \n     jobs, so we can continue to see that percentage decrease. One \n     way is to create new jobs by initiating a clean energy start. \n     Hundreds of thousands of jobs lie on the creation and \n     innovation of clean energy. Why not reduce our unemployment \n     rate, while leading the world on a new, greener path.\n       Outsourcing is the second main reason for unemployment \n     rates. As a country, we need to put our priorities first, and \n     make sure that we hold onto our jobs. We need to step back up \n     to the plate again, and continue our stronghold on the title \n     of the world's powerhouse.\n       Now, along with instability in jobs, comes the concern of \n     our overriding deficit. This deficit is like the elephant in \n     the room. Everyone knows it's there, but no one is doing \n     anything about it. Our country is in over 14 trillion dollars \n     of debt. The only viable fix is to cut all of the programs \n     that simply aren't working. We need to re-think our \n     approaches, and decide what is needed and what isn't.\n       Finally, the issue of the rising education costs is \n     plaguing our Nation, holding children back from their full \n     potential. If students are able to go to school, \\2/3\\ of \n     them will be stuck under student loans once they graduate. \n     Colleges and universities need to cut their costs, because if \n     they do so, more students will have a chance at education. \n     More of these educated citizens will be able to contribute to \n     our nation.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, America's history has been a \n     rollercoaster of ups and downs. We've seen it all, and we \n     know how to recover from it. By addressing the most prevalent \n     problems, America will have the opportunity to possibly not \n     see a ``down'' for a long time.\n\n\n                Susannah Johnson, Vermont Commons School\n\n       We Will Not be Perfect, But We Will Be Better\n       I try to use the word ``perfect'' seldom. In my short life \n     I've worked with lots of different people in many different \n     places. And I have come to the sad conclusion that the world \n     will never be perfect.\n       The United States, like every country, has problems deeply \n     concerning to young people. Yet our voices are rarely heard. \n     Here's my voice.\n       In my opinion the priority issues are those that involve \n     the overall wellbeing of people: the economy, renewable \n     energy, and health care.\n       The Economy--Since the Recession began in 2008 the economy \n     has splintered. Thousands of people lost their jobs, lost \n     their homes, and found themselves struggling to pay for \n     things like housing, college tuitions, even food on their \n     tables. In response to the recession, President Obama created \n     the Recovery Act which helped create three million jobs. The \n     law helped avoid another Great Depression. But it is \n     important for the President to face all aspects of the \n     economic crisis and create a new plan for a ``new era of \n     responsibility'' (his words). The plan needs to include the \n     creation of more jobs, a strategy to keep families in their \n     homes, and finally a plan to get credit flowing again so that \n     small businesses can reform and hire workers so families are \n     able to pay for their children to go to college.\n       Energy--Renewable energy is another long-term goal \n     President Obama needs to focus on. So far the President's \n     programs have helped provide short-term relief to families \n     who struggle to pay for gas at the pump, produce one million \n     Plug-In Hybrid cars which get up to 150 miles per gallon, and \n     has told America that by 2012 10 percent of our electricity \n     must come from renewable sources. These actions have helped \n     lead the country in the right direction. But more steps need \n     to be taken. It is important for us to reduce our dependence \n     on foreign oil. The U.S. should also become the world leader \n     on climate change. The more people that are aware of the \n     issue and its effects, the more ideas people will have about \n     how to resolve it. Creating jobs that are ``green'' is also a \n     strategy that would be beneficial.\n       Health Care--More and more Americans have lost their health \n     insurance over time. They just can't afford good medical \n     care. There should be no debate whether health care reform is \n     necessary--it is. Period. Nearly 46 million Americans have no \n     insurance, and this needs to change. It would be beneficial \n     to create a health insurance program that would be an option \n     for all Americans. It's very unfair that there are people who \n     don't qualify for health insurance because of ``pre-\n     existing'' health conditions. A program needs to be created \n     in which nobody is discriminated against, regardless of their \n     health history. To create a program that does these things \n     will be expensive, so the President needs to be creative and \n     figure out where this money will come from. He's smart, he \n     can do it.\n\n\n               Ingrid Klinkenberg, Edmunds Middle School\n\n       The state of our Union can be addressed in many topics; the \n     economy, education, achievements, failures, and so much more. \n     There are many things that have happened in the past year, we \n     have achieved some of our goals, but we have fallen short on \n     some of our goals as well. A couple of years ago, our country \n     was in a severe economic decline. Since then our economy has \n     been improving and looking promising. This is a step in the \n     right direction. In the other direction, this year our \n     poverty rates went up by 10.3 percent. If we can do something \n     to lower the poverty rate in coming years that would be \n     beneficial. The state of our Union is stronger today than it \n     was last year, and it can be stronger next year if we stay \n     focused.\n       Poverty in the United States is a big problem. Right now \n     about 13 percent, or nearly 40 million people, are living in \n     poverty. Many of these people live without a roof over their \n     head, food on the table, and many work multiple jobs just to \n     survive.\n       It would be beneficial to make the opportunity of education \n     more accessible, education provides opportunities. When more \n     people have the opportunity of education, more people are \n     able to have better paying jobs, which will allow them to \n     better support themselves. Even though education would offer \n     a brighter future for many, there still will be poverty. It \n     is an unsolved problem the whole world is faced with. It has \n     existed in the past, it exists now, and it will exist in the \n     future. What we can do to make a difference is to decrease \n     poverty in the future. Better education and more \n     opportunities will be one of the keys.\n       In the past few years the U.S. has been recovering from a \n     devastating economic crisis, which impacted the whole country \n     and most of the world. Financial institutions collapsed, the \n     stock markets fell, people's retirement savings were reduced, \n     and people became more conservative in their spending. Many \n     jobs were lost, resulting in people not being able to pay for \n     their homes and the real estate market weakened. The future \n     for many Americans continues to be uncertain. This past year \n     our economy has been getting more healthy and promising. The \n     credit markets have begun to unfreeze allowing companies to \n     borrow the money they need to expand. Company profits have \n     improved, which has allowed the stock markets to go up, \n     benefiting investors. 2010 has been a year that we have been \n     able to make our economy stronger and healthier.\n       One sentence to describe this past year, and the change in \n     the U.S., I would say, ``We are headed in the right \n     direction, we just need to make a little more change \n     happen.'' Overall our economy has improved, and if we keep it \n     at a steady rate like it is now, we will be in a better \n     position in a couple of years. The poverty rates went up \n     which told us that we need to work harder on that aspect of \n     our Union. That is what better and more affordable education \n     will do in the United States. There were defiantly postitives \n     and negitives about the state of our Union this past year, \n     and I think it was a good step in the right direction for a \n     better future in our Union.\n\n\n         Ezra Mount-Finette, Champlain Valley Union High School\n\n       Mr. Speaker, Vice president Biden, Members of the Congress, \n     distinguished guests and fellow American citizens.\n       I am here before you today, to full fill one of my \n     constitutional responsibilities to address congress on the \n     current state of union. My speech tonight is not meant just \n     for the hundred and twelfth congress but also to the citizens \n     concerned in the condition of our country.\n       Half way through my presidential term, we have brought our \n     country out of a recession, passed a health care bill that \n     delivered healthcare to every single United State citizen, \n     constructed loan programs helping students pay for college, \n     and cut taxes for everyone. Yet we still have a growing 14.5 \n     trillion dollar debt, 9.4 percent of the country is out of \n     work and we have troops stationed in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n       We have work to do, and I am first going to address the \n     subject of partisanship, not just in Congress but also \n     throughout the country. We might be Muslim, Jewish, \n     Christian, old, young, African-American, Mexican-American, \n     Caucasian, democrat or republican but there is one thing we \n     all are; citizen of this great country. I want to remind \n     Congress that their duty is to represent the United States \n     and what is in the country's best interest. That there are no \n     two sides of an issue just two opinions; both with there own \n     reasoning behind them. Your job as Congressmen is to create \n     the optimal legislation that benefits the citizens of the \n     country, not legislation that is beneficial to a party, a \n     company or yourself, but to the three hundred million other \n     people that live in the United States of America. Take those \n     two ideas and work together to compromise. Look past the D or \n     R that is by your name\n\n[[Page S112]]\n\n     and look at your passport, your license and tax forms and \n     stare at the word ``America'' that is printed on them.\n       Our economy is not on the brink of collapse, but on the \n     brink of success. As I stood hear last year, banks were in \n     trouble and weren't loaning out money. The stock market was \n     plummeting and everyone was panicking. People were wondering \n     how they would make it through the next year. Now the banks \n     are stabilized and have started to give out more loans, the \n     stock market is gaining point and people are feeling more \n     comfortable about their future. With Unemployment still at \n     one of its highest levels in the past century I am looking \n     forward to working with my fellow colleagues in drafting \n     legislation that will bring jobs back into the economy. We \n     have almost recovered from this current recession. By the \n     time my term in office is complete I promise that I will \n     bring our economy out of the trouble that the previous \n     administration created for us.\n       I look forward to working and helping with the new Senate \n     and House of representatives in restoring this country to the \n     greatness it deserves.\n       Thank you, God bless you and God Bless the United States of \n     America. Thank you\n\n\n                 1Lisa Ogorzalek of Rutland High School\n\n       Dear Mr. Speaker, Vice President Biden, Members of \n     Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:\n       During the terms you all have been in office, the United \n     States has gone through many changes. Many changes have been \n     for the benefit of our economy, and many have created \n     problems for the people of America. This country has many \n     issues that need to be resolved if we want to make this \n     generation stronger than the ones that came before it. By \n     having a specific short-term goal, such as having healthcare \n     for all, and having a specific long-term goal, such as \n     reducing the national deficit, I think the young people of \n     this Nation will have the opportunity to thrive.\n       First, a short-term goal that I think would benefit America \n     right now is having healthcare for all. Many young people's \n     families in this country cannot afford healthcare, and their \n     wellness is suffering with each day. To make healthcare \n     available to all, I propose to have health insurance \n     companies share a percent of their revenue with the \n     government, based on their yearly income. With this money, \n     the government can then fund designated hospitals to provide \n     healthcare for the people who cannot afford it. This way, the \n     people who receive healthcare through their jobs can keep it, \n     and young people who are not fortunate enough to have it can \n     get it through government aid.\n       Next, a longer-term goal that would benefit America's youth \n     would be to decrease the national deficit. Our Nation's \n     budget is complex and divided into many parts, and as a \n     result of these components, we are in trillions of dollars of \n     debt. Although it would be difficult to significantly reduce \n     our debt in the next few years, there are some arrangements \n     that would help lower the amount of debt we hold. For \n     example, we could raise taxes for people who make at least \n     half a million dollars a year. This would create an increase \n     in tax revenue. If we could keep this increase steady and not \n     spend more than the rate of inflation, or Nation's debt would \n     be significantly reduced. As a result, we would be less \n     dependent on foreign countries, such as China. Since they \n     hold 11 percent of our debt, we could reduce this number to \n     let our nation's money go to other important matters, such as \n     poverty and research for illness.\n       Overall, this Nation has gone through many changes in the \n     past few decades. If we could make healthcare available to \n     all, especially young people, and reduce the national \n     deficit, then this generation has the opportunity to really \n     succeed. These changes would also help improve our economy, \n     global position, and overall wellness of the young people in \n     America.\n\n\n           Bryn Philibert, Champlain Valley Union High School\n\n       My fellow Americans,\n       This year our country has risen out of a recession that \n     threatened the economic stability of many Americans. We have \n     taken great strides to restore the hope and promise America \n     has always stood for. In 2010 we have made great progress but \n     there is still much more to do moving forward, which is why I \n     am taking this opportunity to address you. I am addressing \n     you all to call to all esteemed members of Congress to step \n     up and help me once again put the United States back on top \n     as a world leader in democracy and peace.\n       Two years after the recession devastated our people, we \n     finished this past year with an unemployment rate of 9.4 \n     percent, down 0.6 percent from the end of 2009. Consumer and \n     business confidence is on the rise and we have finally come \n     to a bipartisan agreement on new tax-cut legislation. We \n     reached a compromise to improve economic growth, help the \n     struggling middle-class families, and business development. \n     We have also made historic steps towards the promise of \n     equality for all with the repealing of the ban on open \n     homosexual service men and women in our armed forces.\n       This year's Health Care Reform Bill set forth legislation \n     to expand coverage to 32 million currently uninsured \n     Americans. Along with this, the bill allowed health care to \n     became less expensive for people to purchase and starting in \n     2014 insurance companies will no longer be able to deny \n     coverage to anyone based on pre-existing conditions. This \n     marks the turning point that great Americans, like the late \n     Senator Ted Kennedy, worked their entire lives for.\n       By August of this past year we had shrunk the number of \n     troops in Iraq to 50,000 down from 110,000 a year ago, and we \n     have ended all U.S. combat missions in Iraq. By the end of \n     2011 all American troops will be withdrawn from Iraq. There \n     is still much to be done around the world to ensure a terror \n     free future, but we have made substantial steps towards that \n     goal in the past year.\n       America has faced challenges this year such as the oil \n     spill in the Gulf. We have learned from this environmental \n     crisis and we are moving forward with new knowledge on how to \n     respond to the economic impacts of a crisis like this.\n       It is a known fact of American politics that U.S. \n     politicians rarely agree in issues across the board, but I \n     know that all of us in this room can agree that we come here \n     every day to ensure that all American people get the \n     opportunity to live in our great country. Now more than ever \n     bipartisanship is going to be imperative to the achievements \n     of the upcoming year. I urge you all, Democrats and \n     Republicans, to work together to live up to the promise of \n     America as our forefathers have.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S112-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO ANGELA GOSPODAREK AND STACEY PLUMMER\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate two \noutstanding teachers from New Hampshire.\n  Stacey Plummer and Angela Gospodarek have been chosen for the \nPresidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, \nawards that honor teachers who have made outstanding contributions to \nthe classroom and to the teaching profession. I applaud them for their \nremarkable accomplishments and dedication to New Hampshire's students.\n  Recent international test scores show that U.S. students lag behind \nstudents of other countries in math and science achievement. Our \ncountry's competitiveness in this global economy requires us to nurture \nskilled engineers and scientists. Teachers like Angela and Stacey are \ncritical to this effort because they are able to engage students and \nhelp them to develop a love for these key subjects. That is why I am \ndelighted to see them honored for their work.\n  Stacey has taught a variety of high school math classes for 16 years \nand currently teaches at Hollis Brookline High School in Hollis, NH. \nHer passion for mathematics combined with her talent for teaching \nallows her to convey to her students the beauty and precision of the \nsubject. In addition to advising the State championship math team, she \nfinds time to mentor student teachers.\n  To make science meaningful, Angela likes to provide hands-on \nclassroom experiences that allow her students to discover the wonders \nof science. She began her career as a marine scientist but soon \nrealized she had a talent for and enjoyed teaching others. The students \nat Iber Holmes Gove Middle School in Raymond, NH, are fortunate to have \nhad her as a teacher for the last 7 years.\n  The Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science \nTeaching are the most prestigious honors given to math and science \nteachers in the country. As a former teacher, it is a privilege for me \nto be able to congratulate Angela Gospodarek and Stacey Plummer for \ntheir commitment to excellence in teaching. I am extremely proud of the \npart they play in educating and training future generations of \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S112-2", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S112-S117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION DELIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION OF \n                   CONGRESS ON JANUARY 25, 2011--PM 2\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was which was ordered to lie on the table:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, distinguished \nguests, and fellow Americans:\n  Tonight I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the \n112th Congress, as well as your new Speaker, John Boehner. And as we \nmark this occasion, we are also mindful of the empty chair in this \nChamber, and pray\n\n[[Page S113]]\n\nfor the health of our colleague--and our friend--Gabby Giffords.\n  It's no secret that those of us here tonight have had our differences \nover the last 2 years. The debates have been contentious; we have \nfought fiercely for our beliefs. And that's a good thing. That's what a \nrobust democracy demands. That's what helps set us apart as a Nation.\n  But there's a reason the tragedy in Tucson gave us pause. Amid all \nthe noise and passions and rancor of our public debate, Tucson reminded \nus that no matter who we are or where we come from, each of us is a \npart of something greater--something more consequential than party or \npolitical preference.\n  We are part of the American family. We believe that in a country \nwhere every race and faith and point of view can be found, we are still \nbound together as one people; that we share common hopes and a common \ncreed; that the dreams of a little girl in Tucson are not so different \nthan those of our own children, and that they all deserve the chance to \nbe fulfilled.\n  That, too, is what sets us apart as a Nation.\n  Now, by itself, this simple recognition won't usher in a new era of \ncooperation. What comes of this moment is up to us. What comes of this \nmoment will be determined not by whether we can sit together tonight, \nbut whether we can work together tomorrow.\n  I believe we can. I believe we must. That's what the people who sent \nus here expect of us. With their votes, they've determined that \ngoverning will now be a shared responsibility between parties. New laws \nwill only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans. We will \nmove forward together, or not at all--for the challenges we face are \nbigger than party, and bigger than politics.\n  At stake right now is not who wins the next election--after all, we \njust had an election. At stake is whether new jobs and industries take \nroot in this country, or somewhere else. It's whether the hard work and \nindustry of our people is rewarded. It's whether we sustain the \nleadership that has made America not just a place on a map, but a light \nto the world.\n  We are poised for progress. Two years after the worst recession most \nof us have ever known, the stock market has come roaring back. \nCorporate profits are up. The economy is growing again.\n  But we have never measured progress by these yardsticks alone. We \nmeasure progress by the success of our people. By the jobs they can \nfind and the quality of life those jobs offer. By the prospects of a \nsmall business owner who dreams of turning a good idea into a thriving \nenterprise. By the opportunities for a better life that we pass on to \nour children.\n  That's the project the American people want us to work on. Together.\n  We did that in December. Thanks to the tax cuts we passed, Americans' \npaychecks are a little bigger today. Every business can write off the \nfull cost of the new investments they make this year. These steps, \ntaken by Democrats and Republicans, will grow the economy and add to \nthe more than one million private sector jobs created last year.\n  But we have more work to do. The steps we've taken over the last 2 \nyears may have broken the back of this recession--but to win the \nfuture, we'll need to take on challenges that have been decades in the \nmaking.\n  Many people watching tonight can probably remember a time when \nfinding a good job meant showing up at a nearby factory or a business \ndowntown. You didn't always need a degree, and your competition was \npretty much limited to your neighbors. If you worked hard, chances are \nyou'd have a job for life, with a decent paycheck, good benefits, and \nthe occasional promotion. Maybe you'd even have the pride of seeing \nyour kids work at the same company.\n  That world has changed. And for many, the change has been painful. \nI've seen it in the shuttered windows of once booming factories, and \nthe vacant storefronts of once busy Main Streets. I've heard it in the \nfrustrations of Americans who've seen their paychecks dwindle or their \njobs disappear--proud men and women who feel like the rules have been \nchanged in the middle of the game.\n  They're right. The rules have changed. In a single generation, \nrevolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work, and \ndo business. Steel mills that once needed 1,000 workers can now do the \nsame work with 100. Today, just about any company can set up shop, hire \nworkers, and sell their products wherever there's an internet \nconnection.\n  Meanwhile, nations like China and India realized that with some \nchanges of their own, they could compete in this new world. And so they \nstarted educating their children earlier and longer, with greater \nemphasis on math and science. They're investing in research and new \ntechnologies. Just recently, China became home to the world's largest \nprivate solar research facility, and the world's fastest computer.\n  So yes, the world has changed. The competition for jobs is real. But \nthis shouldn't discourage us. It should challenge us. Remember--for all \nthe hits we've taken these last few years, for all the naysayers \npredicting our decline, America still has the largest, most prosperous \neconomy in the world. No workers are more productive than ours. No \ncountry has more successful companies, or grants more patents to \ninventors and entrepreneurs. We are home to the world's best colleges \nand universities, where more students come to study than any other \nplace on Earth.\n  What's more, we are the first Nation to be founded for the sake of an \nidea--the idea that each of us deserves the chance to shape our own \ndestiny. That is why centuries of pioneers and immigrants have risked \neverything to come here. It's why our students don't just memorize \nequations, but answer questions like ``What do you think of that idea? \nWhat would you change about the world? What do you want to be when you \ngrow up?''\n  The future is ours to win. But to get there, we can't just stand \nstill. As Robert Kennedy told us, ``The future is not a gift. It is an \nachievement.'' Sustaining the American Dream has never been about \nstanding pat. It has required each generation to sacrifice, and \nstruggle, and meet the demands of a new age.\n  Now it's our turn. We know what it takes to compete for the jobs and \nindustries of our time. We need to out-innovate, out-educate, and out-\nbuild the rest of the world. We have to make America the best place on \nEarth to do business. We need to take responsibility for our deficit, \nand reform our Government. That's how our people will prosper. That's \nhow we'll win the future. And tonight, I'd like to talk about how we \nget there.\n  The first step in winning the future is encouraging American \ninnovation.\n  None of us can predict with certainty what the next big industry will \nbe, or where the new jobs will come from. Thirty years ago, we couldn't \nknow that something called the Internet would lead to an economic \nrevolution. What we can do--what America does better than anyone--is \nspark the creativity and imagination of our people. We are the Nation \nthat put cars in driveways and computers in offices; the Nation of \nEdison and the Wright brothers; of Google and Facebook. In America, \ninnovation doesn't just change our lives. It's how we make a living.\n  Our free enterprise system is what drives innovation. But because \nit's not always profitable for companies to invest in basic research, \nthroughout history our Government has provided cutting-edge scientists \nand inventors with the support that they need. That's what planted the \nseeds for the Internet. That's what helped make possible things like \ncomputer chips and GPS.\n  Just think of all the good jobs--from manufacturing to retail--that \nhave come from those breakthroughs.\n  Half a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the \nlaunch of a satellite called Sputnik, we had no idea how we'd beat them \nto the moon. The science wasn't there yet. NASA didn't even exist. But \nafter investing in better research and education, we didn't just \nsurpass the Soviets; we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new \nindustries and millions of new jobs.\n  This is our generation's Sputnik moment. Two years ago, I said that \nwe needed to reach a level of research and development we haven't seen \nsince the height of the Space Race. In a few weeks, I will be sending a \nbudget to the Congress that helps us meet that goal. We'll invest in \nbiomedical research, information technology, and especially\n\n[[Page S114]]\n\nclean energy technology--an investment that will strengthen our \nsecurity, protect our planet, and create countless new jobs for our \npeople.\n  Already, we are seeing the promise of renewable energy. Robert and \nGary Allen are brothers who run a small Michigan roofing company. After \nSeptember 11th, they volunteered their best roofers to help repair the \nPentagon. But half of their factory went unused, and the recession hit \nthem hard. Today, with the help of a Government loan, that empty space \nis being used to manufacture solar shingles that are being sold all \nacross the country. In Robert's words, ``We reinvented ourselves.''\n  That's what Americans have done for over 200 years: reinvented \nourselves. And to spur on more success stories like the Allen Brothers, \nwe've begun to reinvent our energy policy. We're not just handing out \nmoney. We're issuing a challenge. We're telling America's scientists \nand engineers that if they assemble teams of the best minds in their \nfields, and focus on the hardest problems in clean energy, we'll fund \nthe Apollo Projects of our time.\n  At the California Institute of Technology, they're developing a way \nto turn sunlight and water into fuel for our cars. At Oak Ridge \nNational Laboratory, they're using supercomputers to get a lot more \npower out of our nuclear facilities. With more research and incentives, \nwe can break our dependence on oil with biofuels, and become the first \ncountry to have 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2015.\n  We need to get behind this innovation. And to help pay for it, I'm \nasking the Congress to eliminate the billions in taxpayer dollars we \ncurrently give to oil companies. I don't know if you've noticed, but \nthey're doing just fine on their own. So instead of subsidizing \nyesterday's energy, let's invest in tomorrow.\n  Now, clean energy breakthroughs will only translate into clean energy \njobs if businesses know there will be a market for what they're \nselling. So tonight, I challenmge you to join me in setting a new goal: \nby 2035, 80 percent of America's electricity will come from clean \nenergy sources. Some folks want wind and solar. Others want nuclear, \nclean coal, and natural gas. To meet this goal, we will need them all--\nand I urge Democrats and Republicans to work together to make it \nhappen.\n\n  Maintaining our leadership in research and technology is crucial to \nAmerica's success. But if we want to win the future--if we want \ninnovation to produce jobs in America and not overseas--then we also \nhave to win the race to educate our kids.\n  Think about it. Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs \nwill require education that goes beyond a high school degree. And yet, \nas many as a quarter of our students aren't even finishing high school. \nThe quality of our math and science education lags behind many other \nnations. America has fallen to 9th in the proportion of young people \nwith a college degree. And so the question is whether all of us--as \ncitizens, and as parents--are willing to do what's necessary to give \nevery child a chance to succeed.\n  That responsibility begins not in our classrooms, but in our homes \nand communities. It's family that first instills the love of learning \nin a child. Only parents can make sure the TV is turned off and \nhomework gets done. We need to teach our kids that it's not just the \nwinner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner \nof the science fair; that success is not a function of fame or PR, but \nof hard work and discipline.\n  Our schools share this responsibility. When a child walks into a \nclassroom, it should be a place of high expectations and high \nperformance. But too many schools don't meet this test. That's why \ninstead of just pouring money into a system that's not working, we \nlaunched a competition called Race to the Top. To all 50 States, we \nsaid, ``If you show us the most innovative plans to improve teacher \nquality and student achievement, we'll show you the money.''\n  Race to the Top is the most meaningful reform of our public schools \nin a generation. For less than one percent of what we spend on \neducation each year, it has led over 40 States to raise their standards \nfor teaching and learning. These standards were developed not by \nWashington, but by Republican and Democratic governors throughout the \ncountry. And Race to the Top should be the approach we follow this year \nas we replace No Child Left Behind with a law that is more flexible and \nfocused on what's best for our kids.\n  You see, we know what's possible for our children when reform isn't \njust a top-down mandate, but the work of local teachers and principals; \nschool boards and communities.\n  Take a school like Bruce Randolph in Denver. Three years ago, it was \nrated one of the worst schools in Colorado; located on turf between two \nrival gangs. But last May, 97 percent of the seniors received their \ndiploma. Most will be the first in their family to go to college. And \nafter the first year of the school's transformation, the principal who \nmade it possible wiped away tears when a student said ``Thank you, Mrs. \nWaters, for showing . . . that we are smart and we can make it.''\n  Let's also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a \nchild's success comes from the man or woman at the front of the \nclassroom. In South Korea, teachers are known as ``nation builders.'' \nHere in America, it's time we treated the people who educate our \nchildren with the same level of respect. We want to reward good \nteachers and stop making excuses for bad ones. And over the next 10 \nyears, with so many Baby Boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want \nto prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science, technology, \nengineering, and math.\n  In fact, to every young person listening tonight who's contemplating \ntheir career choice: If you want to make a difference in the life of \nour Nation; if you want to make a difference in the life of a child--\nbecome a teacher. Your country needs you.\n  Of course, the education race doesn't end with a high school diploma. \nTo compete, higher education must be within reach of every American. \nThat's why we've ended the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that went to \nbanks, and used the savings to make college affordable for millions of \nstudents. And this year, I ask the Congress to go further, and make \npermanent our tuition tax credit--worth $10,000 for 4 years of college.\n  Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in \ntoday's fast-changing economy, we are also revitalizing America's \ncommunity colleges. Last month, I saw the promise of these schools at \nForsyth Tech in North Carolina. Many of the students there used to work \nin the surrounding factories that have since left town. One mother of \ntwo, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had worked in the furniture industry \nsince she was 18 years old. And she told me she's earning her degree in \nbiotechnology now, at 55 years old, not just because the furniture jobs \nare gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their \ndreams too. As Kathy said, ``I hope it tells them to never give up.''\n  If we take these steps--if we raise expectations for every child, and \ngive them the best possible chance at an education, from the day \nthey're born until the last job they take--we will reach the goal I set \n2 years ago: by the end of the decade, America will once again have the \nhighest proportion of college graduates in the world.\n  One last point about education. Today, there are hundreds of \nthousands of students excelling in our schools who are not American \ncitizens. Some are the children of undocumented workers, who had \nnothing to do with the actions of their parents. They grew up as \nAmericans and pledge allegiance to our flag, and yet live every day \nwith the threat of deportation. Others come here from abroad to study \nin our colleges and universities. But as soon as they obtain advanced \ndegrees, we send them back home to compete against us. It makes no \nsense.\n  Now, I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the \nissue of illegal immigration. I am prepared to work with Republicans \nand Democrats to protect our borders, enforce our laws, and address the \nmillions of undocumented workers who are now living in the shadows. I \nknow that debate will be difficult and take time. But tonight, let's \nagree to make that effort. And let's stop expelling talented, \nresponsible young people who can staff our research labs, start new \nbusinesses, and further enrich this Nation.\n  The third step in winning the future is rebuilding America. To \nattract new\n\n[[Page S115]]\n\nbusinesses to our shores, we need the fastest, most reliable ways to \nmove people, goods, and information--from high-speed rail to high-speed \nInternet.\n  Our infrastructure used to be the best--but our lead has slipped. \nSouth Korean homes now have greater internet access than we do. \nCountries in Europe and Russia invest more in their roads and railways \nthan we do. China is building faster trains and newer airports. \nMeanwhile, when our own engineers graded our Nation's infrastructure, \nthey gave us a ``D.''\n  We have to do better. America is the Nation that built the \ntranscontinental railroad, brought electricity to rural communities, \nand constructed the interstate highway system. The jobs created by \nthese projects didn't just come from laying down tracks or pavement. \nThey came from businesses that opened near a town's new train station \nor the new off-ramp.\n  Over the last 2 years, we have begun rebuilding for the 21st century, \na project that has meant thousands of good jobs for the hard-hit \nconstruction industry. Tonight, I'm proposing that we redouble these \nefforts.\n  We will put more Americans to work repairing crumbling roads and \nbridges. We will make sure this is fully paid for, attract private \ninvestment, and pick projects based on what's best for the economy, not \npoliticians.\n  Within 25 years, our goal is to give 80 percent of Americans access \nto high-speed rail, which could allow you to go places in half the time \nit takes to travel by car. For some trips, it will be faster than \nflying--without the pat-down. As we speak, routes in California and the \nMidwest are already underway.\n  Within the next 5 years, we will make it possible for business to \ndeploy the next generation of high-speed wireless coverage to 98 \npercent of all Americans. This isn't just about a faster internet and \nfewer dropped calls. It's about connecting every part of America to the \ndigital age. It's about a rural community in Iowa or Alabama where \nfarmers and small business owners will be able to sell their products \nall over the world. It's about a firefighter who can download the \ndesign of a burning building onto a handheld device; a student who can \ntake classes with a digital textbook; or a patient who can have face-\nto-face video chats with her doctor.\n  All these investments--in innovation, education, and infrastructure--\nwill make America a better place to do business and create jobs. But to \nhelp our companies compete, we also have to knock down barriers that \nstand in the way of their success.\n  Over the years, a parade of lobbyists has rigged the tax code to \nbenefit particular companies and industries. Those with accountants or \nlawyers to work the system can end up paying no taxes at all. But all \nthe rest are hit with one of the highest corporate tax rates in the \nworld. It makes no sense, and it has to change.\n  So tonight, I'm asking Democrats and Republicans to simplify the \nsystem. Get rid of the loopholes. Level the playing field. And use the \nsavings to lower the corporate tax rate for the first time in 25 \nyears--without adding to our deficit.\n  To help businesses sell more products abroad, we set a goal of \ndoubling our exports by 2014--because the more we export, the more jobs \nwe create at home. Already, our exports are up. Recently, we signed \nagreements with India and China that will support more than 250,000 \njobs in the United States. And last month, we finalized a trade \nagreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American \njobs. This agreement has unprecedented support from business and labor; \nDemocrats and Republicans, and I ask this Congress to pass it as soon \nas possible.\n  Before I took office, I made it clear that we would enforce our trade \nagreements, and that I would only sign deals that keep faith with \nAmerican workers, and promote American jobs. That's what we did with \nKorea, and that's what I intend to do as we pursue agreements with \nPanama and Colombia, and continue our Asia Pacific and global trade \ntalks.\n  To reduce barriers to growth and investment, I've ordered a review of \nGovernment regulations. When we find rules that put an unnecessary \nburden on businesses, we will fix them. But I will not hesitate to \ncreate or enforce commonsense safeguards to protect the American \npeople. That's what we've done in this country for more than a century. \nIt's why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our \nair is safe to breathe. It's why we have speed limits and child labor \nlaws. It's why last year, we put in place consumer protections against \nhidden fees and penalties by credit card companies, and new rules to \nprevent another financial crisis. And it's why we passed reform that \nfinally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting \npatients.\n  Now, I've heard rumors that a few of you have some concerns about the \nnew health care law. So let me be the first to say that anything can be \nimproved. If you have ideas about how to improve this law by making \ncare better or more affordable, I am eager to work with you. We can \nstart right now by correcting a flaw in the legislation that has placed \nan unnecessary bookkeeping burden on small businesses.\n  What I'm not willing to do is go back to the days when insurance \ncompanies could deny someone coverage because of a pre-existing \ncondition. I'm not willing to tell James Howard, a brain cancer patient \nfrom Texas, that his treatment might not be covered. I'm not willing to \ntell Jim Houser, a small business owner from Oregon, that he has to go \nback to paying $5,000 more to cover his employees. As we speak, this \nlaw is making prescription drugs cheaper for seniors and giving \nuninsured students a chance to stay on their parents' coverage. So \ninstead of re-fighting the battles of the last 2 years, let's fix what \nneeds fixing and move forward.\n  Now, the final step--a critical step--in winning the future is to \nmake sure we aren't buried under a mountain of debt.\n  We are living with a legacy of deficit spending that began almost a \ndecade ago. And in the wake of the financial crisis, some of that was \nnecessary to keep credit flowing, save jobs, and put money in people's \npockets.\n  But now that the worst of the recession is over, we have to confront \nthe fact that our Government spends more than it takes in. That is not \nsustainable. Every day, families sacrifice to live within their means. \nThey deserve a Government that does the same.\n  So tonight, I am proposing that starting this year, we freeze annual \ndomestic spending for the next 5 years. This would reduce the deficit \nby more than $400 billion over the next decade, and will bring \ndiscretionary spending to the lowest share of our economy since Dwight \nEisenhower was President.\n  This freeze will require painful cuts. Already, we have frozen the \nsalaries of hardworking Federal employees for the next 2 years. I've \nproposed cuts to things I care deeply about, like community action \nprograms. The Secretary of Defense has also agreed to cut tens of \nbillions of dollars in spending that he and his generals believe our \nmilitary can do without.\n  I recognize that some in this Chamber have already proposed deeper \ncuts, and I'm willing to eliminate whatever we can honestly afford to \ndo without. But let's make sure that we're not doing it on the backs of \nour most vulnerable citizens. And let's make sure what we're cutting is \nreally excess weight. Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in \ninnovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by \nremoving its engine. It may feel like you're flying high at first, but \nit won't take long before you'll feel the impact.\n  Now, most of the cuts and savings I've proposed only address annual \ndomestic spending, which represents a little more than 12 percent of \nour budget. To make further progress, we have to stop pretending that \ncutting this kind of spending alone will be enough. It won't.\n  The bipartisan Fiscal Commission I created last year made this \ncrystal clear. I don't agree with all their proposals, but they made \nimportant progress. And their conclusion is that the only way to tackle \nour deficit is to cut excessive spending wherever we find it--in \ndomestic spending, defense spending, health care spending, and spending \nthrough tax breaks and loopholes.\n  This means further reducing health care costs, including programs \nlike Medicare and Medicaid, which are the single biggest contributor to \nour long-\n\n[[Page S116]]\n\nterm deficit. Health insurance reform will slow these rising costs, \nwhich is part of why nonpartisan economists have said that repealing \nthe health care law would add a quarter of a trillion dollars to our \ndeficit. Still, I'm willing to look at other ideas to bring down costs, \nincluding one that Republicans suggested last year: medical malpractice \nreform to rein in frivolous lawsuits.\n  To put us on solid ground, we should also find a bipartisan solution \nto strengthen Social Security for future generations. And we must do it \nwithout putting at risk current retirees, the most vulnerable, or \npeople with disabilities; without slashing benefits for future \ngenerations; and without subjecting Americans' guaranteed retirement \nincome to the whims of the stock market.\n  And if we truly care about our deficit, we simply cannot afford a \npermanent extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of \nAmericans. Before we take money away from our schools, or scholarships \naway from our students, we should ask millionaires to give up their tax \nbreak.\n  It's not a matter of punishing their success. It's about promoting \nAmerica's success.\n  In fact, the best thing we could do on taxes for all Americans is to \nsimplify the individual tax code. This will be a tough job, but members \nof both parties have expressed interest in doing this, and I am \nprepared to join them.\n  So now is the time to act. Now is the time for both sides and both \nHouses of Congress--Democrats and Republicans--to forge a principled \ncompromise that gets the job done. If we make the hard choices now to \nrein in our deficits, we can make the investments we need to win the \nfuture.\n  Let me take this one step further. We shouldn't just give our people \na Government that's more affordable. We should give them a Government \nthat's more competent and efficient. We cannot win the future with a \nGovernment of the past.\n  We live and do business in the information age, but the last major \nreorganization of the Government happened in the age of black and white \nTV. There are 12 different agencies that deal with exports. There are \nat least five different entities that deal with housing policy. Then \nthere's my favorite example: the Interior Department is in charge of \nsalmon while they're in fresh water, but the Commerce Department \nhandles them in when they're in saltwater. And I hear it gets even more \ncomplicated once they're smoked.\n  Now, we have made great strides over the last 2 years in using \ntechnology and getting rid of waste. Veterans can now download their \nelectronic medical records with a click of the mouse. We're selling \nacres of Federal office space that hasn't been used in years, and we \nwill cut through redtape to get rid of more. But we need to think \nbigger. In the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal \nto merge, consolidate, and reorganize the Federal Government in a way \nthat best serves the goal of a more competitive America. I will submit \nthat proposal to the Congress for a vote--and we will push to get it \npassed.\n  In the coming year, we will also work to rebuild people's faith in \nthe institution of Government. Because you deserve to know exactly how \nand where your tax dollars are being spent, you will be able to go to a \nWeb site and get that information for the very first time in history. \nBecause you deserve to know when your elected officials are meeting \nwith lobbyists, I ask the Congress to do what the White House has \nalready done: put that information online. And because the American \npeople deserve to know that special interests aren't larding up \nlegislation with pet projects, both parties in Congress should know \nthis: if a bill comes to my desk with earmarks inside, I will veto it.\n  A 21st century Government that's open and competent. A Government \nthat lives within its means. An economy that's driven by new skills and \nideas. Our success in this new and changing world will require reform, \nresponsibility, and innovation. It will also require us to approach \nthat world with a new level of engagement in our foreign affairs.\n  Just as jobs and businesses can now race across borders, so can new \nthreats and new challenges. No single wall separates East and West; no \none rival superpower is aligned against us.\n  And so we must defeat determined enemies wherever they are, and build \ncoalitions that cut across lines of region and race and religion. \nAmerica's moral example must always shine for all who yearn for \nfreedom, justice, and dignity. And because we have begun this work, \ntonight we can say that American leadership has been renewed and \nAmerica's standing has been restored.\n  Look to Iraq, where nearly 100,000 of our brave men and women have \nleft with their heads held high; where American combat patrols have \nended; violence has come down; and a new government has been formed. \nThis year, our civilians will forge a lasting partnership with the \nIraqi people, while we finish the job of bringing our troops out of \nIraq. America's commitment has been kept; the Iraq War is coming to an \nend.\n  Of course, as we speak, al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to \nplan attacks against us. Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement \nprofessionals, we are disrupting plots and securing our cities and \nskies. And as extremists try to inspire acts of violence within our \nborders, we are responding with the strength of our communities, with \nrespect for the rule of law, and with the conviction that American \nMuslims are a part of our American family.\n  We have also taken the fight to al Qaeda and their allies abroad. In \nAfghanistan, our troops have taken Taliban strongholds and trained \nAfghan Security Forces. Our purpose is clear--by preventing the Taliban \nfrom reestablishing a stranglehold over the Afghan people, we will deny \nal Qaeda the safe-haven that served as a launching pad for 9/11.\n  Thanks to our heroic troops and civilians, fewer Afghans are under \nthe control of the insurgency. There will be tough fighting ahead, and \nthe Afghan government will need to deliver better governance. But we \nare strengthening the capacity of the Afghan people and building an \nenduring partnership with them. This year, we will work with nearly 50 \ncountries to begin a transition to an Afghan lead. And this July, we \nwill begin to bring our troops home.\n  In Pakistan, al Qaeda's leadership is under more pressure than at any \npoint since 2001. Their leaders and operatives are being removed from \nthe battlefield. Their safe-havens are shrinking. And we have sent a \nmessage from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of \nthe globe: we will not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat \nyou.\n  American leadership can also be seen in the effort to secure the \nworst weapons of war. Because Republicans and Democrats approved the \nNew START Treaty, far fewer nuclear weapons and launchers will be \ndeployed. Because we rallied the world, nuclear materials are being \nlocked down on every continent so they never fall into the hands of \nterrorists.\n  Because of a diplomatic effort to insist that Iran meet its \nobligations, the Iranian government now faces tougher and tighter \nsanctions than ever before. And on the Korean peninsula, we stand with \nour ally South Korea, and insist that North Korea keeps its commitment \nto abandon nuclear weapons.\n  This is just a part of how we are shaping a world that favors peace \nand prosperity. With our European allies, we revitalized NATO, and \nincreased our cooperation on everything from counter-terrorism to \nmissile defense. We have reset our relationship with Russia, \nstrengthened Asian alliances, and built new partnerships with nations \nlike India. This March, I will travel to Brazil, Chile, and El Salvador \nto forge new alliances for progress in the Americas. Around the globe, \nwe are standing with those who take responsibility--helping farmers \ngrow more food; supporting doctors who care for the sick; and combating \nthe corruption that can rot a society and rob people of opportunity.\n  Recent events have shown us that what sets us apart must not just be \nour power--it must be the purpose behind it. In South Sudan--with our \nassistance--the people were finally able to vote for independence after \nyears of war. Thousands lined up before dawn. People danced in the \nstreets. One man who lost four of his brothers at war summed up the \nscene around him: ``This was a battlefield for most of my life. Now we \nwant to be free.''\n\n[[Page S117]]\n\n  We saw that same desire to be free in Tunisia, where the will of the \npeople proved more powerful than the writ of a dictator. And tonight, \nlet us be clear: the United States of America stands with the people of \nTunisia, and supports the democratic aspirations of all people.\n  We must never forget that the things we've struggled for, and fought \nfor, live in the hearts of people everywhere. And we must always \nremember that the Americans who have borne the greatest burden in this \nstruggle are the men and women who serve our country.\n  Tonight, let us speak with one voice in reaffirming that our Nation \nis united in support of our troops and their families. Let us serve \nthem as well as they have served us--by giving them the equipment they \nneed; by providing them with the care and benefits they have earned; \nand by enlisting our veterans in the great task of building our own \nNation.\n  Our troops come from every corner of this country--they are black, \nwhite, Latino, Asian, and Native American. They are Christian and \nHindu, Jewish and Muslim. And, yes, we know that some of them are gay. \nStarting this year, no American will be forbidden from serving the \ncountry they love because of who they love. And with that change, I \ncall on all of our college campuses to open their doors to our military \nrecruiters and the ROTC. It is time to leave behind the divisive \nbattles of the past. It is time to move forward as one Nation.\n  We should have no illusions about the work ahead of us. Reforming our \nschools; changing the way we use energy; reducing our deficit--none of \nthis is easy. All of it will take time. And it will be harder because \nwe will argue about everything. The cost. The details. The letter of \nevery law.\n  Of course, some countries don't have this problem. If the central \ngovernment wants a railroad, they get a railroad--no matter how many \nhomes are bulldozed. If they don't want a bad story in the newspaper, \nit doesn't get written.\n  And yet, as contentious and frustrating and messy as our democracy \ncan sometimes be, I know there isn't a person here who would trade \nplaces with any other Nation on Earth.\n  We may have differences in policy, but we all believe in the rights \nenshrined in our Constitution. We may have different opinions, but we \nbelieve in the same promise that says this is a place where you can \nmake it if you try. We may have different backgrounds, but we believe \nin the same dream that says this is a country where anything's \npossible. No matter who you are. No matter where you come from.\n  That dream is why I can stand here before you tonight. That dream is \nwhy a working class kid from Scranton can stand behind me. That dream \nis why someone who began by sweeping the floors of his father's \nCincinnati bar can preside as Speaker of the House in the greatest \nNation on Earth.\n  That dream--that American Dream--is what drove the Allen Brothers to \nreinvent their roofing company for a new era. It's what drove those \nstudents at Forsyth Tech to learn a new skill and work towards the \nfuture. And that dream is the story of a small business owner named \nBrandon Fisher.\n  Brandon started a company in Berlin, Pennsylvania, that specializes \nin a new kind of drilling technology. One day last summer, he saw the \nnews that halfway across the world, 33 men were trapped in a Chilean \nmine, and no one knew how to save them.\n  But Brandon thought his company could help. And so he designed a \nrescue that would come to be known as Plan B. His employees worked \naround the clock to manufacture the necessary drilling equipment. And \nBrandon left for Chile.\n  Along with others, he began drilling a 2,000 foot hole into the \nground, working 3 or 4 days at a time with no sleep. Thirty-seven days \nlater, Plan B succeeded, and the miners were rescued. But because he \ndidn't want all of the attention, Brandon wasn't there when the miners \nemerged. He had already gone home, back to work on this next project.\n  Later, one of his employees said of the rescue, ``We proved that \nCenter Rock is a little company, but we do big things.''\n  We do big things.\n  From the earliest days of our founding, America has been the story of \nordinary people who dare to dream. That's how we win the future.\n  We are a Nation that says, ``I might not have a lot of money, but I \nhave this great idea for a new company. I might not come from a family \nof college graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree. I might \nnot know those people in trouble, but I think I can help them, and I \nneed to try.\n  ``I'm not sure how we'll reach that better place beyond the horizon, \nbut I know we'll get there. I know we will.''\n  We do big things.\n  The idea of America endures. Our destiny remains our choice. And \ntonight, more than two centuries later, it is because of our people \nthat our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of \nour Union is strong.\n  Thank you, God Bless You, and may God Bless the United States of \nAmerica.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, January 25, 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S117-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING RECESS\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on January 6, 2011, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives, \nannouncing that the House has agreed to the following concurrent \nresolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

A bill to provide permanent tax relief from the marriage \npenalty; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \nprovide permanent tax relief from the marriage penalty--the most \negregious, anti-family provision in the tax code. One of my highest \npriorities in the United States Senate has been to relieve American \ntaxpayers of this punitive burden.\n  We have made important strides to eliminate this unfair tax and \nprovide marriage penalty relief by raising the standard deduction and \nenlarging the 15 percent tax bracket for married joint filers to twice \nthat of single filers. Before these provisions were changed, 42 percent \nof married couples paid an average penalty of $1,400.\n  Enacting marriage penalty relief was a giant step for tax fairness, \nbut it may be fleeting. Even as married couples use the money they now \nsave to put food on the table and clothes on their children, a tax \nincrease looms in the future. While I am pleased that relief from the \nmarriage penalty was included in the recent agreement to extend the \nbroader tax relief for all Americans, the marriage penalty provisions \nwill only be in effect through 2012. In 2013, marriage will again be a \ntaxable event and a significant number of married couples will again \npay more in taxes unless we act decisively. Given the challenges many \nfamilies face in making ends meet, we must make sure we do not \nbacktrack on this important reform.\n  The benefits of marriage are well established, yet, without marriage \npenalty relief, the tax code provides a significant disincentive for \npeople to walk down the aisle. Marriage is a fundamental institution in \nour society and should not be discouraged by the IRS. Children living \nin a married household are far less likely to live in poverty or to \nsuffer from child abuse. Research indicates these children are also \nless likely to be depressed or have developmental problems. Scourges \nsuch as adolescent drug use are less common in married families, and \nmarried mothers are less likely to be victims of domestic violence.\n  We should celebrate marriage, not penalize it. The bill I am offering \nwould make marriage penalty relief permanent, because marriage should \nnot be a taxable event. I welcome and appreciate the support of \nSenators Ensign, Johanns, Cornyn, and Vitter, who have signed on as \ncosponsors, and I call on the Senate to finish the job we started and \nmake marriage penalty relief permanent today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 11\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cyber Security and American \n     Cyber Competitiveness Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Malicious state, terrorist, and criminal actors \n     exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications \n     networks and gaps in cyber security pose one of the most \n     serious and rapidly growing threats to both the national \n     security and economy of the United States.\n       (2) With information technology now the backbone of the \n     United States economy, a critical element of United States \n     national security infrastructure and defense systems, the \n     primary foundation of global communications, and a key \n     enabler of most critical infrastructure, nearly every single \n     American citizen is touched by cyberspace and is threatened \n     by cyber attacks.\n       (3) Malicious actors in cyberspace have already caused \n     significant damage to the United States Government, the \n     United States economy, and United States citizens: United \n     States Government computer networks are probed millions of \n     times each day; approximately 9,000,000 Americans have their \n     identities stolen each year; cyber crime costs American \n     businesses with 500 or more employees an average of \n     $3,800,000 per year; and intellectual property worth over \n     $1,000,000,000,000 has already been stolen from American \n     businesses.\n       (4) In its 2009 Cyberspace Policy Review, the White House \n     concluded, ``Ensuring that cyberspace is sufficiently \n     resilient and trustworthy to support United States goals of \n     economic growth, civil liberties and privacy protections, \n     national security, and the continued advancement of \n     democratic institutions requires making cybersecurity a \n     national priority.''\n       (5) An effective solution to the tremendous challenges of \n     cyber security demands cooperation and integration of effort \n     across jurisdictions of multiple Federal, State, local, and \n     tribal government agencies, between the government and the \n     private sector, and with international allies, as well as \n     increased public awareness and preparedness among the \n     American people.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress should enact, and \n     the President should sign, bipartisan legislation to secure \n     the United States against cyber attack, to enhance American \n     competitiveness and create jobs in the information technology \n     industry, and to protect the identities and sensitive \n     information of American citizens and businesses by--\n       (1) enhancing the security and resiliency of United States \n     Government communications and information networks against \n     cyber attack by nation-states, terrorists, and cyber \n     criminals;\n       (2) incentivizing the private sector to quantify, assess, \n     and mitigate cyber risks to their communications and \n     information networks;\n       (3) promoting investments in the American information \n     technology sector that create and maintain good, well-paying \n     jobs in the United States and help to enhance American \n     economic competitiveness;\n       (4) improving the capability of the United States \n     Government to assess cyber risks and prevent, detect, and \n     robustly respond to cyber attacks against the government and \n     the military;\n       (5) improving the capability of the United States \n     Government and the private sector to assess cyber risk and \n     prevent, detect, and robustly respond to cyber attacks \n     against United States critical infrastructure;\n       (6) preventing and mitigating identity theft and guarding \n     against abuses or breaches of personally identifiable \n     information;\n       (7) enhancing United States diplomatic capacity and \n     international cooperation to respond to emerging cyber \n     threats, including promoting security and freedom of access \n     for communications and information networks around the world \n     and battling global cyber crime through focused diplomacy;\n       (8) protecting and increasing the resiliency of United \n     States' critical infrastructure and assets, including the \n     electric grid, military assets, the financial sector, and \n     telecommunications networks against cyber attacks and other \n     threats and vulnerabilities;\n       (9) expanding tools and resources for investigating and \n     prosecuting cyber crimes in an manner that respects privacy \n     rights and civil liberties and promotes American innovation; \n     and\n       (10) maintaining robust protections of the privacy of \n     American citizens and their on-line activities and \n     communications.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Grassley, Ms. \n        Klobuchar, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Coons):\n  S. 23. A bill to amend title 35, United States Code, to provide for \npatent reform; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the United States of America has long been \nthe world leader in invention and innovation. That leadership has \npropelled our economic growth, but we cannot\n\n[[Page S131]]\n\nremain complacent while expecting to stay on top.\n  A Newsweek study last year found that only 41 percent of Americans \nbelieve that the United States is staying ahead of China on innovation. \nA Thompson Reuters analysis has already predicted that China will \noutpace the United States in patent filings this year. China, in fact, \nhas a specific plan not just to overtake the United States this year in \npatent applications, but to more than quadruple its patent filings over \nthe next 5 years.\n  That is astonishing, until considering that China has been \nmodernizing its patent laws and promoting innovation while the United \nStates has failed to keep pace. It has now been nearly 60 years since \nCongress last acted to reform American patent law. We can no longer \nwait.\n  Today, I am reintroducing bipartisan patent reform legislation that \nis the culmination of three Congresses worth of bipartisan, bicameral \nwork, including eight hearings in the Senate alone. The Patent Reform \nAct of 2011 is structured on legislation first introduced in the House \nby Chairman Smith and Mr. Berman in 2005. The legislation will \naccomplish three important goals, which have been at the center of the \npatent reform debate: improve the application process by transitioning \nto a first-inventor-to-file system; improve the quality of patents \nissued by the USPTO by introducing several quality-enhancement \nmeasures; and provide more certainty in litigation.\n  In many areas that were highly contentious when the patent reform \ndebate began, the courts have stepped in to act. Their decisions \nreflect the concerns heard in Congress that questionable patents are \ntoo easily obtained and too difficult to challenge. The courts have \nmoved the law in a generally positive direction, more closely aligned \nwith the text of the statutes.\n  Most recently, the Federal Circuit aggressively moved to constrain \nrun-away damage awards, which has plagued the patent system by basing \nawards on unreliable numbers, untethered to the reality of licensing \ndecisions. As the court continues to move in the right direction, it is \nmore apparent than ever that the gatekeeper compromise on damages we \nhave worked to reach with Senator Feinstein and others is what is \nneeded to ensure an award of a reasonable royalty is not artificially \ninflated or based on irrelevant factors.\n  The courts have addressed issues where they can, but in some areas, \nonly Congress can take the necessary steps. The Patent Reform Act will \nboth speed the application process and, at the same time, improve \npatent quality. It will provide the USPTO with the resources it needs \nto work through its application backlog, while also providing for \ngreater input from third parties to improve the quality of patents \nissued and that remain in effect.\n  High quality patents are the key to our economic growth. They benefit \nboth patent owners and users, who can be more confident in the validity \nof issued patents. Patents of low quality and dubious validity, by \ncontrast, enable patent trolls and constitute a drag on innovation. Too \nmany dubious patents also unjustly cast doubt on truly high quality \npatents.\n  The Patent Reform Act provides the tools the USPTO needs to separate \nthe inventive wheat from the chaff. It will allow our inventors and \ninnovators to flourish. The Department of Commerce recently issued a \nreport indicating that these reforms will create jobs without adding to \nthe deficit. The Obama administration supports these efforts, as do \nindustries and stakeholders from all sectors of the patent community. \nCongressional action can no longer be delayed.\n  Innovation and economic development are not uniquely Democrat or \nRepublican objectives, so we worked together to find the proper balance \nfor America--for our economy, for our inventors, for our consumers.\n  Thomas Freidman wrote not too long ago in The New York Times that the \ncountry which ``endows its people with more tools and basic research to \ninvent new goods and services [] is the one that will not just survive \nbut thrive down the road. . . . We might be able to stimulate our way \nback to stability, but we can only invent our way back to prosperity.''\n  Reforming our patent system will stimulate the American economy \nthrough structural changes, rather than taxpayer dollars. I look \nforward to working with all Senators and our counterparts in the House, \nwho have also made this a bipartisan priority, to ensure that this is \nthe year we make our patent system reward inventors and provide \ncertainty to users.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 23\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to express support for the Patent \nReform Act of 2011, S. 23, introduced today by Senate Judiciary \nCommittee Chairman Patrick Leahy. Senator Leahy and I, along with a \nnumber of our colleagues, have worked for years to enact much-needed \nreform to our Nation's patent system.\n  Last Congress, the Managers' Amendment to the Patent Reform Act of \n2009, S. 515, enjoyed strong bipartisan support for Senate floor \nconsideration and passage; the momentum undoubtedly will continue under \nthe leadership of Judiciary Committee Chairman Leahy and Ranking \nMinority Member Charles Grassley. Similarly, House Judiciary Committee \nChairman Lamar Smith and Ranking Minority Member John Conyers are true \npartners in this important legislation. They share the same desire to \nstreamline our patent system in a way that will improve the clarity and \nquality of patents issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, \nUSPTO, which in return will provide greater confidence in their \nvalidity and enforcement.\n  I have said this before, but it bears repeating: we must ensure that \nour patent system is as strong and vibrant as possible, not only to \nprotect our country's premier position as the world leader in \ninnovation, but also to secure our economic future. Patents encourage \ntechnological advancement by providing incentives to invent, invest in, \nand disclose new technology. Now, more than ever, it is important to \nensure efficiency and increased quality in the issuance of patents. \nThis in turn will create an environment that fosters entrepreneurship \nand the creation of new jobs.\n  One single deployed patent has positive effects across almost all \nsectors of our economy. As a result, properly examined patents, \npromptly issued by the USPTO, creates jobs--jobs that are dedicated to \ndeveloping and producing new products and services. Unfortunately, the \ncurrent USPTO backlog of applications now exceeds 700,000 applications. \nThe sheer volume of patent applications not only reflects the vibrant, \ninnovative spirit that has made America a world-wide leader in science, \nengineering, and technology, but also represents dynamic economic \ngrowth waiting to be unleashed.\n  If enacted, the Patent Reform Act of 2011 would move the United \nStates to a first-inventor-to-file system, which will bring greater \nharmony and improve our competiveness. Also, among other things, the \nbill would improve the system for administratively challenging the \nvalidity of a patent at the USPTO; improve patent quality; create a \nsupplemental examination process for patent owners; prevent patents \nfrom being issued on claims for tax strategies; and provide fee-setting \nauthority for the USPTO Director to ensure the Office is properly \nfunded.\n  This bipartisan bill also contains provisions on venue; changes to \nthe best mode; increased incentives for government laboratories to \ncommercialize inventions; restrictions on false marking claims, and \nremoves restrictions on the residency of Federal Circuit judges.\n  We have been working on this legislation since 2006. Reforming our \npatent system is a critical priority whose time has more than come. It \nis essential to growing our economy, creating jobs and promoting \ninnovation in our Nation. I encourage my colleagues to join in this \neffort and help move this important legislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Mr. Kirk, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 25.

A bill to prohibit brand name drug companies from compensating \ngeneric drug companies to delay the entry of a generic drug into the \nmarket; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to introduce the Preserve Access \nto Affordable Generics Act. This bipartisan legislation will \ndramatically reduce prescription drug costs by preventing one of the \nmost egregious, anti-consumer tactics ever devised to keep generic \ndrugs off the market.\n  This amendment would combat ``pay-for-delay'' agreements between \nbrand name and generic drug companies which delay entry of low-cost \ngeneric competition. These pay-for-delay agreements are estimated by \nthe FTC to cost consumers $3.5 billion each year, and are estimated by \nthe CBO estimates to cost the federal government more than $2.8 billion \nover the next decade in higher drug reimbursement payments.\n  In 2008, $235 billion were spent on prescription drugs in the United \nStates. Generic drugs play a crucial role in containing rising \nprescription drug costs, by offering consumers therapeutically \nidentical alternatives to brand-name drugs, at a significantly reduced \ncost. Studies have shown that generic competition to brand name drugs \ncan reduce drug prices by as much as 80 percent. However, in recent \nyears generic entry has frequently been blocked by anti-competitive, \nanti-consumer agreements between brand-name and generic drug \nmanufacturers that limit, delay, or otherwise prevent competition from \ngeneric drugs.\n  In pay-for-delay agreements, a brand-name drug manufacturer settles \npatent litigation by paying off a generic competitor with large amounts \nof cash, or other valuable consideration to stay off the market until \nexpiration--or a time close to expiration--of the brand-name patent. \nFor example, in 2006, the CEO of Cephalon, which makes the sleep \ndisorder pill Provigil, praised the deals his company made with four \ngeneric drug-makers to keep generic versions of Provigil off the market \nuntil 2012. ``We were able to get six more years of patent \nprotection,'' he said. ``That's $4 billion in sales that no one \nexpected.'' Unfortunately, that $4 billion came from the pockets of \nAmerican consumers.\n  At their core, pay-for-delay agreements permit brand-name drug \ncompanies to pay off competitors not to compete. The brand name drug \ncompany wins because it reaps the profits from eliminating competition. \nThe generic drug company wins because they get paid millions of dollars \nto do nothing more than drop their patent challenge. But consumers and \nthe American taxpayer loses, to the tune of billions of dollars in \nhigher drug costs every year.\n  Agreements between competitors, like these, are the most nefarious \ntype of antitrust violation. Unfortunately, when the FTC has challenged \n``pay-for-delay'' agreements, courts have favored big industry \ninterests over consumers. Courts have wrongly concluded that this type \nof basic antitrust violation is immune from antitrust law because it \ninvolves the settlement of a patent challenge. In other words, it is \npermissible for competitors to collude to when it involves a patented \ndrug and in order to keep lower cost drugs out of consumers' medicine \ncabinets. These misguided court rulings are what make passage of our \nlegislation so vital.\n\n[[Page S144]]\n\n  For years, we have seen the use of anticompetitive agreements \nincrease. From 2000 to 2004, there were twenty settlements of drug \npatent litigation, but we saw no pay-for-delay agreements because drug \ncompanies assumed they violated antitrust law. But, these settlements \nbecame all too prevalent following three courts of appeals decisions in \n2005 which effectively found them to be per se legal and prevented the \nFTC from taking action on behalf of consumers against these \nsettlements.\n  In the 2 years following these 2005 court decisions, 28 out of 61 \npatent settlements had provisions in which the brand name drug company \nmade payments to the generic manufacturer in exchange for the generic \nmanufacturer agreeing to delay entry of generic competition. Clearly, \npay-for-delay agreements are not necessary to settle a case because \nduring that same time, 33 cases settled without delaying entry to \nconsumers in exchange for a payment.\n  Last fall, the FTC released a report which found a record 19 pay-for-\ndelay settlements in fiscal year 2009, the highest ever recorded in a \nsingle year. This report convincingly demonstrates the danger these \ndeals pose to consumers. Each of these deals will lead to higher drug \ncosts for millions of consumers. Each of these deals cost the Federal \nGovernment large sums in taxpayer money in higher drug reimbursement \ncosts. Each of these deals deprive consumers of needed drug \ncompetition. The time for action to stop these anti-consumer, \nanticompetitive back room deals is now.\n  Our legislation passed the Judiciary Committee last Congress with a \nstrong bipartisan majority. The Judiciary Committee made several \nchanges to the legislation as it is was introduced in the 111th \nCongress, and the legislation I am introducing today includes all of \nthese changes. I believe the current version of this legislation \nrepresents a well balanced approach to this problem. Under my bill, \nthese settlement agreements will be presumed to be illegal. However, \nthe FTC will need to pursue legal action prior to these agreements \nbeing found illegal, and the drug companies will have an opportunity to \nconvince the Judge why these agreement are not in fact anticompetitive. \nIf found illegal, the FTC will have the authority to assess civil \npenalties up to three times the profits gained by the drug companies.\n  I believe this measure strikes the right balance. By presuming these \nagreements to be illegal, and armed with strong civil penalties, this \nbill will deter drug companies from entering into anti-competitive and \nanti-consumer ``pay-for-delay'' settlements in the first place. By \ngiving the drug companies a hearing before a neutral tribunal, the drug \ncompanies will have their day in court to go forward with those \nagreements which truly do not harm competition.\n  The evidence is clear. These ``pay-for-delay'' agreements between \nbrand name and generic drug companies deny consumers the benefits of \ngeneric drug competition and costs consumers and the Federal Government \nbillions of dollars. My legislation will give the FTC strong remedies \nto prevent these agreements when it concludes they harm competition. \nMillions and millions of Americans that struggle to pay their \nprescription drug costs and who need low priced generic alternatives \nare awaiting action on this amendment. I urge my colleagues support for \nthe Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 27\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Preserve Access to \n     Affordable Generics Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \n     Restoration Act (Public Law 98-417) (referred to in this Act \n     as the ``1984 Act''), was enacted with the intent of \n     facilitating the early entry of generic drugs while \n     preserving incentives for innovation.\n       (2) Prescription drugs make up 10 percent of the national \n     health care spending but for the past decade have been one of \n     the fastest growing segments of health care expenditures.\n       (3) Until recently, the 1984 Act was successful in \n     facilitating generic competition to the benefit of consumers \n     and health care payers - although 67 percent of all \n     prescriptions dispensed in the United States are generic \n     drugs, they account for only 20 percent of all expenditures.\n       (4) Generic drugs cost substantially less than brand name \n     drugs, with discounts off the brand price sometimes exceeding \n     90 percent.\n       (5) Federal dollars currently account for an estimated 30 \n     percent of the $235,000,000,000 spent on prescription drugs \n     in 2008, and this share is expected to rise to 40 percent by \n     2018.\n       (6)(A) In recent years, the intent of the 1984 Act has been \n     subverted by certain settlement agreements between brand \n     companies and their potential generic competitors that make \n     ``reverse payments'' which are payments by the brand company \n     to the generic company.\n       (B) These settlement agreements have unduly delayed the \n     marketing of low-cost generic drugs contrary to free \n     competition, the interests of consumers, and the principles \n     underlying antitrust law.\n       (C) Because of the price disparity between brand name and \n     generic drugs, such agreements are more profitable for both \n     the brand and generic manufacturers than competition, and \n     will become increasingly common unless prohibited.\n       (D) These agreements result in consumers losing the \n     benefits that the 1984 Act was intended to provide.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical market by \n     stopping anticompetitive agreements between brand name and \n     generic drug manufacturers that limit, delay, or otherwise \n     prevent competition from generic drugs; and\n       (2) to support the purpose and intent of antitrust law by \n     prohibiting anticompetitive practices in the pharmaceutical \n     industry that harm consumers.\n\n     SEC. 3. UNLAWFUL COMPENSATION FOR DELAY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Federal Trade Commission Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 44 et seq.) is amended by--\n       (1) redesignating section 28 as section 29; and\n       (2) inserting before section 29, as redesignated, the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 28.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide \npublic safety providers an additional 10 megahertz of spectrum to \nsupport a national, interoperable wireless broadband network and \nauthorize the Federal Communications Commission to hold incentive \nauctions to provide funding to support such a network, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the \nPublic Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act.\n  Radio spectrum is a tremendous resource. It can grow our economy and \nput innovative wireless services in the hands of consumers and \nbusinesses. It also can enhance our public safety by fostering \ncommunications between first responders when the unthinkable occurs. \nBut it is also scarce. That is why we need a forward-thinking spectrum \npolicy that promotes smart use of our airwaves--and provides public \nsafety officials with the wireless resources they need to keep us safe.\n  For all of these reasons, I believe in the Public Safety Spectrum and \nWireless Innovation Act and call on my colleagues to join me and \nsupport it. I commit to them that I am open to their input and will \nwork tirelessly with the administration, my Senate and House \ncolleagues, and public safety officials to pass this legislation this \nyear.\n  The Public Safety Spectrum and Wireless Innovation Act does two \nthings.\n  First, as we approach the tenth anniversary of 9/11, this legislation \nwill provide public safety officials with an additional 10 megahertz of \nspectrum known as the ``D-block.'' This spectrum will at long last, \nsupport a national, interoperable, wireless broadband network that will \nhelp first responders protect us from harm. I believe this is the right \nthing to do, because we owe those courageous individuals who wear the \nshield the resources they need to do their job.\n  Second, this legislation will promote smart spectrum policy and \nefficient use of our Nation's wireless airwaves. It will do this by \nproviding the Federal Communications Commission with the authority to \nhold voluntary incentive auctions. These auctions will help put \nvaluable spectrum into the hands of companies that can create \ninnovative new services for American consumers and businesses. This \nproposal will not require the return of spectrum from existing \ncommercial users, but instead will provide them with a voluntary \nopportunity to realize a portion of auction revenues if they wish to \nfacilitate putting spectrum to new and productive uses. Then the \nremaining revenues from these auctions will provide a revenue stream to \nassist public safety with the construction and maintenance of their \nspectrum network.\n  Marrying together these ideas--good spectrum policy and the right \nresources for our first responders--makes good sense. It is also the \nright thing to do. Because the American people deserve to have the best \nand most innovative uses of wireless networks anywhere. They deserve to \nknow our first responders have access to the airwaves they need when \ntragedy strikes.

A bill to establish the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National \nHeritage Area; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nBoxer to introduce legislation to establish a National Heritage Area in \nthe California Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This legislation will \ncreate the first Heritage Area in California.\n  I am pleased that I have had the opportunity to work with Senator \nBoxer, Representative John Garamendi, and the County Supervisors from \nthe 5 Delta Counties to prepare this legislation and support their \nefforts to fully partner with the State, the Federal agencies, and \nother local governments to improve and care for the Delta.\n  This bill will establish the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as a \nNational Heritage Area.\n  The Delta Protection Commission, created by California law and \nresponsible to the citizens of the Delta and California, will manage \nthe Heritage Area. It will ensure an open and public process, working \nwith all levels of federal, state, and local government, tribes, local \nstakeholders, and private property owners as it develops and implements \nthe management plan for the Heritage Area. The goal is to conserve and \nprotect the Delta, its communities, its resources, and its history.\n  It is also important to understand what this legislation will not do. \nIt will not affect water rights. It will not affect water contracts. It \nwill not affect private property.\n  Nothing in this bill gives any governmental agency any more \nregulatory power than it already has, nor does it take away regulatory \nfrom agencies that have it.\n  In short, this bill does not affect water rights or water contracts, \nnor does is impose any additional responsibilities on local government \nor residents. Instead, it authorizes Federal assistance to a local \nprocess already required by State law that will elevate the Delta, \nproviding a means to conserve and protect its valued communities, \nresources, and history.\n  The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is the largest estuary on the West \nCoast. It is the most extensive inland delta in the world, and a unique \nnational treasure.\n  Today, it is a labyrinth of sloughs, wetlands, and deepwater channels \nthat connect the waters of the high Sierra mountain streams to the \nPacific Ocean through the San Francisco Bay. Its approximately 60 \nislands are protected by 1,100 miles of levees, and are home to \n3,500,000 residents, including 2,500 family farmers. The Delta and its \nfarmers produce some of the highest quality specialty crops in the \nUnited States.\n  The Delta offers recreational opportunities to the two million \nCalifornians who visit the Delta each year for boating, fishing, \nhunting, visiting historic sites, and viewing wildlife. It provides \nhabitat for more than 750 species of plants and wildlife. These include \nsand hill cranes that migrate to the Delta wetland from places as far \naway as Siberia. The Delta also provides habitat for 55 species of \nfish, including Chinook salmon--some as large as 60 pounds--that return \neach year to travel through the Delta to spawn in the tributaries.\n  These same waterways also channel fresh water to the Federal and \nState-owned pumps in the South Delta that provide water to 23 million \nCalifornians and 3 million acres of irrigated agricultural land \nelsewhere in the state.\n  Before the Delta was reclaimed for farmland in the 19th Century, the \nDelta flooded regularly with snow melt each spring, and provided the \nrich environment that, by 1492, supported the largest settlement of \nNative Americans in North America.\n  The Delta was the gateway to the gold fields in 1849, after which \nChinese workers built hundreds of miles of levees throughout the \nwaterways of the Delta to make its rich peat soils available for \nfarming and to control flooding.\n  Japanese, Italians, German, Portuguese, Dutch, Greeks, South Asians, \nand other immigrants began the farming legacy, and developed \ntechnologies specifically adapted to the unique environment, including \nthe Caterpillar Tractor, which later contributed to agriculture and \ntransportation internationally.\n  Delta communities created a river culture befitting their dependence \non water transport, a culture which has attracted the attention of \nauthors from Mark Twain and Jack London to Joan Didion.\n  The Delta is in crisis due to many factors, including invasive \nspecies, urban and agricultural run-off, wastewater discharges, \nchannelization, dredging, water export operations, and other stressors.\n  Many of the islands of the Delta are between 10 and 20 feet below sea \nlevel, and the levee system is presently inadequate to provide reliable \nflood protection for historic communities, significant habitats, \nagricultural enterprises, water resources, transportation and other \ninfrastructure.\n  Existing levees have not been engineered to withstand earthquakes. \nShould levees fail for any reason, a rush of seawater into the interior \nof the Delta could damage the already fragile ecosystem, contaminate \ndrinking water for many Californians, flood agricultural land, inundate \ntowns, and damage roads, power lines, and water project infrastructure.\n  The State of California has been working for decades on a resolution \nto the water supply and ecosystem crisis in the State, and has a long \nhistory of partnerships with Federal agencies, working together to \nresolve challenges to the Delta's historic communities, ecosystem and \nthe water it supplies so many Californians.\n  The Delta Protection Commission, established under state law, has \nbeen tasked by the California State Legislature with providing a forum \nfor Delta residents to engage in decisions regarding actions to \nrecognize and enhance the unique cultural, recreational, agricultural \nresources, infrastructure and legacy communities of the Delta and to \nserve as the facilitating agency for the implementation of a National \nHeritage Area in the Delta.\n  This legislation will complement the broadly supported State Water \nLegislation of 2009, which called for a Heritage designation for the \nDelta.\n  This legislation authorizes the creation of the Delta Heritage Area \nand federal assistance to the Delta Protection Commission in \nimplementing the Area. This legislation is just a small part of the \ncommitment the Federal government must make to the Delta. I look \nforward to continuing to work with my colleagues at every level of\n\n[[Page S150]]\n\ngovernment to restore and sustain the ecosystem in the Delta, to \nprovide for reliable water supply in the State of California, to \nrecover the native species of the Delta, protect communities in the \nDelta from flood risk, ensure economic sustainability in the Delta, \nimprove water quality in the Delta, and; sustain the unique cultural, \nhistorical, recreational, agricultural and economic values of the \nDelta.\n  The National Heritage Area designation for the Sacramento-San Joaquin \nDelta will help local governments develop and implement a plan for a \nsustainable future by providing Federal recognition, technical \nassistance and small amounts of funding to a community-based process \nalready underway.\n  Through the Delta Heritage Area, local communities and citizens will \npartner with Federal, State and local governments to collaboratively \nwork to promote conservation, community revitalization, and economic \ndevelopment projects.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 29\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge as wilderness; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today, I introduced legislation to \nprotect the coastal plains region of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge from oil and gas exploration and drilling. Every Congress since \nthe 101st, I have either introduced or been an original cosponsor of \nlegislation to protect the Refuge, making tomorrow the twelfth time \nsince 1989 that I will mark my unwavering support for reaffirming the \noriginal intent of the Refuge: to provide habitat for Alaska's \nwildlife, by designating 1.5 million acres of the Refuge as Wilderness \nto be included in the National Wilderness Preservation System.\n  I have long believed we have a responsibility to future generations \nto preserve the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and I have fought to \nprotect it for as long as I have been in the Senate. The fact is, we do \nnot have to choose between conservation and exploration when it comes \nto our energy future; we can do both simultaneously while moving toward \na sustainable and diverse national energy policy.\n  The Arctic Refuge is home to 250 species of wildlife. Drilling there \nwould severely harm its abundant populations of polar bears, caribou, \nmusk oxen, and snow geese. Beyond that, the amount of commercially \nrecoverable oil in the Refuge would satisfy only a very small \npercentage of our Nation's need at any given time and would have no \nappreciable long-tem impact on gasoline prices. The permanent \nenvironmental price we would pay for ravaging the Refuge to drain those \nlimited resources is simply too high.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Sanders, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Brown of Ohio and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 45. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the taxation of income of controlled foreign corporations \nattributable for imported property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, from the Recovery Act to the Small \nBusiness Jobs Act, in the previous Congress we passed a number of \nsubstantial pieces of legislation to preserve, protect, and create \nAmerican jobs. The Recovery Act alone has supported between 2.7 and 3.7 \nmillion jobs, including 12,000 jobs in my home State of Rhode Island. \nThis was vital in stemming the 700,000-per-month job loss rate we faced \nwhen the previous administration left office. Without the Recovery Act \nand the other fiscal stimulus we passed over the past 2 years, the \neconomy would have been much worse.\n  While the Recovery Act protected our country from what would have \nbeen a far worse economic meltdown, the employment market is still weak \nand families are still hurting. Our national unemployment rate was 9.4 \npercent in December--an unacceptably high level. And it was higher \nstill in harder hit States such as Rhode Island, where we have had an \n11.5-percent unemployment rate in December. As we begin this new \nCongress, our No. 1 priority must remain job retention and creation.\n  The manufacturing industry has historically been the engine of growth \nfor the American economy. The manufacturing economy has been especially \nimportant in the industrial Northeast, particularly in my State of \nRhode Island. From Slater Mill in Pawtucket--one of the first water-\npowered textile mills in the Nation and the birthplace of the \nIndustrial Revolution--to high-tech modern submarine production at \nQuonset Point, the manufacturing sector has always been central to \nRhode Island's economy.\n  Unfortunately, as American companies have faced rising production \ncosts and increased--and very often unfair--competition from foreign \nfirms, U.S. manufacturing employment has plummeted. According to the \nBureau of Labor Statistics, the number of manufacturing jobs declined \nby almost a third over the past decade, from 17.2 million people at \nwork in 2000 to 11.7 million people at work in 2010. That is 6 million \njobs lost. This decline has been felt most sharply in our old \nmanufacturing centers, such as Rhode Island. In Rhode Island, the loss \nof manufacturing jobs in the past decade has topped 44 percent. The \ndecline of the manufacturing sector is a primary reason why Rhode \nIsland has had greater difficulty than most other States in recovering \nfrom the recent recession.\n  Over and over I have traveled around Rhode Island to meet with local \nmanufacturers, listening to their frustrations and discussing ideas to \nhelp their businesses grow. During these visits, I have heard one theme \nover and over: Unfair foreign competition is killing domestic \nindustries. One Pawtucket manufacturer I visited last week told me they \nrecently lost 8 percent of their business to a Chinese competitor. It \nis clear to me that if we want to keep manufacturing jobs in this \ncountry and in Rhode Island, we need to level the playing field for our \nmanufacturing companies with their foreign competitors.\n  Today I will introduce legislation that will remove one homegrown \nincentive to move jobs offshore and help to make competition fairer for \ncompanies straggling to keep their factory doors open at plants here in \nthe United States. The Offshoring Prevention Act, cosponsored by \nSenators Leahy, Sanders, Boxer, Durbin, Brown of Ohio, and Harkin, \nwould end a perverse tax incentive that actually rewards companies for \nshipping jobs overseas. Under current law, an American company that \nmanufactures goods in Rhode Island or Montana or Maine must pay Federal \nincome tax on profits in the year the profits are earned. That is \nstandard tax law. But if that same company moves its factory to another \ncountry, it is permitted to defer the payment of income taxes from that \nfactory and declare them in a year that is more advantageous--for \nexample, one in which the company has offsetting tax losses.\n  If an American company moves a plant offshore, it acquires this tax \ndeferral advantage. It makes no sense that our Tax Code allows \ncompanies to delay paying income taxes on profits when made through \noverseas subsidiaries but charges those profits in the year they are \nmade at home. My bill will put a stop to this practice on profits \nearned on manufactured goods exported to the United States. To put it \nsimply: Our tax system should not reward companies for eliminating \nAmerican jobs.\n  The Offshoring Prevention Act is based on legislation Senator Byron \nDorgan offered over the past two decades, again and again. We can all \nremember Senator Dorgan coming to this floor here with pictures of \niconic American goods, such as York Peppermint Patties, Radio Flyer red \nwagons, Fig Newton cookies, and Huffy bicycles, to highlight the fact \nthat the production of these American classic products had moved to \nMexico, to China, and elsewhere. On dozens, if not hundreds, of \noccasions, Senator Dorgan spoke passionately on this floor about the \ndecline of American manufacturing. I am grateful to his leadership on \nthis critical issue and for bringing our attention to an unfair tax \nadvantage that rewards companies for moving manufacturing jobs \noverseas.\n  Last year, a version of Senator Dorgan's bill was included in the \nCreating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act. While a majority of \nthis body--53 Senators--voted to begin debate on the bill, we were not \nable to overcome a filibuster to have a chance to consider and pass \nthis legislation. I am sorry we were not able to pass the bill last \nyear, and I will do my best to bring it up for a vote in this new \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, keeping jobs in America and providing a level playing \nfield for American manufacturing should\n\n[[Page S153]]\n\nnot be a Democratic or a Republican issue. We all serve here in the \nSenate to represent the interests of our constituents, and our \nconstituents want us to keep these good-paying manufacturing jobs in \nAmerica. I hope that all of our colleagues will join me in passing the \nOffshoring Prevention Act to do just that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \n        Snowe, and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 46. A bill to reauthorize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Coral Reef \nConservation Amendments Act, which I also introduced in the 111th \nCongress. This critical bill reauthorizes and strengthens the Coral \nReef Conservation Act of 2000, a program that I was pleased to \noriginally sponsor in the 106th Congress establishing the Coral Reef \nConservation Program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA.\n  Coral reefs are among the oldest and most economically and \nbiologically important ecosystems in the world. They provide habitat \nfor more than one million diverse aquatic species, a natural barrier \nfor protection from coastal storms and erosion, and are a potential \nsource of treatment for many of the world's diseases. From a commerce \nperspective, reef-supported tourism is a $30 billion industry \nworldwide, and the commercial value of United States fisheries from \ncoral reefs is more than $100 million.\n  However, our coral reef ecosystems face many threats including \npollution, climate change and coral bleaching, and overfishing to name \na few. Coral reefs cover only one-tenth of one percent of the ocean \nfloor, yet provide habitat for more than twenty-five percent of all \nmarine species.\n  The original Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 recognized the need \nto preserve, sustain and restore the condition of these valuable coral \nreef ecosystems. The Coral Reef Conservation Amendments Act of 2011 \nwould strengthen NOAA's ability to comprehensively address threats to \ncoral reefs and empower the agency with tools to ensure that damage to \nour coral reef ecosystems is prevented or effectively mitigated. It \nalso establishes consistent practices for maintaining data, products, \nand information, and promotes the widespread availability and \ndissemination of that environmental information.\n  Finally, the bill allows the Secretary to further develop \npartnerships with foreign governments and international organizations--\npartnerships that are critical not only to the understanding of our \ncoral reef ecosystems, but also to their protection and restoration.\n  Thank you and I would urge you to support this important legislation \nto continue supporting NOAA's leadership role in coral reef \nconservation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 46\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe participation of pharmacists in National Health Services Corps \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the need for \ninclusion of pharmacists in the National Health Services Corps, NHSC, \nstudent loan repayment program. It is imperative that our Nation focus \nits efforts on increased access to affordable, high quality healthcare \nfor our Nation's underserved communities. Today's pharmacist graduates \nwith a professional doctorate degree. My home State of Hawaii is home \nto our only school of pharmacy program located at the University of \nHawaii at Hilo and this year will mark the school's very first \ngraduating class. Pharmacists are vital to our intent of increasing \naccess to patient-centered, team-based healthcare for all individuals. \nThey collaborate with providers across the continuum of care to improve \nmedication-use related outcomes, provides access to prevention and \nwellness screening that, among others, can reduce tobacco use and \nincrease immunization rates all of which support provider effectiveness \nand organizational efficiencies. The integration of the pharmacist \nacross the continuum of care helps increase access to primary and \npreventive care and allows for better management of chronic disease. \nPharmacists support prescribers by focusing on the management of \nmedications preventing adverse events that lead to avoidable emergency \nroom visits and hospital admissions. This collaborative effort among \nhealthcare providers helps improve clinical and economic outcomes and \nincreases patient satisfaction with their care.\n  The current approach of recruiting and retaining primary care \npractitioners may limit access to robust patient-centered, team-based \ncare by patients in underserved communities. Today over 88 percent of \npharmacy students borrow over $107,000 to help them pay for their \neducation.

A bill to amend the Federal antitrust laws to provide expanded \ncoverage and to eliminate exemptions from such laws that are contrary \nto the public interest with respect to railroads; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nessential to restoring competition to the nation's crucial freight \nrailroad sector. Freight railroads are essential to shipping a myriad \nof vital goods, everything from coal used to generate electricity to \ngrain used for basic foodstuffs. But for decades the freight railroads \nhave been insulated from the normal rules of competition followed by \nalmost all other parts of our economy by an outmoded and unwarranted \nantitrust exemption. So today I am introducing, along with my \ncolleagues, the Railroad Antitrust Enforcement Act of 2011. This \nbipartisan legislation will eliminate the obsolete antitrust exemptions \nthat protect freight railroads from competition. This legislation is \nidentical to the legislation that was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee in the last Congress by a unanimous 15-0 vote.\n  Our legislation will eliminate unwarranted and outmoded antitrust \nexemptions that protect freight railroads from competition and result \nin higher prices to millions of consumers every day. Consolidation in \nthe railroad industry in recent years has resulted in only four Class I \nrailroads providing nearly 90 percent of the Nation's freight rail \ntransportation, as measured by revenue. The harmful result of this \nindustry concentration for railroad shippers is well documented. A 2006 \nGeneral Accounting Office Report found that shippers in many geographic \nareas ``may be paying excessive rates due to a lack of competition in \nthese markets.'' These unjustified cost increases cause consumers to \nsuffer higher electricity bills because a utility must pay for the high \ncost of transporting coal, result in higher prices for goods produced \nby manufacturers who rely on railroads to transport raw materials, and \nreduce earnings for American farmers who ship their products by rail \nand raise food prices paid by consumers.\n  A recent staff report, issued September 15, 2010, of the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation also makes clear how railroads \nhave benefited from the unique combination of deregulation and large-\nscale antitrust immunity, to the detriment of rail shippers and \nconsumers. This Report--titled ``The Current State of the Class I \nFreight Rail Industry''--stated that ``[t]he four Class I railroads \nthat today dominate the U.S. rail shipping market are achieving returns \non revenue and operating ratios that rank them among the most \nprofitable businesses in the U.S. economy.'' The four largest railroads \nnearly doubled their collective profit margins in the last decade to 13 \npercent ranking the railroad industry the fifth most profitable \nindustry as ranking by Fortune magazine.\n  Increased concentration and lack of antitrust scrutiny have had clear \nprice effects--according to the Commerce Committee Report, since 2004, \n``Class I railroads have been raising prices by an average of 5 percent \na year above inflation.'' The recent Commerce Committee Report \nconcluded that ``Class I freight railroads have regained the pricing \npower they lacked in the 1980s, and are now some of the most highly \nprofitable businesses in the U.S. economy.'' Given the industry's \nconcentration and pricing power, the case for full fledged application \nof the antitrust laws is plain.\n  The ill-effects of railroad industry consolidation are exemplified in \nthe case of ``captive shippers''--industries served by only one \nrailroad. Over the past several years, these captive shippers have \nfaced spiking rail rates. They are the victims of monopolistic \npractices and price gouging by the single railroad that serves them, \nprice increases which they are forced to pass along into the price of \ntheir products, and ultimately, to consumers. And in many cases, the \nordinary protections of antitrust law are unavailable to these captive \nshippers--instead, the railroads are protected by a series of outmoded \nexemptions from the normal rules of antitrust law to which all other \nindustries must abide.\n  These unwarranted antitrust exemptions have put the American consumer \nat risk, and in Wisconsin, victims of a lack of railroad competition \nabound. From Dairyland Power Cooperative in La Crosse to Wolf River \nLumber in New London, companies in my state are feeling the crunch of \nyears of railroad consolidation. To help offset a 93 percent increase \nin shipping rates in 2006, Dairyland Power Cooperative had to raise \nelectricity rates by 20 percent. The reliability, efficiency, and \naffordability of freight rail have all declined, and Wisconsin \nconsumers feel the pinch.\n  And similar stories exist across the country. We held a hearing at \nthe Antitrust Subcommittee in the 110th Congress which detailed \nnumerous instances of anti-competitive conduct by the dominant freight \nrailroads and at which railroad shippers testified as to the need to \nrepeal the outmoded and unwarranted antitrust exemptions which left \nthem without remedies. Dozens of organizations, unions and trade groups \naffected by monopolistic railroad conduct endorsed the Railroad \nAntitrust Enforcement Act in the last Congress. Supporters of the \nlegislation include 20 state Attorneys General, the National \nAssociation of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, NARUC, the Consumers \nFederation of America, Consumers Union, the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, American Chemistry Council, the American Corn Growers \nAssociation, the American Forest and Paper Association, the American \nPublic Power Association, and the American Bar Association Antitrust \nSection.\n  The current antitrust exemptions protect a wide range of railroad \nindustry conduct from scrutiny by governmental antitrust enforcers. \nRailroad mergers and acquisitions are exempt from antitrust law and are \nreviewed solely by the Surface Transportation Board. Railroads that \nengage in collective ratemaking are also exempt from antitrust law. \nRailroads subject to the regulation of the Surface Transportation Board \nare also exempt from private antitrust lawsuits seeking the termination \nof anti-competitive practices via injunctive relief. Our bill will \neliminate these exemptions.\n  No good reason exists for them. While railroad legislation in recent \ndecades--including most notably the Staggers Rail Act of 1980--\nderegulated much railroad rate setting from the oversight of the \nSurface Transportation Board, these obsolete antitrust exemptions \nremained in place, insulating a consolidating industry from obeying the \nrules of fair competition. And there is no reason to treat railroads \nany differently from dozens of other regulated industries in our \neconomy that are fully subject to antitrust law--whether the \ntelecommunications sector regulated by the FCC, or the aviation \nindustry regulation by the Department of Transportation, just name just \ntwo examples.\n  Our bill will bring railroad mergers and acquisitions under the \npurview of\n\n[[Page S162]]\n\nthe Clayton Act, allowing the federal government, state attorneys \ngeneral and private parties to file suit to enjoin anti-competitive \nmergers and acquisitions. It will restore the review of these mergers \nto the agencies where they belong--the Justice Department's Antitrust \nDivision and the Federal Trade Commission. It will eliminate the \nexemption that prevents FTC's scrutiny of railroad common carriers. It \nwill eliminate the antitrust exemption for railroad collective \nratemaking. It will allow state attorneys general and other private \nparties to sue railroads for treble damages and injunctive relief for \nviolations of the antitrust laws, including collusion that leads to \nexcessive and unreasonable rates. This legislation will force railroads \nto play by the rules of free competition like all other businesses.\n  Significantly, our bill will not affect in way the jurisdiction of \nthe Surface Transportation Board to regulate freight railroads. It will \nin no way limit or alter the authority of the STB; the STB will \ncontinue to exercise full jurisdiction over the railroad industry.\n  In sum, by clearing out this thicket of outmoded antitrust \nexemptions, railroads will be subject to the same laws as the rest of \nthe economy. Government antitrust enforcers will finally have the tools \nto prevent anti-competitive transactions and practices by railroads. \nLikewise, private parties will be able to utilize the antitrust laws to \ndeter anti-competitive conduct and to seek redress for their injuries.\n  It is time to put an end to the abusive practices of the Nation's \nfreight railroads. On the Antitrust Subcommittee, we have seen that in \nindustry after industry, vigorous application of our Nation's antitrust \nlaws is the best way to eliminate barriers to competition, to end \nmonopolistic behavior, to keep prices low and quality of service high. \nThe railroad industry is no different. All those who rely on railroads \nto ship their products--whether it is an electric utility for its coal, \na farmer to ship grain, or a factory to acquire its raw materials or \nship out its finished product--deserve the full application of the \nantitrust laws to end the anti-competitive abuses all too prevalent in \nthis industry today.

A bill to strengthen Federal consumer product safety programs \nand activities with respect to commercially-marketed seafood by \ndirecting the Secretary of Commerce to coordinate with the Federal \nTrade Commission and other appropriate Federal agencies to strengthen \nand coordinate those programs and activities; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am pleased to introduce my Commercial Seafood Consumer \nProtection Act, Seafood Safety Act. The Seafood Safety Act will \nstrengthen the partnership between the Secretary of Commerce, the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, HHS, the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, the Federal Trade Commission, \nFTC, and other appropriate Federal agencies, to coordinate Federal \nactivities for ensuring that commercially distributed seafood in the \nUnited States meets the food quality and safety requirements of Federal \nlaw. The bill provides for no new jurisdiction and does not alter any \nexisting jurisdiction given to FDA or any other agency. The bill does \nnot include any authorization of appropriations, but seeks only to \nstrengthen existing partnerships and share information.\n  The bill remains largely unchanged since I first introduced it in the \n110th Congress, but this version, like the one I introduced in the \n111th, incorporates the FTC as an additional partner since they have \nbroad existing authority for consumer and interstate commerce fraud \nissues.\n  Specifically, the bill requires the Secretaries of Commerce, HHS, \nDHS, and the FTC to enter into agreements as necessary to strengthen \ncooperation on seafood safety, seafood labeling, and seafood fraud. \nThose agreements must address seafood testing and inspection; data \nstandardization for seafood names; data coordination for the \nexportation, transportation, sale, harvest, or trade of seafood; \nseafood labeling compliance assurance; and information-sharing for \nobserved non-compliance. The bill also increases the number of \nlaboratories certified to inspection standards of the FDA and allows \nthe Secretary of Commerce to increase the number and capacity of NOAA \nlaboratories responsible for seafood safety testing. It allows for an \nincrease in the percentage of seafood import shipments tested and \ninspected to improve detection of violations. Finally, the bill allows \nthe Secretary of HHS to refuse entry of seafood imports from countries \nwith known violations, and also allows the Secretary to permit \nindividual seafood shipments from recognized and properly certified \nexporters.\n  For the safety of the American people, I remain committed to the \nSeafood Safety Act and look forward to continuing to work to ensure its \npassage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 50\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Applicable federal laws.--The term ``applicable laws \n     and regulations'' means Federal statutes, regulations, and \n     international agreements pertaining to the importation, \n     exportation, transportation, sale, harvest, processing, or \n     trade of seafood, including the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \n     Conservation and Management Act, section 801 of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 381), section 203 of \n     the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of \n     2004 (21 U.S.C. 374a), and the Seafood Hazard Analysis and \n     Critical Control Point regulations in part 123 of title 21, \n     Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (2) Appropriate federal agencies.--The term ``appropriate \n     Federal agencies'' includes the Department of Health and \n     Human Services, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the \n     Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of \n     Agriculture.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Commerce.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \n        Snowe, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 52. A bill to establish uniform administrative and enforcement \nprocedures and penalties for the enforcement of the High Seas Driftnet \nFishing Moratorium Protection Act and similar statutes, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nInternational Fisheries Stewardship and Enforcement Act, which I also \nintroduced in the 111th. This bill would harmonize the enforcement \nprovisions of the U.S. statutes for implementing international \nfisheries agreements to strengthen international fisheries enforcement.\n  Specifically it would grant the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, and the U.S. Coast Guard authority to implement \ninternational fisheries laws, expand their authorities in carrying out \ninvestigations and enforcement activities, and establish interference \nwith investigations as a prohibited act. It would also amend the \nenforcement provisions of statutes for implementing international \nfisheries agreements to conform to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act, while increasing both civil and \ncriminal penalties for violating international fisheries laws.\n  The bill also authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to maintain and \nmake public a list of vessels engaged in illegal, unregulated, and \nunreported, IUU, fishing and authorize appropriate action against \nlisted vessels, which will hopefully allow for strong strides in our \nfight against illegal activity.\n  Finally, by creating an International Cooperation and Assistance \nProgram that will provide assistance for international capacity \nbuilding efforts, training, outreach, and education, it is my hope that \nwe are able to more-successfully combat IUU fishing and promote \ninternational marine conservation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S165]]\n\n  There be no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 52\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

REPEAL OF EASTERN PACIFIC TUNA LICENSING ACT OF \n                   1984.\n\n       The Eastern Pacific Tuna Licensing Act of 1984 (16 U.S.C. \n     972 et seq.) is repealed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 57. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe application of the tonnage tax on certain vessels; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, foreign registered ships now carry 97 \npercent of the imports and exports moving in United States \ninternational trade. These foreign vessels are held to lower standards \nthan United States registered ships, and are virtually untaxed. Their \ncosts of operation are, therefore, lower than United States ship \noperating costs, which explains their 97 percent market share.\n  Seven years ago, in order to help level the playing field for United \nStates-flag ships that compete in international trade, Congress \nenacted, under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, Public Law 108-\n357, Subchapter R, a ``tonnage tax'' that is based on the tonnage of a \nvessel, rather than taxing international income at a 35 percent \ncorporate income tax rate. However, during the House and Senate \nconference, language was included, which states that a United States \nvessel cannot use the tonnage tax on international income if that \nvessel also operates in United States domestic commerce for more than \n30 days per year.\n  This 30-day limitation dramatically limits the availability of the \ntonnage tax for those United States ships that operate in both domestic \nand international trade and, accordingly, severely hinders their \ncompetitiveness in foreign commerce. It is important to recognize that \nships operating in United States domestic trade already have \nsignificant cost disadvantages. Specifically, they are built in higher \npriced United States shipyards; do not receive Maritime Security \nPayments, even when operated in international trade; and are owned by \nUnited States-based American corporations. The inability of these \ndomestic operators to use the tonnage tax for their international \nservice is a further, unnecessary burden on their competitive position \nin foreign commerce.\n  When windows of opportunity present themselves in international \ntrade, American tax policy and maritime policy should facilitate the \nparticipation of these American-built ships. Instead, the 30-day limit \nmakes them ineligible to use the tonnage tax, and further handicaps \nAmerican vessels when competing for international cargo. Denying the \ntonnage tax to coastwise qualified ships further stymies the operation \nof American built ships in international commerce, and further \nexacerbates America's 97 percent reliance on foreign ships to carry its \ninternational cargo.\n  These concerns were of sufficient importance that in December 2006 \nCongress repealed the 30-day limit on domestic trading--but only for \napproximately 50 ships operating in the Great Lakes. These ships \nprimarily operate in domestic trade on the Great Lakes, but also carry \ncargo between the United States and Canada in international trade, \nSection 415 of P.L. 109-432, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of \n2006.\n  The identifiable universe of remaining ships other than the Great \nLakes\n\n[[Page S172]]\n\nships that operate in domestic trade, but that may also operate \ntemporarily in international trade, totals 13 United States flag \nvessels. These 13 ships normally operate in domestic trades that \ninvolve Washington, Oregon, California, Hawaii, Alaska, Florida, \nMississippi, and Louisiana. In the interest of providing tax equity to \nthe United States corporations that own and operate these 13 vessels, \nmy bill would repeal the tonnage tax 30-day limit on domestic \noperations and enable these vessels to utilize the tonnage tax on their \ninternational income so they receive the same treatment as other United \nStates flag international operations. I stress that, under my bill, \nthese ships will continue to pay the normal 35 percent United States \ncorporate tax rate on their domestic income.\n  Repeal of the tonnage tax's 30-day limit on domestic operations is a \nnecessary step toward providing tax equity between United States flag \nand foreign flag vessels.

A bill to treat certain hospital support organizations as \nqualified organizations for purposes of determining acquisition \nindebtedness; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the legislation I am reintroducing today \nwill extend to qualified teaching hospital support organizations the \nexisting debt-financed safe harbor rule. Congress enacted that rule to \nsupport the public service activities of tax-exempt schools, \nuniversities, pension funds, and consortia of such institutions. Our \nteaching hospitals require similar support.\n  As a result, for-profit hospitals are moving from older areas to \naffluent locations where residents can afford to pay for treatment. \nThese private hospitals typically have no mandate for community \nservice. In contrast, non-profit hospitals must fulfill a community \nservice requirement. They must stretch their resources to provide \nincreased charitable care, update their facilities, and maintain \nskilled staffing resulting in closures of non-profit hospitals due to \nthis financial strain.\n  The problem is particularly severe for teaching hospitals. Non-profit \nhospitals provide nearly all the postgraduate medical education in the \nUnited States. Post-graduate medical instruction is by nature not \nprofitable. Instruction in the treatment of mental disorders and trauma \nis especially costly.\n  Despite their financial problem, the Nation's non-profit hospitals \nstrive to deliver a very high level of service. A study in the December \n2006 issue of Archives of International Medicine had surveyed \nhospital's quality of care in four areas of treatment. It found that \nnon-profit hospitals consistently outperformed for-profit hospitals. \nThe study also found that teaching hospitals had a higher level of \nperformance in treatment and diagnosis, and that investments in \ntechnology and staffing leads to better care. In addition, it \nrecommended that alternative payments and sources of payments be \nconsidered to finance these improvements.\n  The success and financial constraints of non-profit teaching \nhospitals is evident in work of the Queen's Health Systems in my State. \nThis 151-year-old organization maintains the largest, private, \nnonprofit hospital in Hawaii. The Queen's Health Systems serve as the \nprimary clinical teaching facility for the University of Hawaii's \nmedical residency program in medicine, general surgery, orthopedic \nsurgery, pathology, psychiatry, and is a clinical teaching facility for \nobstetrics-gynecology. It conducts educational and training programs \nfor nurses and allied health personnel. The Queen's Health Systems \noperate the only trauma unit as well as the chief behavioral health \nprogram in the State. It maintains clinics throughout Hawaii, health \nprograms, for Native Hawaiians, and a small hospital in the rural, \neconomically depressed island of Molokai. Furthermore, the Queen's \nHealth Systems annually provides millions of dollars in uncompensated \nhealth services. To help pay for these community benefits, the Queen's \nHealth Systems, as other nonprofit teaching hospitals, relies \nsignificantly on income from its endowment.\n  In the past, the Congress has allowed tax-exempt schools, colleges, \nuniversities, and pension funds to invest their endowment in real \nestate so as to better meet their financial needs. Under the tax code, \nthese organizations can incur debt for real estate investments without \ntriggering the tax on unrelated business activities.\n  If the Queen's Health Systems were part of a university, it could \nborrow without incurring an unrelated business income tax. Not being \npart of a university, however, a teaching hospital and its support \norganization run into the tax code's debt financing prohibition. Non-\nprofit teaching hospitals have the same if not more pressing needs as \nthat of universities, schools, and pension trusts. The same safe harbor \nrule should be extended to teaching hospitals.\n  My bill would allow the support organizations for qualified teaching \nhospitals to engage in limited borrowing to enhance their endowment \nincome. The proposal for teaching hospitals is actually more restricted \nthan current law for schools, universities and pension trusts. Under \nsafeguards developed by the Joint Committee on Taxation staff, a \nsupport organization for a teaching hospital cannot buy and develop \nland on a commercial basis. The proposal is tied directly to the \norganization endowment. The staff's revenue estimates show that the \nprovision with its general application will help a number of teaching \nhospitals.\n  The U.S. Senate has several times before acted favorably on this \nproposal. The Senate adopted a similar provision in H.R. 1836, the \nEconomic Growth and Tax Relief Act of 2001. The House conferees on that \nbill, however, objected that the provision was unrelated to the bill's \nfocus on individual tax relief and the conference deleted the provision \nfrom the final legislation. Subsequently, the Finance Committee \nincluded the provision in H.R. 7, the CARE Act of 2002, and in S. 476, \nthe CARE Act of 2003, which the Senate passed. In a previous Congress' \nS. 6, the\n\n[[Page S173]]\n\nMarriage, Opportunity, Relief, and Empowerment Act of 2005, which the \nSenate leadership introduced, also included the proposal.\n  As the Senate Finance Committee's hearings show, substantial health \nneeds would go unmet if not for our charitable hospitals. It is time \nfor the Congress to assist the Nation's teaching hospitals in their \ncharitable, educational service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 59\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide relief to the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada \nfor settlement of certain claims against the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, nearly 16 years ago I stood before you to \nintroduce a bill ``to provide an opportunity for the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada to have the merits of their claims against the United States \ndetermined by the United States Court of Federal Claims.''\n  That bill was introduced as Senate Resolution 223, which referred the \nPottawatomi's claim to the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Federal \nClaims and required the Chief Judge to report back to the Senate and \nprovide sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to enable \nthe Congress to determine whether the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada is legal or equitable in nature, and the amount of damages, \nif any, which may be legally or equitably due from the United States.\n  Over a decade ago, the Chief Judge of the Court of Federal Claims \nreported back that the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has a legitimate \nand credible legal claim. Thereafter, by settlement stipulation, the \nUnited States has taken the position that it would be ``fair, just and \nequitable'' to settle the claims of the\n  ottawatomi Nation in Canada for the sum of $1,830,000. This \nsettlement amount was reached by the parties after seven years of \nextensive, fact-intensive litigation. Independently, the court \nconcluded that the settlement amount is ``not a gratuity'' and that the \n``settlement was predicated on a credible legal claim.'' Pottawatomi \nNation in Canada, et al. v. United States, Cong. Ref. 94-1037X at 28, \nCt. Fed. Cl., September 15, 2000, Report of Hearing Officer.\n  The bill I introduce today is to authorize the appropriation of those \nfunds that the United States has concluded would be ``fair, just and \nequitable'' to satisfy this legal claim. If enacted, this bill will \nfinally achieve a measure of justice for a tribal nation that has for \nfar too long been denied.\n  For the information of our colleagues, this is the historical \nbackground that informs the underlying legal claim of the Canadian \nPottawatomi.\n  The members of the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada are one of the \ndescendant groups--successors-in-interest--of the historical \nPottawatomi Nation and their claim originates in the latter part of the \n18th century. The historical Pottawatomi Nation was aboriginal to the \nUnited States. They occupied and possessed a vast expanse in what is \nnow the States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. \nFrom 1795 to 1833, the United States annexed most of the traditional \nland of the Pottawatomi Nation through a series of treaties of \ncession--many of these cessions were made under extreme duress and the \nthreat of military action. In exchange, the Pottawatomi were repeatedly \nmade promises that the remainder of their lands would be secure and, in \naddition, that the United States would pay certain annuities to the \nPottawatomi.\n  In 1829, the United States formally adopted a Federal the policy of \nremoval; an effort to remove all Indian tribes from their traditional \nlands east of the Mississippi River to the west. As part of that \neffort, the government increasingly pressured the Pottawatomi to cede \nthe remainder of their traditional lands, some five million acres in \nand around the city of Chicago, and remove their nation west. For \nyears, the Pottawatomi steadfastly refused to cede the remainder of \ntheir tribal territory. Then in 1833, the United States, pressed by \nsettlers seeking more land, sent a Treaty Commission to the Pottawatomi \nwith orders to extract a cession of the remaining lands. The Treaty \nCommissioners spent 2 weeks using extraordinarily coercive tactics--\nincluding threats of war--in an attempt to get the Pottawatomi to agree \nto cede their territory. Finally, those Pottawatomi who were present \nrelented and on September 26, 1933, they ceded their remaining tribal \nestate through what would be known as the Treaty of Chicago. Seventy-\nseven members of the Pottawatomi Nation signed the Treaty of Chicago. \nMembers of the ``Wisconsin Band'' were not present and did not assent \nto the cession.\n  In exchange for their land, the Treaty of Chicago provided that the \nUnited States would give to the Pottawatomi 5 million acres of \ncomparable land in what is now Missouri. The Pottawatomi were familiar \nwith the Missouri land, aware that it was similar to their homeland. \nHowever, the Senate refused to ratify that negotiated agreement and \nunilaterally switched the land to five million acres in Iowa. The \nTreaty Commissioners were sent back to acquire Pottawatomi assent to \nthe Iowa land. All but seven of the original 77 signatories refused to \naccept the change even with promises that if they were dissatisfied \n``justice would be done.''\n  Nevertheless, the Treaty of Chicago was ratified as amended by the \nSenate in 1834. Subsequently, the Pottawatomi sent a delegation to \nevaluate the land in Iowa. The delegation reported back that the land \nwas ``not fit for snakes to live on.''\n  While some Pottawatomi moved westward, many of the Pottawatomi, \nparticularly the Wisconsin Band, whose leaders never agreed to the \nTreaty, refused to do so. By 1836, the United States began to \nforcefully remove Pottawatomi who remained in the east with devastating \nconsequences. As is true with many other American Indian tribes, the \nforced removal westward came at great human cost. Many of the \nPottawatomi were forcefully removed\n\n[[Page S174]]\n\nby mercenaries who were paid on a per capita basis government contract. \nOver one-half of the Indians removed by these means died en route. \nThose who reached Iowa were almost immediately removed further to \ninhospitable parts of Kansas against their will and without their \nconsent.\n  After learning of these conditions, many of the Pottawatomi, \nincluding most of the Wisconsin Band, vigorously resisted forced \nremoval. To avoid Federal troops and mercenaries, much of the Wisconsin \nBand ultimately found it necessary to flee to Canada. They were often \npursued to the border by government troops, government-paid mercenaries \nor both. Official files of the Canadian and United States governments \ndisclose that many Pottawatomi were forced to leave their homes without \ntheir horses or any of their possessions other than the clothes on \ntheir backs.\n  By the late 1830s, the government refused payment of annuities to any \nPottawatomi groups that had not removed west. In the 1860s, members of \nthe Wisconsin Band--those still in their traditional territory and \nthose forced to flee to Canada--petitioned Congress for the payment of \ntheir treaty annuities promised under the Treaty of Chicago and all \nother cession treaties. By the Act of June 25, 1864, 13 Stat. 172, \nCongress declared that the Wisconsin Band did not forfeit their \nannuities by not removing and directed that the share of the \nPottawatomi Indians who had refused to relocate to the west should be \nretained for their use in the United States Treasury. H.R. Rep. No. \n470, 64th Cong., p. 5, as quoted on page 3 of memo dated October 7, \n1949. Nevertheless, much of the money was never paid to the Wisconsin \nBand.\n  In 1903, the Wisconsin Band--most of whom now resided in three areas, \nthe States of Michigan and Wisconsin and the Province of Ontario--\npetitioned the Senate once again to pay them their fair portion of \nannuities as required by the law and treaties, Sen. Doc. No. 185, 57th \nCong., 2d Sess. By the act of June 21, 1906, 34 Stat. 380, Congress \ndirected the Secretary of the Interior to investigate claims made by \nthe Wisconsin Band and establish a roll of the Wisconsin Band \nPottawatomi that still remained in the east. In addition, Congress \nordered the Secretary to determine ``the [Wisconsin Bands] \nproportionate shares of the annuities, trust funds, and other moneys \npaid to or expended for the tribe to which they belong in which the \nclaimant Indians have not shared, [and] the amount of such monies \nretained in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the \nclamant Indians as directed the provision of the Act of June 25, \n1864.''\n  In order to carry out the 1906 Act, the Secretary of Interior \ndirected Dr. W.M. Wooster to conduct an enumeration of Wisconsin Band \nPottawatomi in both the United States and Canada. Dr. Wooster \ndocumented 2,007 Wisconsin Pottawatomi: 457 in Wisconsin and Michigan \nand 1,550 in Canada. He also concluded that the proportionate share of \nannuities for the Pottawatomi in Wisconsin and Michigan was $477,339 \nand that the proportionate share of annuities due the Pottawatomi \nNation in Canada was $1,517,226. Congress thereafter enacted a series \nof appropriation Acts from June 30, 1913 to May 29, 1928 to satisfy \nmost of the money owed to those Wisconsin Band Pottawatomi residing in \nthe United States. However, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomi who resided \nin Canada were never paid their share of the tribal funds.\n  Since that time, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has diligently and \ncontinuously sought to enforce their treaty rights, although until this \nCongressional reference, they had never been provided their day in \ncourt. In 1910, the United States and Great Britain entered into an \nagreement for the purpose of dealing with claims between both \ncountries, including claims of Indian tribes within their respective \njurisdictions, by creating the Pecuniary Claims Tribunal. From 1910 to \n1938, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada diligently sought to have their \nclaim heard in this international forum. Overlooked for more pressing \ninternational matters of the period, including the intervention of \nWorld War I, the Pottawatomi then came to the U.S. Congress for redress \nof their claim.\n  In 1946, the Congress waived its sovereign immunity and established \nthe Indian Claims Commission for the purpose of granting tribes their \nlong-delayed day in court. The Indian Claims Commission Act, ICCA, \ngranted the Commission jurisdiction over claims such as the type \ninvolved here. In 1948, the Wisconsin Band Pottawatomi from both sides \nof the border brought suit together in the Indian Claims Commission for \nrecovery of damages. Hannahville Indian Community v. U.S., No. 28 (Ind. \nCl. Comm. Filed May 4, 1948). Unfortunately, the Indian Claims \nCommission dismissed Pottawatomi Nation in Canada's part of the claim \nruling that the Commission had no jurisdiction to consider claims of \nIndians living outside territorial limits of the United States. \nHannahville Indian Community v. U.S., 115 Ct. Cl. 823, 1950. The claim \nof the Wisconsin Band residing in the United States that was filed in \nthe Indian Claims Commission was finally decided in favor of the \nWisconsin Band by the U.S. Claims Court in 1983. Hannahville Indian \nCommunity v. United States, 4 Ct. Cl. 445, 1983. The Court of Claims \nconcluded that the Wisconsin Band was owed a member's proportionate \nshare of unpaid annuities from 1838 through 1907 due under various \ntreaties, including the Treaty of Chicago and entered judgment for the \nAmerican Wisconsin Band Pottawatomi for any monies not paid. Still the \nPottawatomi Nation in Canada was excluded because of the jurisdictional \nlimits of the ICCA.\n  Undaunted, the Pottawatomi Nation in Canada came to the Senate, and \nafter careful consideration, we finally gave them their long-awaited \nday in court through the Congressional reference process. The court has \nnow reported back to us that their claim is meritorious and that the \npayment that this bill would make constitutes a ``fair, just and \nequitable'' resolution to this claim.\n  The Pottawatomi Nation in Canada has sought justice for over 150 \nyears. They have done all that we asked in order to establish their \nclaim. Now it is time for us to finally live up to the promise our \ngovernment made so many years ago. It will not correct all the wrongs \nof the past, but it is a demonstration that this government is willing \nto admit when it has left an unfulfilled obligation, and that the \nUnited States is willing to do what we can to see that justice, so long \ndelayed, is not now denied.\n  Finally, I would just note that the claim of the Pottawatomi Nation \nin Canada is supported through specific resolutions by the National \nCongress of American Indians, the oldest, largest and most-\nrepresentative tribal organization here in the United States, the \nAssembly of First Nations, which includes all recognized tribal \nentities in Canada, and each and every of the Pottawatomi tribal groups \nthat remain in the United States today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 60\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Native American Economic Advisory \nCouncil, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would \nestablish a Native American Economic Advisory Council. This Council's \nprimary duties would be to consult, coordinate, and make \nrecommendations to Federal agencies for the purpose of improving the \nsubstandard economic conditions that exist in our Native communities.\n  Currently, there is no Council, and despite the Federal Government's \n``trust'' relationship with Native American tribes, Native Americans \nthemselves continue to rank lowest in quality of life standings. As a \nnation we need to preserve our Native communities as they are rich with \ncultural significance and living history.\n  Native communities are considered ``emerging economies'' that have \nstalled because of the current economic situation. This bill is an \nattempt to keep these communities moving by educating, empowering, and \nencouraging our future Native American leaders to create sustainable \neconomic growth programs in their own communities.\n  In Hawaii, the cost of living ranges from 30 percent to 60 percent \nhigher than the national average. We have to start planning for \neconomic stability in the future and this bill provides an opportunity \nto do so.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds--\n       (1) the United States has a special political and legal \n     relationship and responsibility to promote the welfare of the \n     Native American people of the United States;\n       (2) evaluations of indicators and criteria of social well-\n     being, education, health, unemployment, housing, income, \n     rates of poverty, justice systems, and nutrition by agencies \n     of government and others have consistently found that Native \n     American communities rank below other groups of United States \n     citizens and many are at or near the bottom in those \n     evaluations;\n       (3) Native Americans, like other people in the United \n     States, have been hit hard by the deepest recession of the \n     United States economy in over 50 years, causing a significant \n     decline in employment and economic activity across the United \n     States;\n       (4) Native American communities have been described as \n     ``emerging economies'' and consequently have been stalled in \n     the efforts of the communities to build sustainable growing \n     economies for the people of the communities and are being \n     adversely affected faster than the rest of the United States;\n       (5) economic stimulus programs to help Native American \n     communities generate jobs and stronger economic performance \n     will require United States financial and tax incentives to \n     increase both local and expanded investment that is tailored \n     to the unique needs and circumstances of Native American \n     communities;\n       (6) the impacts of the ongoing recession and the near \n     collapse of the financial and banking systems require a \n     review of assumptions about the future, the need for new \n     growth strategies, and a focus on laying the groundwork for \n     economic success in the 21st century;\n       (7) there is a continuing need for direct economic \n     stimulus, including needs for improving rural infrastructure \n     and alternative energy in rural and Native American \n     communities of the United States and providing Native \n     Americans leaders with the tools to create jobs and improve \n     economic conditions;\n       (8) in light of the role of Native American communities as \n     emerging markets within the United States, there are \n     opportunities and needs that should be addressed, including \n     consideration of United States support for the pooling of \n     resources to create an Indigenous Sovereign Wealth Fund that \n     is similar to those Funds created around the world to \n     diversify revenue streams, attract more resources, invest \n     more wisely, and create jobs;\n       (9) Native Americans should be participants when major \n     economic decisions are made that affect the property, lives, \n     and future of Native Americans; and\n       (10) Native Americans should fully participate in \n     rebuilding Native American communities and have necessary \n     tools and resources.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to authorize and establish a \n     Native American Economic Advisory Council to consult, \n     coordinate with, and make recommendations to the Executive \n     Office of the President, Cabinet officers, and Federal \n     agencies--\n       (1) to improve the focus, effectiveness, and delivery of \n     Federal economic aid and development programs to Native \n     Americans and, as a result, improve substandard economic \n     conditions in Native American communities;\n       (2) to build and expand on the capacity of leaders in \n     Native American organizations and communities to take \n     positive and innovative steps--\n       (A) to create jobs;\n       (B) to establish stable and profitable business \n     enterprises;\n       (C) to enhance economic conditions; and\n       (D) to use Native American-owned resources for the benefit \n     of members; and\n       (3) to achieve the long-term goal of improving the quality \n     of Native American life and living conditions and access to \n     basic public services to the levels enjoyed by the average \n     citizen and community of the United States by the year 2025.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to modify \nrequirements relating to the location of bank branches on Indian \nreservations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would \nprovide authority for the establishment of branch banking facilities on \nIndian reservations so that the Federally-chartered Native American \nBank could enable access to financial services to Indian tribes and \ntheir citizens.\n  Many years ago, as part of my service as Chairman of the Senate \nIndian Affairs Committee, I met with tribal leaders to discuss the \nchallenges of economic development in Indian country. At that time, I \nsuggested that they might give consideration to a means by which tribal \ngovernments could pool their resources and thereby provide the capital \nthat other tribal governments could employ on a short-term loan basis \nto undertake reservation-based projects that held the potential of \nstimulating economic growth in their tribal communities.\n  The tribal leaders with whom I met were very interested in this idea, \nand in the ensuing years, went forward and established the Native \nAmerican Bank--which is headquartered in Denver--but continues to \nmanage its first affiliated bank on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in \nMontana.\n  As my colleagues know, there are few financial institutions located \neither on or near Indian reservations, and sadly, there is evidence \nthat some financial institutions have found it apparently necessary to \neither charge very high rates that they associate with the risk of \ndoing business in Indian country, or to deny financial assistance \naltogether.\n  The Native American Bank has stepped into that latter void and has \nbeen providing meaningful financial services to tribal governments and \ntheir citizens for a number of years.\n  This bill contains amendments to the McFadden Act that have been \ncarefully sculpted to address only this narrow expansion of capacity on \nthe part of financial institutions serving Indian country.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 62\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Reservation Bank \n     Branch Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to establish a fact-finding Commission to extend the \nstudy of a prior Commission to investigate and determine facts and \ncircumstances surrounding the relocation, internment, and deportation \nto Axis countries of Latin Americans of Japanese descent from December \n1941 thorugh February 1948, and the impact of those actions by the \nUnited States, and to recommend appropriate remedies, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Commission \non Wartime Relocation and Internment of Latin Americans of Japanese \nDescent Act.\n  The story of U.S. citizens taken from their homes on the west coast \nand confined in camps is a story that was made known after a fact-\nfinding study by a Commission that Congress authorized in 1980. That \nstudy was followed by a formal apology by President Reagan and a bill \nfor reparations. Far less known, and indeed, I myself did not initially \nknow, is the story of Latin Americans of Japanese descent taken from \ntheir homes in Latin America, stripped of their passports, brought to \nthe U.S., and interned in American camps.\n  This is a story about the U.S. government's act of reaching its arm \nacross international borders, into a community that did not pose an \nimmediate threat to our Nation, in order to use them, devoid of \npassports or any other proof of citizenship, for exchange with \nAmericans with Japan. Between the years 1941 and 1945, our Government, \nwith the help of Latin American officials, arbitrarily arrested persons \nof Japanese descent from streets, homes, and workplaces. Approximately \n2,300 undocumented persons were brought to camp sites in the U.S., \nwhere they were held under armed watch, and then held in reserve for \nprisoner exchange. Those used in an exchange were sent to Japan, a \nforeign country that many had never set foot on since their ancestors' \nimmigration to Latin America.\n  Despite their involuntary arrival, Latin American internees of \nJapanese descent were considered by the Immigration and Naturalization \nService as illegal entrants. By the end of the war, some Japanese Latin \nAmericans had been sent to Japan. Those who were not used in a prisoner \nexchange were cast out into a new and English-speaking country, and \nsubject to deportation proceedings. Some returned to Latin America. \nOthers remained in the U.S., because their country of origin in Latin \nAmerica refused their re-entry, because they were unable to present a \npassport.\n  When I first learned of the wartime experiences of Japanese Latin \nAmericans, it seemed unbelievable, but indeed, it happened. It is a \npart of our national history, and it is a part of the living histories \nof the many families whose lives are forever tied to internment camps \nin our country.\n  The outline of this story was sketched out in a book published by the \nCommission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians formed in \n1980. This Commission had set out to learn about Japanese Americans. \nTowards the close of their investigations, the Commissioners stumbled \nupon this extraordinary effort by the U.S. Government to relocate, \nintern, and deport Japanese persons formerly living in Latin America. \nBecause this finding surfaced late in its study, the Commission was \nunable to fully uncover the facts, but found them significant enough to \ninclude in its published study, urging a deeper investigation.\n  I rise today to introduce the Commission on Wartime Relocation and \nInternment of Latin Americans of Japanese Descent Act, which would \nestablish a fact-finding Commission to extend the study of the 1980 \nCommission. This Commission's task would be to determine facts \nsurrounding the U.S. government's actions in regards to Japanese Latin \nAmericans subject to a program of relocation, internment, and \ndeportation. I believe that examining this extraordinary program would \ngive finality to, and complete the account of Federal actions to detain \nand intern civilians of Japanese ancestry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 64\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Commission on Wartime \n     Relocation and Internment of Latin Americans of Japanese \n     Descent Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Based on a preliminary study published in \n     December 1982 by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and \n     Internment of Civilians, Congress finds the following:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States--\n       (A) expanded its internment program and national security \n     investigations to conduct the program and investigations in \n     Latin America; and\n       (B) financed relocation to the United States, and \n     internment, of approximately 2,300 Latin Americans of \n     Japanese descent, for the purpose of exchanging the Latin \n     Americans of Japanese descent for United States citizens held \n     by Axis countries.\n       (2) Approximately 2,300 men, women, and children of \n     Japanese descent from 13 Latin American countries were held \n     in the custody of the Department of State in internment camps \n     operated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service from \n     1941 through 1948.\n       (3) Those men, women, and children either--\n       (A) were arrested without a warrant, hearing, or indictment \n     by local police, and sent to the United States for \n     internment; or\n       (B) in some cases involving women and children, voluntarily \n     entered internment camps to remain with their arrested \n     husbands, fathers, and other male relatives.\n       (4) Passports held by individuals who were Latin Americans \n     of Japanese descent were routinely confiscated before the \n     individuals arrived in the United States, and the Department \n     of State ordered United States consuls in Latin American \n     countries to refuse to issue visas to the individuals prior \n     to departure.\n       (5) Despite their involuntary arrival, Latin American \n     internees of Japanese descent were\n\n[[Page S179]]\n\n     considered to be and treated as illegal entrants by the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service. Thus, the internees \n     became illegal aliens in United States custody who were \n     subject to deportation proceedings for immediate removal from \n     the United States. In some cases, Latin American internees of \n     Japanese descent were deported to Axis countries to enable \n     the United States to conduct prisoner exchanges.\n       (6) Approximately 2,300 men, women, and children of \n     Japanese descent were relocated from their homes in Latin \n     America, detained in internment camps in the United States, \n     and in some cases, deported to Axis countries to enable the \n     United States to conduct prisoner exchanges.\n       (7) The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians studied Federal actions conducted pursuant to \n     Executive Order 9066 (relating to authorizing the Secretary \n     of War to prescribe military areas). Although the United \n     States program of interning Latin Americans of Japanese \n     descent was not conducted pursuant to Executive Order 9066, \n     an examination of that extraordinary program is necessary to \n     establish a complete account of Federal actions to detain and \n     intern civilians of enemy or foreign nationality, \n     particularly of Japanese descent. Although historical \n     documents relating to the program exist in distant archives, \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians did not research those documents.\n       (8) Latin American internees of Japanese descent were a \n     group not covered by the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (50 \n     U.S.C. App. 1989b et seq.), which formally apologized and \n     provided compensation payments to former Japanese Americans \n     interned pursuant to Executive Order 9066.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     fact-finding Commission to extend the study of the Commission \n     on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians to \n     investigate and determine facts and circumstances surrounding \n     the relocation, internment, and deportation to Axis countries \n     of Latin Americans of Japanese descent from December 1941 \n     through February 1948, and the impact of those actions by the \n     United States, and to recommend appropriate remedies, if any, \n     based on preliminary findings by the original Commission and \n     new discoveries.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to reauthorize the programs of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development for housing assistances for Native \nHawaiians; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to reauthorize \nTitle VIII of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-\nDetermination Act. Title VIII provides authority for the appropriation \nof funds for the construction of low-income housing for Native \nHawaiians and further provides authority for access to loan guarantees \nassociated with the construction of housing to serve Native Hawaiians.\n  Three studies have documented the acute housing needs of Native \nHawaiians--which include the highest rates of overcrowding and \nhomelessness in the State of Hawaii. Those same studies indicate that \ninadequate housing rates for Native Hawaiians are amongst the highest \nin the Nation.\n  The reauthorization of Title VIII will support the continuation of \nefforts to assure that the native people of Hawaii may one day have \naccess to housing opportunities that are comparable to those now \nenjoyed by other Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 65\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit former \nmembers of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected disability \nrated as total to travel on military aircraft in the same manner and to \nthe same extent as retired members of the Armed Forces are entitled to \ntravel on such aircraft; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill which is \nof great importance to a group of patriotic Americans. This legislation \nis designed to end space-available travel privileges on military \naircraft to those who have been totally disabled in the service of our \ncountry.\n  Currently, retired members of the Armed Services are permitted to \ntravel on a space-available basis on non-scheduled military flights \nwithin the continental United States, and on scheduled overseas flights \noperated by the Military Airlift Command. My bill would provide the \nsame benefits for veterans with 100 percent service-connected \ndisabilities.\n  We owe these heroic men and women who have given so much to our \ncountry a debt of gratitude. Of course, we can never repay them for the \nsacrifices they have made on behalf of our Nation, but we can surely \ntry to make their lives more pleasant and fulfilling. One way in which \nwe can help is to extend military travel privileges to these \ndistinguished American veterans. I have received numerous letters from \nall over the country attesting to the importance attached to this issue \nby veterans. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues show their concern and \njoin me in saying ``thank you'' by supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 67\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to authorize \ncertain disabled former prisoners of war to use Department of Defense \ncommissary and exchange stores; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \nenable those former prisoners of war who have been separated honorably \nfrom their respective services and who have been rated as having a 30 \npercent service-connected disability to have the use of both the \nmilitary commissary and post exchange privileges. While I realize it is \nimpossible to adequately compensate one who has endured long periods of \nincarceration at the hands of our Nation's enemies, I do feel this \ngesture is both meaningful and important to those concerned because it \nserves as a reminder that our nation has not forgotten their \nsacrifices.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S181]]\n\n                                 S. 68\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of \n2008 to exclude secondary sales, repair services, and certain vehicles \nfrom the ban on lead in children's products, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Common Sense \nin Consumer Product Safety Act of 2011 on behalf of the folks across \nAmerica who are outdoor enthusiasts and budding sportsman and women. \nThis bill will bring a common sense approach to restrictions we place \nupon access to children's products.\n  In 2008, in response to the high lead paint content found in a number \nof toys and products intended for children, the Congress passed \nlegislation to limit children's access to these dangerous products. \nMany of these products were imports from China and other places where \nconsumer protection is weak or non-existent. I supported this \nlegislation, as did 78 of my colleagues.\n  Any product sold that is intended to be used by children up to the \nage of 12 must be tested and certified to not contain more than the \nallowable level of lead. However, it became clear that the Consumer \nProduct Safety Improvement Act has had some unintended consequences.\n  While the goal is admirable, it is important to inject a little \ncommon sense into the process. I want our kids and grandkids to be safe \nand protected from harmful toys, but we all know that most kids who are \npast the teething stage do not chew on their toys. It is important to \nstrike a balance--to enact responsible safety requirements while at the \nsame time recognizing that overzealous restrictions can interfere with \na way of life enjoyed by not just Montanans, but outdoor enthusiasts \nacross America.\n  As Chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, I am proud to \nstand up for Montana's outdoor heritage at every chance. The consumer \nprotection law goes too far and limits younger Montanans' opportunities \nto participate in those traditions.\n  My bill will protect small businesses and allow families safer access \nto the outdoors.\n  The consumer protection law covers all products intended for the use \nof children through the age of 12. This includes ATVs, dirt bikes and \nother vehicles built specifically for the use of older kids and adults. \nHowever, because of the way the vehicles are built, parts that may \ninclude lead are not exclusively internal components and therefore \ndon't pass the inaccessibility standard required by law. As a result of \nthis requirement, a number of ATV sales and retail establishments have \nhalted the sale of all ATVs for kids. In an abundance of caution, they \nhave also refused to repair any equipment intended for kids use.\n  I have heard from many Montanans--consumers and retail sales people \nalike--expressing their concern about the impact of the legislation \nupon outdoor motor sports. A few years ago I worked with the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission to successfully provide a two year waiver for \nchild-sized motorized vehicles. However, that stay of enforcement \nexpires this May. Therefore today, I am reintroducing this bill to \nprovide a permanent exception for vehicles intended to be used by \nchildren between the ages of 6 and 12.\n  In addition to manufacturers and merchants, thrift stores, and other \nretail establishments are also implicated because of the wide-reaching \nscope of the legislation. It is possible that even holding a yard sale \ncan lead folks astray from the new law. Therefore, my bill also removes \nliability for lead paint content in any product that is repaired or is \nresold by thrift stores, flea markets or at yard sales. The liability \nin place at the time of primary sale of these products is sufficient \nand it could cripple the profitability of the secondary merchants if \nthey were to be liable for testing the products they resell or repair.\n  In this tough economy, second-hand resellers simply can't afford the \nthird-party testing requirement put in place by the bill. At the same \ntime, more and more of Montana's families are finding their budgets \ntighten and are relying upon thrift and resale stores for toys, \nchildren's clothing and other household goods. I want to make sure that \nlaws intended to keep our kids safe end up doing more harm than good.\n  This a very important bill, bringing a dose of common sense to the \nvery important goal of protecting our kids from lead paint and other \nsubstances that will harm their health. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 70. A bill to restore the traditional day of observance of \nMemorial Day, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, in our effort to accommodate many \nAmericans by making Memorial Day the last Monday in May, we have lost \nsight of the significance of this day to our nation. My bill would \nrestore Memorial Day to May 30 and authorize our flag to fly at half \nmast on that day. In addition, this legislation would authorize the \nPresident to issue a proclamation designating Memorial Day and Veterans \nDay as days for prayer and ceremonies. This legislation would help \nrestore the recognition our veterans deserve for the sacrifices they \nhave made on behalf of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 70\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to preserve the free and open nature of the Internet, \nexpand the benefits of broadband, and promote\n\n[[Page S182]]\n\nuniversally available and affordable broadband service; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will preserve the free and open Internet that has led to the \ngrowth of broadband.\n  The broadband Internet is integral to U.S. job creation, economic \ngrowth, education, civic engagement, and innovation.\n  The network design principles fostering the development of the \nbroadband Internet to date, an end-to-end design, layered architecture, \nand open standards, promotes innovation at the edge of the network and \ngives end users choice and control of their online activities.\n  These network design principles have led to the network neutrality of \nthe Internet, where there are no paid-for premium fast lanes and best-\neffort slow lanes.\n  Today, broadband providers have access to technology and an economic \nincentive to favor their own or affiliated services, content, and \napplications; and discriminate against other providers of services \ncontent, and applications.\n  If our Nation is to achieve the ambitious broadband goals put forward \nin the National Broadband Plan, the U.S. needs a clear Federal policy \nthat preserves the historically free and open nature of the Internet.\n  The policy must apply to all broadband Internet access service \nproviders regardless of the means by which they reach the end user.\n  As you know, the FCC released its net neutrality rules last fall.\n  I consider the Commission's actions to be completely within the \nbounds of its authority.\n  The Chevron deference courts give agencies is rather broad.\n  A quick read of the 2005 U.S. Supreme Court's Brand X decision tells \nyou all you need to know.\n  Former FCC Chairman Powell was very creative in his approach to \nderegulating broadband over cable modem in 2002.\n  As you remember, one of the most conservative justices on the Supreme \nCourt, Justice Scalia, voted against the FCC action saying more or less \nthat what Chairman Powell did was an overreach.\n  Even so, the final decision was six to three in favor of the FCC. \nThat is how broad the Chevron deference is.\n  And because of the meticulous way Chairman Genachowski conducted the \nCommission's process, in the end, I am confident the court system will \nuphold its actions.\n  My issue with the Commission's net neutrality rules is that I do not \nthink the Chairman was bold enough.\n  The Commission should have issued one set of rules that covered \nbroadband delivered over wireline, wireless, or some combination of the \ntwo. Everyone realizes that the future of broadband is wireless. And \nwith the rollout of 4-G wireless services, that future is with us now.\n  The Commission should not have kept open the door for any pay-for-\npriority schemes. It will lead to a tiered Internet, where broadband \nInternet service providers have the incentive to create artificial \nbandwidth shortages to maximize profits, rather than invest in new \ncapacity.\n  The Commission also needed to get the definitions of broadband and \nreasonable network management right. One was too broad and one too \nnarrow. The wording in definitions is negotiated over fiercely because, \nif not crafted properly, it can lead to loopholes that severely \nundercut the effectiveness of the rules.\n  More fundamentally, the Commission should have reclassified broadband \nInternet access into Title II of the communications act and forebear \nfrom regulation all of the elements more appropriate to Title I. It \nwould have taken the Commission a lot more time and resources, but \ngetting net neutrality right is that important, because this is the \nfoundation that all broadband rules and regulations will be built on \ngoing forward.\n  It is surprising that as weak as these rules are they have stirred up \nso much vitriol.\n  I know this body will be taking up this matter another day.\n  My legislation puts in statute strong net neutrality protections, \ntakes steps to promote broadband adoption, and provides consumer \nprotection for broadband end users.\n  First I want to acknowledge the leadership of our former colleague \nSenator Dorgan on this issue.\n  The bill builds on what we started working together on last fall.\n  It also borrows some of the good ideas of Mr. Markey and Ms. Eshoo in \nthe House.\n  At a high level my legislation creates a new section in Title II of \nthe Communications Act that codifies the six new neutrality principles \nin the FCC's November 2009 notice of proposed rulemaking for preserving \nthe open Internet.\n  My legislation adds a few things to the FCC's list. For example, my \nlegislation also prohibits broadband operators from requiring content, \nservice, or application providers from paying for prioritized delivery \nof their IP packets; more commonly referred to as pay-for priority. It \nalso requires broadband providers to interconnect with middle-mile \nbroadband providers on just and reasonable terms and conditions.\n  All of this is subject to reasonable network management as defined. \nAnd it applies to all broadband Internet platforms--wireline and \nwireless.\n  My legislation takes several steps to promote the adoption of \nbroadband, steps such as requiring broadband providers to provide \nservice upon reasonable request by an end user; and requiring broadband \nproviders to offer standalone broadband at reasonable rates, terms and \nconditions.\n  My legislation increases consumer protections because all charges, \npractices, classifications, regulations, for and in connection with the \nbroadband Internet access service must be just and reasonable.\n  My legislation directs the FCC to come up with enforcement \nmechanisms. End users, who include individuals, businesses of all \nsizes, non-for-profit organization, and others, can file a complaint \neither at the FCC or at a U.S. District Court, but not both. \nAdditionally, State Attorneys General can file on behalf of their \nresidents and seek either to enforce the act or to seek civil \npenalties.\n  My legislation supports continued broadband investment, innovation, \nand jobs.\n  Let me explain.\n  First innovation. With the Internet's end-to-end design, innovation \nis at the edge of the network in the hands of the end users. New ideas \nfor online content, application, and services do not need the \npermission of the centralized network operator to become successful. \nWithout net neutrality protections, I foresee situations arising that \nwill chill innovation.\n  For example, if a broadband provider has a partnership with company A \nto provide end users a certain on-line service, and new company B comes \nup with a better value proposition for providing that same on-line \nservice, how many believe that the broadband provider will allow \ncompany B get access to its end users with the same bandwidth or \nquality-of-service assurances, particularly if Company A gives a \nportion of its revenues from that on-line service to the broadband \nprovider.\n  Experience has taught me that the most promising path to developing \nan innovation into a new on-line product or service is hard to predict, \nif one can do it at all. If broadband Internet access service provider \nend up on the critical path for successful commercialization of on-line \ninnovations, the path to success will be all the much harder. The \nlanguage in my bill tries to prevent these types of situations from \nhappening.\n  This leads to my second point, the chilling of investment without \neffective net neutrality rules.\n  Take the situation where an early stage online company is seeking \nventure capital investments. The first question any responsible VC will \nask is whether the following list of large broadband providers are on-\nboard with the online product or service. Because if there is a \nsituation, as in my example on innovation, where the large broadband \nprovider has a partnership with the early stage companies' entrenched \ncompetitor, it is going to be difficult, if not impossible to raise \nfunds. Basically, the blessing of broadband providers will become \nessential to obtaining VC investment of any magnitude. How to get large \nbroadband\n\n[[Page S183]]\n\nproviders on board will become a key part of every business plan. \nBroadband providers would then become gatekeepers to online innovation \nand investment.\n  Broadband investment can also be chilled a second way. The logical \nextension of pay-for-priority is a tiered Internet with premium fast \nlanes and best effort slow lanes. With a tiered Internet, it becomes \nmore profitable to create an artificial bandwidth shortage rather than \nin investing to increase broadband capacity of the local network.\n  The reason is that it is easier to adjust pricing policies than \nforecast the optimum level of investment and be able to finance it at \nfavorable rates. Recall the Internet bubble about a decade ago. That is \nwhy I believe that if pay-for-priority exists, it will ultimately lead \nto a lower level of broadband investment that would occur otherwise.\n  I agree with the need for broadband providers to upgrade the quality \nof their network and increase the available bandwidth to meet the \nanticipated market demand. If end users want more bandwidth or quality-\nof-service assurances they should be willing to pay for it. It is that \nsimple. I have no issue with allowing broadband providers explore \ndifferent pricing options for consumers. My bill doesn't prevent that.\n  Third jobs. Since the advent of the broadband age, there have been \nmore high-value-added, high-paying jobs created by companies operating \nat the edge of the network than companies at the center of the network. \nAnd because of chilled investment and other restrictions, without net \nneutrality rules, I believe we will experience a lower rate of growth \nof broadband-enabled jobs.\n  Let me close by saying that I bring a unique perspective to the \npolicy discussion over net neutrality by virtue of working in the tech \nindustry during the dial-up age and early years of broadband.\n  To put things in perspective, the ideas and language that became the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996 was coming together around the time \nNetscape 1.0 was being introduced commercially.\n  Whether intentionally or unintentionally, that 1996 Telecom Act \naccelerated the roll out of broadband, even though the word Internet \nappeared less then one dozen times. It set the wheels in motion by \nallowing local competition to the offspring of Ma Bell, allowing \ntelecom companies to offer video programming, and allowing cable \ncompanies to offer telecom service.\n  Cable companies responded to this competitive threat, and that from \nthe satellite TV companies due to the Satellite Home Viewing Act, by \nmaking infrastructure investments that allowed them to offer new \nbroadband service over cable modem.\n  Competitive Local Exchange Carriers, taking advantage of their new \nability to line share and access unbundled network elements, also saw \nthe competitive benefits of offering broadband service.\n  The traditional telecom companies, well, at the time they seemed \nfocused on trying to reassemble Ma Bell and having us all buy an extra, \ndedicated landline or two for dial up service.\n  Eventually, the competitive pressure did drive them to make the \nnecessary investment to offer broadband.\n  The business models for delivering broadband Internet access differed \nthan that of dial-up. In their heyday, ISPs such as AOL, CompuServe, \nand Prodigy did not own their own infrastructure; they leased telecom \ntransmission capacity from third parties telecom companies. With \nbroadband, for a number of reasons, there came the much greater \nvertical integration of the ISP and transmission capacity.\n  Looking back, broadband over cable modem flourished under Title II \nthrough 2002, until the FCC deregulated it. Similarly, broadband over \nlandlines flourished under Title II through 2005, until Chairman \nMartin's deregulated it in the wake of the Brand X decision.\n  As Senator Dorgan used to say, having broadband under Title II \nensured that there was a broadband cop on the beat.\n  If there were functioning local markets for broadband services, \nconsumers would have true choices, and I might think differently about \nthe need for legislation. Unfortunately end users in most communities \nhave a limited number of choices at best when it comes to broadband \nInternet access services.\n  At its most basic, that is why we need to return that broadband cop \nto the beat. My bill will do that, and do that without regulating the \nInternet.\n  It will achieve the regulatory certainty industry seems to clamoring \nfor by having the net neutrality protection in statute rather than left \nto agency rule and the politics of each succeeding administration.\n  I don't claim that this bill is a perfect bill. It lays down a marker \nfor where we should start the discussion.\n  Given the complexity of the Internet ecosystem, any legislation will \nhave to be worked through by the Commerce Committee. There are always \ndetails, details, and more details with respect to business models and \nusage cases that need to be considered. For these reasons I recognize \nthat the Commission will need some flexibility in implementing the \nstatute and I believe my language will provide them with just enough.\n  My bill will preserve an open and free Internet, allow for \nbroadband's continued growth, and the economic growth and jobs that it \nwill create.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 74\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Freedom, Broadband \n     Promotion, and Consumer Protection Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Two-way communications networks constitute basic \n     infrastructure that is as essential to our national economy \n     as roads and electricity.\n       (2) The broadband Internet constitutes the most important \n     two-way communications infrastructure of our time.\n       (3) Access to the broadband Internet is critical for job \n     creation, economic growth, and technological innovation.\n       (4) Access to the broadband Internet creates opportunity \n     for more direct civic engagement, increased educational \n     attainment, and enables free speech.\n       (5) The network design principles fostering the development \n     of the broadband Internet to date, an end-to-end design, \n     layered architecture, and open standards, promotes innovation \n     at the edge of the network and gives end users choice and \n     control of their online activities.\n       (6) These network design principles have led to the network \n     neutrality of the Internet, where there are no paid for \n     premium fast lanes and best effort slow lanes.\n       (7) According to the Federal Communications Commission in \n     2009, technologies now allow network operators to distinguish \n     different classes of Internet traffic, to offer different \n     qualities-of-service, and to charge different prices to each \n     class of Internet traffic.\n       (8) Broadband Internet access service providers have an \n     economic interest to discriminate in favor of their own or \n     affiliated services, content, and applications and against \n     other providers of such services, content, and applications.\n       (9) Broadband Internet access service providers have an \n     economic interest in, and the ability to adopt, pay-for-\n     priority schemes to the detriment of job creation, economic \n     growth, innovation, and consumer protections.\n       (10) The market for broadband today demonstrates \n     substantial obstacles to effective competition, to the \n     protection of users, and to the continued viability of a free \n     and open Internet.\n       (11) These obstacles impede the universal deployment and \n     adoption of broadband, impede meeting the goals set forth in \n     the National Broadband Plan, and perpetuate a digital divide.\n       (12) The United States needs clear Federal policy that \n     preserves the historically free and open nature of the \n     Internet, expands the benefits of broadband, and promotes \n     universally available and affordable broadband service that \n     does not chill innovation or speech within the content, \n     applications, and services available online.\n       (13) The Federal policy to ensure that the Internet remains \n     free and open must apply equally to all broadband Internet \n     access services, regardless of whether those services use \n     wire, radio, or some combination of those means to reach the \n     end user.\n\n     SEC. 3.

My bill, the Discount Pricing \nConsumer Protection Act, will restore the nearly century old rule that \nit is illegal under antitrust law for a manufacturer to set a minimum \nprice below which a retailer cannot sell the manufacturer's product, a \npractice known as ``resale price maintenance'' or ``vertical price \nfixing.'' This bill wil ensure that consumers can obtain discount \nprices at the very time they need them the most.\n  In June 2007, overturning a 96-year-old precedent, a narrow 5-4 \nSupreme Court majority in the Leegin case turned the Sherman Act on its \nhead to overturn this basic rule of the marketplace which has served \nconsumers well for nearly a century. My bill--identical to legislation \nI introduced in the last two Congresses--will correct this \nmisinterpretation of antitrust law and restore the per se ban on \nvertical price fixing. My bill has been endorsed by the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, 38 state attorneys general, as well \nas numerous antitrust experts, including former FTC Chairman Pitofsky \nand former FTC Commissioner Harbour, and the leading consumer groups, \nincluding Consumers Union, the Consumers Federation of America, and the \nAmerican Antitrust Institute. This legislation passed the Judiciary \nCommittee last year.\n  The reasons for this legislation are compelling. Allowing \nmanufacturers to set minimum retail prices will threaten the very \nexistence of discounting and discount stores, and lead to higher prices \nfor consumers. For nearly a century the rule against vertical price \nfixing permitted discounters to sell goods at the most competitive \nprice. Many credit this rule with the rise of today's low price, \ndiscount retail giants--stores like Target, Best Buy, Walmart, and the \ninternet sites Amazon and EBay, which offer consumers a wide array of \nhighly desired products at discount prices.\n  Ample evidence exists of the pernicious effect of allowing vertical \nprice fixing. For nearly 40 years until 1975 when Congress passed the \nConsumer Goods Pricing Act, Federal law permitted States to enact so-\ncalled ``fair trade'' laws legalizing vertical price fixing. Studies \nthe Department of Justice conducted in the late 1960s indicated that \nprices were between 18-27 percent higher in the States that allowed \nvertical price fixing than the States that had not passed such ``fair \ntrade'' laws, costing consumers at least $2.1 billion per year at that \ntime.\n  Given the tremendous economic growth in the intervening decades, the \nlikely harm to consumers if vertical price fixing were permitted is \neven greater today. In his dissenting opinion in the Leegin case, \nJustice Breyer estimated that if only 10 percent of manufacturers \nengaged in vertical price fixing, the volume of commerce affected today \nwould be $300 billion, translating into retail bills that would average \n$750 to $1,000 higher for the average family of four every year.\n  The experience of the last three years since the Leegin decision has \nbegun to confirm our fears regarding the dangers from permitting \nvertical price fixing. The Wall Street Journal has reported that more \nthan 5,000 companies have implemented minimum pricing policies. A new \nbusiness--known as ``internet monitors''--has materialized for \ncompanies that scour the Internet in search of retailers selling \nproducts at a bargain. When such bargain sellers are detected, the \nmanufacturer is alerted so that they can demand the seller\n\n[[Page S186]]\n\nend its discounting. There have been many reports of everything from \nconsumer electronics and video games to baby products and toys, rental \ncars and bicycles being subject to minimum retail pricing policies.\n  Defenders of the Leegin decision argue that today's giant retailers \nsuch as Wal-Mart, Best Buy or Target can ``take care of themselves'' \nand have sufficient market power to fight manufacturer efforts to \nimpose retail prices. Whatever the merits of that argument, I am \nparticularly worried about the effect of this new rule permitting \nminimum vertical price fixing on the next generation of discount \nretailers. If new discount retailers can be prevented from selling \nproducts at a discount at the behest of an established retailer worried \nabout the competition, we will imperil an essential element of retail \ncompetition so beneficial to consumers.\n  In overturning the per se ban on vertical price fixing, the Supreme \nCourt in Leegin announced this practice should instead be evaluated \nunder what is known as the ``rule of reason.'' Under the rule of \nreason, a business practice is illegal only if it imposes an \n``unreasonable'' restraint on competition. The burden is on the party \nchallenging the practice to prove in court that the anti-competitive \neffects of the practice outweigh its justifications. In the words of \nthe Supreme Court, the party challenging the practice must establish \nthe restraint's ``history, nature and effect.'' Whether the businesses \ninvolved possess market power ``is a further, significant \nconsideration'' under the rule of reason.\n  In short, establishing that any specific example of vertical price \nfixing violates the rule of reason is an onerous and difficult burden \nfor a plaintiff in an antitrust case. Parties complaining about \nvertical price fixing are likely to be small discount stores or \nconsumers with limited resources to engage in lengthy and complicated \nantitrust litigation. These plaintiffs are unlikely to possess the \nfacts and complicated economic evidence necessary to make the extensive \nshowing necessary to prove a case under the ``rule of reason.'' In the \nwords of former FTC Commissioner Pamela Jones Harbour, applying the \nrule of reason to vertical price fixing ``is a virtual euphemism for \nper se legality.''\n  Our Antitrust Subcommittee conducted two extensive hearings into the \nLeegin decision and the likely effects of abolishing the ban on \nvertical price fixing in the last two Congresses. Both former FTC \nChairman Robert Pitofsky and former FTC Commissioner Harbour strongly \nendorsed restoring the ban on vertical price fixing. Marcy Syms, CEO of \nthe Syms discount clothing stores, and a senior executive of the \nBurlington Coat Factory discount chain testified as well, both citing \nthe likely dangers to the ability of discounters such as Syms to \nsurvive after abolition of the rule against vertical price fixing. Ms. \nSyms also stated that ``it would be very unlikely for her to bring an \nantitrust suit'' challenging vertical price fixing under the rule of \nreason because her company ``would not have the resources, knowledge or \na strong enough position in the market place to make such action \nprudent.'' Our examination of this issue has produced compelling \nevidence for the continued necessity of a ban on vertical price fixing \nto protect discounting and low prices for consumers.\n  The Discount Pricing Consumer Protection Act will accomplish this \ngoal. My legislation is quite simple and direct. It would simply add \none sentence to Section 1 of the Sherman Act--the basic provision \naddressing combinations in restraint of trade--a statement that any \nagreement with a retailer, wholesaler or distributor setting a price \nbelow which a product or service cannot be sold violates the law. No \nbalancing or protracted legal proceedings will be necessary. Should a \nmanufacturer enter into such an agreement it will unquestionably \nviolate antitrust law. The uncertainty and legal impediments to \nantitrust enforcement of vertical price fixing will be replaced by \nsimple and clear legal rule--a legal rule that will promote low prices \nand discount competition to the benefit of consumers every day.\n  In the last few decades, millions of consumers have benefited from an \nexplosion of retail competition from new large discounters in virtually \nevery product, from clothing to electronics to groceries, in both ``big \nbox'' stores and on the Internet. Our legislation will correct the \nSupreme Court's abrupt change to antitrust law, and will ensure that \ntoday's vibrant competitive retail marketplace and the savings gained \nby American consumers from discounting will not be jeopardized by the \nabolition of the ban on vertical price fixing. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 75\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Discount Pricing Consumer \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) From 1911 in the Dr. Miles decision until June 2007 in \n     the Leegin decision, the Supreme Court had ruled that the \n     Sherman Act forbid in all circumstances the practice of a \n     manufacturer setting a minimum price below which any \n     retailer, wholesaler or distributor could not sell the \n     manufacturer's product (the practice of ``resale price \n     maintenance'' or ``vertical price fixing'').\n       (2) The rule of per se illegality forbidding resale price \n     maintenance promoted price competition and the practice of \n     discounting all to the substantial benefit of consumers and \n     the health of the economy.\n       (3) Many economic studies showed that the rule against \n     resale price maintenance led to lower prices and promoted \n     consumer welfare.\n       (4) Abandoning the rule against resale price maintenance \n     will likely lead to higher prices paid by consumers and \n     substantially harms the ability of discount retail stores to \n     compete. For 40 years prior to 1975, Federal law permitted \n     states to enact so-called ``fair trade'' laws allowing \n     vertical price fixing. Studies conducted by the Department of \n     Justice in the late 1960s indicated that retail prices were \n     between 18 and 27 percent higher in states that allowed \n     vertical price fixing than those that did not. Likewise, a \n     1983 study by the Bureau of Economics of the Federal Trade \n     Commission found that, in most cases, resale price \n     maintenance increased the prices of products sold.\n       (5) The 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court majority in \n     Leegin incorrectly interpreted the Sherman Act and improperly \n     disregarded 96 years of antitrust law precedent in \n     overturning the per se rule against resale price maintenance.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to correct the Supreme Court's mistaken interpretation \n     of the Sherman Act in the Leegin decision; and\n       (2) to restore the rule that agreements between \n     manufacturers and retailers, distributors or wholesalers to \n     set the minimum price below which the manufacturer's product \n     or service cannot be sold violates the Sherman Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON VERTICAL PRICE FIXING.\n\n       (a) Amendment to the Sherman Act.--Section 1 of the Sherman \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 1) is amended by adding after the first \n     sentence the following: ``Any contract, combination, \n     conspiracy or agreement setting a minimum price below which a \n     product or service cannot be sold by a retailer, wholesaler, \n     or distributor shall violate this Act.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect 90 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Begich, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. \n        Cornyn, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 80. A bill to provide a permanent deduction for State and local \ngeneral sales taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \npermanently correct an injustice in the tax code that has harmed \ncitizens in many States of this great Nation.\n  State and local governments have various alternatives for raising \nrevenue. Some levy income taxes, some use sales taxes, and others use a \ncombination of the two. The citizens who pay State and local income \ntaxes have been able to offset some of their Federal income taxes by \nreceiving a deduction for those State and local income taxes. Before \n1986, taxpayers also had the ability to deduct their sales taxes.\n  The philosophy behind these deductions is simple: people should not \nhave to pay taxes on their taxes. The money that people must give to \none level of government should not also be taxed by another level of \ngovernment.\n  Unfortunately, citizens of some States were treated differently after\n\n[[Page S187]]\n\n1986 when the deduction for State and local sales taxes was eliminated. \nThis discriminated against those living in States, such as my home \nState of Texas, with no income taxes. It is important to remember the \nlack of an income tax does not mean citizens in these States do not pay \nState taxes; revenues are simply collected differently.\n  It is unfair to give citizens from some States a deduction for the \nrevenue they provide their State and local governments, while not doing \nthe same for citizens from other States. Federal tax law should not \ntreat people differently on the basis of State residence and differing \ntax collection methods, and it should not provide an incentive for \nStates to establish income taxes over sales taxes.\n  This discrepancy has a significant impact on Texas. According to the \nTexas Comptroller, extending the deduction would save Texans a \nprojected $1.2 billion a year, or an average of $520 per filer claiming \nthe deduction. The Texas Comptroller also estimates continuing the \ndeduction is associated with 15,700 to 25,700 Texas jobs and $1.1 \nbillion to $1.4 billion in gross state product.\n  Recognizing the inequity in the tax code, Congress reinstated the \nsales tax deduction in 2004 and authorized it for 2 years. Congress \nfurther extended the sales tax deduction in 2006 and 2008, \nrespectively. On January 1, 2010, however, the sales tax deduction \nexpired, and, for much of this past year, many Americans once again \nfaced the prospect of paying Federal income taxes on their State and \nlocal sales taxes.\n  Fortunately, under the recent agreement to extend the broader tax \nrelief for all Americans, Congress staved off the return of the sales \ntax deduction by extending it for 2 years, retroactive to January 1, \n2010. However, this deduction is only in effect through 2011, and we \nmust act to prevent the inequity from returning.\n  The legislation I am offering today will fix this problem for good by \nmaking the State and local sales tax deduction permanent. This will \npermanently end the discrimination suffered by my fellow Texans and \ncitizens of other States who do not have the option of an income tax \ndeduction.\n  This legislation is about reestablishing equity to the tax code and \ndefending the important principle of eliminating taxes on taxes. I hope \nmy fellow Senators will support this effort and pass this legislation, \nand I appreciate the backing of Senators Barrasso, Begich, Cornyn, \nAlexander, Enzi and Thune who have already signed on as co-sponsors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 80\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF DEDUCTION FOR STATE AND \n                   LOCAL GENERAL SALES TAXES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (I) of section 164(b)(5) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended by section 722 \n     of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, \n     and Job Creation Act of 2010, is amended by striking ``, and \n     before January 1, 2012''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2011.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mrs. Feinstein (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):-\n  S. 97. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nestablish a grant program to support the restoration of San Francisco \nBay; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. REID for Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Boxer to introduce legislation to further the \nrestoration of the San Francisco Bay.\n  There are many areas in the country in which restoration is done, and \nI am pleased to introduce an authorization for restoration work in the \nSan Francisco Bay with Senator Boxer, Chairwoman of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. Companion legislation will also \nbe introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congresswoman \nJackie Speier.\n  As Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, \nand Related Agencies, I secured $17 million in Federal funding for \necosystem restoration and water quality work in the San Francisco Bay \nin the last three years. I also secured $15 million since 2006 for the \nFish and Wildlife Service to restore salt ponds to tidal wetlands in \nthe Bay.\n  It is necessary to ensure that these funds continue to be \nappropriated and are spent on the most important projects for the \necosystem and public benefit.\n  To that end, this legislation will prioritize funding for projects \nthat will protect and restore vital estuarine habitat for migratory \nwaterfowl, shorebirds, and wildlife; improve and restore water quality \nand rearing habitat for fish; and ensure public benefits.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 97\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote the production of molybdenum-99 in the \nUnited States for medical isotope production, and to condition and \nphase out the export of highly enriched uranium for the production of \nmedical isotopes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the American \nMedical Isotopes Production Act of 2011. The purpose of the bill is to \nprovide certainty in developing a domestic supply of molybdenum-99, \nwhich is used to produce technetium-99m, one of the most widely used \nmedical isotopes in the United States. Right now we import all of our \nmolybdenum-99 from outside the United States, primarily Canada and the \nNetherlands, from reactors that are old and that will most likely be \nshut down within the next 10 years. In addition, this bill moves us \naway from using highly enriched bomb-grade uranium targets to those \nthat are low-enriched; that is, that are less than 20 percent in the \nfissile isotope uranium-235. I think this is a very important \nnonproliferation goal because the world is currently in discussion with \nIran on replacing fuel and targets from their medical isotopes reactor; \nwe should lead by example in dealing in this area with countries like \nIran that can now enrich nuclear fuel.\n  The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a very detailed \nhearing on this topic last Congress. The bill we reported unanimously \nhad a wide body of support among the medical isotopes and non-\nproliferation communities. I am attaching several letters from the last \nCongress as evidence of the wide support for this bill.\n  The new bill that I am introducing today is identical to the bill \nreported by the Committee in the last Congress, H.R. 3276, as amended. \nThere are only two differences between this bill and the one from the \nlast Congress. The authorization level has been lowered by $20 million \nto account for the fact that we are in fiscal year 2011 and not fiscal \nyear 2010, and technical PAYGO language has been added.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 99\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, U.S. Capitol, S-221, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, U.S. Capitol, S-231, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lisa Murkowski,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \n         Resources, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, \n     Chairman Bingaman, and Ranking Member Murkowski: The Society \n     of Nuclear Medicine (SNM), a leading, multidisciplinary \n     international scientific and professional organization with \n     more than 17,000 physician, technologist, and scientist \n     members dedicated to promoting the science, technology, and \n     practical applications of molecular imaging and nuclear \n     medicine, respectfully requests that the Senate to take up \n     and pass the American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2009 \n     (H.R. 3276) as a stand-alone bill or as an amendment to an \n     appropriate legislative vehicle. Recent disruptions in the \n     international supply of Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) have \n     highlighted the urgent need to ensure a domestic supply for \n     the U.S. H.R. 3276 would help to ensure a domestic supply of \n     Mo-99 over the long term and curtail the use of highly-\n     enriched uranium (HEU) in radionuclide production as a non-\n     proliferation strategy to deter terrorism.\n       As you know, the House of Representatives approved this \n     bill by an overwhelming vote of 400--17 on November 5, 2009 \n     and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee \n     reported this bill favorably with amendments on January 28, \n     2010. SNM believes that rapid passage of this legislation is \n     essential to ensure Americans' access to vital medical \n     radionuclides and give patients timely access to appropriate \n     heart and cancer testing.\n       Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) decays into Technetium-99m (Tc-99m), \n     which is used in approximately 16 million nuclear medicine \n     procedures each year in the U.S. Tc-99m is used in the \n     detection and staging of cancer, detection of heart disease, \n     detection of thyroid disease, study of brain and kidney \n     function, and imaging of stress fractures. In addition to \n     pinpointing the underlying cause of disease, physicians can \n     actually see how a disease is affecting other functions in \n     the body. Imaging with Tc-99m is an important part of patient \n     care. SNM, along with thousands of nuclear medicine \n     physicians in the U.S., has, over the course of the last two \n     years, been disturbed about supply interruptions of Mo-99 \n     from foreign vendors and the lack of a reliable supplier of \n     Mo-99 in the U.S. Due to these recent shutdowns in Canada, \n     numerous nuclear medicine professionals across the country \n     have delayed or had to cancel imaging procedures. Because Mo-\n     99 is produced through the fission of uranium and has a half-\n     life of 66 hours, it cannot be produced and then stored for \n     long periods of time. Unlike traditional pharmaceuticals, \n     which are dispensed by pharmacists or sold over-the-\n\n[[Page S190]]\n\n     counter, nuclear reactors produce radioactive isotopes that \n     are processed and provided to hospitals and other nuclear \n     medicine facilities based on demand. Any disruption to the \n     supply chain can wreak havoc on patient access to important \n     medical imaging procedures.\n       In order to ensure that patient needs are not compromised, \n     a continuous reliable supply of medical radioisotopes is \n     essential.\n       Currently there are no facilities in the U.S. that are \n     dedicated to manufacturing Mo-99 for Mo-99/Tc-99m generators. \n     The United States must develop domestic capabilities to \n     produce Mo-99 and not rely solely on foreign suppliers. The \n     legislation encourages domestic production of Mo-99 for \n     medical isotopes without HEU in two different ways. First, it \n     would facilitate the operation of new facilities by granting \n     the government the ability ``to retain responsibility for the \n     final disposition of radioactive waste'' under uranium-lease \n     agreements. The Department of Energy (DoE) does not currently \n     have this ability and cannot assume the responsibility for \n     domestic producers' radioactive waste. The bill also \n     authorizes government cost-sharing which would subsidize \n     construction of production facilities. Without the multi-year \n     authorization that is included in H.R. 3276, investments in \n     domestic productive facilities will be prohibitively \n     uncertain.\n       There is significant support for passing this piece of \n     legislation, which has been endorsed by a variety of \n     organizations. Further, at a House Energy and Environment \n     Subcommittee on September 9, 2009, Parrish Staples, the U.S. \n     official who oversees medical isotope production at DoE's \n     National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) testified as \n     follows:\n\n       ``NNSA is working on several Cooperative Agreements to \n     potential commercial Mo-99 producers, whose projects are in \n     the most advanced stages of development, accelerating their \n     efforts to begin producing Mo-99 in quantities adequate to \n     the U.S. medical community's demand by the end of 2013. . . . \n     The American Medical Isotopes Production Act of 2009 is \n     crucial to ensuring the success of these efforts to \n     accelerate development of a domestic supply of Mo-99 with the \n     use of HEU.\n\n       At the subsequent Senate hearing, Dr. Staples stated:\n\n       ``Currently, we are working or we would intend to work that \n     we would develop four independent technologies, each capable \n     of supplying up to 50 percent of the U.S. demand. Obviously, \n     in theory, that means that if each of these are successful, \n     we could supply the global requirement for this isotope''--\n     roughly twice the U.S. domestic demand. In other words, under \n     the legislation, the projected U.S. domestic production \n     capacity could satisfy US demand prior to the cutoff of HEU \n     exports, even if only half of the four main projects \n     succeeded.''\n\n       Passage of this legislation is necessary to help address \n     the future needs of patients by promoting the production of \n     Mo-99 in the United States. We thank you for your efforts and \n     look forward to continuing to work with you on this important \n     issue.

Jeff Bingaman, Chair\n     Hon. Lisa Murkowski, Ranking Member\n     Energy and Natural Resources Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Bingaman and Murkowski: On behalf of the \n     Health Physics Society (HPS), I urge the Senate Energy and \n     Natural Resources Committee to give full support to and take \n     timely action on H.R. 3276, the ``American Medical Isotope \n     Production Act of 2009.''\n       The Health Physics Society, a nonprofit scientific \n     organization of approximately 5000 radiation safety \n     professionals, has joined with eight other professional \n     organizations in a coalition to address two concerns of \n     national importance: (1) an inherent need for reliable \n     domestic suppliers of Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99); and, (2) efforts \n     to curtail the use of high-enriched uranium (HEU) in \n     radionuclide production as a non-proliferation strategy and \n     to deter terrorism. A discussion of these concerns with \n     recommendations for action by the United States is contained \n     in a white paper by the coalition of professional \n     organizations titled ``Reliable Domestic & Global Supplier of \n     Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) and Switch from Highly Enriched Uranium \n     (HEU) to Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) to Produce Mo-99.'' The \n     white paper is accessible at http://hps.org/documents/\nisotopes_white-paper_multiorganization.pdf.\n       A national effort to address these concerns requires (1) a \n     commitment by the administration to have a coordinated inter-\n     agency program with the specific responsibility to achieve \n     reliable domestic independence in the production of Mo-99, \n     (2) continued appropriations by Congress to provide the \n     financial investment needed by the administration's program, \n     and (3) support of the Congress through authorizing \n     legislation that will serve as the basis for the continuation \n     of the administration's program until its goals are achieved.\n       The Obama administration has made a commitment to achieve \n     domestic independence in the production of Mo-99. The HPS \n     believes the initiative being led by the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration through the Global Threat Reduction \n     Initiative with oversight and interagency coordination by the \n     Office of Science and Technology Policy has the capability to \n     achieve the establishment of a reliable domestic production \n     of Mo-99 within the next ten years. The Congress has \n     appropriated sufficient support for fiscal year 2010. The \n     remaining task is to obtain congressional support through \n     authorizing legislation that will serve as the support and \n     basis for the administration's program into the future.\n       The HPS believes H.R. 3276 provides the needed \n     congressional support for the administration's program.\n       We understand there may be some concern about the \n     provisions in H.R. 3276 for imposing a ban on export of HEU \n     at a fixed time in the future. HPS's interest in the issue of \n     domestic production of radioisotopes is related to the \n     radiation safety implications of the issue, including the \n     implications of exporting HEU for this purpose. In 2005, the \n     HPS did not support the inclusion of an HEU export ban \n     provision in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The HPS felt that \n     the controls under which HEU was exported were rigorous \n     enough to make the export acceptably safe when compared to \n     the prospect of not having a supply of Mo-99. This position \n     was influenced by the lack of any administration program or \n     congressional support for a program dedicated to the domestic \n     production of radioisotopes. The HPS still considers the \n     controls for export of HEU for production of radioisotopes to \n     be rigorous enough to make the risk of diversion for \n     terrorism, or other malicious use of the HEU to be \n     speculative. However, we feel that with appropriate \n     congressional support, the initiative to establish reliable \n     domestic production of Mo-99 will be successful within the \n     next ten years, making the need to export HEU unnecessary. \n     Therefore, we feel the export ban provisions will prove to be \n     extraneous and, therefore, do not form a basis for not \n     supporting H.R. 3276.\n       I hope this letter is helpful in your considered \n     deliberation of action on H.R. 3276. Please do not hesitate \n     to contact me if you have any questions about this letter or \n     HPS support for H.R. 3276.\n           Sincerely,\n     Howard W. Dickson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 23, 2010.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lisa Murkowski,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member Murkowski: As a \n     coalition made up of the Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM), \n     American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM), \n     American College of Radiology (ACR), American Nuclear Society \n     (ANS), American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC), \n     American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), Health \n     Physics Society (HPS), Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), \n     Academy of Molecular Imaging (AMI), the non-proliferation \n     community, Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), National \n     Association of Nuclear Pharmacies (NANP) and the Council on \n     Radionuclides and Radiopharmaceuticals (CORAR), we ask that \n     you support the timely passage of H.R. 3276, the American \n     Medical Isotope Production Act of 2009. The Senate Energy and \n     Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on the bill \n     December 3, 2009, and unanimously approved the bill with an \n     amendment on December 16, 2009. We understand it is currently \n     on the Senate calendar but we are asking for your assistance \n     in bringing this legislation forward for action by the \n     Senate.\n       H.R. 3276 is urgently needed legislation that would provide \n     the U.S. Department of Energy the authority to aid in the \n     domestic development of essential medical isotope production. \n     H.R. 3276 is intended to help ensure that U.S. patients have \n     a stable and reliable supply of diagnostic and therapeutic \n     medical isotopes within the next ten years, while converting \n     the production process to avoid highly enriched uranium \n     (HEU), in keeping with U.S. non-proliferation policy.\n       The legislation would facilitate the adequate production of \n     isotopes without HEU prior to the restriction of HEU exports. \n     In the unexpected event that conversion were delayed, the \n     legislation provides for a waiver to permit continued HEU \n     exports to avoid a ``critical shortage'' of isotopes. The \n     legislation thus ensures both the supply of isotopes and the \n     timely phase out of HEU exports.\n       Moreover, as you may know, on November 5, 2009, the House \n     passed H.R. 3276 by a vote of 400-17. Sponsored by \n     Representative Edward Markey (D-Mass.) and Representative \n     Fred Upton (R-Mich.), the Act is balanced, bipartisan \n     legislation that addresses the current shortfall in the \n     availability of critical medical isotopes that has had a high \n     negative impact on patients in the U.S.\n       Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) is a critical medical radioisotope \n     whose decay product Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) is used in more \n     than 16 million nuclear medicine procedures annually across \n     the nation. Physicians who use Tc-99m for the diagnosis of \n     common cancers, heart and other diseases, fully rely upon a \n     steady and predictable supply. The very\n\n[[Page S191]]\n\n     short six-hour half-life of Tc-99m, while beneficial to \n     patients and health care professionals, precludes any efforts \n     to maintain an inventory. In addition, the domestic supply of \n     Mo-99 (to produce Tc-99m-generators) is entirely dependent \n     upon aging foreign reactors that have faced extended \n     shutdowns for repair and maintenance.\n       As a consequence, the U.S. supply has been repeatedly and \n     significantly disrupted. Many patients who need imaging with \n     Tc-99m-based radiopharmaceuticals are now facing lengthy \n     delays in the availability of nuclear medicine imaging, or \n     being forced to resort to alternative diagnostic and \n     therapeutic procedures that may involve the potential of more \n     invasive procedures (with possible higher clinical risks to \n     patients), greater radiation dosage, lower accuracy, and \n     higher costs.\n       Additionally, the reliance on foreign reactors for the \n     supply of Mo-99 requires the U.S. to ship highly enriched \n     uranium, material of interest for use in nuclear terrorism, \n     out of the country. Domestic production of Mo-99 will \n     eliminate the risk that this nuclear material can be diverted \n     for terrorists' use, thus increasing the effectiveness of the \n     U.S. program for non-proliferation of nuclear materials.\n       The coalition believes the initiative being led by the \n     National Nuclear Security Administration through the Global \n     Threat Reduction Initiative with oversight and interagency \n     coordination by the Office of Science and Technology Policy \n     has the capability to achieve the establishment of a reliable \n     domestic production of Mo-99 within the next ten years. The \n     Congress has appropriated sufficient support for fiscal year \n     2010. The remaining task is to obtain congressional support \n     through authorizing legislation that will serve as the \n     support and basis for the administration's program into the \n     future.\n       In order to avoid compromising patient care and increasing \n     medical costs, a continuous and reliable supply of medical \n     radioisotopes is clearly essential. It is also critical that \n     domestic production capability for Mo-99 be developed. H.R. \n     3276 provides the needed support to accelerate the process of \n     conversion so that the industry can move even more \n     aggressively in this direction and be able to meet the time \n     frame highlighted in this bill.\n       Senator, we hope you will join the patients, physicians, \n     nuclear non-proliferation community, radioisotope \n     manufacturers, and our coalition of professional \n     organizations to quickly enact H.R. 3276. We would welcome \n     the opportunity to answer any question you or your staff may \n     have about the bill or the medical isotope industry.

A bill to authorize the application of State law with respect \nto vehicle weight limitations on the Interstate Highway System in the \nStates of Maine and Vermont; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, improving public safety, growing our \neconomy, increasing energy independence, and protecting the environment \nhave always been among my top priorities as a Senator. Today, the very \nfirst bill I am introducing in this new Congress will advance all of \nthose goals by allowing the heaviest trucks to travel on our Federal \ninterstate highways in Maine rather than being forced to use secondary \nroads and downtown streets.\n  I am delighted to have the senior Senator from Vermont, Patrick \nLeahy, as my Democratic cosponsor, and my good friend and colleague \nfrom Maine, Olympia Snowe, also as an original cosponsor. Vermont has \nthe same problem as we do in Maine. Thus the bill I am introducing \napplies to our two States.\n  In 2009, I authored a law to establish a 1-year pilot project that \nallowed trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds to travel on Maine's \nFederal interstates--I-95, 195, 295, and 395. According to the results \nof a preliminary study by the Maine Department of Transportation, this \npilot project, which ran until mid-December of last year, helped to \npreserve and create jobs by allowing Maine's businesses to receive raw \nmaterials and to ship their products more economically.\n  Also important, the pilot program improved safety, saved energy, and \nreduced carbon emissions. Let me give a specific example. On a trip \nfrom Hampden to Houlton, ME, the benefits are obvious. A truck \ntraveling on I-95 rather than on Route 2 avoids more than 270 \nintersections, 9 school crossings, 30 traffic lights, and 86 \ncrosswalks. In addition, the driver also saves more than $30 on fuel. \nGiven the cost of diesel, it is probably even higher than that now. \nAdditionally, 50 minutes is saved by traveling on Interstate 95 rather \nthan on the secondary road of Route 2.\n  Unfortunately, despite the clear success of this pilot project and \nthe strong support of the administration and many of my colleagues in \nthe Senate, the House of Representatives failed to include my provision \nmaking the pilot permanent in the Federal funding bill. As a result, \nfor both Maine and Vermont, the program expired on December 17 and the \nheavy trucks are once again unable to use our most modern, safe, and \nefficient highways.\n  It is important to emphasize that our legislation does not increase \nthe size or the weight of trucks in our States. Maine law already \nallows trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds to operate on State and \nmunicipal roads. Heavy trucks already operate on some 22,500 miles of \nnon-Interstate roads in Maine, in addition to the approximately 167 \nmiles of the Maine turnpike. But the nearly 260 miles of non-turnpike \ninterstates that are the major economic corridors in my State are off \nlimits. This simply makes no sense.\n  Furthermore, trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds are already \npermitted on many Federal interstates in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, \nNew York, and the neighboring provinces in Canada. So that puts Maine \nand Vermont at a distinct competitive disadvantage. All around us, the \nStates and our Canadian counterparts allow the heavier trucks to use \nthe Federal interstates, but unfortunately Maine and Vermont have been \nexcluded. That is why my friend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, has joined \nme in this effort to help provide a level playing field for our States.\n\n  Here are a few more important points about our bill.\n  The 100,000-pound trucks are no larger or wider than 80,000-pound \ntrucks. This change would remove an estimated 7.8 million truck miles \nfrom our local roads and streets. Increasing the truck payloads by 35 \npercent would reduce the overall number of trucks needed. In addition \nto saving fuel by traveling fewer miles, the steady pace of interstate \ndriving improves the fuel economy of trucks by 14 to 21 percent. And \nthe Maine Department of Transportation's engineers say they are \nconfident our interstate bridges are safe and can handle the additional \nweight in the State of Maine.\n  Countless Maine small business owners have told me how this change \nwould improve their competitiveness. For example, at a recent press \nconference, Keith Van Scotter discussed the savings his company accrued \nunder the pilot project. Under the pilot project, his company Lincoln \nPaper and Tissue was able to save 1.1 million billable truck miles, a \n28 percent decrease from the year before. These savings are the \nequivalent of the company being 220 miles closer to its primary market. \nAlso, the owner-operator of a logging business in Penobscot County said \nthat being able to transport his pulpwood to the mill on I-95 rather \nthan on secondary roads would save his company at least 118 gallons of \nfuel each week. That benefits not only this small business but also our \nNation as we seek to reduce our overall fuel consumption and reduce \ncarbon emissions.\n  The pilot program has also made a dramatic improvement for some of \nour communities. According to the Maine DOT, before the pilot program \nbegan last December of 2009, more than 200 heavy trucks heading north \non Route 201 crawled through downtown Vassalboro a small town of about \n4,000--each day even though I-95 runs\n\n[[Page S192]]\n\nparallel just a few miles away. During the span of the pilot program, \nthe number of northbound trucks on Route 201 decreased by roughly 90 \npercent. These trucks were using the interstate where they belong.\n  I will tell you that since the pilot project expired, so many of my \nconstituents have talked to me about the return of these heavy trucks \nto the residential neighborhoods in which they live, to downtown \nPortland, Orono, Brewer, Freeport, and other towns throughout our \nState. The fact is, this kind of road congestion caused by diverting \nthese heavy trucks into downtowns and along secondary roads can lead to \ntragedy. A study conducted by a nationally recognized traffic \nconsulting firm found that the crash rate of semitrailer trucks on \nMaine's secondary roads were 7 to 10 times higher than on the turnpike. \nIt estimated that allowing these trucks to stay on the interstates \ncould result in three fewer fatal crashes each year. Public safety \nagencies in Maine, including the Maine State Police, have long \nsupported my efforts to bring about this change. In fact, Bangor's \npolice chief joined me at a press conference last week where he spoke \neloquently about the safety implications for downtown Bangor.\n  In 2010, as a result of this pilot project, people throughout our \nState saw their roads less congested, our States safer, our air \ncleaner, and, most important, our businesses more competitive. That is \nwhy I am so committed to ensuring that these improvements are allowed \nto continue and are made permanent.\n  This legislation simply is common sense. It will benefit our economy \nas well as lower fuel costs and make our roads safer for most tourists \nand pedestrians. Most important, we now have the concrete evidence from \nthis pilot project showing why this bill should become law.\n  I am grateful for the support and leadership of my colleague from \nVermont and the steadfast support from Maine's senior Senator as well. \nI urge its swift passage. This is the highest priority I have for the \nState of Maine this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na number of letters I have received endorsing this bill. These letters \nare from the Maine Motor Transport Association, the City of Bangor's \nchief of police, the Professional Logging Contractors, the Northeast \nRegion for the Forestry Resources Association, and from a well-known \ntrucking firm in Maine, H.O. Bouchard.\n  In addition, I expect to have a letter from the Governor of Maine \nlater today that I will also ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Maine Motor Transport Association,\n\n                                 Augusta, Maine, January 21, 2011.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: Your introduction of the bill to \n     permanently increase the truck weight limit on Maine highways \n     comes as great news for the trucking industry, for shippers \n     and consumers who rely on efficient transportation of goods \n     and for the people of our state who utilize these roads. We \n     have heard from many of our members who were thrilled to \n     operate on the entire interstate system in Maine under the \n     recently-expired pilot project, as well as hearing from \n     citizens who live along the previously traveled truck routes \n     who were happy to have them off Maine's secondary roads. Your \n     support for this common sense solution has been tremendous \n     and we very much appreciate your continued efforts to educate \n     your peers in the Senate.\n       As you know, when Federal Highway froze interstate weight \n     limits in 1998 and allowed the Maine Turnpike and southern \n     portions of 1-95 to be grandfathered, there was much concern \n     about the same things that concern some people from other \n     states now--safety and the impact on our infrastructure. \n     Results in Maine have shown these concerns were unnecessary \n     as there is ample proof of the improved safety and \n     infrastructure costs and all we ask is for Maine to close the \n     donut hole that puts us at a competitive disadvantage with \n     our neighbors all around us. New Hampshire, Massachusetts and \n     Canada already have permanently higher weight limits on their \n     entire interstate system which put our businesses at a \n     disadvantage, a fact not lost on the hundreds of small \n     trucking companies hauling raw materials to the few mills \n     still left in this state. A strong argument can be made that \n     this is an economic development issue with many jobs at stake \n     for the mills that rely on efficient transportation with both \n     their inbound freight and the outbound movement of goods to \n     markets outside Maine.\n       Your proposal to allow for a more productive vehicle \n     configuration makes sense for both state and federal roads. \n     More efficient configurations mean fewer trucks on the road. \n     Fewer trucks on the road reduce engine emissions and promote \n     fuel conservation, all while lessening our dependence on \n     foreign oil. The whole notion that heavier trucks will use \n     more fuel and pollute more is inherently false, especially \n     since it would take approximately three trucks operating at \n     80,000 pounds to replace two trucks operating at 100,000 \n     pounds to haul the same amount of freight.\n       In fact, a study by the American Transportation Research \n     Institute (ATRI) commissioned by the Maine DOT found that the \n     fuel efficiency of these rigs would improve up to 21 percent \n     by allowing state weight limits on the entire highway system \n     and emissions would decrease from 6 to 11 percent. \n     Extrapolating their findings over an entire week resulted in \n     savings of as much as 675 gallons of fuel, up to 6.8 metric \n     tons of CO2 and almost 94 grams of Particulate Matter. Yes, \n     that's each week and only from trucks shifting from Route 9 \n     to 1-95 once the weight limit exemption pilot project went \n     into effect. This efficiency has gone away now that the pilot \n     project has expired.\n       Safety, however, is the most important reason to embrace \n     this pilot project and we are proud that the safety record of \n     the trucking industry continues to improve. Federal Highway \n     Administration statistics tracking truck-involved crashes has \n     shown consistent improvement by the trucking industry, with \n     current crash rates at the lowest levels since the U.S. \n     Department of Transportation began tracking large truck \n     safety records in 1975. Not resting on our accomplishments, \n     the trucking industry is actively working on ways we can \n     improve highway safety by improving driver performance with \n     rigorous licensing and training, focusing on equipment \n     improvements and by giving carriers access to the proper \n     tools that are critical for them to fulfill their \n     responsibility to the safety of the motoring public.\n       Allowing these trucks to use the safer interstate system \n     would also decrease the interactions with other vehicles and \n     pedestrians if they are able to avoid secondary roads and \n     having to go past driveways and through towns to deliver \n     their goods that move the Maine economy. A four lane divided \n     highway with all traffic going in the same direction at \n     relatively the same speed has been statistically proven to be \n     the safer road for all vehicles--not just trucks.\n       It's hard to find a topic that garners widespread and \n     bipartisan support these days when partisan bickering and \n     political polarization are the norm. This issue is not only \n     strongly supported by groups you would expect like the \n     trucking, oil dealers and forest products industries, but it \n     also finds support from the Maine Legislature, \n     municipalities, the Maine DOT, Maine Department of Public \n     Safety as well as the Maine State Police and many local and \n     regional chambers of commerce. We all may not see eye-to-eye \n     on every public policy issue, but we are in lock step on this \n     one.\n       There may never be a better opportunity than now to enact a \n     permanent solution relative to vehicle productivity. The \n     Maine Motor Transport Association, our members and our \n     partner trade associations will work diligently to provide \n     you with additional statistics and information as they become \n     available. Your work on this issue, especially getting the \n     pilot project implemented last year, has not gone unnoticed \n     by our members and we continue to appreciate your efforts to \n     address it in your recently proposed bill.\n       If Maine is going to be able to compete in a regional and \n     global economy, it is essential that we encourage efficient, \n     effective and safe transportation solutions such as the one \n     you have proposed. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Brian D. Parke,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            City of Bangor, Maine,\n\n\n                                            Police Department,\n\n                                                 January 24, 2011.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Dirkson Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: First and foremost, thank you again \n     for being a champion for the effort to increase the truck \n     weight limits on Maine's interstate highways. Without your \n     diligence and dedication to this extremely important matter, \n     any further progress to correct the inconceivable injustice \n     of the current law would be most assuredly abandoned for the \n     foreseeable future. Your legislation, which would allow \n     trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds on all of Maine's \n     Interstate highways, would correct this injustice once and \n     for all.\n       I would like to reiterate what I have previously stated \n     regarding the present law that forces trucks weighing over \n     80,000 pounds off Maine's interstate highways. These trucks \n     do not belong on Maine's city streets and secondary roads, \n     just as they do not belong on those of New Hampshire, \n     Massachusetts, and New York. I, along with other Maine chiefs \n     of police across the state, believe that these trucks pose a \n     significant risk to the safety of citizens as they travel \n     upon the populated city streets and narrow and winding rural \n     roads of Maine's cities and towns. We have seen, first hand, \n     the dangers these trucks pose to Maine citizens as they \n     travel on our secondary roads. The constant changing of \n     speeds and their repeated starts and stops cause regular \n     disruption to the flow of local traffic, and their presence \n     have resulted in traffic accidents and tragedies.\n\n[[Page S193]]\n\n     During the winter months, Maine's secondary roads become much \n     narrower, rural roads are more slippery, and speed limits are \n     reduced, thereby increasing the danger to pedestrians and \n     other drivers. No matter how experienced the truck driver may \n     be, they cannot stop these trucks on a dime; they cannot \n     anticipate every situation that can occur in heavily \n     populated areas; and they cannot prevent the shifting of \n     their heavy loads from occurring.\n       It is important to do everything possible to insure safety \n     for the public. Therefore, I offer my utmost support for your \n     legislation that will keep these heavy loads on Maine's \n     interstate highways where they belong. I continue to \n     encourage you and others, like Senator Leahy of Vermont, to \n     continue your efforts to keep these 100,000 pound trucks on \n     interstate highways, and off our local streets and rural \n     roads.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Ronald K.

Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing to express the \n     Professional Logging Contractors of Maine's full support for \n     your proposed legislation to permanently allow trucks \n     weighing up to 100,000 pounds to use federal Interstate \n     highways in Maine and Vermont.\n       Our logger members rely on trucks to deliver their logs, \n     chips and biomass to market. We are surrounded by states and \n     provinces which allow higher Interstate truck weights, \n     putting loggers in rural Maine at a significant competitive \n     disadvantage. Many of our members are small business owners \n     for whom the increased costs of being forced to make longer, \n     less efficient trips on secondary roads could make the \n     difference between profitability and unprofitability. This \n     could lead some business owners to exit the market place, \n     costing jobs and placing an additional strain on wood \n     supplies.\n       Interstate highways are designed and built to handle higher \n     truck weights and wherever possible trucks should be able to \n     utilize this system, taking unnecessary traffic off of state \n     and local highways and out of our communities. PLC of Maine \n     believes each state should have the right to adjust the \n     weight limits on Interstates within its borders to meet the \n     needs of its people.\n       Last year's pilot project in Maine, allowing 100,000 pound \n     trucks to access Interstate highways, was tremendously \n     successful. The loss of the pilot in December was a real blow \n     to our loggers, the forest products industry, and our rural \n     communities as well.\n       Restoring the terms of the pilot is one action Congress can \n     take that would immediately benefit industry and the public, \n     without imposing new burdens on taxpayers. The benefits of \n     the increased weight limits are clear:\n       Safety--Fewer miles travelled, on safer roads, with reduced \n     contact with pedestrians, automobiles, rail crossings and \n     school zones;\n       Environmental--Reduced fuel consumption, reduced emissions \n     from start and stops; and\n       Economic--Reduced secondary road and bridge wear, improved \n     truck efficiency for loggers.\n       Please let me know if there is anything the Professional \n     Logging Contractors of Maine can do to promote your \n     legislation. Thank you again for your continued support for \n     Maine's loggers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Michael A. Beardsley,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Forest Resources\n\n\n                                            Association, Inc.,\n\n                                     Holden, ME, January 21, 2011.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing to express the Forest \n     Resources Association's full support for your proposed \n     legislation which would permanently allow trucks weighing up \n     to 100,000 pounds to use federal Interstate highways in Maine \n     and Vermont.\n       Our members--forest landowners, loggers, truckers, wood-\n     using mills, and associated businesses, as well as our \n     families and neighbors--all rely on safe and efficient \n     transportation of goods and services by truck for our \n     livelihoods.\n       Our industry relies on trucks to deliver raw materials from \n     the forest to our mills and shipment of finished product to \n     market. We are surrounded by states and provinces which allow \n     higher Interstate truck weights, putting our industry in \n     rural Maine at a significant disadvantage.\n       The federal Interstate system is designed and built to \n     handle these loads, as are Maine highways and wherever \n     possible trucks should be able to utilize this system, taking \n     unnecessary traffic off of state and local highways and out \n     of communities. FRA believes that, within reasonable \n     guidelines, each state should have the right to adjust weight \n     limits on Interstates within its borders to conform with its \n     needs.\n       By all accounts, last year's pilot project in Maine and \n     Vermont allowing these trucks to access Interstate highways \n     was tremendously successful. Attached is a Forest Resources \n     Association Technical Release presenting testimony on the \n     pilot's benefits. The loss of the pilot in December was a \n     real blow to our industry and rural communities.\n       Restoring the terms of the pilot is one action Congress can \n     take which immediately benefits both industry and the public \n     without imposing new burdens on taxpayers. The benefits are \n     clear:\n       Safety Benefits--Fewer miles travelled, on safer roads, \n     with fewer exposures.\n       Environmental Benefits--Reduced fuel usage, reduced \n     emissions.\n       Economic Benefits--Reduced wear on secondary roads, \n     improved efficiency for haulers.\n       Please let me know if there is anything FRA can do to \n     promote your legislation--and thanks again for your continued \n     support for Maine's forest products community .\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Joel Swanton,\n     Region Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     H.O. Bouchard\n\n\n                                      Transportation Services,\n\n                                    Hampden, ME, January 21, 2011.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Dirkson Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing on behalf of H.O. \n     Bouchard in favor of allowing trucks weighing up to 100,000 \n     pounds gross vehicle weight on Interstates in Maine. We are a \n     major motor carrier in Maine whose fleet is made up of 6-axle \n     units transporting heavy bulk products throughout Maine, \n     Canada, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New \n     York. These products include: cement powder, liquid asphalt, \n     fuel oil, road salt, raw forest products, chemicals, logs and \n     machinery. We have done this safely for 27 years.\n       I ask that you help those who are not from this area to \n     understand that the whole New England area (with the \n     exception of Vermont), New York and Canada allow up to at \n     least 99,000 pounds on 6 axle combination units. New York \n     allows more than 100,000 pounds and Canada allows more than \n     109,000 lbs. on 6 axles. The only areas that do not are a \n     very small slice of Maine that is Interstates 95, 295, 395 \n     and interstates in Vermont. Presently the freight moves on 6 \n     axle units, but on secondary roads. Commerce to and from \n     Bangor to Aroostook County must travel on secondary Route 2, \n     rather than 1-95, which runs parallel. To go the same \n     distance takes 50 minutes longer at a cost of approximately \n     $70.00 more. This is multiplied by hundreds of trips daily of \n     fuels, logs, lumber and many other consumer commodities. This \n     commercial traffic is very noticeable in all of the small \n     towns where the trucks must constantly stop and start for RR \n     crossings, crosswalks, school buses and emergency vehicles. \n     That same truck traffic was not even noticeable when it was \n     on the interstate, a road that can handle much more traffic \n     with ease. We have paid for the best roads and cannot use \n     them.\n       The future of our nation must include increased \n     transportation productivity to keep from clogging highways \n     and slowing the economic recovery. Using 2 trucks to haul the \n     freight of 3 is a simple, safe, cost effective way to \n     accomplish this. Your proposal to allow 6-axle vehicles \n     weighing up to 100,000 pounds to use the interstate system in \n     Maine and Vermont (99,000) is all benefit at no cost. It is \n     simply good business.\n       Thank you for your support in helping with this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Brian Bouchard,\n                                                        President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friends and \nneighbors from New England--Senators Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe \nfrom Maine--to introduce a bill that would allow Vermont and Maine to \nset the appropriate truck-weight standards on the interstates in their \nstates.\n  For too long, Vermont and Maine have been at a competitive \ndisadvantage while our next-door neighbors in New York, New Hampshire, \nMassachusetts, and Quebec have enjoyed the economic benefits that come \nwith higher highway truck weight limits. Due to these restrictions, the \nheaviest truck traffic in Vermont and Maine must travel over smaller \nand narrower roadways, creating significant safety concerns for \npedestrians and motorists and putting pressure on our already \noverburdened secondary roads and bridges.\n  That is why Senator Collins and I included language in the 2010 \ntransportation funding bill to implement pilot programs that allowed \nheavier trucks on interstates in Vermont and Maine for one year and \nstudied the impacts of this policy change on highway safety, bridge and \nroad durability, commerce, truck volumes, and energy use in Vermont.\n  During the past year I have heard from a number of Vermont truckers, \nbusiness owners, and state and local officials who support extending \nthe pilot program because of the economic and safety benefits they saw \nwhen the trucks were on the Interstates. Most importantly, many \nVermonters reported a significant reduction of heavy truck traffic in \nour downtowns and villages.\n  Unfortunately, last month the leadership on the other side of the \naisle\n\n[[Page S194]]\n\nblocked consideration of an omnibus budget bill that included a \nprovision Senator Collins and I authored to extend the Vermont and \nMaine truck weight pilot programs for another year. This sudden and \nsenseless reversal of a previous commitment to support the bill led to \nthe end of the Vermont and Maine pilot programs in December.\n  As a result the heaviest trucks in our states have been forced to \ndivert back to secondary roads--and the negative economic impact of \nthese trucks is once again being felt in downtowns and villages \nthroughout Vermont and Maine.\n  I am pleased to join with Senators Collins and Snowe in introducing \nthis bipartisan bill today. It will stop overweight trucks from having \nto rumble through our historic villages and downtowns, and it will \nbetter protect our citizens and our ailing transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  I appreciate the support this legislation has received from the State \nof Vermont, the Vermont League of Cities and Towns, the Vermont Truck \nand Bus Association, the Vermont Petroleum Association, the Vermont \nFuel Dealers Association, and many individual businesses and \nmunicipalities throughout Vermont.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 132. A bill to establish an Office of Forensic Science and a \nForensic Science Board, to strengthen and promote confidence in the \ncriminal justice system by ensuring consistency and scientific validity \nin forensic testing, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud today to introduce the Criminal \nJustice and Forensic Science Reform Act of 2011. This legislation is an \nimportant first step toward guaranteeing the effectiveness and \nscientific integrity of forensic evidence used in criminal cases, and \nin ensuring that Americans can have faith in their criminal justice \nsystem.\n  In March of 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee began its \nexamination of serious issues concerning forensic science, which is at \nthe heart of our criminal justice system. The Committee has studied the \nproblem exhaustively, and has worked with a wide array of experts and \nstakeholders. The legislation I introduce today is a product of this \nprocess. It seeks to strengthen our confidence in the criminal justice \nsystem, and the evidence it relies upon, by ensuring that forensic \nevidence and testimony is accurate, credible, and scientifically \ngrounded.\n  The National Academy of Science published a report in February 2009 \nasserting that the field of forensic science has significant problems \nthat urgently need to be addressed. The report suggested that basic \nresearch establishing the scientific validity of many forensic science \ndisciplines has never been done in a comprehensive way. It suggested \nthat the forensic sciences lack uniform and unassailable standards \ngoverning the accreditation of laboratories, the certification of \nforensic practitioners, and the testing and analysis of evidence.\n  The National Academy of Science's report was an urgent call to \naction. It has been hailed and widely cited since its release. It has \nalso been criticized by many. I did not view the Academy's report as \nthe final word on this issue, but rather as the starting point for a \nsearching review of the state of forensic science in this country.\n  Last Congress, the Judiciary Committee held two hearings on the \nissue. Committee members and staff spent countless hours talking to \nprosecutors, defense attorneys, law enforcement officers, judges, \nforensic practitioners, academic experts, and many, many others to \nlearn as much as we could about what is happening in the forensic \nsciences and what needs to be done.\n  As this effort has progressed, I have been disturbed to learn about \nstill more cases in which innocent people may have been convicted, and \nperhaps even executed, in part due to faulty forensic evidence. It is a \ndouble tragedy when an innocent person is convicted. An innocent person \nsuffers, and a guilty person remains free, leaving us all less safe. We \nmust do everything we can to avoid that untenable outcome.\n  At the same time, through the course of this inquiry, it has become \nabundantly clear that the men and women who test and analyze forensic \nevidence do tremendous work that is vital to our criminal justice \nsystem. I remember their important contributions and hard work from my \ndays as a prosecutor, when some of the forensic disciplines we have now \ndid not even exist. Their work is even more important today, and we \nneed to strengthen the field of forensics--and the justice system's \nconfidence in it--so that their hard work can be consistently relied \nupon, as it should be.\n  It is beyond question that everyone recognizes the need for forensic \nevidence that is accurate and reliable. Prosecutors and law enforcement \nofficers want evidence that can be relied upon to determine guilt and \nprove it beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. Defense attorneys \nwant strong evidence that can be used to exclude innocent people from \nsuspicion. Forensic science practitioners want their work to have as \nmuch certainty as possible and to be given deserved deference. All \nscientists and all attorneys who care about these issues want the \nscience that is admitted as evidence in the courtroom to match the \nscience that is proven through rigorous testing and research in the \nlaboratory.\n  There is also general agreement that the forensic sciences can be \nimproved through strong and unassailable research to test and establish \nthe validity of the forensic disciplines, as well as the application of \nconsistent and regular standards in the field. There is a dire need for \nwell managed and appropriately directed funding for research, \ndevelopment, training, and technical assistance. It is a good \ninvestment, as it will lead to fewer trials and appeals, and will \nreduce crime by ensuring that those who commit serious offenses are \npromptly captured and convicted.\n  There is also broad consensus that all forensic laboratories should \nbe required to meet rigorous accreditation standards and that forensic \npractitioners should be required to obtain meaningful certification.\n  The bill I introduce today seeks to address these widely recognized \nneeds. It requires that all forensic science laboratories that receive \nFederal funding or Federal business be accredited according to rigorous \nstandards. It requires all relevant personnel who perform forensic work \nfor any laboratory or agency that gets Federal money to become \ncertified in their fields, which will mean meeting basic proficiency, \neducation, and training requirements.\n  The bill sets up a rigorous process to determine the most serious \nneeds for research to establish the basic validity of the forensic \ndisciplines, and establishes grant programs to provide for peer-\nreviewed scientific research to answer fundamental questions and \npromote innovation. It also sets up a process for this research to lead \nto appropriate standards and best practices in each discipline. The \nbill funds research into new technologies and techniques that will \nallow forensic testing to be done more quickly, more efficiently, and \nmore accurately. I believe these are proposals that will be widely \nsupported by those on all sides of this issue.\n  There have been of course some areas of disagreement, particularly as \nto who should oversee these vital reforms to the field of forensics. \nSome have argued that, because the purpose of forensic science is \nprimarily to produce evidence to be used in the investigation and \nprosecution of criminal cases, it is vital that those regulating and \nevaluating forensics must have expertise in criminal justice. They have \nsaid that at the Federal level, the Department of Justice is the \nnatural place for an office to examine and oversee the forensic \nsciences and have emphasized the need for forensic science \npractitioners to have substantial input in evaluating research and \nstandards.\n  Others have argued that, for forensic science to truly engender our \ntrust and confidence, its validity must be established by independent \nscientific research, and standards must be determined by scientists \nwith no possible conflict of interest. They have argued for protections \nto ensure independent scientific decision making, as well as the \nsignificant involvement of Federal scientific agencies.\n\n[[Page S195]]\n\n  I find both of these arguments persuasive. I know firsthand the \nimportance of understanding how the criminal justice system works when \nevaluating the needs and practices in forensic science. I also \nunderstand that it is absolutely essential that forensic science be \ngrounded in independent scientific research in order to avoid any \nquestion of convictions being based on faulty forensic work.\n  This legislation attempts to address both of these concerns with a \nhybrid structure that ensures both criminal justice expertise and \nscientific independence. It establishes an Office of Forensic Science \nin the Office of the Deputy Attorney General within the Department of \nJustice. That office will have a Director who will make all final \ndecisions about research priorities, standards, and structure and who \nwill implement and enforce the systems set up by the legislation.\n  It also establishes a Forensic Science Board composed of forensic and \nacademic scientists, prosecutors and defense attorneys, and other key \nstakeholders. The Board will have a careful balance, and a majority of \nits members will be scientists. It will recommend all research \npriorities and standards and other key definitions and structures \nbefore the Director of the Office of Forensic Science makes a decision. \nThe bill will include important protections to encourage the Director \nto defer to the recommendations of the Board and to ensure that he or \nshe explains to Congress and to the public, with opportunities for \ncomment, any decision to disregard the Board's recommendations.\n  The bill also establishes committees of scientists to examine each \nindividual forensic science discipline to determine research needs and \nstandards. It includes protections to ensure that the committees' \nrecommendations receive significant deference, and the committees will \nbe overseen by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nNIST, a respected scientific agency. NIST will also implement grant \nprograms for research into the forensic sciences premised on the \nresearch priorities established by the Forensic Science Board and the \nOffice of Forensic Science. The National Science Foundation will help \nto ensure that the grant programs are run properly, with rigorous \nscientific peer review and without any bias.\n  This bill aims to carefully balance the competing considerations that \nare so important to getting a review of forensics right. It also \ncapitalizes on existing expertise and structures, rather than calling \nfor the creation of a costly new agency. It seeks to proceed modestly \nand cost effectively, with ample oversight, checks, and controls. I am \ncommitted to exploring ways to use existing resources so that this \nurgent work will not negatively impact the budget. Ultimately, \nimprovements in the forensic sciences will save money, reduce the \nnumber of costly appeals, shorten investigations and trials, and help \nto eliminate wrongful imprisonments.\n  I understand that sweeping forensic reform and criminal justice \nreform legislation not only should, but must, be bipartisan. There is \nno reason for a partisan divide on this issue; fixing this problem does \nnot advance the interests of only prosecutors or defendants, or of \nDemocrats or Republicans, but the interests of justice. I have worked \nclosely with interested Republican Senators on this vital issue. I will \ncontinue to work diligently with Senators on both sides of the aisle to \nensure that this becomes the consensus bipartisan legislation that it \nought to be. I hope many will cosponsor this legislation, and work with \nme to ensure its passage.\n  I want to thank the forensic science practitioners, experts, \nadvocates, law enforcement personnel, judges, and so many others whose \ninput forms the basis for this legislation. Your passion for this issue \nand for getting it right gives me confidence that we will work together \nsuccessfully to make much needed progress.\n  I hope all Senators will join me in advancing this important \nlegislation to bolster confidence in the forensic sciences and the \ncriminal justice system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Mescalero Apache Tribe to lease \nadjudicated water rights; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill entitled \nthe Mescalero Apache Tribe Leasing Authorization Act to allow the \nMescalero Apache Tribe in New Mexico to lease certain adjudicated water \nrights to other communities in need of water. My colleague Senator Tom \nUdall is co-sponsoring this measure and I am looking forward to working \nwith him on this issue.\n  As competition for limited water supplies increases and water \nsupplies become more uncertain as a result of a changing climate, more \nflexibility in water management strategies is essential. This bill will \nenable the Mescalero Apache Tribe to lease certain unused water rights \nadjudicated to the Tribe to other communities in New Mexico that have \nsignificant water needs. Through this bill, communities including the \nVillage of Ruidoso, the Village of Cloudcroft and the City of \nAlamogordo would be able to negotiate with the Mescalero Apache Tribe \nto lease water through a process overseen by the New Mexico State \nEngineer. These mutually beneficial transactions will provide \nadditional water to communities in times of need and will provide \neconomic benefits to the Tribe. Allowing these types of transactions to \noccur will also help to strengthen the relationship between Indian and \nnon-Indian communities that co-exist in many parts of New Mexico.\n  This bill will greatly benefit the Mescalero Apache Tribe and its \nsurrounding neighbors and it is my hope that my colleagues will \nultimately support its enactment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish requirements with respect to bisphenol A; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Ban \nPoisonous Additives Act of 2011,'' a bill that would ban the chemical \nBisphenol A, known as BPA, from all children's feeding products. I \nthank my cosponsors Senators Schumer, Kerry, Sanders, and Franken for \ntheir support.\n  I vowed in the last Congress not to give up, and this is why I am \nintroducing a bill that bans the use of BPA in baby bottles, sippy \ncups, infant formula, and baby food containers: the products used to \nprovide food and beverages to the most vulnerable.\n  I have a deep, abiding concern regarding the presence of toxins and \nchemicals in the daily lives of Americans. BPA is an endocrine \ndisruptor, which means that it interferes with the way hormones work in \nthe body.\n  The evidence against BPA is mounting, especially its harmful effects \non babies and children who are still developing.\n  I believe we have an obligation to safeguard babies and children from \nunnecessary exposure to this chemical that is linked to so many health \nproblems.\n  Over 200 scientific studies show that even at low doses, BPA is \nlinked to serious health problems including: Cancer, Diabetes, Heart \nDisease, Early puberty, Behavioral problems, Obesity.\n  This chemical is so widespread it has been found in 93 percent of \nAmericans.\n  Babies and children are particularly at risk to the exposure of BPA \nbecause when they are developing, any small change can cause dramatic \nconsequences.\n  It may not surprise you that the chemical industry continues to \ninsist that BPA is not harmful. According to at least one study, there \nis reason to be skeptical about research coming from chemical \ncompanies.\n  In 2006, the journal Environmental Research published an article \ncomparing the results of government funded studies on BPA to BPA \nstudies funded by industry.\n  The difference is glaring.\n  Ninety-two percent of the government funded studies found that \nexposure to BPA caused health problems.\n  Overwhelmingly, government studies found harm. None of the industry \nfunded studies identified health problems as a result of BPA exposure. \nNot one.\n  Clearly, serious questions are raised about the validity of the \nchemical industry's studies. The results also illustrate why our \nnation's regulatory agencies should not and cannot solely rely on \nchemical companies to conduct research on their own products.\n  The fact that so many adverse health effects are linked to this \nchemical, the fact that this chemical is so present in our bodies, and \nthe fact that babies are more at risk from its harmful effects leads me \nto believe that there is no good reason to expose our children to BPA.\n  This is why we are introducing legislation that protects all babies \nacross the country, no matter which state they happen to live.\n  This bill will ensure that parents no longer have to wonder whether \nproducts they buy for their babies and children will harm them now or \nlater in life.\n  This bill: Bans the use of BPA in baby bottles and sippy cups within \n6 months; Bans the use of BPA in baby food within 1 year; Bans the use \nof BPA in infant formula within 18 months; Requires that the FDA issue \na revised safety assessment on BPA by December 1, 2012; and Includes a \nsavings clause to allow states to enact their own legislation.\n  This bill makes sense. It's a reasonable step forward to protecting \nour children's health.\n  Major manufacturers are already phasing out BPA from their food and \nbeverage products for children.\n  Food and beverage products for children all have safe, alternative, \nBPA-free packaging available right now.\n  Major baby food and formula manufacturers offer BPA-free alternatives \nincluding: Nestle's GOOD START, Similac powdered infant formula, \nEnfamil powdered infant formula, Nestle liquid formula, and Similac \nliquid formula.\n  At least 14 manufacturers of baby bottles either offer some BPA-free \nalternatives or have completely banned its use. They are: Avent, Born \nFree, Disney First Years, Dr. Brown's, Evenflo, Gerber, Green to Grow, \nKlean Kanteen, Medala, Munchkin, Nuby Sippy Cups, Playtex, Think Baby, \nand Weil Baby.\n  Many major retailers have taken action and sell BPA-free baby bottles \nand cups: CVS, Kmart, Kroger, Rite Aid, Safeway, Sears, Toys ``R'' Us \nand Babies ``R'' Us, Wal-Mart, Wegmans, and Whole Foods.\n  Eight states have already enacted laws banning BPA from children's \nproducts: Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, \nVermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n  Other countries have already moved forward to restrict this chemical. \nCanada declared BPA a toxic substance, and banned it from all baby \nbottles and sippy cups. Denmark and France have national bans on BPA in \ncertain children's products.\n  The European Commission banned BPA from baby bottles, protecting \nconsumers in the European Union.\n  Clearly, the problem has been recognized and steps are being taken by \ncountries, states, companies, and retailers to remove this harmful \nchemical.\n  Let me briefly explain what BPA is.\n  BPA is a synthetic estrogen. As I stated previously, it is a hormone \ndisruptor and interferes with how hormones work in the body. This \nchemical is used in thousands of consumer products to harden plastics, \nline tin cans, and make CDs. It is even used to coat airline tickets, \ngrocery store receipts, and to make dental sealants.\n  It is one of the most pervasive chemicals in modern life. And, as \nwith so many other chemicals in consumer products, BPA has been added \nto our products without us knowing whether it was safe or not.\n  Alternatives exist because there is growing concern about the harmful \neffects of BPA. The chemical industry continues to try to quiet \ncriticism by reassuring consumers that BPA is safe.\n  I don't buy it.\n  As I previously stated, over 200 scientific studies show that \nexposure to BPA, particularly during prenatal development and early \ninfancy, are linked to a wide range of adverse health effects in later \nlife.\n  Because of their smaller size and stage of development, babies and \nchildren are particularly at risk from the harmful health effects of \nBPA.\n  These serious effects include: increased risk of breast and prostate \ncancer; genital abnormalities in males; infertility in men; sexual \ndysfunction; early puberty in girls; metabolic disorders such as \ninsulin resistant Type 2 diabetes and obesity; and behavioral problems \nsuch as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.\n  It continues to astound me how, even with this extensive list of \npotentially serious health effects, we continue to allow this chemical \nto be put in our products.\n  Moreover, additional science continues to be released, confirming the \npotential for BPA to cause severe problems:\n  Recently, the University of California, San Francisco published a \nsmall scale study finding that human exposure to BPA may compromise the \nquality of a woman's eggs retrieved for in vitro fertilization, IVF.\n  A study of over 200 Chinese factory workers found evidence that high \nlevels of BPA exposure to adversely affect sperm quality in humans.\n  Researchers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center recently \npublished a study concluding that BPA has biochemical properties \nsimilar to human carcinogens.\n  I want to underscore the importance and the urgency of withdrawing \nBPA from these children's products.\n  Well-known and respected organizations and Federal agencies also have \nexpressed concern about BPA:\n  The President's Cancer Panel Annual Report released in April 2010 \nconcluded that there is growing evidence of a link between BPA and \nseveral diseases, such as cancer.\n  The Panel recommended using BPA-free containers to limit chemical \nexposure.\n  A 2008 study by the American Medical Association suggested links \nbetween exposure to BPA and diabetes,\n\n[[Page S204]]\n\nheart disease and liver problems in humans.\n  The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) linked \nBPA in high concentrations to cardiovascular disease, and Type II \ndiabetes.\n  Given these conclusions, it is critical we act now to protect the \nmost vulnerable, our infants and toddlers from this chemical.\n  Children receive no benefit by having a baby bottle or cup coated \nwith BPA.\n  In the last Congress, I vowed not to give up in my fight to ban BPA. \nAfter working hard for many months to reach an agreement with Senator \nEnzi on a more limited ban, I was sincerely disappointed that this \nagreement was blocked by the chemical industry from being included in \nthe food safety bill.\n  I want to reiterate the importance of this legislation. I strongly \nbelieve we need to take action on this.\n  I don't think we can take a chance with our children's health.\n  BPA has been linked to developmental disorders, cancer, \ncardiovascular complications, and diabetes by credible scientific \nbodies. The evidence that BPA is unacceptably dangerous is mounting. \nYet it remains in thousands of household and food products.\n  This is a reasonable, common sense bill.\n  Now, the time comes again for this body to take a stand and move \nforward to protect the health of America's children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting my legislation, the Ban \nPoisonous Additives Act of 2011.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 136\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nprotections for consumers against excessive, unjustified, or unfairly \ndiscriminatory increases in premium rates; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in passing the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act, PPACA, on March 23, 2010, the 111th Congress made \ngreat strides towards protecting consumers from egregious health \ninsurance company practices. However, despite the passage of this \nhistoric legislation, the urgent need to protect Americans from unfair \nhealth insurance rate increases remains.\n  Health insurance premiums have been spiraling upwards nationally at \nout-of-control rates--10, 20, 30 percent every year--all while big \nnational insurance companies enjoy increasing profits.\n  Without further legislative action, health insurance companies will \ncontinue to do what they have done for far too long: put their profits \nahead of people.\n  Over the past decade, family health insurance premiums have more than \ndoubled, growing a shocking 130 percent, while workers' hourly earnings \nrose by only 38 percent, and inflation rose just 29 percent.\n  From 2000-2008, individuals in the employer-sponsored market saw \npremiums increase an average of 90 percent.\n  The cost of health insurance continues to outpace income and \ninflation for other goods and services, and these rapidly escalating \ncosts strain businesses, families, and individuals.\n  In 2009, 57 percent of people attempting to purchase insurance in the \nindividual market found it difficult or impossible to afford coverage.\n  All the while, in the third quarter of 2010, the six-largest \ninvestor-owned health insurance companies (Aetna, Coventry Health, \nUnited Health, Humana, WellPoint, and Cigna) saw a 22 percent increase \nin combined net income, putting them on pace to break their own profit \nrecord.\n  The problem is that the health reform law did not go far enough to \ncontrol these unfair premium increases, it leaves a loophole.\n  Simply stated, there is no federal authority to do anything about \nthese rate increases, even if they are unfair.\n  We need to close this loophole.\n  This is why today I am introducing, with Senators Boxer and Inouye, \nthe Health Insurance Rate Review Act of 2011. Representative Schakowsky \nis introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  This legislation creates a federal fallback rate review process, and \ngrants regulatory authority to block or modify rate increases that are \nexcessive, unjustified, or unfairly discriminatory.\n  This legislation is a simple, common-sense solution: for States where \nthe insurance commissioner does not have or\n\n[[Page S205]]\n\nuse authority to block unfair rate increases, the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services can do so.\n  On March 4, 2010, I introduced similar legislation to what I am \nintroducing today. I worked with the Administration and the Finance \nCommittee in putting it together, and with Representative Schakowsky.\n  President Obama included it in his health reform proposal, but \nunfortunately, it did not meet the criteria for reconciliation.\n  The time has come now to take action.\n  This legislation is necessary in order to protect consumers from the \negregious abuses of insurance companies, especially before the majority \nof the consumer protections included in health reform are fully in \nplace in 2014.\n  It is disturbing that year after year, health insurance premiums \nspiral out control, all while insurance companies enjoy increasing \nprofits.\n  Insurance premiums make up a higher percentage of household income \nthan ever before, meaning that more and more families have to choose \nbetween health care and daily living expenses, saving for retirement, \nand education.\n  This is unacceptable, and more must be done to protect consumers.\n  Everyone by now is familiar with the increases that Anthem/Blue \nCross, a subsidiary of WellPoint, was set to impose--as much as 39 \npercent--for 800,000 Californians.\n  It turns out that Anthem Blue Cross used flawed data to calculate \nhealth insurance premium increases to hundreds of thousands of \npolicyholders in California, resulting in increases that were larger \nthan necessary.\n  According to an independent analysis, the 25 percent average increase \nproposed by Anthem should have only been 15.2 percent.\n  What is most disturbing is that Anthem's case is not an aberration. \nFar from it.\n  This is not a problem unique to California. In the spring of 2010, \nhealth insurance companies pursued rate hikes in a number of States: as \nmuch as 60 percent in Illinois; 72 percent in Georgia; 50 percent in \nNew Jersey; and 40 percent in Virginia, to name a few.\n  The White House reports that premium rates have been rising across \nthe Nation, with substantial geographic variation.\n  For employer-sponsored family coverage, premiums increased 88 percent \nin Michigan over the past decade compared to a 145 percent increase in \nAlaska.\n  A report by the Center for American Progress Action Fund found that \nthis summer, WellPoint pursued double digit increases in the individual \nmarket for 10 other States: Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, \nMaine, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n  The reporting requirements in the health reform law will improve the \ninformation available, but right now, comprehensive data on the premium \nincreases insurers are imposing does not exist.\n  In 2009, despite the worst economic downturn since the Great \nDepression, the five largest for-profit health insurance companies, \nWellPoint Inc., United Health Group Inc., Aetna Inc., Humana Inc., and \nCigna Corp., set a full-year profit record. These companies saw a 56 \npercent increase in profits from 2008 to 2009, from $7.7 billion to \n$12.1 billion.\n  Furthermore, when many Americans were experiencing double-digit \npremium increases in 2009, high unemployment, and an average wage \ngrowth of only 2 percent, insurance CEOs gave themselves a 167 percent \nraise.\n  CEO pay for the 10 largest for-profit health insurance companies was \n$228.1 million in 2009, up from $85.5 million in 2008.\n  This doesn't even include the tens of millions more dollars in \nexercised stock options, and means that these CEOs raked in nearly $1 \nbillion in total compensation.\n  In the first three months of 2010, the five largest for-profit health \ninsurance companies, WellPoint Inc., United Health Group Inc., Aetna \nInc., Humana Inc., and Cigna Corp., recorded a combined net income of \n$3.2 billion--a 31 percent jump over the same period in 2009.\n  Meanwhile, large insurance companies now insure 2.8 million fewer \nAmericans than they did on December 31, 2008. An estimated 59.1 million \nAmericans were uninsured in the first quarter of 2010.\n  The California HealthCare Foundation reported that 6.8 million \nCalifornia residents lack health coverage.\n  That is 20 percent of the State's residents who are not able to \nafford health insurance.\n  All the while, insurance companies have been reducing the amount they \nspend on actual health care. As profits and CEO pay increased, the \namount of money insurers spent on medical care went down.\n  The top six insurers drove down the portion of premiums spent on \nmedical care. For example, the share of premium dollars that CIGNA \nspent on medical care decreased 6.4 percent in the second quarter of \n2010 compared to the prior year, and Humana's decreased 7.4 percent.\n  Now, because of legislation in the health reform law, insurance \ncompanies have to spend 80-85 percent of premiums on medical care and \nquality improvement services, not on profits.\n  This will go a long way to keeping insurance company greed in check, \nbut we need to go farther.\n  Clearly without additional legislative requirements, health insurance \ncompanies are not going to change.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services recently published \nproposed rules defining the rate review process. These regulations are \na first step towards protecting consumers and keeping insurers in \ncheck.\n  But they fall short of creating a strong rate review system, and rely \ntoo heavily on the notion that public disclosure of rates will cause \ninsurance companies to change their behavior.\n  The regulations do not grant explicit regulatory authority--either \nState or Federal--to deny, modify, or block rate increases that are \nexcessive, unjustified, or unfairly discriminatory.\n  The health reform law requires insurance companies to provide \njustification for unreasonable premium increases to the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services and post them on their Web sites.\n  The regulations subject rate increases of 10 percent or greater to \nadditional scrutiny and review, but the State-specific thresholds in \n2012 could sanction increases higher than 10 percent.\n  Transparency and increased scrutiny are steps forward, but there is \nstill this loophole where there is no authority to block or modify even \nexcessive, unjustified, and unfairly discriminatory increases.\n  This is why I am again introducing my rate review legislation, which \nwill grant this authority.\n  I believe there needs to be a Federal fallback in States that lack \nthe legal authority, capacity, or resources to conduct strong rate \nreview.\n  This legislation gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the \nauthority to block premium or other rate increases that are excessive, \nunjustified, or unfairly discriminatory.\n  In some States, insurance commissioners already have that authority, \nand that is fine. The bill doesn't touch them.\n  In Maine, for example, the State superintendent of insurance was able \nto block Anthem's proposed 18.5-percent increase last year. She \napproved only a 10.9-percent increase.\n  In at least 17 States, including my own--California--companies are \nnot required to receive prior approval for rate increases before they \ntake effect.\n  In these States, the Secretary would review potentially excessive, \nunjustified, or unfairly discriminatory rate increases and take \ncorrective action. This could include blocking an increase, providing \nrebates to consumers, or adjusting an increase.\n  Under this proposal, the Secretary would work with the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners to implement the rate review \nprocess. States already doing this work will continue to do so unabated \nand unfettered. The legislation would not affect them.\n  However, for the consumers in the other 17 States with no authority, \nsuch as California, protection from unfair rate hikes would be \nprovided.\n  Given the variation in State rate review authority and process, I \nthink this proposal strikes the right balance.\n  There is no need for involvement in States with insurance \ncommissioners that are able to protect consumers. So the legislation I \nam introducing simply\n\n[[Page S206]]\n\nprovides Federal protection for consumers who are currently at the \nmercy of large health insurance companies whose top priority is their \nbottom line.\n  This legislation is particularly important given a recent report by \nthe Kaiser Family Foundation showing that many States lack the capacity \nand resources to conduct adequate rate review, regardless of the \nState's statutory authority to review rates.\n  I strongly believe that we need to take action on this. The health \nreform law made great strides towards holding companies and \nshareholders accountable for providing health care at a reasonable \nrate.\n  However, there is this loophole.\n  So this bill becomes very necessary. Premiums are increasing every \nday, and people in many States have no recourse, and no way to know if \na particular increase is unfair.\n  There needs to be a Federal fallback in States that lack the legal \nauthority, capacity, or resources to conduct strong rate review. In \nStates where the Insurance Commissioner is not equipped to review, \nmodify, and block unreasonable rates, my legislation would grant the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services the authority to do so.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation, the \nHealth Insurance Rate Review Act of 2011, which will close this \nloophole.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 137\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for conservation, enhanced recreation \nopportunities, and development of renewable energy in the California \nDesert Conservation Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCalifornia Desert Protection Act of 2011.\n  This bill is an effort to plan for the competing uses--such as \nconservation, off-highway vehicle recreation, development, and military \ntraining--that are now being proposed for the desert. These uses of our \npublic lands can coexist through comprehensive planning, but in the \nabsence of such planning, it's quite possible that none will thrive.\n  During the previous Congress I introduced similar legislation to help \npreserve pristine desert lands that were donated to the Federal \nGovernment for permanent conservation a decade ago, but that more \nrecently have come under threat of development because of a flawed \nbureaucratic process that failed to protect them.\n  Over the last year the bill was endorsed by more than 100 \norganizations and agencies, and it had a hearing in the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee.\n  I am grateful to Senator Bingaman and his staff for working with me \nto prepare the bill for further action in the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. I believe we can revise the bill to address \nfurther the needs of renewable energy developers, the Department of \nDefense, off-road recreation enthusiasts, local government and others, \nand I look forward to continuing that effort in the new Congress.\n  I strongly believe that conservation, renewable energy development \nand recreation can and must co-exist in the California Desert--and this \nlegislation strikes a carefully conceived balance between these \nsometimes competing concerns.\n  The key provisions of this bill would designate two new national \nmonuments--the Mojave Trails and the Sand\n\n[[Page S207]]\n\nto Snow National Monuments; add adjacent lands to the Joshua Tree and \nDeath Valley National Parks and the Mojave National Preserve; designate \n5 new BLM wilderness areas and protect 4 important waterways--including \nthe Amargosa River and Deep Creek--as Wild and Scenic Rivers; and \nenhance recreational opportunities in the desert and ensure that the \ntraining needs of the military are met.\n  This bill is the product of painstaking discussions with key \nstakeholders including environmental groups, local and State \ngovernment, off-highway recreation enthusiasts, hunters, cattle \nranchers, mining interests, the Department of Defense, wind and solar \nenergy companies, California's public utility companies, and many \nothers. I am grateful for all of their efforts.\n  The previous version of my bill proposed specific improvements to the \nDepartment of the Interior's rules governing the development of \nrenewable energy on public lands. I'm pleased that the Department has \ninstituted a number of new policies over the last year which have \ngreatly improved the process. Consequently, the current bill focuses \nprimarily on conservation, recreation and other important uses of the \nCalifornia desert.\n  However, I intend to work with my colleagues from the West on \nseparate legislation to further expedite the development of wind and \nsolar energy in California and the West.\n  The California Desert Protection Act, which was enacted in 1994, was \na sweeping piece of legislation aimed at conserving some of the most \nbeautiful and ecologically significant lands in my home State.\n  The law created Death Valley National Park, Joshua Tree National Park \nand the Mojave National Preserve, as well as 69 desert wilderness areas \nmanaged by the Bureau of Land Management, BLM.\n  Collectively, it protected more than 7 million acres of desert lands, \nmaking it the largest land conservation bill in the lower 48 States in \nU.S. history.\n  To this day, it remains one of my proudest accomplishments since \njoining this body.\n  Much has changed since the passage of the California Desert \nProtection Act. Many of the impediments that prevented conservation of \nother pristine desert lands in the area no longer exist.\n  For example the Department of Defense concerns with designating some \nwilderness areas near Fort Irwin have been resolved; many mining areas \ninside national parks and potential wilderness have closed; grazing \nallotments on both BLM and National Park Service land have been retired \nby willing sellers; hundreds of thousands of acres of privately owned \nland have been donated to or acquired by the Federal Government.\n  Yet even as these issues were resolved, new challenges have emerged. \nThere are now competing demands over how best to manage hundreds of \nthousands of acres of public lands in the desert.\n  Some believe the lands should be used for large-scale solar and wind \nfacilities and transmission lines. Others would like to conserve \ncritical habitat for threatened and endangered species.\n  Some would like more acreage available for grazing or for off-road \nrecreation.\n  Finally, some would like to see additional lands made available for \nmilitary training and base expansion.\n  Two years ago, I learned that BLM had accepted applications to build \nvast solar and wind energy projects on former railroad lands previously \nowned by the Catellus Corporation. These lands had been donated to the \nFederal Government or acquired with taxpayer funds with the explicit \ngoal of conservation.\n  Approximately $45 million of private donations--including a $5 \nmillion land discount from Catellus Corporation--and $18 million in \nFederal Land and Water Conservation grants was spent to purchase these \nlands, with the intent of conserving them in perpetuity.\n  As the sponsor of the legislative provisions that helped secure the \ndeal to acquire the roughly 600,000 acres of former private land, I \nfound the BLM's actions unacceptable.\n  We have an obligation to honor our commitment to conserve these \nlands--and I believe we can still accomplish that goal while also \nfulfilling California's commitment to develop a clean energy portfolio.\n  I believe the development of these new cleaner energy sources is \nvital to addressing climate change, yet we must be careful about \nselecting where these facilities are located.\n  I plan to work with senators from Western States to improve the \nrenewable energy permitting process to allow quicker development of \nrenewable energy projects on private and disturbed public land. This \neffort likely requires separate legislation and improved regulation.\n  I applaud the Department of the Interior's efforts over the last year \nto address this problem, especially Interior's proposed designation of \n24 solar energy zones encompassing 677,000 acres of public land in 6 \nWestern States. By designating these zones in appropriate areas and \nstreamlining the permitting process for projects proposed there, the \nDepartment has helped ensure that sensitive areas of the desert can be \npreserved.\n  As BLM finalizes the creation of these Zones and its new Solar Energy \nProgram, I will push BLM to create a development zone in the West \nMojave, conduct sufficient study of zones to ensure projects in these \nlocations can be permitted quickly, and establish the program's rules \nas expeditiously as possible.\n\n  I will continue to suggest ways that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService can improve permitting on private lands, the Defense Department \ncan welcome development on its bases, and the Forest Service can \nutilize its own lands. These matters may require legislation.\n  There is enough land in California's desert to protect the most \nprecious areas of the Mojave and aggressively develop renewable \nresources where permitting will be rapid. California must develop \n15,000 to 20,000 megawatts of renewable power to meet its climate goals \nby 2020, and the current permitting process will need to vastly improve \nfor the state to meet this goal.\n  First, this bill will ensure that hundreds of thousands of acres of \nland donated to the federal government for conservation will be \nprotected by creating the Mojave Trails National Monument. This new \nmonument would cover approximately 941,000 acres of federal land, which \nincludes approximately 266,000 acres of the former Catellus-owned \nrailroad lands along historic Route 66. I visited the area and was \namazed by the beauty of the massive valleys, pristine dry lakes, and \nrugged mountains.\n  In addition to its iconic sweeping desert vistas and majestic \nmountain ranges, this area of the Eastern Mojave also contains critical \nwildlife corridors linking Joshua Tree National Park and the Mojave \nNational Preserve. It also encompasses hundreds of thousands of acres \ndesignated as areas of critical environmental concern, critical habitat \nfor the threatened desert tortoise, and ancient lava bed flows and \ncraters. It is surrounded by more than a dozen BLM wilderness areas.\n  The BLM would be given the authority to both conserve the monument \nlands, and also to maintain existing recreational uses, including \nhunting, vehicular travel on open roads and trails, camping, horseback \nriding and rockhounding.\n  The bill also creates an advisory committee to help develop and \noversee the implementation of the monument management plan. It would be \ncomprised of representatives from local, state and federal government, \nconservation and recreation groups, and local Native American tribes.\n  Before I go on to the other conservation provisions in the bill, I \nwould like to address one important issue--and that is what should be \ndone about some of the proposed renewable energy development projects \nproposed for lands included in this monument.\n  Although it is true that the monument will prevent further \nconsideration of some applications to develop solar and wind energy \nprojects on former Catellus lands or adjoining lands in the monument, \nit is important to note that of the proposals in question, not a single \none has been granted a permit, nor is a single one under review at the \nCalifornia Energy Commission or under formal NEPA, National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, review at BLM.\n  To ensure that creation of the monument does not unnecessarily harm \nthe\n\n[[Page S208]]\n\nfirms that worked in good faith and invested substantial time and \nresources to produce renewable energy in California, the legislation \nwill offer these companies an opportunity to relocate their projects to \nfederal renewable energy zones currently being developed by the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n  Additionally, the monument would not prevent the construction or \nexpansion of necessary transmission lines critical to linking renewable \nenergy generation facilities with the electricity grid.\n  Second, the bill would establish the ``Sand to Snow National \nMonument,'' encompassing 134,000 acres of land from the desert floor in \nthe Coachella Valley up to the top of Mount San Gorgonio, the highest \npeak in Southern California.\n  The boundaries of this second, smaller new monument would include two \nAreas of Critical Environmental Concern: Big Morongo Canyon and \nWhitewater Canyon, the BLM and U.S. Forest Service San Gorgonio \nWilderness, the Wildlands Conservancy's Pipe's Canyon and Mission Creek \nPreserves, and additional public and private conservation lands, \nincluding two wildlife movement corridor areas connecting the \nPeninsular Ranges with the Transverse Ranges.\n  This area is truly remarkable, and would arguably be the most \nenvironmentally diverse national monument in the country. It serves as \nthe intersection of three converging ecological systems--the Mojave \nDesert, the Colorado Desert, and the San Bernardino mountains--and is \none of the most important wildlife corridors in Southern California.\n  This monument designation would protect 23.6 miles of the Pacific \nCrest Trail and the habitat for approximately 240 species of migrating \nand breeding birds, the second highest density of nesting birds in the \nUnited States. It also serves as a home and a crucial migration \ncorridor for animals traveling between Joshua Tree National Park, the \noasis at Big Morongo, and the higher elevations of the San Bernardino \nMountains.\n  I'd like to make one additional point, and that is that despite its \necological significance, this area is not particularly well-known--\nlargely because it is managed by a number of distinct entities, \nincluding the BLM, Forest Service, National Park Service and private \npreserves and conservation agencies. So, the monument designation would \nhelp to attract more attention to one of California's natural gems.\n  Third, the bill establishes new wilderness areas and allows more \nappropriate use of lands currently designated as Wilderness Study \nAreas.\n  The 1994 California Desert Protection Act extended wilderness \nprotection to many areas in the desert, yet several areas near Fort \nIrwin were designated as wilderness study areas in order to allow the \nbase to expand.\n  Now that Fort Irwin's expansion is complete, it is time to consider \nthese areas for permanent wilderness designation.\n  The bill protects approximately 250,000 acres of BLM land as \nwilderness in five areas. These areas contain some of the most pristine \nand rugged landscapes in the California desert.\n  Beyond Fort Irwin, the bill also expands wilderness areas in Death \nValley National Park, 90,000 acres, and the San Bernardino National \nForest, 4,300 acres, inside the Sand to Snow National Monument created \nby this bill.\n  The bill also releases 126,000 acres of land from their existing \nwilderness study area designation in response to requests from local \ngovernment and recreation users. This will allow the land to be made \navailable for other purposes, including recreational off-highway \nvehicle use on designated routes.\n  Fourth, this bill would create the Vinagre Wash Special Management \nArea.\n  The agreed-upon designation for this area in Imperial County, near \nthe Colorado River, was reached after careful discussion with key \nstakeholders.\n  Although the land possesses some wilderness characteristics, there \nare also competing interests. The Navy Seals currently use some of this \narea for occasional training. Additionally, many local residents enjoy \ntouring the rolling hills in the area by jeep.\n  Through the combined efforts of conservation groups, local residents \nand county government, and the Department of Defense, a compromise \nconservation designation was developed.\n  For the land known as the Vinagre Wash, the bill will create a \n``special management area'' covering 76,000 acres, including 12,000 \nacres of former railroad lands donated to the federal government.\n  Of these, 49,000 acres are designated as potential wilderness and \nonly become permanent wilderness if and when the Department of Defense \ndetermines these lands are no longer needed for Navy Seal training.\n  This designation will permit the area to continue to be accessed by \nvehicles and be used for camping, hiking, mountain biking, sightseeing, \nand off-highway vehicle use on designated routes and protect tribal \ncultural assets in the area.\n  Fifth, the bill adds to or designates four new Wild and Scenic \nRivers, totaling 76 miles in length. These designations will ensure the \nrivers remain clean and free-flowing and that their immediate \nenvironments are preserved. These beautiful waterways are Deep Creek \nand the Whitewater River in and near the San Bernardino National \nForest, as well as the Amargosa River and Surprise Canyon Creek near \nDeath Valley National Park.\n  Sixth, the bill adds approximately 74,000 acres of adjacent lands to \nthe three National Parks established by the 1994 California Desert \nProtection Act: 41,000 acres in Death Valley National Park. This \nincludes former mining areas where the claims have been retired and a \nnarrow strip of BLM land between National Park and Defense Department \nboundaries that has made BLM management difficult; almost 30,000 acres \nin the Mojave National Preserve. This land was not included in the \noriginal Monument because of the former Viceroy gold mine. However, the \nmining operations ceased several years ago and the reclamation process \nis nearly complete. Additionally, a 2007 analysis by the Interior \nDepartment recommended that this area would be suitable to add to the \nPreserve; 2,900 acres in Joshua Tree National Park. This includes \nmultiple small parcels of BLM land identified for disposal on its \nperiphery. Transferring this land to the Park Service would help \nprotect Joshua Tree by preserving these undeveloped areas that border \nresidential communities.\n  Seventh, the bill designates new lands as Off-Highway Vehicle \nRecreation Areas.\n  One of the key goals I have strived for in this bill is to find \nbalance to ensure that the many different needs and uses in the desert \nare accommodated with the least possible conflict. Some of the most \nfrequent visitors to the desert are the off-highway recreation \nenthusiasts.\n  In California alone, there are over 1 million registered off-highway \nvehicles, many of which can be found exploring thousands of miles of \ndesert trails or BLM designated open areas.\n  However, in order to meet military training needs, the Marine Corps \nis studying the potential expansion of Marine Corps Air Ground Combat \nCenter at Twentynine Palms into Johnson Valley, the largest OHV area in \nthe country. I strongly support providing our troops with the best \npossible training, but if the Marines need to expand the base into \nJohnson Valley, this could have potentially resulted in the loss of \ntens of thousands of acres of OHV recreation lands.\n  In 2009 I met with Major General Eugene Payne, Assistant Deputy \nCommandant for Installations and Logistics, and Brigadier General \nMelvin Spiese, Commanding General, Training and Education Command, to \ndiscuss this issue, and I am very grateful for their efforts to \nconsider base expansion options that would preserve much of Johnson \nValley for recreation.\n  As the result of those meetings, the Marine Corps has committed to \nstudying an alternative that would allow for a portion of Johnson \nValley to be used exclusively for military training, another portion to \nbe used exclusively for continued OHV recreation and a third area for \njoint use. While the environmental review process must first be \ncompleted, I am hopeful that this option will prevail for the benefit \nof the Marines and recreational users of Johnson Valley.\n  The lesson learned from Johnson Valley is that, despite the vast size \nof the California desert, there are relatively\n\n[[Page S209]]\n\nfew areas dedicated to OHV recreation, and even those areas face \nincreasing competition from other types of uses. These areas are \nimportant not only to the hundreds of thousands visitors who enjoy \nthem, but also to the local economy that depends on their tourist \ndollars. Additionally, by protecting these areas, we also protect \nconservation areas by providing appropriate places for OHV recreation.\n  This bill will designate five existing OHV areas in the Mojave desert \nas permanent OHV areas, providing off-highway groups some certainty \nthat these uses will be protected as much as conservation areas. \nCollectively, these areas could be as much as 314,000 acres, depending \non what, if any, of Johnson Valley is ultimately needed by the Marines.\n  This section of the bill also requires the Secretary of the Inerior \nto conduct a study to determine which, if any, lands adjacent to these \nrecreation areas would be suitable for addition. This will help make up \nfor some of the lost acres in Johnson Valley should the Marines decide \nto expand there.\n  Finally, this bill includes other key provisions that address various \nchallenges and opportunities in the California desert, including state \nland exchanges. There are currently about 370,000 acres of state lands \nspread across the California desert in isolated 640 acre parcels. \nBecause many of these acres are inside national parks, wilderness, the \nproposed monuments or conservation areas, they are largely unusable. \nThe bill seeks to remedy that problem by requiring the Department of \nthe Interior to develop and implement a plan with the state to complete \nthe exchange of these lands for other BLM or GSA owned property in the \nnext ten years. These land exchanges will help consolidate the state \nlands into larger, more usable areas that could potentially provide the \nstate with viable sites for renewable energy development, off-highway \nvehicle recreation or other commercial purposes.\n  Military activities. The bill ensures the right of the Department of \nDefense to conduct low-level overflights over wilderness, national \nparks and national monuments.\n  Climate change and wildlife corridors. The bill requires the \nDepartment of the Interior to study the impact of climate change on \nCalifornia desert species migration, incorporate the study's results \nand recommendations into land use management plans, and consider the \nstudy's findings when making decisions granting rights of way for \nprojects on public lands.\n  Tribal uses and interests. The bill requires the Secretary to ensure \naccess for tribal cultural activities within national parks, monuments, \nwilderness and other areas designated within the bill. It also requires \nthe Secretary to develop a cultural resources management plan to \nprotect a sacred tribal trail along the Colorado River between southern \nNevada and the California-Baja border.\n  Prohibited uses of donated and acquired lands. In order to ensure \nthat donated and acquired Catellus lands outside the Mojave Trails \nNational Monument are maintained for conservation, the bill prohibits \ntheir use for development, mining, off-highway vehicle use, except \ndesignated routes, grazing, military training and other surface \ndisturbing activities. The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to \nmake limited exceptions in cases where it is deemed in the public \ninterest, but comparable lands would have to be purchased and donated \nto the federal government as mitigation for lost acreage.\n  All of these provisions, when taken together, would serve to \ncomplement the lasting conservation established by the California \nDesert Protection Act--while ensuring that other important local uses \nare maintained in appropriate areas.\n  Though I have lived in or near San Francisco for most of my life, \nover the years I have come to truly appreciate California's sweeping \ndesert landscapes.\n  I remember my first visits to the desert years ago. It was treated \nlike a waste dump. It was full of abandoned cars. Old appliances \nlittered the landscape.\n  But we have worked very hard to clean it up.\n  We have worked to make sure that the vast vistas and pristine desert \nhabitat are respected by humanity, and that we give to our children a \nhealthier, more beautiful desert than we inherited.\n  But if we are to remain successful in the long run, we must not only \nprotect the desert land itself, we must also protect the broader \nenvironment from the ravages of climate change, and we must offer \neconomic opportunity to those who live in these areas.\n  That is the purpose of this legislation. There are many places in the \nCalifornia desert where development and employment are essential and \nappropriate.\n  But there are also places that future generations will thank us for \nsetting aside.\n  I have worked painstakingly with stakeholders to ensure that this \nlegislation balances sometimes competing needs.\n  This bill, if enacted, will have a positive and enduring impact on \nthe landscape of the Southern California desert by conserving pristine \nareas while meeting the needs of all desert stakeholders.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 138\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide that certain tax planning strategies are \nnot patentable, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, American judge and judicial philosopher \nLearned Hand once wrote: ``Any one may so arrange his affairs that his \ntaxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that \npattern which will best pay the Treasury.''\n  Judge Hand would probably have been surprised to learn that, through \nthe use of patents, certain individuals have acquired monopolies on \nmethods of arranging one's affairs to lower taxes.\n  That is precisely what patenting a tax strategy does: it gives the \nholder the exclusive right to exclude others from a particular \ntransaction or financial arrangement without permission or payment of a \nroyalty.\n  And patents have been granted on ideas as simple as funding a certain \ntype of tax-favored trust with a specific type of financial product or \ncalculating the ways to minimize the tax burden of converting to an \nalternative retirement plan.\n  These commonsense tax planning approaches should be available to \neveryone. No one should be able to patent those techniques.\n  Let's first assume that the tax planning technique is legitimate \nunder the Tax Code and does, indeed, reduce taxes.\n  In that case, every taxpayer should be able to plan in a way that \nthey can lower their taxes without paying royalties or worrying that \nthey are violating patent law while filing their tax returns. This is a \nmatter of fairness and uniform application of the tax laws.\n  Conversely, there are tax planning techniques that are not legitimate \nunder the Tax Code, say, for example, a tax shelter designed to \nillegally evade taxes.\n  No taxpayer should be using those strategies. A patent on those ideas \nmay mislead unknowing taxpayers into believing that the strategy is \nvalid under the tax law.\n  Today, we have gathered a coalition of Senators to introduce \nlegislation to prevent patents from being issued on claims of tax \nstrategies.\n  Our bill, the ``Equal Access to Tax Planning Act,'' makes it clear \nthat any strategy for reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax liability \nrelies on the provisions of the Tax Code to work, will not be \nconsidered a new or nonobvious idea and therefore not be eligible for a \npatent.\n  In the lingo of the patent law, the Tax Code is ``prior art''--which \nis just another way of saying it isn't novel and nonobvious--and \nmethods of complying with the Code cannot be patented. This would be \nthe result under patent law whenever an invention was not found to be \nnovel or nonobvious.\n  This legislation does not hinder patent protection for otherwise \nnovel, non-tax driven inventions but only stops the patenting of the \ntax strategy claims.\n  Where a patent is indeed granted--for example, where an application \nadvances multiple claims--the taxpayer has certainty that what is not \npatented is a strategy for applying the Tax Code.\n  It is encouraging that our bill has been incorporated into the larger \npatent bill that is being introduced by Senators Grassley and Leahy \ntoday.\n  I strongly believe in the importance of patents. America is a land \nthat fosters innovation and competitiveness by\n\n[[Page S222]]\n\nallowing inventors to benefit from their creative ideas.\n  Intellectual property drives our exports and our economy. But patents \ncannot be used to upset the fair and uniform application of the Tax \nCode.\n  Our tax system relies on the voluntary compliance of millions of \ntaxpayers and the Tax Code cannot and should not be co-opted for \nprivate gain.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Baucus and I first introduced a \nbill to ban patents for tax inventions in the 110th Congress. Since \nthen, we have worked with the leaders of the Judiciary Committee, the \nPatent and Trademark Office, the American Institute of Certified Public \nAccountants, industry, and members of the patent bar to perfect the \nlanguage. I am pleased to introduce this new and improved bill today \nwith Senators Baucus, Levin, Wyden, Bingaman, Conrad, Enzi, and Kerry.\n  There are strong policy reasons to ban tax strategy patents. Tax \nstrategy patents may lead to the marketing of aggressive tax shelters \nor otherwise mislead taxpayers about expected results. Tax strategy \npatents encumber the ability of taxpayers and their advisers to use the \ntax law freely, interfering with the voluntary tax compliance system. \nIf firms or individuals were able to hold patents for these strategies, \nsome taxpayers could face fees simply for complying with the Tax Code. \nAnd, tax patents provide windfalls to lawyers and patent holders by \ngranting them exclusive rights to use tax loopholes, which could \nprovide some businesses with an unfair advantage.\n  Tax strategy patents are unlikely to be novel given the public nature \nof the Tax Code. Moreover, tax strategy patents may undermine the \nfairness of the Federal tax system by removing from the public domain \nparticular ways of satisfying a taxpayer's legal obligations. The Equal \nAccess to Tax Planning Act expressly provides that a strategy for \nreducing, avoiding or deferring tax liability cannot be considered a \nnew or nonobvious idea, and therefore, a patent on a tax strategy \ncannot be obtained. This ensures that all taxpayers will have equal \naccess to strategies to comply with the Tax Code. I encourage support \nfor this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KIRK (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 147. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nestablish a deadline for restricting sewage dumping into the Great \nLakes and to fund programs and activities for improving wastewater \ndischarges into the Great Lakes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with Senator \nDurbin to introduce the Great Lakes Water Protection Act. This \nbipartisan legislation would set a date certain to end sewage dumping \nin America's largest supply of fresh water, the Great Lakes. More than \nthirty million Americans depend on the Great Lakes for their drinking \nwater, food, jobs, and recreation. We need to put a stop to the \npoisoning of our water supply. Cities along the Great Lakes must become \nenvironmental stewards of our country's most precious freshwater \necosystem.\n  The Great Lakes Water Protection Act gives cities until 2031 to build \nthe full infrastructure needed to prevent sewage dumping into the Great \nLakes. Those who violate EPA sewage dumping regulations after that \nfederal deadline will be subject to fines up to $100,000 for each day a \nviolation occurs. These fines will be directed to a newly established \nGreat Lakes Clean-Up Fund within the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. \nPenalties collected would go into this fund and be reallocated to the \nstates surrounding the Great Lakes. From there, the funds will be spent \non wastewater treatment options, with a special focus on greener \nsolutions such as habitat protection and wetland restoration.\n  This legislation is sorely needed. Many major cities along the Great \nLakes do not have the infrastructure needed to divert sewage overflows \nduring times of heavy rainfall. More than twenty-four billion gallons \nof sewage are dumped into the Lakes each year; Detroit alone dumps an \nestimated 13 billion gallons of sewage into the Great Lakes annually. \nEPA estimates show there is a total of 347 combined sewer outflows that \ndischarge into the Lake Michigan basin alone. This development is \nechoed throughout the Great Lakes region and is one we need to reverse.\n  These disastrous practices result in thousands of annual beach \nclosing for the region's 815 freshwater beaches. Illinois faced 628 \nbeach closures or contamination advisories in 2009 alone, up 17 percent \nfrom 2008. This greatly affects the health of our children and \nfamilies--a recent University of Chicago study showed swim bans at \nChicago's beaches due to E. coli levels cost the local economy $2.4 \nmillion in lost revenue every year.\n  Protecting our Great Lakes is one of my top priorities in the \nCongress. As an original sponsor of the Great Lakes Restoration Act, I \nfavor a broad approach to addressing needs in the region. However, we \nmust also move forward with tailored approaches to fix specific \nproblems as we continue to push for more comprehensive reform. I am \nproud to introduce this important legislation that addresses a key \nproblem facing our Great Lakes, and hope my colleagues will support me \nin ensuring that these important resources become free from the threat \nof sewage pollution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 147\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Great Lakes \nWater Protection Act with my colleague, Senator Mark Kirk.\n  We face many challenges in protecting the Great Lakes--from \ncontaminated sediment to industrial pollutants to invasive species. \nThis legislation tackles another significant threat to the water system \nmunicipal sewage.\n  A recent report found that from January 2009 through January 2010, \nfive U.S. cities dumped a combined 41 billion gallons of waste water \ninto the Great Lakes. Sewage and storm water discharges have been \nassociated with elevated levels of bacterial pollutants. For the 40 \nmillion people who depend on the Great Lakes for their drinking water, \nthat is no small matter.\n  When bacterial counts go too high, beaches have to be closed. In \nIllinois, we have 52 public beaches along the Lake Michigan shoreline. \nPeople use these beaches for swimming, boating, fishing--and many \ncommunities generate revenue from the public beaches.\n  Our legislation will quadruple fines for municipalities that dump raw \nsewage in the Great Lakes and direct the revenue from these penalties \nto projects that improve water quality. The bill also includes new \nreporting requirements that will provide a more complete understanding \nof the frequency and impact of sewage dumping on this critical water \nsystem.\n  The Great Lakes are a national treasure. Illinoisans know that. They \nwant to protect Lake Michigan, and they are willing to fight for the \nlake. Three and a half years ago, when we learned that BP was planning \nto increase the pollutants it puts into Lake Michigan--the people of \nIllinois stood up and said: No, polluting our lake further is not an \noption.\n  Senator Kirk and I happen to agree with that message. Protecting the \nGreat Lakes is not a partisan issue, and this is not a partisan bill. \nWe intend to work together to ensure that this national treasure is \naround for generations, providing drinking water, recreation, and \ncommerce for Illinois and other Great Lakes States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 149. A bill to extend the expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT \nImprovement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, and the FISA Amendments Act of \n2008 until December 31, 2013, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the FISA \nSunsets Extension Act of 2011 to extend the three expiring provisions \nof the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--the authority to conduct, \nsubject to court order, so-called ``roving wiretaps,'' ``lone wolf'' \nsurveillance, and collection of business records. This legislation will \nextend these three authorities, otherwise set to expire on February 28, \nto December 31, 2013.\n  The bill will also change the expiration date of the intelligence \ncollection authorities provided in the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 so \nthey, too, last until the end of 2013.\n  I firmly believe that the United States Government needs these \nauthorities to help prevent against future terrorist attacks against \nour nation and to collect vital intelligence insights into the \ncapabilities and intentions of our adversaries. We remain a nation \nunder threat and need to remain vigilant in our defense.\n  Let me briefly describe the three expiring provisions.\n  First, court-ordered roving authority is directed against foreign \nintelligence targets who attempt to thwart FISA surveillance by such \nactions as rapidly changing cell phones. In a September 2009 letter, \nthe Department of Justice reported to Congress that this authority \n``has proven an important intelligence-gathering tool in a small but \nsignificant subset of FISA electronic surveillance orders.''\n  Second, lone wolf authority allows for court-ordered collection \nagainst non-U.S. persons who engage in international terrorism but for \nwhom an association with a specific international terrorist group has \nnot yet been identified. In the last Congress, when the Department of \nJustice advised that it had not yet been necessary for the Government \nto use this authority, the Department stated that it could foresee \ncircumstances in which a terrorist target had not actually contacted a \nterrorist group or was known to have severed his association from a \nterrorist group.\n  From the events of the last several years, we have all become aware \nthat we may be attacked by a lone, unaffiliated terrorist--or one whose \nlinks to\n\n[[Page S224]]\n\nterrorist groups are only clear after an individual is apprehended.\n  Third, the collection of business records pursuant to court orders. \nThis provision allows the Government to require the production of \n``tangible things'' in order to obtain foreign intelligence information \nas part of an investigation. In the September 2009 letter, the \nDepartment of Justice urged reauthorization of that authority because \n``[t]he absence of such authority could force the FBI to sacrifice key \nintelligence opportunities.''\n  I cannot elaborate into the use of these authorities in this \nunclassified context. I can say, however, that as the Chairman of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence and as one who reviews the \nintelligence on the threats we face, we remain a nation under attack. \nProviding the authorities to collect intelligence to identify and \nprevent terrorist attacks on the homeland remains necessary.\n  It is also important to allow Congress, in the future, to conduct a \ncomplete review of FISA provisions. By synchronizing the dates when \ndifferent pieces of the law expire, Congress can consider changes to \nFISA at once, prior to the end of 2013.\n  In closing, l would like to assure all Members of the Senate and the \nAmerican public that extending these sunsets does not shield them from \noversight. There is a system of review and oversight in place that \nconsists of the FISA Court, Inspectors General in the Department of \nJustice and in the intelligence community, regular oversight reviews by \nthe National Security Division at the Department of Justice, a new \nDirector of Compliance at the National Security Agency, and reporting \nto the Senate and House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees. As \nChairman of the Senate Select Committee and as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, I can assure colleagues that the Senate has \nplaced, and will continue to place, oversight of the Government's \nsurveillance authorities as a major priority.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Manchin):\n  S. 153. A bill to improve compliance with mine and occupational \nsafety and health laws, empower workers to raise safety concerns, \nprevent future mine and other workplace tragedies, establish rights of \nfamilies of victims of workplace accidents, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \nRobert C. Byrd Mine and Workplace Safety and Health Act of 2011. This \nlegislation is identical to the bill I introduced last Congress with \nSenator Carte Goodwin and will afford miners in West Virginia and \nemployees across the country the safest possible workplace, which is \nwhat they deserve. As I have mentioned before, this legislation is a \ntribute to all miners who have lost their lives and also to my dear \nfriend and colleague, the late Senator Robert Byrd, who devoted his \ncareer to improving the working conditions of West Virginia's miners \nand worked diligently with me to develop this bill.\n  I am also very pleased that Senators Tom Harkin, Patty Murray, and \nJoe Manchin are joining me in cosponsoring this legislation. Chairman \nHarkin and Senator Murray are strong advocates for America's workforce \nand worked closely with me to draft this bill. Their contributions and \nexpertise on this issue are immeasurable. Senator Manchin and I also \nhave a history of working together, when he was Governor, to improve \nthe safety of West Virginia's mining community. We were there with the \nfamilies after the Sago, Aracoma, and Upper Big Branch tragedies, and I \nknow that he shares my commitment to keeping miners safe.\n  I firmly believe that every American deserves a safe and healthy work \nenvironment. No family should have to experience the sadness and grief \nthat is felt by the families of Upper Big Branch victims. Sadly, the \nUpper Big Branch families are still waiting. They are waiting for \nanswers regarding this horrible tragedy. And, they are waiting for \nCongress to do even more to strengthen the mine safety laws of the \nland.\n  The Upper Big Branch tragedy and several other high-profile workplace \naccidents around the country last year serve as stark reminders of the \nneed to make sure that all workers can return home to their loved ones \nat the end of the day. Yet, these types of tragedies are far too \ncommon. Each year, thousands of employees die on the job and millions \nmore are injured or become ill. These fatalities, injuries, and \nillnesses result not only in loss of life and quality of life, but also \nsubstantial costs for employers. It is in everyone's interest to \nimprove the safety and health of America's workforce.\n  I also know that improving the safety of our workforce will require \nhard work and dedication by everyone involved including state and \nfederal officials, businesses, unions, employees, and safety experts. \nHere in the Senate, I am committed to working with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle--there is no question that we must work \ntogether to find real solutions that will save lives in mining and \nother industries in our country. I have no doubt that we will continue \nto learn more about the Upper Big Branch disaster as the investigations \nmove forward. But I also know that there are several areas of the law \nthat we can work to fix right now. These improvements will make us more \nproactive in identifying hazards before they become fatal, foster \ncooperation between employers and employees to keep everyone safe, \nimprove the efficiency and effectiveness of our regulators, and \nincrease the accountability for those responsible for keeping our \nworkforce safe.\n  The Robert C. Byrd Mine and Workplace Safety and Health Act of 2011 \ntakes important steps to empower miners to report safety concerns and \nkeep themselves and their coworkers safe. Specifically, it gives \nwhistleblowers up to 180 days to file a complaint if they have been \nretaliated against, permits the assessment of punitive damages and \ncriminal penalties against operators that retaliate against miners who \nreport safety problems, makes sure that miners do not lose a paycheck \nwhen their mines are shut down for safety reasons, and allows miners to \ngive private interviews to MSHA without the operator or union \nrepresentative present, so that they can speak openly about \ninvestigations.\n  Our legislation allows MSHA to be more effective and efficient in its \nenforcement of our mine safety laws, while also increasing \naccountability and making sure that the agency is doing everything in \nits power to keep miners safe. Importantly, it expands MSHA's authority \nto subpoena documents and testimony, seek injunctions to stop dangerous \nacts, and implement additional safety training at unsafe mines. It also \ncreates an independent panel to determine MSHA's role in serious \naccidents, and requires that MSHA conduct its inspections in a way that \nprotects every miner regardless of when the miner's shift occurs.\n  Another key piece of this bill is the section that reforms the broken \n``pattern of violations'' process and requires MSHA to focus on \nrehabilitating unsafe mines. The original pattern of violations process \nwas meant to allow MSHA to take additional action against mines that \nrepeatedly violate our laws, but unfortunately it has never been \neffectively implemented. This bill requires unsafe mines to adopt \nsafety plans, undergo additional safety inspections, and meet specific \nsafety improvement benchmarks. To make sure that MSHA's pattern of \nviolations criteria accurately identifies unsafe mines, the Government \nAccountability Office will evaluate the implementation of MSHA's new \ncriteria.\n  I know that Secretary Hilda Solis and Assistant Secretary Joe Main \nhave made mine safety a priority, and I deeply appreciate their work. \nThey are currently examining proposals to administratively change how \nthe pattern of violations process is used, and I support them in those \nefforts. But ultimately, there is only so much that MSHA can do under \nexisting statute, which is why I believe that Congress must address \nthis matter legislatively.\n  We also know that workplace disasters are not confined to the mining \nindustry, which is why our bill provides important, protections for \nworkers across all industries under the jurisdiction of the \nOccupational Safety and\n\n[[Page S225]]\n\nHealth Administration. This legislation allows employees to refuse to \nperform unsafe life-threatening work, updates civil penalties that have \nnot been increased in two decades, gives victims and their families a \nvoice in the investigation and enforcement process, requires employers \nto immediately correct hazardous conditions in the workplace, and \nimproves whistleblower protections for employees.\n  With these common-sense reforms, we can keep workers safe on the job, \nwhile also reducing the costs associated with occupational injuries and \nillnesses. By doing so, we can save lives, help employers save money, \nimprove productivity, and increase the competitiveness of our \nworkforce.\n  I hope that my colleagues will carefully consider this legislation \nand that we can work together on a bipartisan basis to pass meaningful \nmine and workplace safety legislation this Congress. After the Sago and \nAracoma disasters, the Senate passed the MINER Act with strong \nbipartisan support. We showed then that we can get the job done, and I \nam confident that we can do it again.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Brown of Ohio):\n  S. 154. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to make grants \nto support early college high schools and other dual enrollment \nprograms; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Fast Track to \nCollege Act, a bill to support the expansion of dual enrollment \nprograms and Early College High Schools. Such programs allow young \npeople to earn up to two years of college credit while also earning \ntheir high school diploma.\n  I believe the key to our country's economic recovery is a strong \ninvestment in our young people. By investing in education, we ensure \nthat today's students are well prepared to compete in a global economy.\n  Far too many of our students are falling behind in school, and as \nstudents struggle with their studies or drop out of school altogether, \ntheir futures and the health of our workforce are at risk. Young people \nwho drop out of high school are at increased risk for negative outcomes \nsuch as unemployment and incarceration, as well as reliance on public \nassistance for healthcare, housing, and other basic needs--outcomes \nthat have high costs for their communities and our economy. Conversely, \nadults who earn bachelor's degrees earn on average two-thirds more than \nhigh school graduates and $1 million more than high school dropouts \nover their working lives.\n  Studies show many youth drop out because they don't see a practical \nreason to complete high school or go on to get a college degree. Maybe \nthey don't think they can get into college, don't think they can afford \nto go, or just don't see the point in going. Dual enrollment programs \nand Early College High Schools address these issues by showing students \nthat they can succeed in college courses while saving time and money. \nThey don't drop out because they can see that they are on track to a \ndegree--and ultimately a job. By earning college credit, and possibly \neven an Associate's Degree, students are better prepared after high \nschool to continue their education or pursue career training.\n  That is why I ask my colleagues to support this bill, which provides \ncompetitive grant funding for Early College High Schools and other dual \nenrollment programs that allow low-income students to earn college \ncredit and a high school diploma at the same time. These programs put \nstudents on the fast track to college and increase the odds that they \nwill not only graduate, but also go on to continue their education and \nsecure higher-paying jobs.\n  This bill authorizes $140,000,000 for competitive 6-year grants to \nschools, with priority given to schools that serve low-income students. \nThe funding will help defray the costs of implementing new programs, \nstrengthening existing programs, and providing students and teachers \nwith the resources they need to succeed in early college high schools \nand other dual enrollment programs. The bill also includes $10 million \nfor states to provide support for these programs, as well as an \nevaluation component so we can measure the program's effectiveness.\n  I am proud to sponsor this legislation, with the support of Senator \nBrown of Ohio, because I believe this investment in our schools will \nhelp solve the dropout crisis and secure America's future by ensuring \nthat all young people can compete in today's global economy. Further, I \nbelieve that all children, regardless of income or other factors, \ndeserve equal opportunities to fulfill their potential, and it is both \nmorally and fiscally responsible for this Congress to invest in high-\nquality educational programs that help our youth reach their potential.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 154\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan enhanced credit for research and development by companies that \nmanufacture products in the United States; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce three bills that I \nbelieve will be important for our small businesses, especially our \nsmaller manufacturers. In each of these bills, there is an emphasis on \nkeeping our research and development and manufacturing here in the \nUnited States, rewarding our innovative American businesses with \npredictable credits and equitable treatment, and creating good paying \njobs.\n  The first bill, S. 155, is designed to incentivize keeping jobs in \nthe United States by increasing the existing Research & Development tax \ncredit for companies that produce most of their goods domestically. The \nDomestic Jobs Innovation Bonus Act would create a bonus R Credit that \nincreases incrementally to reward a higher percentage of domestic \nproduction. To earn the bonus credit, a company would need to make at \nleast half of their products domestically--and for doing so would \nreceive an additional 2 percentage points on top of the existing R \ncredit. The credit would max out at a 10 percentage point increase for \ncompanies with 90 percent to 100 percent of their receipts from \ndomestic production. For example, a company with 100 percent domestic \nproduction that would normally receive a 20 percent R tax credit \nwould receive a 30 percent credit under this proposal.\n  To be clear, this isn't a tax credit that will benefit every company \nthat has a presence in the United States. It\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\nmay not benefit many large, multi-national corporations, but those \ncompanies will still have access to the existing R Credit, which I \nsupport as well.\n  It is my hope that a credit like this could convince a company that \nis deciding whether to manufacture and research here or abroad, to \nchoose America.\n  I am introducing a second bill, S. 156, with Senators Corker and \nAlexander that would establish a uniform energy efficiency descriptor \nfor all water heaters and improve the testing methods by which that \ndescriptor is determined. Currently, water heaters are lumped into two \ncategories under two federal statutes, based on arbitrary gallon \ncapacity and energy input ratings. ``Smaller'' water heaters are \ncovered by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, NAECA, and \nmust be rated using an energy factor or EF rating. ``Larger'' water \nheaters are within the scope of the Energy Policy Act, EPACT, and must \nbe rated using a thermal efficiency or TE rating. Not only do the \ntesting methods differ, but a manufacturer is forbidden to place an EF \nrating on a TE-sized unit, and vice-versa.\n  This legislation would direct the Department of Energy to work with \nindustry stakeholders to develop a uniform energy efficiency descriptor \nthat applies to all sizes of water heaters. It also would develop a \ntest method to accurately determine that descriptor for all types of \nwater heaters. It is my hope that the water heating manufacturing \ncommunity can develop and implement the new test method and descriptor \nthat will eliminate confusion and enable consumers and business owners \nto make informed purchasing decisions on water heaters. In today's \ntough economy, energy bills continue to stretch family budgets. \nFamilies can save money and conserve energy if they have accurate \ninformation about how much energy home appliances consume.\n  The difference between EF and TE ratings was based on the assumption \nthat smaller units were exclusively for residential uses while larger \nunits were exclusively for commercial purposes. Due to advances in \nmanufacturing technology, the assumptions underlying the earlier \ndividing line are no longer accurate. In fact, both larger and smaller \nunits made by leading U.S. manufacturers are used in residences without \nregard to which Federal law applies. Yet, Federal legislation continues \nto be written by taking this distinction into account.\n  In particular, these American companies are affected by the current \ndisparate energy standards because it can disadvantage some of their \nproducts. Establishing one standard will help breakdown a patchwork of \nincentives and efficiency designations at both the state and federal \nlevel. For example, water heaters rated with a TE rating are not \neligible for the ENERGY STAR label, and accordingly, not eligible for \nmany state appliance rebate programs that link their incentives to an \nENERGY STAR designation. This bill will make it so all products are \ncompeting on a level playing field for all incentives.\n  In addition to the energy savings that this bill will provide, it is \nalso about the jobs potential for companies making these cutting-edge \nproducts. A globally-recognized cluster of water technology companies \nis emerging in the City of Milwaukee and surrounding counties. An \nimportant part of this effort is innovative water heater technologies. \nIncentivizing these products through predictable and equitable \nstandards is vital to these companies.\n  The third bill, S. 157, would extend the Section 48 investment tax \ncredit to solar light pipe technology. This is a promising new \ntechnology that could save our businesses money on their electricity \nbills, and reduce our overall energy usage--two goals on which we can \nall agree. Light pipes collect natural light, and then through the use \nof sensor technology, automatically dim the other lights in a \nbuilding--thereby using less electricity for the same amount of light.\n  Despite the clear benefits of the technology, high cost has kept many \nbusinesses from using light pipes. Adding this technology to Section 48 \nwill provide that boost that these businesses need to justify the \nexpense.\n  I became aware of this technology because one of the companies that \nmakes it is based in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. This company, Orion Energy \nSystems, employs about 250 people, and has been growing even during \nthis tough economic time. In addition to light pipes, Orion makes \nenergy efficient lighting systems, and partners with wind and solar \npower companies to significantly reduce the energy costs for many of \nour largest and most distinguished companies. Orion technology has been \ndeployed at more than 6,000 facilities, and has worked with 126 of the \nFortune 500 companies. Since 2001, Orion customers have saved more than \n$1 billion in electricity costs by displacing nearly 600 megawatts.\n  This credit will help Orion and companies like it create thousands of \njobs through the production of the technology as well as installing it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support all of these bills, and I hope that \nthey are enacted as part of an agenda that focuses on innovation, job \ncreation, and shoring up our vital manufacturing sector.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 170. A bill to provide for the affordable refinancing of mortgages \nheld by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Helping \nResponsible Homeowners Act of 2011. This legislation will eliminate \nbarriers that have prevented millions of borrowers who continue to make \ntheir payments on time from taking advantage of historically low \ninterest rates and refinancing their mortgages.\n  Despite a recent uptick, interest rates for 30-year home mortgages \nremain at historically low levels--under five percent. Yet of the 31.5 \nmillion mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, nearly 13 \nmillion still carry an interest rate at or above 6 percent. This bill \nwould allow non-delinquent mortgages to be refinanced at current rates, \nputting hundreds of dollars a month back in the pockets of struggling \nfamilies.\n  The Administration's Home Affordable Refinance Program has resulted \nin Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac refinancing 520,000 loans through October \n2010, far short of its goal of assisting four to five million \nhomeowners.\n  One reason for the program's failure is that Fannie and Freddie \ncontinue to charge risk-based fees to refinance a loan they already \nguarantee. These additional fees can be as high as two percent of the \nloan amount, or an extra $4,000 on a $200,000 loan. In my home state of \nCalifornia, where prices are higher, that might be $8,000 on a $400,000 \nloan. For borrowers struggling to keep up with their payments, this is \nan additional cost they simply cannot afford.\n  Fannie and Freddie already bear the risks on these loans; yet this \npolicy actually makes it less likely that borrowers will be able to \ntake advantage of the low rates and increases the chance they will \neventually default.\n  Many borrowers also have been blocked from refinancing by the owner \nof their second mortgage, even though reducing payments on the first \nmortgage would make it more likely the borrower would be able to \ncontinue making payments on the second.\n  To remove these barriers and allow borrowers current on their \npayments to refinance their loans, the Helping Responsible Homeowners \nAct would eliminate risk-based fees on loans for which Fannie and \nFreddie already bear the risk; remove refinancing limits on properties \nthat lost value during the real estate crisis; make it easier for \nborrowers with second mortgages to participate in refinancing programs; \nand require that borrowers are able to receive a fair interest rate, \ncomparable to that received by any other current borrower who has not \nsuffered a drop in home value.\n  At a time when millions of Americans have been forced out of their \nhomes, this legislation will ensure that homeowners who make their \npayments on time will be able to refinance their mortgages at current \nlow rates so they can stay in their homes. I urge my colleagues to join \nme and to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 174. A bill to improve the health of Americans and reduce health \ncare costs by reorienting the Nation's health care\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\nsystem toward prevention, wellness, and health promotion; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Healthy Lifestyles and Prevention \nAmerica Act, also known as the HeLP America Act, will improve the \nhealth of Americans and reduce health care costs by emphasizing \nprevention, wellness, and health promotion in our communities, \nworkplaces and schools.\n  We made a significant investment in prevention and wellness as part \nof the passing of the historic Affordable Care Act into law. The robust \narray of provisions contained in the HeLP America Act continue to build \noff the investments made by the Affordable Care Act and together, they \nwill significantly transform our current sick care system into a true \nhealth care system.\n  Make no mistake about it; these combined efforts will continue our \ntransformation into a genuine wellness society by keeping people from \ndeveloping chronic diseases and from costly hospitalizations in the \nfirst place.\n  Currently, the United States spends more than $2 trillion on health \ncare each year but historically we invest just four cents out of every \ndollar in prevention and public health--let me repeat that--just four \ncents out of every dollar is invested in prevention and public health.\n  This is pennies despite all the research that shows that prevention \nand public health can effectively reduce health care spending. This is \nwhy I fought for the Prevention and Public Health Fund that is included \nin the health reform law.\n  But transforming our Nation into a true wellness society requires a \ncomprehensive approach to make being healthier easier for all \nAmericans.\n  It just doesn't make any sense why we don't put a greater emphasis on \nmaking health promotion easier--why would we focus so little on \nprevention and public health when we know that these initiatives can \nmake us healthier and reduce our annual health care spending?\n  Well, I am proud that the bill before the Senate continues to make \nsignificant investments in prevention and wellness. The HeLP America \nAct will put additional systems into place that will improve access to \nnutritious foods, opportunities for physical activity, and \naffordability of recommended preventive services.\n  The bill focuses on initiatives to make kids and schools healthier. \nIn particular, it will support State efforts to provide resources to \nchild care providers to help them meet high-quality physical activity \nand healthy eating standards. It also directs the Department of \nEducation to provide guidance and technical assistance to schools to \nprovide equal opportunities for students with disabilities for physical \neducation and extracurricular athletics.\n  In addition, the bill focuses on initiatives to make healthier \ncommunities and workplaces. For example, it requires the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to establish guidelines in physical activity \nfor children under the age of 5 and the Secretary of Agriculture to \nestablish a grant program promoting and expanding efforts to create \ncommunity gardens. Specific to small businesses and workplace wellness \nprograms, there is a provision that allows employers to deduct the cost \nof athletic facility memberships for their employees and exempts this \nbenefit as taxable income for employees.\n  The HeLP America Act also creates systems that give Americans the \ninformation they need to make informed decisions. In particular, there \nis a provision that requires uniform guidelines be developed for the \nuse of nutrient labeling symbols or systems on the front of food \npackages. There are provisions meant to strengthen federal initiatives \nto improve the health literacy of consumers by making health \ninformation easier to understand and health care systems easier to \nnavigate.\n  Let me be clear, this bill doesn't just tinker around the edges; it \nchanges the very paradigm of a variety of systems to make it easier for \nAmericans to be healthy. After many years of advocating for wellness \nand prevention, I am thrilled to see that these things were at the very \nheart of the historic Affordable Care Act passed into law. But there is \nstill much more to be done, and the HeLP America Act is an important \nstep in continuing our transformation into a genuine wellness society \nand getting health care costs under control.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 174\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the expansion of the biofuels market; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the great \nimportance of expanding the production and availability of biofuels, \nand the significant impact that biofuels continue to have on reducing \nour overall consumption of petroleum in the United States.\n  Our national energy situation continues to deteriorate. Because we \nimport 60 percent of the petroleum we consume, our economy faces a \nconstant threat from volatile petroleum prices as well as significant \namounts of American wealth being transferred to foreign producers. \nBecause more than two-thirds of our petroleum supply is consumed by our \ntransportation sector, we can improve this situation by expanding the \nproduction and use of alternatives to petroleum-derived fuels. Domestic \nbiofuels have been by far our most successful alternative. Biofuels \nalready displace close to 10 percent of our gasoline supplies, and they \nhave the potential to make significantly larger contributions in the \nyears ahead. Expanding domestic biofuels production and use also will \nsupport economic recovery by creating jobs in the areas of feedstock \nproduction and delivery, fuels processing in bio refineries, and \nbiofuels marketing.\n  The American people understand the need to reduce our dependence on \nforeign petroleum supplies. Congress has expressed broad agreement on \ntwo fundamental approaches--increasing efficiency of vehicles and \nincreasing use of alternative fuels. We mandated more efficient \nvehicles by passing the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, \nEISA. That bill mandates a brisk expansion of biofuels production under \nthe Renewable Fuels Standard. However, biofuels currently are facing \ncritical market barriers. The most common form of biofuel, ethanol, can \nonly be used as a 10 percent blend with gasoline in most highway \nvehicles. To enable much larger production and use levels, we need to \nexpand the number of flex-fuel vehicles that can use higher blends, and \nwe need to expand the number of filling stations selling those higher \nblends. We also need to enable safer and more economical transport of \nhigher volumes by supporting development of biofuel pipelines.\n  To these ends, I am proud today to introduce the Biofuels Market \nExpansion Act of 2011. This measure would require that at least 90 \npercent of new auto sales in the United States be flex fuel vehicles by \n2016. It would also require major fuel distributers, those owning or \nbranding more than 50 gasoline filling stations, to install increasing \nnumbers of blender pumps at their retail filling stations, and it would \nauthorize funding to support blender pump installations by smaller \nfilling station operators. Finally, this measure would authorize \nguarantees for loans covering 80 percent of renewable fuel pipeline \nproject costs.\n  The requirements and assistance authorized in this bill will ensure \nthat the number of flex-fuel automobiles and the availability of \nalternative fuels are expanding in tandem with the production and use \nof biofuels in our national fuel supply over the next 8 years and \nbeyond. This is a job-creating bill that reduces American dependence on \nforeign petroleum by giving Americans the option of choosing clean, \ndomestically-produced fuels for their personal transportation needs in \nthe future. These steps represent critical components in the transition \nof our energy systems away from fossil and imported fuels toward the \nbenefits of greater reliance on sustainable domestic fuel sources.\n  Today, I urge my Senate colleagues to join us in taking action to \nboost the transition to a cleaner, more resilient, and more secure \nenergy economy. I urge Senators' support for this bill and its rapid \nenactment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 187\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize all of the \nproviders who work in retail-based Convenient Care Clinics in a \nResolution to designate August 1 through August 7, 2011 as National \nConvenient Care Clinic Week. National Convenient Care Clinic Week will \nprovide a national platform from which to promote the pivotal services \noffered by the more than 1,100 retail-based convenient care clinics in \nthe United States.\n  Today, thousands of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and \nphysicians provide care in convenient care clinics. At a time when \nAmericans are more and more challenged by the inaccessibility and high \ncosts of health care, convenient care offers a vital high-quality \nprimary care alternative.\n  A Senate Resolution will help pave the way for this effort. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this tribute to Convenient Care \nClinics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/01/25/senate-section/article/S242-1", "month": "01", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 16--TO REQUIRE THAT ALL LEGISLATIVE MATTERS BE \nAVAILABLE AND FULLY SCORED BY CBO 72 HOURS BEFORE CONSIDERATION BY ANY \n SUBCOMMITTEE OR COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE OR ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Crapo, \nMr. Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Coburn, and Mr. Thune) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.

Res. 17\n\n       Whereas military families, through their sacrifices and \n     their dedication to the United States and its values, \n     represent the bedrock upon which the United States was \n     founded and upon which the country continues to rely in these \n     perilous and challenging times: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates November 2011 as ``National Military Family \n     Month''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     National Military Family Month with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to honor all our military \nfamilies by introducing a Resolution to designate November as National \nMilitary Family Month. As we all know, memories fade and the hardships \nexperienced by our military families are easily forgotten unless they \ntouch our own immediate family.\n  Today, we have our men and women deployed all over the world, engaged \nin this war on terrorism. These far-ranging military deployments are \nextremely difficult on the families who bear this heavy burden.\n  To honor these families, the Armed Services YMCA has sponsored \nMilitary Family Week in late November since 1996. However, due to \nfrequent ``short week'' conflicts around the Thanksgiving holidays, the \ndesignated week has not always afforded enough time to schedule \nobservances on and near our military bases.\n  I believe a month long observation will allow greater opportunity to \nplan events.

Res. 20\n\n       Whereas the United States has signed free trade agreements \n     with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama, but Congress has not \n     approved those agreements;\n       Whereas, according to the United States International Trade \n     Commission, the gross domestic product of the United States \n     will likely increase by $10,100,000,000 to $11,900,000,000 as \n     a result of increased access to the market of South Korea \n     under the provisions of the United States-Korea Free Trade \n     Agreement;\n       Whereas, according to the United States International Trade \n     Commission, implementing the United States-Korea Free Trade \n     Agreement will increase exports from the United States by an \n     estimated $9,700,000,000 to $10,900,000,000 each year;\n       Whereas, according to the United States International Trade \n     Commission, implementing the United States-Korea Free Trade \n     Agreement would create 20,000 to 24,000 jobs in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the implementation of the United States-Korea Free \n     Trade Agreement will ensure that agricultural products \n     exported from the United States to South Korea receive \n     treatment equivalent to the treatment provided by the United \n     States to agricultural products exported from South Korea and \n     will significantly increase exports of agricultural products \n     from the United States to South Korea;\n       Whereas the American Farm Bureau estimates an increase of \n     $1,800,000,000 in United States agricultural trade per year \n     after the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement is fully \n     implemented;\n       Whereas increased trade will help to strengthen ties \n     between the United States and South Korea and advance \n     important national security goals;\n       Whereas the United States and Colombia negotiated and \n     signed the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement \n     on November 22, 2006;\n       Whereas, according to the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative, Colombia is currently the 27th largest \n     trading partner of the United States with respect to goods;\n       Whereas, according to the United States International Trade \n     Commission, implementation of the United States-Colombia \n     Trade Promotion Agreement will increase exports from the \n     United States by an estimated $1,100,000,000 each year;\n       Whereas, according to the United States International Trade \n     Commission, implementation of the United States-Colombia \n     Trade Promotion Agreement will create 3,693 jobs;\n       Whereas, in 2010, more than 90 percent of exports from \n     Colombia to the United States entered the United States duty-\n     free under the Andean Trade Preference Act (19 U.S.C. 3201 et \n     seq.) and the Generalized System of Preferences under title V \n     of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2461 et seq.);\n       Whereas, according to the United States International Trade \n     Commission, goods valued at $11,400,000,000 were exported \n     from the United States to Colombia in 2008, an increase from \n     $3,600,000,000 in 2002;\n       Whereas, according to the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative, more than 80 percent of consumer and \n     industrial products exported from the United States to \n     Colombia will enter Colombia duty-free as soon as the United \n     States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement enters into force \n     and all remaining tariffs on such products will be eliminated \n     within 10 years after the Agreement enters into force;\n       Whereas, according to the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative, the primary exports from the United States to \n     Colombia in 2008 were $2,600,000,000 in machinery, \n     $10,000,000,000 in mineral fuel, $974,000,000 in organic \n     chemicals, $969,000,000 in corn and wheat cereals, and \n     $950,000,000 in electrical machinery;\n       Whereas, according to the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative, Colombia is the 15th largest market for farm \n     products exported from the United States, with the United \n     States exporting almost $1,700,000,000 worth of farm products \n     to Colombia in 2008;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Agriculture, 99.9 \n     percent of agricultural products imported into the United \n     States from Colombia already enter the United States duty-\n     free, but no agricultural products exported from the United \n     States to Colombia currently enter Colombia duty-free;\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\n       Whereas, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation, \n     the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement would \n     increase sales of agricultural products produced in the \n     United States by $910,000,000 each year;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of Agriculture, more \n     than half of agricultural products exported from the United \n     States to Colombia will enter Colombia duty-free as soon as \n     the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement enters \n     into force and all remaining tariffs on such products will be \n     phased out over time;\n       Whereas the United States and Panama, after 10 rounds of \n     negotiations, signed the United States-Panama Trade Promotion \n     Agreement on December 16, 2006;\n       Whereas the United States values its long-standing \n     bilateral relationship with Panama;\n       Whereas the National Assembly of Panama ratified the United \n     States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement by a vote of 58 to 4 \n     on July 11, 2007;\n       Whereas 88 percent of United States commercial and \n     industrial exports will enter Panama duty-free immediately \n     after the United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement \n     enters into force and all remaining tariffs on such exports \n     will be phased out over 10 years;\n       Whereas more than 60 percent of exports of agricultural \n     products from the United States will enter Panama duty-free \n     immediately after the United States-Panama Trade Promotion \n     Agreement enters into force and all remaining tariffs on \n     agricultural products will be phased out over 20 years;\n       Whereas, according to the United States International Trade \n     Commission, the primary effect of the implementation of the \n     United States-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement will be to \n     increase exports from the United States to Panama because 96 \n     percent of imports from Panama already enter the United \n     States duty-free; and\n       Whereas concerns about Panama's alleged position as a ``tax \n     haven'' have been addressed with the November 30, 2010, \n     signing of a United States-Panama Tax Information Exchange \n     Agreement, which permits the competent authorities of the \n     United States and Panama to request information on most taxes \n     to better increase transparency in an attempt to combat \n     illegal financial transactions, including those linked to \n     drug smuggling and money laundering: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate recognizes that the implementation of the \n     United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, the United States-\n     Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, and the United States-\n     Panama Trade Promotion Agreement will--\n       (A) create jobs in the United States;\n       (B) increase export opportunities for businesses and \n     agricultural producers in the United States; and\n       (C) further develop cross-cultural business relationships \n     between the United States and South Korea, Colombia, and \n     Panama, respectively; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that it is in the \n     security, economic, and diplomatic interests of the United \n     States to enhance relationships with South Korea, Colombia, \n     and Panama, respectively, by immediately approving the United \n     States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, the United States-Colombia \n     Trade Promotion Agreement, and the United States-Panama Trade \n     Promotion Agreement.\n\n

Immediately after the \n     motion is made and before putting the question thereon, the \n     Presiding Officer shall immediately inquire whether any \n     Senator seeks recognition for the purpose of debating the \n     measure, motion or other matter on which the Senate had \n     previously voted against closing debate under subparagraph \n     (b).
