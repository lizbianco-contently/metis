Mr. President, this weekend we will celebrate Independence \nDay and 235 years of this country's very proud history. This Nation was \nfounded on the notion of liberty and justice for all. As we celebrate, \nwe should remember that the pursuit of liberty is not just a journey \nwith a destination but, rather, a quest to which we must recommit \nourselves every single day. As we commit fully and firmly to liberty \nand justice, we must commit just as fully and firmly to the idea that \nthe liberty and justice should be truly for all.\n  It is often said that with liberty comes responsibility. We should \ntake that responsibility seriously. I am confident we do. That is why \nthe Senate will reconvene on Tuesday, the day after the Fourth. We will \ndo that because we have work to do. We will be in session that week--\nthat is next week--with our first vote on July 5. We will determine \nwhat time that vote will be on July 5, likely in the afternoon because \nof the travel problems with the Fourth of July the previous day. There \nis still so much to do to put Americans back to work, cut our deficit, \nget our economy back to work. It is very important we do this. That \nmoment is too important, the obstacles too steep, and the time too \nshort to waste even a moment.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues will put politics aside and help \nDemocrats fulfill Congress's responsibility to the American people. \nThere are some Republicans in Congress who say the U.S. Government has \nless responsibility to pay its bills than struggling families\n\n[[Page S4244]]\n\nall across our great country. As a default crisis approaches, \nRepublicans are saying we should simply stop cutting checks for the \nnational equivalent of the home mortgage, the credit card, the car \npayment. Republicans say this crisis is about spending more or growing \ngovernment. They are wrong. This crisis is about paying the bills for \nthings we have already bought--for example, a decade of tax breaks for \nmillionaires and billionaires, our war of choice in Iraq, the war in \nAfghanistan, those tax cuts for billionaires and millionaires and the \nwars unpaid for. What they are not saying is what the consequences \nwould be of such an irresponsible decision to not pay our accrued \nbills--remember, the bills we already accumulated, have run up. If we \ndid not pay our bills, it would plunge the United States not into a \nrecession, not into the so-called double-dip recession, but into a \nfull-blown depression. That is without a doubt. Without exception, the \nrespected financial voices of our time have said the effects of a \ndefault crisis would be felt across the globe, not just here in the \nUnited States. I repeat, this would create a worldwide depression.\n  Many respected voices could not have spoken in clearer terms. From \nthe private sector, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, a man by the name of \nJamie Dimon, said default would be ``catastrophic.'' He went on to say \nraising the debt limit is our ``moral obligation.''\n  What does that mean? It means the world should ``know that the United \nStates is good for its money. Period.'' That is what Jamie Dimon said, \nand I agree.\n  He is not the only one saying this. Business leaders have said it, \neconomists have said it, banks have said it, and Republican advisers to \nPresidents Reagan and the first George Bush have said it. Perhaps more \nimportantly, credit rating agencies have said it. Credit rating \nagencies Standard & Poor's and Moody's have said that if the United \nStates misses even one payment, the Nation will immediately lose its \nhigh credit rating, interest rates would increase. Remember, for every \n1-percent increase in the interest rates it would cost our country $1.3 \ntrillion--not million, not billion, trillion.\n  That is one more reason why defaulting on our debt to make a point \nabout fiscal responsibility makes so little sense. If we default, it \nwill actually cost our Nation more to meet our financial obligations in \nthe future, and that is a gross understatement.\n  Democrats believe we must create jobs and get our economy moving \nagain. We must cut spending and live within our means. We all know \nthat. We must eliminate tax loopholes for millionaires, billionaires, \nand oil companies. Republicans must not put the economy of this country \nand the world at risk for the sake of protecting special interests and \nthe big donors. It is time we returned to the type of fiscal discipline \nDemocrats brought to Washington in the 1990s, when Democrats in \nCongress and the White House balanced the budget and used the surplus--\nto do what? To pay down the debt. We were being criticized for paying \ndown the debt too fast. President Bush changed that very quickly.\n  But a default crisis would do nothing to get our fiscal house in \norder. Instead, default, in effect bankruptcy, would derail our fragile \neconomic recovery and plunge this Nation and the world back into not \njust a recession but a full-blown depression. I said that earlier. It \nis the truth. It would also risk millions of Americans' jobs, tax \nrefunds, Social Security checks, Medicare payments, and paychecks for \nour troops.\n\n  There was a nice report written the day before yesterday by Alice \nRivlin and one of George Bush's Assistant Secretaries of the Treasury \nand they said the same thing but in much more detail. Frankly, reading \nthat was very frightening. Those risks are simply not worth taking.\n  Today, middle-class families in America are struggling to survive \neconomically. They are living paycheck to paycheck in many instances. \nMeanwhile, Republicans walked away from the negotiations. Why did they \nwalk away from the negotiations that would have cut the deficit and \naverted a catastrophic default? They did it in order to protect tax \nbreaks for millionaires and billionaires. That is obvious. Republicans \nare willing to risk our economy to keep tax breaks for corporations and \nship jobs overseas. Meanwhile, average Americans are struggling to find \nwork here at home. Republicans are willing to risk our economy to \nprotect tax breaks for owners of corporate jets and yachts and oil \ncompanies, while the average Americans are struggling to afford gas for \ntheir cars. Republicans are willing to risk our economy to protect tax \nbreaks for millionaires and billionaires and average Americans are \nstruggling to meet their mortgage payments for their homes.\n  I have said it before. Republicans simply have the wrong priorities. \nThey have made it their mission to stand and shout for the richest few. \nWe Democrats consider it our responsibility to stand and shout for all \nAmericans. That is what this debate is all about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4244-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today I want to speak about a young man \nfrom Corbin, KY, who gave his life in service of our country. LCpl \nTimothy Matthew Jackson, a U.S. marine, was tragically killed while \nconducting combat operations in Helmand province, Afghanistan, on \nSeptember 30, 2010. He was 22 years old.\n  Lance Corporal Jackson was deployed with the 2nd Battalion, 9th \nMarine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force, \nFox Company, based out of Camp Lejeune, NC.\n  For his heroic service, he received many awards, medals, and \ndecorations, including the Purple Heart, the Combat Action Ribbon, the \nMarine Corps Good Conduct Medal, three Sea Service Deployment Ribbons, \nthe Afghanistan Campaign Medal, two Iraq Campaign Medals, the Global \nWar on Terrorism Service Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal.\n  Lance Corporal Jackson--who went by his middle name, Matt--attended \nCorbin Elementary School, Corbin Middle School, and Corbin High School, \nwhere he graduated in the class of 2007.\n\n[[Page S4245]]\n\nMany who knew Matt in school knew of his desire to serve in the \nmilitary after graduation. He was an enthusiastic participant in his \nschool's Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps.\n  ``All he ever wanted to do when he graduated was join the Marines and \nserve his country, and that's what he did,'' says COL Rick McClure, \nMatt's senior instructor in Corbin High's JROTC program.\n  Matt was an ``outstanding young man. He was quiet. Always had a \nsmile. Just a super young man,'' Colonel McClure says. ``And as long as \nI knew him, what he wanted to do was to graduate from high school and \nbe a marine . . . I'm just so thankful that we have guys like Matt that \nwill go and give their lives for the freedoms we enjoy.''\n  Matt's wife Nikki remembers the surprising way Matt asked her to \nmarry him. It was on Christmas Eve. Matt and Nikki were with family, \nopening presents. One present was addressed to both of them, and Matt \nopened it to reveal a Cracker Jack box.\n  ``He handed it to me and said open it,'' Nikki says. ``When I did, \neveryone's hand shot for some, and by the time I could pour some in my \nhand it was crumbs. There fell the ring in my hand, and I looked at him \nand he was down on one knee and asked me to marry him. Of course I said \nyeah.'' Matt and Nikki were married on May 22, 2009.\n  For Matt's mom Jody Tonkin, it is too hard to pick just one memory of \nher son. ``I don't have just one,'' she says. ``As his mom, all my \nmemories are the best.''\n  Matt's aunt Theresa Jackson Hopkins, remembers when Matt was a little \nboy and went on a trip to Disney World. ``He had a smile on his face \nthe whole time,'' she says. ``That had to be the highlight of his life, \nuntil he met Nikki.''\n  Matt worked hard to prepare himself for the service, and joined the \nMarine Corps right after high school. In 2008 he was deployed to Iraq. \nHe also served on missions in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, \nand Cuba. After his military service concluded, he was looking forward \nto a career in law enforcement.\n  Matt's uncle Tom Jackson, remembers the day Matt came home from \nAfghanistan for a hero's funeral. At the terminal of the London-Corbin \nAirport waiting to meet the plane carrying Matt's body were over a \nhundred Patriot Guard Riders, with American flags on their motorcycles, \nthere to escort the fallen marine to the funeral home.\n  ``As we followed the hearse from the airport, the Riders slowed, and \nthere beside the road was a small group of men, women, and children \nwaving flags as tears ran down their faces,'' says Tom Jackson. ``I \ncould read their lips saying `thank you' and at that point in time \nthere was an outward burst of emotion that I just could not contain. I \nwas crying like a baby, a sight that I'm sure that my daughter and \ngrandson had never seen from me.''\n  The number of people who wished to thank Lance Corporal Jackson for \nhis service was so great the funeral home chapel could not accommodate \nthem all. The city of Corbin graciously donated the use of the Arena at \nthe Southeastern Kentucky Ag & Expo Complex, where hundreds came to pay \ntheir respects.\n  We must keep Matt's friends and family in our thoughts as I recount \nhis story for the Senate today. We are thinking of his wife, Nichole A. \nJackson; his father, Timothy Wayne Jackson; his mother, Jody Tonkin; \nhis brothers, Jerricho Tonkin, Barry Daniel Powell, Dustin Johnson, and \nWayne Spurlin; his stepmother, Lorrie Johnson; his stepfather, Billy \nBowers; his grandmothers, Mary Jackson and Carol Gable; his uncle, Tom \nJackson; his cousin, Michael Ryan Hopkins; his aunt, Theresa Jackson \nHopkins; and many other beloved family members and friends. Matt was \npreceded in death by his grandfather, Edgar Jackson.\n  Matt's Uncle Tom can still recall a time he and a 9-year-old Matt \nwere walking in the woods after dark and Tom feared they were lost. \nMatt was scared, but put on a brave face nearly until the end--when he \nfinally said, ``Uncle Tom, hold my hand,'' just as the two of them \nreached the truck.\n  The family of LCpl Timothy Matthew Jackson must be very proud that \nlittle boy grew up to become one of our country's most honored heroes, \na brave marine. I want them to know this U.S. Senate honors Lance \nCorporal Jackson for his life of service. And we honor the immense \nsacrifice he made on behalf of a very grateful Nation.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4245-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4245-S4246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FISCAL POLICY\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we are involved in a very important \nnational debate about our finances, our deficits, our debt, investments \nin our economy, including the creation of jobs, and how we take on \nthose problems in the most effective manner to build a strong financial \nfoundation for our Nation going ahead and a strong set of opportunities \nfor families to thrive. In the course of this debate, there has been a \nvery interesting development that merits our attention, and that \ndevelopment is this: Some of my colleagues across the aisle have, over \ntime, chosen to put key programs for the wealthy and well connected not \nin an appropriations bill but in tax legislation. There are advantages \nto doing so. With appropriations, programs have to be defended year \nafter year. It has to be reviewed in committee. It may have to go \nthrough an authorization process as well as an appropriations process. \nBut if a program for the wealthy and well connected is placed in the \nTax Code, then, unless a sunset clause has been instituted, that \nprogram is a gift that keeps on giving, unexamined in the course of the \nstandard appropriating process.\n  By putting these programs for the wealthy and well connected into the \nTax Code, some of my colleagues across the aisle have said that as a \nresult, there is an additional advantage. We can claim these programs \nare off-limits, and we can claim that if anyone seeks to examine these \nprograms for the wealthy and well connected, they are seeking to \n``raise taxes,'' and we will scare the American citizens into revolt \nagainst that effort to examine these sacred cows.\n  I think this attitude, quite frankly, underestimates American \ncitizens. American citizens understand very well what is up. They \nunderstand there is an effort to put programs for working Americans in \nlegislation where it has to be authorized regularly, where it has to go \nthrough the appropriations process annually, but the programs for the \nmost wealthy and well connected are put over here behind the fence \nwhere they don't have to go through that process, and then they say \nthose are sacred cows and we can't touch them.\n  There is a big difference between fighting for fairness for working \nAmericans and fighting to defend the benefits for the best off in our \nsociety. This is a debate that must be on the floor of the Senate.\n  It was in 1976 that I came here as an intern to Senator Hatfield. As \nit turned out, I was assigned to the Tax Reform Act of 1976. In that \nassignment, I was reading all the mail from Oregon. Then, as the debate \ncame to this Chamber, I would meet Senator Hatfield at the elevator \ndoors, just outside these double doors to the Chamber. Of course, in \nthose days we didn't have a television camera in the Chamber, and in \nthose days we didn't have e-mail to communicate. So staff members would \nline up and meet their Senators coming off the elevator and brief them \nabout the debate: What were the ups and downs, what were people back \nhome saying, what type of vote it was, whether it was an up-or-down \nvote, a motion to table, and so on and so forth. Then I would run up to \nthe seats for the staff to observe the debate, and then I would come \nback down when the next vote on an amendment came up.\n  That review in 1976 was a tough discussion, because anytime we talk \nabout cutting a program, anyone who benefits from that program is very \nupset. But there was an understanding on both sides of the aisle that \nwe owed it to the American taxpayer to spend every dollar in the best \npossible fashion, and, therefore, there could be no fence walling off \nprograms for some for consideration, while the programs for\n\n[[Page S4246]]\n\nothers merit full examination. Everything needed to be talked about. \nEverything needed to be weighed as to the value it provided.\n  Again in 1986, a decade later, an even larger effort--a major \neffort--was undertaken to examine every tax program, whether it was one \nthat benefited people here or people there, to weigh it in the context \nof our fiscal responsibility to the Nation. It was Senator Hatfield \nfrom Oregon who was head of the Finance Committee and who led that \ndebate on the floor of the Senate. I emphasize that Senator Hatfield \nwas a Republican. Republicans back then believed in fiscal \nresponsibility. They didn't believe in setting off one part of the Tax \nCode for the wealthy and well connected that would never be examined \nagain, while the programs for working Americans were on the table. No. \nThey looked at everything across the entire spectrum.\n  So here we are not in 1976, not in 1986 but in 2011. It has been a \nquarter century since we have had a serious review of the programs \nembedded in the Tax Code. I must say we have every reason to examine \nevery program funded, whether through the appropriations code or the \nTax Code, because we face serious financial circumstances. It is in \nthis context that I would have expected to hear the echoes of 1986--\nthat every program is up for examination and every program is going to \nbe tested against a rigorous set of circumstances to say it is the best \nuse of our dollars. But, instead, my colleagues across the aisle take \nthe position of putting up a very high fence around the tax provisions \nfor the wealthy and well connected, saying their No. 1 goal is to \nprotect those provisions. Programs for seniors are on the table. \nDismantling Medicare is a Republican plan. Programs for those who don't \nhave enough food to eat are on the table. Unemployment has been on the \ntable. Funding for the infrastructure we need to rebuild our country is \non the table, but this set of sacred cows is not, this set of sacred \nprograms for the wealthy and well connected.\n  Quite frankly, that is wrong. That must change. We must bring that \ndebate to the floor of the Senate as our colleagues did a quarter \ncentury ago, as our colleagues did 35 years ago.\n  So when it comes to these programs, there must be no sacred cows and \nthere must be no sacred horses. This chart says ``running away with our \ntax dollars.'' One of the tax programs my colleagues across the aisle \nare insisting be walled off from examination is a special writeoff for \nthoroughbred racehorses. Yes, racehorses. This is the bluegrass \nboondoggle which allows millionaire and billionaire racehorse owners to \nwrite off the cost of their horses in an accelerated manner, reducing \nthe normal 7-year period to just 3 years. This bluegrass boondoggle \nwill cost U.S. taxpayers, over the course of the coming 10 years, $126 \nmillion, according to CBO estimates, after modeling the impact of this \ntax provision. This is equivalent to us writing a check over this \ncoming decade for $126 million. This is equivalent to a grant program. \nThis is equivalent to subsidizing a loan program. No program, simply \nbecause it is in one bill--the tax bill--rather than in another bill--\nan appropriations bill--should be off-limits. Horseracing may have been \ncalled the sport of kings----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator will \nsuspend.\n  The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you, Mr. President. Is there a 10-minute rule in \neffect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is.\n  Mr. Schumer addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I believe I am the next speaker. I ask unanimous consent \nto cede the Senator from Oregon 3 minutes of my 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague from New York, and I appreciate \nthose 3 minutes.\n  So horseracing may have been called the sport of kings, but that \ndoesn't mean owners of horses--those millionaires and billionaires \nsupporting those horses--need royal tax treatment. As long as these tax \nsubsidies are preserved, the richest and best off will remain in the \nwinner's circle, while working families don't even get a chance to \ncompete.\n  There is no doubt that closing this loophole alone isn't going to \nsolve our deficit problem, but it is a good place to start because, \notherwise, we are going to cut $126 million from Head Start or $126 \nmillion from Medicare for our seniors or programs that help retrain \nlaid-off workers. Giving ``triple crown'' treatment to millionaires, \nwhile workers are put out to pasture is not right, and it is not the \nAmerican way.\n  I have proposed searching through the Tax Code to find wasteful tax \nsubsidies and eliminate unnecessary giveaways. This year is the right \ntime to start. No one program should be singled out. We should set a \nseries of standards and test each tax program against those standards \non whether they create jobs, whether they make a stronger economy, \nwhether they take America forward, and whether that $126 million spent \nin this category or that is more important to the Nation than other \ncuts we might be entertaining. Those are the tests that need to be \napplied in a thoughtful and thorough manner. It is time to stop walling \noff the programs for the wealthy and well connected while attacking \nprograms that make working America go forward in a stronger fashion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4246-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will be \nin a period of morning business until 12 noon, with Senators permitted \nto speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, with the time equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with \nthe majority controlling the first hour and the Republicans controlling \nthe second hour.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oregon. \nOnce again, he is forthright, he is courageous, he is on the money, and \npeople should listen to him because he says a lot of good things about \na lot of subjects, including this one. I appreciate what he has said.\n  After weeks of stops and starts, we are now approaching crunch time \nin the debt ceiling talks. I believe a grand bipartisan bargain is \npossible but only if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle take \noff their partisan blinders. Neither side can afford to cling to their \nideological positions any longer.\n  To get the economy humming on all cylinders again and avoid a default \ncrisis, we need to say goodbye to a few sacred cows. Yet, mere weeks \nafter voting to repeal ethanol subsidies, the other side's leader, the \nSenator from Kentucky, has drawn a line in the sand against including \nany and all revenue changes in the debt deal. He has said that repeal \nof special interest tax breaks is ``politically impossible.'' Well, \nthat is a curious idea given that the Senator from Kentucky and 33 of \nhis colleagues are on record as supporting the end of ethanol \ngiveaways. It seems Leader McConnell would rather end Medicare as we \nknow it and force cuts to Pell grants and cancer research than \ninstitute a little shared sacrifice.\n  On this side of the aisle, we want to repeal tax breaks that have no \npurpose whatsoever other than to bloat our budget deficit.\n  Today, I want to highlight one of the most egregiously wasteful \nloopholes in the Tax Code: the tax break for yacht owners. Yes, believe \nit or not, Uncle Sam subsidizes the purchase of sprawling, luxurious, \n72-foot Viking yachts. As long as your yacht has a place to sleep and a \nplace to--how shall I put it--relieve yourself, you can classify it as \nyour ``second home'' and claim the mortgage interest deduction. That's \nright. The deduction Congress helped create for middle-class families \nto realize the American dream of home ownership is helping millionaires \nand billionaires get a 35-percent discount on their yachts. In fact, \nhow-to books on tax avoidance advise readers that ``if you're paying \nfor your yacht in cash, you're paying too much.'' Millionaires who \nwould otherwise write a six-figure check for their yacht without \nbatting an eye instead take out a loan so they can claim the mortgage \ninterest deduction. The IRS's only requirement is\n\n[[Page S4247]]\n\nthat the yacht owner provide proof that they spend 14 days a year on \nthe boat. If only Gilligan and the Skipper had taken a 14-day trip \ninstead of a 3-hour tour, they could have expensed the cost to the S.S. \nMinnow.\n  There are tough choices ahead as we seek to achieve our dual goal of \ncreating jobs and reining in the deficit. But repealing this insane tax \nbreak for yacht owners is not tough at all--not by a mile or, to put it \nin terms our nautical friends would understand, not by a league.\n  I want to make clear that I have nothing against yacht owners. God \nbless them. They are doing well for themselves, and in America we \ncelebrate success and say: Enjoy your success. That is a great thing. \nBut at a time when the government is tightening its belt and we are \ngrappling with painful cuts to vital programs, it boggles the mind to \ncontinue to give boaters a tax break they do not need and never should \nhave had in the first place.\n  It is a question of priorities. Both sides are for deficit reduction. \nIf our side dug a line in the sand and said: No cuts to programs, we \nwould be regarded as way off the deep end and not really wanting to \ncompromise. Well, the mirror image is exactly true. Just as we must \nendure program cuts we consider painful, the other side must endure \ncuts they may consider painful on the tax side.\n  We will not get anywhere unless both sides compromise, and what we \nare doing here today--the Senator from Oregon, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, the Senator from Illinois, myself, and many others--is we are \nshowing that there is plenty of room on the tax side--these are small; \nthere are larger ones--there is plenty of room on the tax side to \neliminate waste, just as there is plenty of room on the spending side \nto eliminate waste, and we will not come to a compromise unless--we \nwill not be able to raise the debt ceiling and get our fiscal house in \norder unless both sides give.\n  Lines in the sand do not help this country. I would plead with my \ncolleagues, no more lines in the sand. There are just as many wasteful \ntax expenditures as there are program expenditures.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon I spoke in this \nChamber, and I quoted former Comptroller General David Walker saying \nthat we as a country face ``large, known and growing structural \ndeficits that could swamp our ship of state.'' To get our ship of state \nin trim, we need to make adjustments; we need to reduce the deficit and \nthe debt.\n  I also discussed that when Republicans demand that all ``revenue \nraisers'' be taken off the table in our discussions about how we reduce \nthat deficit and that debt, as the Republican leader has done just this \nweek, what they are really defending is tax subsidies for profitable \nbig oil companies; what they are really defending is corporations that \ndodge their U.S. taxes by setting up phony business locations in the \nCayman Islands and elsewhere; what they are really defending is ultra-\nhigh-income individuals--the highest 400 income earners in the \ncountry--paying a lower actual tax rate than ordinary working \nAmericans, in some years lower than truckdrivers, in some years as low \nas a hospital orderly.\n  Just last month, Republicans filibustered a measure that would have \nended $21 billion in completely unnecessary subsidies for the largest \noil companies. We know those oil companies are enjoying record \nmultibillion-dollar profits, the highest, in some cases, profits any \ncorporation has ever made, and they do not need continued support from \nthe American taxpayer--they just do not, not when these other cuts are \nbeing thought of. But our Republican friends went to bat for the big \noil companies, and they fought back our attempt and they protected that \nbill oil subsidy.\n  To keep our ship of state afloat, Republicans are willing to end \nMedicare, kick children out of Head Start early education, knock down \nPell grants, and eliminate PBS. But they will fight to protect special \nsubsidies and tax breaks for big corporations and billionaires.\n  Today, I rise to discuss one such unjustifiable tax giveaway--a tax \nbreak for private jets for the use of CEOs and other top corporate \nexecutives that has no public policy benefit whatsoever.\n  The way this works, under current law companies that buy private \njets--planes which can cost upward of $50 million each--can deduct the \nvalue of that jet from their taxes over 5 years. There is a 5-year \ndepreciation schedule. Airline carriers, on the other hand, the folks \nwho carry 99 percent of the American public through the air, must \ndepreciate the value of their planes over 7 years--2 years longer than \nfor the private executive jets. Now, this may sound like a minor \naccounting anomaly, and I am sure that is what the corporate lobbyists \nwho got this through and stuck into our Tax Code said when they got it \ndone, but this is one that may cost the government $3 billion in lost \ntax revenue over the next decade.\n  The special treatment of corporate jets, its advantage relative to \njets that regular people fly on when they take to the air, is just one \nmore example of a Tax Code that is riddled with custom-made provisions, \nearmarks in the Tax Code that benefit corporations and the wealthy. \nWhile middle-class families struggle to make car payments and face ever \nhigher prices at the gas pump, our Tax Code subsidizes the private jet \ntravel of millionaires and billionaires.\n  In a time of austerity, when we are being asked to cut education, \nwhen we are being asked to cut science, when we are being asked to cut \nhealth care, it is no time to be protecting a private jet subsidy that \nordinary taxpayers have to make up for through their own taxes, and we \nshould repeal it as part of a package to lower our budget deficits. I \nwas disappointed when Senate Republicans rejected our attempt to repeal \nBig Oil giveaways, and I hope they will not do the same when we bring \nup a corporate jet loophole repeal for a vote.\n  As we continue to debate ways to close the budget gap, I hope my \nRepublican colleagues will rethink their determination to defend tax \nloopholes for corporations and the wealthy while they are trying to get \nrid of Medicare. That is a terrible set of priorities. It is simply \nunconscionable for them to talk about cutting education and research \nand health programs while they are fighting on the floor to protect, at \nall costs, special interest tax subsidies that are on the books.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  So people understand this debate, we have a deficit problem--serious. \nWe borrow 40 cents from other countries for every $1 we spend. We \ncannot sustain that. Our economy may be the strongest in the world, but \nit is being called into question every day. Look what is happening on \nthe streets of Athens, Greece, and in Portugal and in Ireland because \nthey went too far, they crossed the point beyond which their creditors \nwould not go. They were so deeply in debt that their creditors \nbasically said: We are not going to loan you any more money unless you \nchange dramatically the way you run your country.\n  That is the pain that is going through these countries today. We want \nto avoid that pain in the United States. To do it, we have to address \nthe deficit honestly. We have to take a look at this debt we have and \ndeal with it in honest terms.\n  Most people have forgotten the fact that 10 years ago--10 years ago--\nwe were running a surplus in the Federal budget. The last 3 years of \nthe Clinton administration were surplus years, and now we are in the \ndeepest debt we have ever been as a nation. We are generating about \n$1.4 trillion of additional debt every year.\n  How did we reach this point? Well, there are a lot of explanations. \nWhen you fight two wars and do not pay for them, it adds to the \nnational debt. When you pass programs and do not pay for them, it adds \nto the debt. When you are already in debt and you give tax breaks to \nthe wealthiest people in America, it makes your debt worse. Those, \nincidentally, were the three policies of the previous administration, \nwhich led us to the point where a surplus, in 8 years, became the \nbiggest deficit in American history. So now we have to address it.\n\n[[Page S4248]]\n\n  What we are saying to our friends on the Republican side of the aisle \nis, for goodness' sake, to end a deficit, you cut spending, right? \nRight. But to end a deficit, you also cut wasteful tax subsidies. If \nyou listened this morning to my colleagues, you heard them describe a \nfew.\n  The Senator from Oregon talked about in the Tax Code a tax subsidy \nfor people who raise thoroughbred horses. I love horses. I like going \nto race tracks. But to think we are going to subsidize them at the \nexpense of Medicaid recipients, the poorest children in America, makes \nno sense.\n  Then my colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, talked about tax \nsubsidies for people who own yachts. For goodness' sake, if we cannot \nfloat the boat of Middle America, help working families across this \ncountry survive, why in the world are we giving a tax subsidy to yacht \nowners?\n  My friend from Rhode Island came and talked about corporate jet \ndeductibility. I am sorry, I ride jet planes, but they are commercial \njets. The fact that United Airlines and American and the rest of them \ndo not enjoy the same preferential tax treatment as the wealthiest \nbusinesspeople in America and their yachts is just plain wrong. It is a \nsubsidy we cannot afford. We should not be subsidizing highfliers in \nAmerica when the Republican budget is calling for us to end Medicare as \nwe know it. It makes no sense.\n  There is one other provision in the Tax Code I really find troubling. \nWe literally subsidize American companies that want to ship jobs \noverseas. We give them one of the biggest tax breaks in the Tax Code to \nleave America, put their production facilities overseas.\n  So what is happening? Take a look at what has happened since the year \n1999 and the number of foreign employees of U.S. multinational \ncorporations. It goes up every single year--now up to 10 million \nforeign employees of American corporations. Now take a look at the U.S. \nemployees of these same multinational corporations over the same period \nof time. Since the year 2000, the number of American employees of U.S. \nmultinational corporations has continued to go down, almost without \nexception.\n  It is not just a matter of companies saying if they build a \nproduction facility overseas it is the right economic judgment for \ntheir business. It is a matter of the U.S. Tax Code that rewards them \nif they do it. What is wrong with this picture? Why are we not \nrewarding patriotic American corporations whose owners stay in this \ncountry, employ our people, pay a decent wage with benefits, and want \nto prosper here? Should that not be our highest priority rather than \nencouraging companies to move production overseas by giving them tax \nbreaks?\n  Well, it is an issue I feel strongly about. I want to end the subsidy \nto ship American jobs overseas. At a time when we are facing \nunemployment in record numbers in some parts of our country, we should \nhave a Tax Code that helps companies create and save jobs in America. I \nask my friends on the Republican side of the aisle: Do you want to \nstand for the subsidies that ship American jobs overseas or do you want \nto stand by American workers and patriotic American companies that want \nto stay right here at home and create jobs?\n  Those are the choices. Anyone on the other side of the aisle who \nargues that to eliminate tax subsidies is to raise taxes--come on. What \nwe are doing is giving a tax earmark, a tax special favor to those who \nare benefitting, whether they own yachts, racehorses, or whether they \nare trying to ship jobs overseas. These are the folks I think have to \nbe willing to step up and sacrifice so we can reduce our deficit and do \nit in a meaningful way.\n  I see my colleague from Maryland is here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe crisis America is facing. We are facing two crises. We are facing a \nsignificant debt crisis, and we are facing a political leadership \ncrisis. We need to deal with both. We need to be sure all things are on \nthe table and all people are at the table trying to find sensible, \npragmatic solutions to be able to move our country forward and \nstabilize our economy so we can grow our economy.\n  Now, I am going to talk first about the debt crisis. Then I am going \nto talk about what we need to do to act like Americans. I am for a more \nfrugal government. We have been voting on cuts in discretionary \nspending. I supported the ban on discretionary spending earmarks. You \nwere a reformer in that area, and I joined with you in that area, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I also voted for $41 billion in cuts in the continuing resolution. In \nApril I voted for $78 billion more in cuts. I wanted to avoid a tea \nparty shutdown and work for this more frugal government. But now we \nhave to lift the debt ceiling, and in order to do that we need to have \na path forward dealing with both the deficit and debt. In order to do \nthat, we need to, just as we cut the earmarks on discretionary \nspending, cut the tax break earmarks, those tax break earmarks that \nhave gone to the well connected but who are disconnected from how we \ncan help our economy grow.\n  I never thought a budget deal would be easy, but I believed we could \nagree on a few key principles. Well, we have not. The Republicans want \nto close Social Security Offices. I want to close tax loopholes. They \nwant to get rid of teachers. I want to get rid of sacred cows. That is \nwhy I voted last week to end the tax break on ethanol production. Wow. \nTalk about a tax break earmark. It is ethanol. It has serious \nconsequences to our budget. It also artificially raises the cost of \ncorn. So what does that mean to Barb Mikulski?\n  Well, right now one of the most important industries on my eastern \nshore is poultry. Poultry has helped make Maryland great and provided \njobs for thousands of Marylanders, people who work hard, get dirt under \ntheir fingernails, salute the flag.\n  Well, they want us to act like we salute the flag and work under the \nflag. Corn is now $7 a bushel. I have companies that have been around \nfor over 100 years filing for bankruptcy. Well, I cannot allow that to \ngo on. We have to get rid of the artificial subsidies and deal with it \nand use that money to go into deficit reduction.\n  So I want part of any agreement that we make to make sure that \neliminating the tax break earmark on ethanol is also in the budget. I \nalso want to get rid of oil and gas tax breaks. Gas has reached $4 a \ngallon in many parts of my State. Yet at the same time, the five \nbiggest oil companies made $36 billion in profits in the first 3 \nmonths--3 months they made $36 billion.\n  Well, companies making billions in profits should again pay their \nfair share. We Democrats voted to end those subsidies and devote $2 \nbillion a year to deficit reduction. Now, the Republicans want to keep \ntax break earmarks. I want to get rid of tax break earmarks. But they \nrefuse to end these giveaways.\n  There are others. Senator Durbin spoke eloquently about the tax \nbreaks that send jobs overseas. Those jobs have left. They went on a \nslow boat to China, a fast track to Mexico. Other jobs are in dial 1-\n800 anywhere but in the USA. We have to have a patriotic Tax Code where \nwe crack down on the tax cheats and invest the money back here at home.\n  It is not only the tax cheats, we legally give them money. We take \nthe money of people who worked in manufacturing, who paid taxes, and \nwhen they paid those taxes, we gave subsidies to send their jobs \noversees. Wow. No wonder people are mad at Congress. They ought to be \nmad at Congress.\n  But I worry about the consequences also of default. When I go around \nMaryland, people do not understand what that means. They think when we \nraise the debt ceiling it is going to raise their interest rates on \ntheir credit cards, their student loans, or their mortgages in some way \nif they have a variable rate. Oh, my gosh. It is just something. We \nneed to make known in plain English what this means.\n  The fact that the United States of America might not pay its bills on \nAugust 3 is frightening. It is frightening from the standpoint of \nnational honor. America should pay its bills. It has always paid its \nbills. Also, it is important for our economy. The consequences could be \nDraconian, unprecedented, and even well beyond the Armageddon of the \nGreat Depression. We could, on August 3, not be able to pay our Social \nSecurity benefits. We could\n\n[[Page S4249]]\n\nnot be able to pay our veterans benefits.\n  This is shocking. We cannot allow this to happen. So we have to come \nto the table. That is why I said at the opening of my remarks we all \nhave to be at the table, and all things have to be on the table.\n  Now, I am going to talk about political leadership. I want to talk \nabout all of us at the table. I lived through a very serious crisis \nwhen Ronald Reagan was President, and Ronald Reagan, Tip O'Neill, and \nHoward Baker provided the political leadership. It was tough. It was \nscary.\n  In 1982, we were scared that we could not meet our obligations, that \nour Social Security checks would go out. The trust fund was running on \nfumes. America faced the fact that we would go into default with our \nsenior citizens. President Reagan provided leadership. I did not agree \nwith everything President Reagan wanted to offer. But he said: We have \nto put America first. He called up his friend Tip O'Neill. Tip O'Neill \nbrought Democrats to the table. Bob Byrd was our party's leader in the \nSenate. Those two men stood together as Americans, not as Democrats. We \nturned to Bob Dole, chairing the Finance Committee, and Howard Baker. \nThey came to the table, not as Republicans but as Americans. That is \nwhat we need now. We have to come to the table as Americans.\n  I love being a Democrat. My family were Democrats. We are going to be \nDemocrats forever. But what I love more is being an American. I got \ninto politics as a protester. In other countries they would have thrown \nme in prison. Here they put me into politics to stand up for the \npeople. I would not have been able to go to college; I would not have \nbeen able to pursue the American dream.\n  I love America and I want America to have a great future ahead of it. \nWe have to stop acting as if we are the Red Party and the Blue Party. \nWe have to start behaving as if we are the Red, White, and Blue Party.\n  Now, I have heard about these pledges to Grover Norquist. But I take \none pledge. I take a pledge to the flag of the United States of \nAmerica. One Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice--\njustice--for all. That is what we need to do.\n  I take an oath on the Constitution to protect and defend the people \nand the law that governs it. Let's get real and let's realize whom our \nfirst pledge is to.\n  So I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Go back to your \nRepublican history books. Read what Ronald Reagan did in 1982. Read \nwhat Republican leadership did in 1986. I will do the same for \nDemocrats. When Tip O'Neill brought us to the table, I had to make \ntough votes. We drank strong medicine. But you know what. At the end of \nthe day we made our obligations. Seniors got their checks, we got the \nSocial Security trust fund out of that crisis, and we became a stronger \neconomy and a better America. We can do it. But let's realize to whom \nwe take our pledge. Mine will always be not to the Democratic Party but \nto the United States of America. So let's be at the table and put all \nthings on the table.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4249-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise for a moment during this time of \nmorning business to talk about what everybody is talking about--the \ncrisis with our debt ceiling, the approaching deadline, and what we \nshould do. Last night, as I thought about what I would say this \nmorning, I thought back to that horrible month of September and October \nof 2008, when the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression \nhit the United States. I was a Member of the Senate, and I was here the \nnight the TARP vote came before us to try to salvage and save the \nfinancial system of the United States. That was probably the toughest \nvote I ever took. It was the right vote, because we stabilized the \nfinancial system. At that time, we were reacting to a crisis we were \nnot in control of.\n  Today, we have a crisis we are totally in control of. It is ironic to \nme that 30 or 35 days before the deadline of August 2, we are fiddling \naround arguing with each other, when we should be talking to each \nother, looking at those things we can do to avert a crisis and move \nforward. I see that our leader has come to the floor. I will shorten my \nremarks so he can have his full time. This is a crisis of which we are \nin control, unlike 2008. We can make a difference.\n  The balanced budget amendment proposed by the Republican conference \nof the Senate is the straitjacket and the discipline we all need. When \nI was a State legislator for 17 years, we had a program on drug abuse \nthat said ``just say no.'' We taught kids not to use drugs. We need a \nway for Congress to ``just say no'' to spending, and have the \ndiscipline to have a constitutional restriction on our ability to have \nrunaway spending without any accountability. It is the kind of \ndiscipline almost every State imposes upon itself.\n  In Georgia, we cannot deficit spend because our constitution won't \nlet us. We cannot borrow more than 10 percent of our entire budget \nbecause the constitution will not let us. Those are the types of \ndisciplines the Congress needs.\n  Before I yield to the leader, I will end the way I began. When the \nfinancial crisis hit in September 2008, we were dealing with issues \nover which we had no control. Today, we are dealing with an issue upon \nwhich we have total control.

Mr. President, I want to say a word about the \nPresident's press conference yesterday.\n  What I heard him propose is that we solve the debt crisis by spending \nmore money--solve the debt crisis by spending more money; that we solve \nthe jobs crisis by raising taxes--solve the jobs crisis by raising \ntaxes.\n  I want to know, is there a single Member of Congress, Democrat or \nRepublican, who thinks it is a good idea to raise hundreds of billions \nof dollars in new job-killing taxes at a time when 14 million Americans \nare out of work? If so, I haven't heard from any of them. But that is \nwhat the President was trying to defend yesterday.\n  Who thinks the answer to a $1.6 trillion deficit is a second \nstimulus, that the answer is more deficit spending? Where in the world \ndid that idea come from? That is what the President was trying to \ndefend yesterday.\n  Look, the President needs to get serious about this. He said \nyesterday that reducing the deficit grows the economy. That part of his \npress conference he got right. Reducing the deficit grows the economy.\n  His own Small Business Administration has told him not to enact one \nof the tax hikes he was proposing at the press conference yesterday. \nThis is what they said over at SBA: ``This can force many small \nbusinesses to close their doors.''\n  Fourteen million people are out of work, and he wants to take an \naction that could force small businesses across the country to close? \nThat is his vision of shared sacrifice?\n  I think the American worker has sacrificed quite enough already. \nBesides, all of us know that Congress isn't going to approve hundreds \nof billions of dollars in tax hikes. It is simply not going to happen. \nWe have known that for 6 months, and we have been saying it all along.\n  The President does not seem to get it. So let me do something that I \nthink would be constructive. I want to invite the President to come to \nthe Capitol today and meet with Senate Republicans anytime this \nafternoon that he is available; come on up to the Capitol and meet with \nSenate Republicans. That way, he can hear directly from Senate \nRepublicans why what he is proposing will not pass. So I invite him to \ncome up today and meet with Senate Republicans, hear directly from \nthem, and we can discuss what he has\n\n[[Page S4250]]\n\nin mind. Maybe we can start talking about what is actually possible.\n  The President says he wants us to get working. I can't think of a \nbetter way than to have him come right on over today--we are waiting--\nand hear from our conference about the legislative realities in \nCongress right now.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with my colleague from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our Nation has an over $14 trillion debt \nand unless we can get a handle on it--I have a chart which I think \nshows what our future will look like if we stay on the current \ntrajectory. You can see that the path leads higher and higher in debt \nto GDP levels. That level is unprecedented in American history. You \nhave to go back to World War II when we had this kind of debt to GDP. \nThe chart shows we are going to face an ever increasing burden and \ndebt.\n  Without shoring up our finances, we know what our future will look \nlike. This week, we saw that the country of Greece had to approve an \nausterity package to be eligible for their next disbursement of a \nmultibillion dollar bailout loan from the IMF and other European \ncountries. This austerity package included 28.4 billion euros in \nspending cuts and tax increases. That is exactly what will happen if we \ndon't do anything. We will reach a time when we will be facing massive \ncuts in spending and tax increases, if we don't get our fiscal house in \norder.\n  But that isn't necessary, because there is a better way to solve this \nproblem. Instead of more debt and spending, we can pass a balanced \nbudget amendment that would prevent us from spending more than we can \ntake in. We know what the effect of this will be on our future as well.\n  We have States across this country--49--that have some type of \nbalanced budget requirement, including South Dakota. That is the reason \nwhy our State's budget is always balanced. Our legislature cannot go \nhome until that happens. We need that same sort of discipline here in \nWashington, and a balanced budget amendment would bring that about.\n  I have with me on the floor a colleague from Nebraska, Senator \nJohanns, who also served as his State's Governor. My understanding is \nthat the Senator from Nebraska, when he was Governor, had a balanced \nbudget requirement in Nebraska's constitution. I wonder if he can \nexplain the effect that had on his State, and whether it forced them to \nmake some of the tough choices necessary to get a budget balanced.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \nabout a topic that I think has made all the difference in the world for \nmy State of Nebraska.\n  I did have the privilege, a few years back, of serving as the \nGovernor of the State of Nebraska. Until I came out to join the Cabinet \nas Secretary of Agriculture, I served about 6 years. Before that, I was \nthe mayor of our State capital in the community of Lincoln, a great \ncommunity. We followed the same pattern at the Governor's office that \nwe did at the mayor's office. And we Governors had a simple principle: \nWe did not spend money we did not have.\n\n  Before I talk about the balanced budget amendment, let me explain how \nthat worked as mayor of Lincoln. My budget staff would go to work. They \nworked on the budget pretty much year-round--really, it was a year-\nround endeavor--and at some point in the process I would get a stack of \npaperwork that was about an inch thick, with line after line after line \nafter line of items they were proposing we needed to spend money on to \nkeep the city running. There would be everything from police cars to \nwhatever, to salaries. I mean, imagine what it takes to run a city, and \nit would be on that list. I would go through item by item, page by \npage, studying each entry. Ultimately, we came to a conclusion for each \nentry: Yes, I believe this is necessary to keep our city going.\n  Well, somewhere in that thick stack of paperwork, I would turn over \nthe page and I would come to a page where there was a red line drawn \nthrough the items. The significance of that red line was that \neverything above that red line we had money for and everything below \nthat red line there was no money for. So if the next entry below the \nred line was something that I wanted to see happen as the chief \nexecutive of that community, I had to cut spending to eliminate \nsomething else because, you see, when I went to the city council I \ncouldn't go to them and say: For operations, we are going to borrow a \nwhole bunch of money. That didn't change at all when I became the \nGovernor of the State of Nebraska.\n  Our constitution requires a balanced budget. It is very \nstraightforward. It basically says: You can't spend more than what is \ncoming in. You can't buy things you don't have money for.\n  Let me add another piece to this--and this makes our State quite a \nbit different, I think, than virtually any other State in the United \nStates. Way back when our constitution was written, those who sat down \nto write the constitution--with amazing foresight--said: At some point \npoliticians, in their passion to get reelected, are going to say to the \npeople, they can have all of this, and then finance it by borrowing \nmoney. Well, they didn't want that. So there is literally a provision \nin our constitution that, in essence, says: You can't borrow any money. \nI think the limit is something like $100,000 or $500,000, and that is \nit.\n  If you drive across the roads in Nebraska, I will just point out, \nthey are paid for. Why? Because we don't spend money we don't have. Our \nconstitution will not allow us to do it. So year after year, when we \nget together, we look at the priorities of State. It might be \neducation, it might be something relative to human services, it might \nbe roads. But whatever it is, the executive branch--me, as Governor, \nworking with the legislature--would decide what we are going to fund \nand at what level.\n  Now, I could guarantee the people of Nebraska three things would \nhappen by the end of the legislative session: No. 1, a budget would be \npassed; No. 2, it would be balanced; and, No. 3, we would not borrow \nmoney for those first two things to happen. A budget would be passed, \nit would be balanced, and we weren't going to borrow money to make that \nhappen. That has been going on for decades and decades and decades.\n  Some of my colleagues are probably ready to rush down to the floor \nand say: Oh, Mike, that sounds so backward. But here is what I have to \nsay. During this very difficult economic time--and all of us agree it \nhas been one of the toughest times since the Depression--unemployment \nin Nebraska has not gone over 5 percent. Unemployment today in Nebraska \nis 4.1 percent. Let me say that a bit differently. Ninety-six percent \nof people able to work in Nebraska have a job--96 percent.\n  This year our legislature actually recessed early and--I believe I \nremember this correctly--they unanimously passed the State budget. \nThere are Democrats in the legislature, there are Republicans in the \nlegislature, and there are Independents. One might ask: How did they do \nthat? They did it because they felt a responsibility to the State and \nto their constitution to get a budget done, to make sure it was \nbalanced, and not to borrow money to get there.\n  Let me contrast that with what is happening out here. What is \nhappening out here is that for decades and decades and decades, we, as \nthe Federal Government, have said to the people: Don't you worry. We \ncan be all things to all people. We can give you this and we can give \nyou that because we have this big credit card. Well, that credit card \ntoday is now at $14.5 trillion and growing--growing and growing and \ngrowing.\n  When I go back home and do townhall meetings, and I look across the \nroom and I see young people or children, it pains me to tell them that \nI know who is going to be responsible to pay off the credit card. It is \nnot Mike Johanns, who turns 61 this year, although it should be my \nresponsibility;\n\n[[Page S4251]]\n\nit is going to be our children and our grandchildren who will have \ntheir own priorities, their own desires, and their own wishes. They are \ngoing to be saddled with trillions and trillions and trillions of \ndollars of debt before they can even address their own priorities.\n  I will end with this thought. What is the merit of a balanced budget \namendment? Well, when I was 20 years old, our Nation owed $380 \nbillion--$380 billion. It is projected that when I reach 65, just 4 \nshort years from now, our Nation will owe $20 trillion. It is time to \nbe honest with the American people. We will not solve this problem \nunless we put discipline in place--as our States have done; as the \ngreat State of Nebraska has done--which would essentially say, year \nafter year, President after President, Senator after Senator, House \nMember after House Member, we have to live within our means.\n  That is what the balanced budget amendment is about. You see, without \nthis, there will always be a way to get around it, to do something and \nnot accept the responsibility of running this country with fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom Nebraska. As a former executive--both as mayor and Governor--he, \nobviously, has had to make the hard decisions necessary to get the \nbooks to balance both in the city of Lincoln and the State of Nebraska. \nAs he has observed, the economic circumstances the State of Nebraska \nfinds itself in today are so much better than other places around the \ncountry.\n  Now, granted, there are lots of factors that contribute to that. Part \nof it has to do with the business climate in some States around the \ncountry. But, clearly, it is also a function of the discipline the \nState of Nebraska imposes on itself through its balanced budget \namendment and the decisions of the leaders in that State, both \nlegislators and Governors, in order to make that possible.\n  So I think the experience of the Senator from Nebraska is valuable in \nhelping us shape the debate that ought to occur on this balanced budget \namendment. I would say one of the features of the balanced budget \namendment that we are both cosponsoring is that it caps spending at 18 \npercent of our entire economy. That is not a number picked out of thin \nair. It is a number that comes from the historical level of taxation \nfor the past 40 years. In the past five times the budget was balanced \nin Washington--and bear in mind five times probably in the last 40 \nyears--spending averaged just under 18.7 percent of GDP--not too far \noff what the cap under the balanced budget amendment would require.\n  Further, we know in 2007--a year in which we had tax laws that are \nvery similar to current tax laws--revenue was 18.5 percent of GDP. So \nif we could constrain spending to 18 percent of our entire economic \noutput, we would be able to balance the budget without raising taxes.\n  Our colleagues on the other side continue to claim the problem could \nbe fixed if we would only raise taxes on a few rich people, tax \ncorporate jets, stop giving tax breaks to American energy production, \nand those sorts of things. The truth is, the tax proposals from \nDemocrats put only a relatively minor dent in the deficit. To truly \nbalance the budget through tax increases we would have to see \nastronomical rate increases that would hit not only high-income earners \nand corporations but the middle class and small business as well.\n  This is clearly not what the American people want. It is not what I \nwant. Simply raising taxes on job creators isn't going to improve our \neconomy. It is only going to hurt it more. And tax increases aren't the \nonly threat to our economy. We also know these current levels of debt \nare costing us about 1 million jobs a year as well, and these debt \nlevels are only predicted to increase.\n  In his experience as a Governor, I guess I would ask my colleague \nfrom Nebraska whether when it came time to make these hard decisions \nabout balancing the budget, did the notion of raising revenues, \nincreasing taxes, come into play? I am sure that was a debate that was \nalways raised. It always is. You can either reduce the amount of \nspending or you can raise taxes on someone.\n  It strikes me the problem we have in Washington is not that we don't \nhave enough revenue. We have plenty of revenue. We just have too much \nspending. I am curious to know in the State of Nebraska what his \nexperience was in terms of this debate we have about more taxes or less \nspending.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. We adopted the philosophy in the State of Nebraska that \nwe wanted to be job creators. We wanted to have that low unemployment. \nSo we recognized it is not government that is going to create the jobs. \nAfter all, people don't want a bigger, grander, greater State \ngovernment--or Federal Government, for that matter. Our responsibility \nwas to create the right climate so a small business had an opportunity \nto grow and expand; that a large employer, looking across the United \nStates for a great place to locate, would know they had an opportunity \nto grow and expand a business in the State of Nebraska. So we fought \ntooth and nail.\n  Let me give a current example. If we dial the clock back to about \nNovember of last year, our current Governor, David Heineman, was faced \nwith a great challenge. He had about $1 billion he had to somehow make \nup to balance the budget over a 2-year cycle. For a State such as \nNebraska, that is a powerful amount of money. In Washington, where we \ntalk about trillion-dollar programs, such as the stimulus, et cetera, \nthat may not sound like much. But it is a huge amount of money to our \nState.\n  I suppose our Governor could have said: Well, if we just hit the \ntaxpayer here more, and hit the taxpayer there more, then all of this \nwill balance out. But he adopted very much the opposite view--which is \nexactly what I expected of Governor Heineman. He said: We are going to \nbalance the budget, and we are going to do it without raising taxes. \nThat philosophy is absolutely right.\n  Families are tightening their belts, they are balancing their \nbudgets, and they are doing everything they can. They are suffering \nthrough economic times that are tough. Why would we hit them harder? \nWhy would we go to our families, who are already struggling, and say: I \nhave to take more money out of your billfold and send it to the State \ncapital?\n  So he led and he stepped forward and he said, Here is a plan to \ndeliver a balanced budget. And do you know what. He didn't send \nsomebody else to go into that room. He went himself and said this is \nthe plan that I believe in for the future of our State. He was there \nthrough every minute, every hour, every second of the legislative \nsession, and at the end of it, with no tax increases, they balanced the \nbudget. I would have to check this, but if memory serves me correctly, \nI think that plan passed unanimously. In our State legislature we have \nmembers who are more liberal than others, more conservative; we have \nsome who are Democrats, some who are Republicans. But do you know what. \nOur chief executive led. And, again, I draw a sharp contrast here.\n  There is one nationally elected official in our Nation, and we call \nhim Mr. President. The President pays the filing fee and convinces the \nNation that he or she is the right person to occupy that office, and \nthere is no substitute for their leadership.\n  We need to have our Chief Executive, the man we call Mr. President, \ndeliver a plan that he believes is the right direction for our country. \nThat is the key to this issue.\n  I will be very clear. I like the plan of Governor Heineman. In tough \ntimes, you pull back. When the revenues are a little bit better, you \ncan do some things and establish some new priorities. But what happens \nout here is there is no prioritization. It is spend on everything. \nSpend on everything that walks by. Some day our kids and grandkids are \ngoing to have to pay off the credit card. I don't think that is right.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his observations. In \na minute I want to turn to the ranking member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to talk about setting priorities, because that is something \nwe are not doing here.\n  I do want to point out in the course of this discussion, however, \nthat what you have said is exactly right. You cut spending and you grow \nthe economy. One of the things you need to do is you have got to create \njobs, you have to get economic expansion going. The way not to do that \nis to raise taxes, and\n\n[[Page S4252]]\n\nthat is the prescription many of our colleagues on the other side would \nlike: Let's get more revenue and raise taxes.\n  That is absolutely the opposite thing that you would do when you have \ngot a downed economy and you are trying to create jobs. What we ought \nto be looking at is how do we reduce the size of government, get us \nliving within our means, and getting the economy growing and expanding \nagain and creating jobs.\n  I want to point out one thing. This is important, in my view. We are \nplanning right now, to the extent that there is any planning going on \nhere--and, unfortunately, without a budget it is very difficult to \nprioritize. But there are expectations about what revenues are going to \nbe for the foreseeable future.\n  There was an interesting op-ed piece earlier this week in the Wall \nStreet Journal written by Larry Lindsey, who is a former economic \nadviser to President Bush and also former Federal Reserve Governor, who \npointed out that the current predictions for the debts and deficits in \nthe coming years are very optimistic for a couple reasons.\n  One is that the White House and the CBO are using very optimistic \nnumbers for growth in our economy. While I hope they are correct, I am \nconcerned that they could be very much overstating the potential for \ngrowth in our economy. If more realistic numbers were used, what Larry \nLindsey recognized in that story was that the impact of the financial \ncrisis on our economy, our debt numbers could jump by an additional $4 \ntrillion over the next 10 years by assuming a more historic growth \nlevel, given the times that we have been through.\n  At the same time, the President and the CBO are also predicting that \ninterest rates are going to remain much lower than they have \nhistorically. What Mr. Lindsey pointed out in this op-ed was that if \ninterest rates normalize--in other words, reset to what are the \nhistorical averages--it would cost us an additional $4.9 trillion more \nover the next 10 years to finance our debt than what we are currently \nexpecting. So those two factors alone would have an $8.9 trillion \nnegative impact on these forecasts for the next decade. Again, it \npoints to the importance of getting spending under control and doing it \nnow.\n  He finally pointed out that the new health care law is another \nsignificant hidden cost. If you look at what employers are increasingly \nbeing faced with, many of them are going to choose to dump their \nemployees into these public exchanges and you are going to see the \nadditional costs of anywhere from about $74 billion to $85 billion a \nyear over the next 10 years.\n  You start adding that up, you add in the economic growth \nassumptions--again, I hope they are right. But assuming they are wrong, \nyou have lower levels of economic growth, which I think are probably \nmore realistic levels. If you have more realistic interest rates at \nleast in terms of historical averages, these long-term predictions get \nawful in a real hurry.\n  The nice thing about having a balanced budget amendment is you are \nforced to make those decisions every year. Instead of dealing with \nthese long-term predictions, which are often inaccurate, each and every \nyear the budget has to be balanced. So if interest rates go up, the \nbudget has to be balanced. If employers put their employees on the \nexchanges, the budget has to be balanced. If there are fictional \nsavings from these independent payment advisory boards that are being \ncreated and those aren't realized, the budget has to be balanced. If \ntaxes don't produce as much revenue as predicted, the budget has to be \nbalanced.\n  This is the very simple solution that, as the Senator from Nebraska \npointed out, so many States have come to, so many States have concluded \nthat you have to have some sort of a requirement to balance the budget \nis the most powerful fiscal reform we could have here in Washington, \nDC.\n  We have credit agencies that are questioning our long-term budget \noutlook. If we did a balanced budget amendment, I think there wouldn't \nbe any question that our country would be able to pay all of our bills.\n  I was a Member of the House of Representatives back in 1997. I think \nthe Senator from Alabama was here at the time. There was a vote on a \nbalanced budget amendment at that time. We didn't vote on it in the \nHouse because the Senate voted on it first. The Senate came within one \nsingle vote of passing a balanced budget amendment. Had they done that, \nwe would have been able to pass it in the House. We had the votes for \nit. We could have sent it on to the States. I can't help but thinking \nhow different our fiscal situation would be today if they had had that \none additional vote back in 1997 to get us a balanced budget amendment.\n  Many of our colleagues here campaigned on a balanced budget \namendment. Hopefully when we get a chance to vote on it--and I hope we \ndo here in the next few weeks--we will see whether the rhetoric matches \nthe actions.\n  But all that is to say we have a major fiscal challenge facing this \ncountry. For all the reasons the Senator from Nebraska noted, we are \nhanding our children a burden of debt that is not fair to them, \ntrillions and trillions of dollars. We have to bring some discipline to \nthe process of budgeting around here. What is unfortunate--and this is \nwhy I want to turn to our colleague from Alabama, because he is the \nranking member on the Senate Budget Committee--we have done nothing in \n792 days to prioritize spending.\n  This Federal Government spends $3.7 trillion annually of the \ntaxpayers' money, and we have not passed a budget for 792 days, let \nalone one that actually balanced.\n  My State of South Dakota spends annually about $3 billion. This \nFederal Government borrows $4 billion every single day. The borrowing \nof the Federal Government exceeds in 1 day what the State of South \nDakota spends in an entire year. That is the dimension of the problem \nwe are dealing with. All that being said, it has been 792 days since we \nproduced a budget here in the Senate.\n  I say to my colleague from Alabama, clearly this is a problem that \nneeds to be addressed. Wouldn't the Senator say this is reflective of \nthe lack of political courage, the lack of political will, the lack of \ndiscipline around here? We have colleagues on the other side who say we \ndon't need a balanced budget amendment. That is a gimmick. All we have \nto do is balance the budget. Well, where is it? Where is the budget, \nand where is the budget it is supposed to balance? It is not happening. \nSo I think the balanced budget amendment is a simple, straightforward \nway in which to deal with a massive challenge facing us in the future, \nand we need some discipline imposed upon Federal spending on the \nCongress that so many States have, and as the Senator from Nebraska \npointed out, as the Governor of his State he was able to exercise.\n  I would refer to my colleague from Alabama to ask him his thoughts \nabout where we are with regard to the budget, and is our lack of \ndiscipline here--or, I should say, is our lack of willingness to pass a \nbudget not a reflection of a lack of discipline that exists in the \nCongress today and an unwillingness to make the hard choices that are \nnecessary to get this fiscal train back on track?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Thune so much for his comments, and \nthat of Senator Johanns. They are raising a fundamental question.\n  We have never, ever been in a financial situation in our country that \nis as systemically deeply dangerous as we are today. You go through a \nwar and you borrow a lot of money. You go through a recession, maybe \nyour debt goes up some. We are systemically in a recession, but we are \nalso in long-term projections of a dangerous surging level of debt, as \nyour chart shows.\n  Last year the Democratic majority moved a budget out of committee. \nSenator Thune is a member of that committee, and remembers that debate. \nSenator Reid declared that he wasn't going to bring it up. It was never \nbrought up on the floor of the Senate or even debated.\n  This year, apparently the majority leader decided once again we would \nnot have a budget, and directed that the Budget Committee not even mark \nup a budget. So we have not even commenced work on a budget this year.\n  Indeed, the majority leader said it was foolish for the country to \nhave a budget this year, which is stunning, since during the 792 days \nwe have been without a budget the debt of the United States has \nincreased some $3.2 trillion. It is a stunning thing.\n  So, yes, I believe that history shows in the past, and based on the \nreal crisis\n\n[[Page S4253]]\n\nwe face in the future, there has never been a more important time for \nus to do what so many States do: Have a balanced budget amendment that \nrequires us each year to balance that budget. I believe this is the \nright thing for us, and it would be so much better for our country.\n  Senator Johanns is here, and he talked about executive leadership. \nYou and Senator Thune were talking about how dangerous the debt path we \nare on is, how much greater it was in Nebraska's situation. Alabama has \nhad to cut spending. But we are not cutting spending at all here. We \nhaven't been. We have been increasing spending here.\n  I wanted to ask you a serious question. Do you feel that the first \nresponsibility of a Chief Executive of the United States, the \nPresident, would be to honestly tell the American people that this is \nnot just a political dust-up, but that we are facing a very serious \ndebt crisis that could actually put us into an economic tailspin again, \nknock us down again, and the debt numbers we are seeing will look even \nworse? Do you feel he has that responsibility, and do you feel it has \nbeen met?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Senator Sessions raises an excellent point. Having \nserved in the executive branch pretty much exclusively until I came to \nthe Senate 2 years ago, there is only one leader. I not only believe \nthat the Executive--in this case, the President of the United States--\nhas that responsibility, but I feel very strongly that that \nresponsibility has not been discharged.\n  I fully appreciate the need to go out there and drive a message and \nget votes and get yourself elected or reelected. That, of course, is \nwhat democracy is all about. But there is a point at which the election \nis over and that needs to be set aside, and there needs to be someone \nwho can lead on behalf of the entire United States.\n  We are all Senators, but it is the people of Nebraska who vote for \nme. We only have one nationally elected official, and that is the \ngentleman I referred to previously who is called Mr. President. There \nis no substitute for that, not in our system of government. It is \nabsolutely incumbent upon the President to lay out in terms U.S. \ncitizens can understand what we are facing.\n\n  I will be very candid. I could not be more disappointed with the \nPresident's comments yesterday. It is his podium. He is free to talk \nabout whatever he chooses to talk about, and he does not need the \nadvice of Mike Johanns. But I will tell you what a great opportunity \nthat was to talk about the dire situation of our budget and to lay out \nin stark detail what brings us to this situation and invite the \nAmerican people to understand the difficulty we are facing and, most \nimportantly, to put a plan out that the President stands behind.\n  Let me tell you what happened this year. The President put out a \nplan. The plan came to the floor of the Senate. It was so disregarded \nit did not get a single vote. It was not a serious plan. No one took it \nas a serious plan.\n  Think about that. No Republican, no Democrat, no Independent, no \nliberal, no conservative, no moderate said this is the right plan for \nthe future of this great Nation; not a single one in this Senate. That \nis a very serious situation for our Nation.\n  It is time to be serious about this and present a serious proposal \nthat makes the hard choices. Don't tell me you can solve this problem \nby, well, everybody is going to pay higher taxes who makes over a \ncertain level. I did the math on that. When I first heard that I said: \nOK, let me understand that better. If you earn over $250,000 a year, \nwhat would the tax rate have to be for those earners just to balance \nthe budget for that year? I am not talking about the massive amount of \ndebt that lies in front of our children and grandchildren. Just to \nbalance the budget that year, the tax rate would be 90 percent. It has \ngotten worse because our deficit has grown to $1.6 trillion--but 90 \npercent. Actually, I think, if I redid that math, it would be closer to \n100 percent.\n  That may be a great political talking point. It may be tested, it may \nbe polled, it may be a 70-percent talking point, it may be an 80-\npercent talking point, but I tell you what, it is not going to solve \nthe problem this Nation faces. It is not the pathway that deals with \nthe massive problem we have, and there is no one else who can speak to \nthe Nation like the President of the United States.\n  Senator Sessions cannot, Senator Johanns cannot, Senator McConnell \nand Senator Reid, with all their stature, cannot either. That bully \npulpit is unique to the President of the United States, and we have yet \nto see that responsibility met.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator, the former Governor for those \ncomments. I do believe it is difficult for Congress to ask the American \npeople to make sacrifices if the President does not acknowledge clearly \nand articulately the deep crisis we are in and why those sacrifices \nhave to be made. It is not that we want to; it is because we do not \nhave the money and we have to make some changes in what we do. That is \nwhy a number of us called on Majority Leader Reid to not recess next \nweek. Let's stay and do something about the debt.\n  I understand we may now be staying next week, but I am not at all \nsure that the plan is to deal with anything involving the greatest \nthreat to our Nation, which is our debt. Apparently, they want to talk \nabout other issues. That was not what drove the concern. It was not \nabout a patent bill--much as I would like to see it passed. That was \nnot what we were concerned about when we said we need to be in next \nweek. It is because, by the end of this month, maybe the first of \nAugust, we will see a monumental bill of some kind produced by the \nDemocratic majority in the Senate, brought out here, and we are going \nto be asked to vote for it in a matter of hours, being told every \nminute that the country is about to sink into oblivion if we don't sign \nit and vote for it, not knowing fully what is in it, not fully having \nstudied it, the American people not knowing what is in it. That is \nwrong policy. We object to that.\n  I believe the regular order in this Senate should be conducted, that \nwe ought to have a proposal brought forth so it can be amended, so it \ncan be analyzed, so it can be accounted for. How much taxes are going \nto be raised by the President? What taxes does he propose to raise? \nWhat does Senator Reid want to do? Let's see those numbers and let's \ndebate them and let's have amendments. That is why we need to be here \nnext week, not to deal with a patent bill or some other legislation. \nThat is why we called for it and I am prepared to work and I believe \nour colleagues are, but it needs to be on something significant.\n  The history of our Congress and the surging debt crisis we face is so \nsignificant that we have to have a balanced budget constitutional \namendment. We almost passed that before. It would have been so much \nbetter had we done so. Let's do it this time and change the course of \nour country. Nothing clears the mind so well as the absence of \nalternatives. When Senators and Congressmen have no alternative but to \nlive within their means, they will figure out a way to do it. But if we \ncan find an alternative, history tells us too often we will, and we \nwill act irresponsibly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I was, frankly, shocked by the comments of \nthe President of the United States yesterday at his press conference, \ntelling Congress it needed to get to work. I guess the President forgot \nhis party controls the Senate, and Republicans, being in the minority, \nhave no ability to place matters on the agenda or to force a vote on \nissues over the objection of Senator Reid, the majority leader, and the \nDemocrats who control the Senate.\n  I guess the thing that rankled me so much is, rather than hold a \npress conference and tell Senator Reid to get to work on the budget, \nthe President should have picked up his telephone or invited Senator \nReid to come to his office and said: Harry, we need to pass a budget. \nWe need to take care of this debt crisis. We need to take care of this \ncliff we are getting ready to fall off on August 2, that Secretary \nGeithner has warned us would have, perhaps, calamitous impacts on \nmarkets and on the economy and on interest rates charged\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\non our national debt, among other things.\n  I guess the most galling thing, listening to the President make this \nkind of outrageous speech, engaging in blatant electioneering, \ncampaigning sort of rhetoric, class warfare, is that this comes from a \nperson who, since January 2011, has had 31 fundraisers, including one \ntonight in Philadelphia. I wonder if he is going to cancel his \nfundraiser in Philadelphia tonight to meet with Leader McConnell and \nSpeaker Boehner to try to work on this threat that he was so emphatic \nabout yesterday. I predict he will not cancel his fundraiser in \nPhiladelphia tonight to get to work on something that only he can do, \nwhich is to negotiate a grand bargain with Republicans and Democrats \nthat will solve this problem.\n  We know he had time on Monday to videotape an appeal to his donors \nwho wanted to solicit donations from people so they might win a dinner \nwith President Obama and the Vice President. He had time to do that. \nYet it was not until Monday of this week that the President himself \nfirst took ownership of this issue, after Majority Leader Cantor and \nAssistant Leader Kyl said we cannot negotiate with the Vice President \nbecause they keep insisting on raising taxes, and we are not going to \ngo there.\n  The President had his first meeting with Republican Leader McConnell \nand the majority leader to talk about this issue that he was flailing \nCongress about not doing its job just yesterday. Frankly, he should be \nembarrassed. But, unfortunately, the threshold for embarrassment here \nin Washington seems to be much higher than in the rest of the country.\n  The President said Republicans were blocking the deal on the debt \nlimit because they had taken tax increases off the table. That is \nright. We believe it is a terrible mistake, with unemployment at 9.1 \npercent--much higher in many regions of the country--to raise taxes on \nthe very people whom you are depending on to create jobs. What is his \nmessage to people who cannot find a job because people are not hiring? \nWhat is his message to people who are out of work and they cannot pay \ntheir home mortgage and they lose their home? It is higher taxes. Let's \njust raise taxes and everything will be fine.\n  We do not have a taxing shortfall. The American people pay plenty of \ntaxes already. What we have is a spending binge by the Federal \nGovernment. Tax revenue is roughly 18 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct, but spending is 25 percent, hence the $1.5 trillion deficit \nthis year and the $14.3 trillion debt so far, which threatens our \nNation's future.\n\n  Frankly, it rankles many of us to have the President engage in such \nblatant demagoguery and blame-shifting, when he himself is unwilling to \ntake responsibility for his duties, which are to lead by example. We \nare ready to work with the President to try to solve the Nation's \nproblems. The House has passed a proposal. It is not perfect. I don't \nnecessarily agree with all of it. But there are plenty of other \nproposals out there that will fix the Nation's fiscal problems, one of \nwhich is the President's own fiscal commission itself. He appointed it, \na bipartisan fiscal commission that reported back in December, entitled \n``Moment Of Truth,'' otherwise known as the Bowles-Simpson Commission, \na bipartisan commission the President appointed himself. But he has \nignored it.\n  There is another one, the Domenici-Rivlin Commission, a bipartisan \ncommission that made recommendations. The President has ignored it.\n  The President yesterday said: ``Call me naive, but my expectation is \nthat leaders are going to lead.'' That is what the President himself \nhad the gall to say yesterday to the American people when he himself \nhas displayed an astounding lack of leadership. As I said, we are ready \nto work with the President. I know Senator McConnell invited him to \ncome over to Congress and explain how this increase in taxes was \nsomehow going to create more jobs in America; how we were going to \nsolve the problems with Medicare--which is going to run out of money in \na little over a decade. I hope the President takes him up on that \ninvitation.\n  It is not a partisan issue. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said \nour national debt sends a message of weakness internationally.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, said that \n``the single greatest threat to our National security is our debt.'' If \nAmerica goes broke, how are we going to pay for our national defense \nand security that not only Americans depend on but so many countries \naround the world depend on America being strong to protect them from \ntyrants and dictators and terrorists? But if our economy goes bust, if \ninterest rates go up to historic norms, our economy could spiral out of \ncontrol. But there is not going to be a bailout for the United States \nof America. Our economy is simply too big. The International Monetary \nFund, the Europeans, and others are not going to bail us out while we \ncontinue to spend recklessly about 43 cents out of every dollar in \nmoney borrowed from these young men and women here sitting in front of \nme. Every baby born in America today comes into this world $46,000 in \ndebt. It is irresponsible. It is wrong.\n\n  The American people sent a message in November of 2010 that they were \nsick and tired of Washington operating business as usual, and they were \nnot going to take it anymore. And the American people should not take \nit anymore.\n  I believe we have an opportunity here. In Texas, we don't recognize \nproblems; we recognize challenges and opportunities. We are a positive \nbunch of folks. This is a grand opportunity for Democrats and \nRepublicans to come together to do the Nation's business, to be \nserious, not to be reckless, not to give speeches like the President \ngave yesterday as part of his reelection campaign. Absolutely \ndisgraceful. He should be ashamed. I respect the office of the \nPresident of the United States, but I think the President has \ndiminished that office and himself by giving the kind of campaign \nspeech he gave yesterday.\n  We do have a solution. The Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, and \nothers of us have sponsored a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. This would be a responsible way to deal with this \nproblem, and I hope we will get a vote on that shortly. But in the \nmeantime, there is no reason we cannot solve this problem. All we need \nis the President to step up and give us a proposal. So far, he has laid \nback and criticized everybody else and said: Where is your proposal? \nHow come you haven't done your work? Well, he has not done his work by \nproposing a responsible solution.\n  We will have a debate. We will have amendments. We will make \nconstructive suggestions. We will do it in the light of day and not \nbehind closed doors, which is where these negotiations are occurring \nnow. Why does this need to be done in secret? Why, as Senator Sessions \nsaid, are we, the elected representatives of the American people, left \nwith a fait accompli shortly before the deadline that says: You either \npass this or the country's economy goes down the tubes. That is not \nwhat the American people expect of us. That is not what they deserve.\n  Sure, there are going to be differences of opinion, but that is what \nthis Senate is for--to work those out. We all understand we are not \ngoing to get what we want 100 percent of the time, but we do deserve to \nhave a fair and open process, transparent and visible to the American \npeople. I get to offer suggestions, they either win or they lose, and \nthen ultimately the majority vote determines the outcome. We respect \nthat as the process by which these differences are resolved. But we \ncannot do our job when the President doesn't do his job and make a \nresponsible proposal, when Senator Reid will not bring a budget to the \nfloor.\n  It has been 2 years since the Senate has had a budget. No one in the \nUnited States of America or anywhere around the world can operate with \nthat sort of recklessness and irresponsibility. Everybody has to have a \nbudget. My family has a budget. Every business has a budget. Only by \nhaving a budget can you determine what your priorities are. What are \nthe things you have to have or do? What are the things you can put off \nuntil tomorrow? What are the things that maybe would be nice to have \nbut you cannot afford?\n  Every family, every business has to go through that process but not \nthe Senate and not, apparently, the President of the United States. The \nproposal he made, which doubled the debt in 5\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\nyears and tripled it in 10 years, called for huge new tax increases. \nYet, when it came up for a vote--and only because Republicans forced a \nvote on that--it lost. It didn't get any support. I think it was 97 to \n0. Not even our friends across the aisle could support the President's \noutrageous proposal back then. So why doesn't he come back with a new \none? Why doesn't he stay at the table? Instead of going to Philadelphia \ntonight and raising money, why doesn't he call Senator McConnell, \nSpeaker Boehner, Minority Leader Pelosi, and Majority Leader Reid into \nhis office and sit down and do his job, just do his job?\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. On my way here, Mr. President, I had the great \npleasure of running into the Redway family, a few minutes ago, visiting \nfrom the State of Connecticut. Jack Redway is a former public servant \nin the State, and he is here with his wife Sue and other members of his \nfamily. When I told them I was on my way here to talk on the floor of \nthe Senate, they asked me what the subject was. When I told them the \nSenate is debating the debt, the deficit, and the budget, one of them \nsaid: Same old, same old.\n  We are here on the same old, same old issues. But the American people \nhave had enough. They have had enough of the tax breaks and the special \ngiveaways and the sweetheart deals that go to the special interests and \nthat have driven our deficit to sky-high, intolerable levels. We are \nnow at a turning point and really at a precipice where we simply cannot \nafford these kinds of tax breaks and sweetheart deals any longer, and \nthe people of Connecticut are saying enough is enough to the same old, \nsame old deals with these special interests. We ought to come together \non a bipartisan basis. Not only do we have a right and opportunity, we \nhave a responsibility and an obligation to say enough is enough and to \neliminate these kinds of tax breaks that squander and waste scarce \nresources.\n  The ethanol subsidies have been voted on by this body, \noverwhelmingly, by Republicans and Democrats, rejected. And the reason \nis quite simply that we can save $400 million each month, close to $2.5 \nbillion by the end of this year if we eliminate these subsidies on \nethanol. We shouldn't be divided on this issue going forward. We ought \nto be united on a bipartisan basis because these scarce resources are \nnecessary to make sure we do not burden our children and their children \nwith this kind of debt going forward.\n  The loophole that enables corporate jets to be depreciated at a \nfaster and higher rate than commercial airplanes adds to the debt and \nthe deficit in hundreds of millions of dollars. If we are serious about \ndebt reduction and addressing the deficit, we should eliminate that \nloophole. It is about making the Tax Code fair and effective.\n  Over the last decade the big five oil companies have taken home more \nthan $1 trillion in profits while enjoying tens of billions of dollars \nin taxpayer subsidies. Those moneys, whether you call them revenues or \ntaxes or breaks, whatever the nomenclature, whatever the rhetoric, they \nare a loss to the taxpayers and the people of the United States of \nAmerica without any reason because these five oil companies are among \nthe most profitable and lucrative in the history of the world, and they \ndon't need that money.\n  It is time to say enough is enough to the kinds of hidden subsidies \nthat go to special interests, and there are others that we ought to \nscrutinize and eliminate in the name of fairness and effectiveness in \nour government so that we can be serious about addressing our debt and \nour deficit.\n  Budgets are about choices. Some choices are not easy. We face tough \nchoices, but we ought to put to use the common sense of the American \npeople, to say enough is enough to the same old, same old hidden \nsubsidies, tax breaks, special giveaways to special interests. Cutting \nMedicare benefits or Medicaid will not make us stronger. Firing \nteachers will not make us stronger. Forcing kids out of college will \nnot make us stronger in Connecticut or across the country. None of \nthese measures will make us stronger or fairer as a nation, nor will \nrolling back our investments in innovation and research, which are \nvital to the high-tech jobs of the future, nor will cutting our \ninvestments in the essential means of transportation--high-speed rail, \nso important to Connecticut. None of these cuts will bring back jobs, \nwhich has to be our priority.\n  Economic growth and job creation must be put first, and the way to do \nit is to eliminate the wasteful tax subsidies, the breaks for special \ninterests. Eliminating them will make us stronger, it will make us \nfairer as a nation.\n  I urge us to come together and put aside whatever the labels and the \nrhetoric and the nomenclature as we call them and do the right thing to \nmake our Nation stronger and fairer.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4255-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

PETRAEUS TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL \n                          INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of David H. \nPetraeus, of New Hampshire, to be Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nhours of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I come to the floor as the chairman of the Select Committee on \nIntelligence to speak about the nomination of GEN David Petraeus to \nbecome the Director of the CIA. I wish to thank the majority leader for \nbringing this nomination to the floor in such a quick fashion because \nthe committee, only earlier this week, on Tuesday, unanimously approved \nthe nomination of General Petraeus.\n  I think there is no doubt but that General Petraeus is among the \nfinest military officers and strategic thinkers of his generation. We \nare very lucky to have his service. He wrote the Army's \ncounterinsurgency strategy and then applied it in Iraq, securing a \nmilitary victory from what had appeared to be a descent into chaos and \nviolence.\n  One year ago to this day, the Senate confirmed General Petraeus to \nreplace GEN Stanley McChrystal as the leader of American and \nInternational Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan. Since then he \nhas shifted the strategy, implemented the troop surge, kept our \ncoalition together, and today our military and intelligence analysts \npoint to gains in the security situation and in the Afghan military and \nability of the police to secure their nation.\n  General Petraeus's willingness to take on the Afghanistan mission \nalso demonstrates his extraordinary commitment to public service. At \nthe time, he was serving in Tampa, FL, as the Combatant Commander for \nCentral Command, no longer directly in charge of a war zone but with \nthe responsibility for not just Afghanistan but for 19 other countries \nas well. He agreed to what was a step down in the military ``org \nchart'' to take on the hardest military challenge in the world and to \ndeploy from Tampa to Kabul. The Nation certainly owes General Petraeus \na debt of gratitude for 37 years in uniform.\n  When he is confirmed, General Petraeus will be taking off the uniform \nto become Director Petraeus. He has clearly considered the differences \nin culture and mission between the CIA and the military, and now he \nwill shift\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\nhis style to lead intelligence collectors and analysts rather than \nofficers and enlisted troops.\n  As a matter of fact, in our hearing in Hart 216, there was a bit of \nlevity when General Petraeus was asked the question about how he would \ntransition from a four-star general to a civilian role as Director of \nthe CIA. He said: You can be sure that when I arrive at the CIA, I will \narrive without an escort and just simply get out of my automobile and \nwalk into the building. Well, as we looked out in the audience at his \nconfirmation hearing and we saw a phalanx of officers accompanying the \ngeneral, it became very clear that it was, indeed, going to be quite a \ntransition.\n  I believe--and I think this is the importance of this nominee--that \nGeneral Petraeus understands the difference and is prepared to move \ninto a civilian organization at a difficult time. Of our 16 different \nintelligence agencies, one is generally--and hopefully but generally--\nled by a civilian, although there have been seven military commanders \nin our history who have led the CIA. Of course, Leon Panetta is, in \nfact, a civilian.\n  I think we have to consider the timing of this: the winddown of two \nwars, Iraq and Afghanistan; the operation in Libya; a restive Middle \nEast where the changes in an Arab spring are not fully known; an \nIsraeli-Palestinian situation that has to it crisis dimensions; the \nNorth Korean situation with respect to the nuclear weaponry of that \ncountry; Iran, a very dangerous country with the potential of becoming \na nuclear country; and, above all things, the fact that this September \nis the tenth anniversary of 9/11, and where there is nonspecific \nintelligence that this country may well have a revenge attack against \nit. Therefore, I think General Petraeus's military service will come in \nhandy. I think his analytical skills and ability will come in very \nhandy. I believe he is the right man for the job at this time.\n  Through the confirmation process, the Intelligence Committee has \nsought to understand General Petraeus's vision for the CIA and how he \nwill lead it through the challenges I have just mentioned. I believe he \nhas answered these questions and has laid out his views.\n  General Petraeus has testified that he had discussed this possible \nmove to the CIA with Secretary Gates as far back as last year. He even \ndemonstrated that he knows the CIA culture and the lingo, saying that \nright after being sworn in he will call an ``all-hands'' meeting for \nall CIA employees and ``will tell them up front right there that you \nall should know that I'm here to recruit you and I know that you're \nhere to recruit me.''\n  He has met with just about every CIA former Director and received \ntheir advice on running the agency, and he plans to put that advice \ninto practice.\n  General Petraeus has written and testified he fully appreciates the \nmission of the CIA is to provide unvarnished intelligence assessments \nto policymakers, whether they like it or not. That is a fundamental \npoint. The intelligence must stand on its own. It must be good \nintelligence, it must be streamlined intelligence, and it must be \nintelligence which has been subject to the best of analysis and red-\nteaming.\n  This was one of the questions raised during his confirmation: Would \nGeneral Petraeus put aside his military commander's assessments and \ncarry forth the agency's analytic view? He answered the question head \non, pointing out that he has experience in the analytical field and in \ndebating assessments to reach the best judgment possible.\n  General Petraeus specifically pointed to his academic background as \nwell as his military command experience. He, in fact, has earned--and I \ndon't think many people know this--a master's of public administration \nand a Ph.D. in international relations from Princeton University's \nWoodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He has \nserved as an assistant professor of international relations at the U.S. \nMilitary Academy at West Point, from which he graduated, and as a \nfellow at Georgetown University.\n  So the culture and debate in the CIA's Directorate of Intelligence \nwill not be new to General Petraeus, and he understands the importance \nof presenting clear analytic views.\n  While all Members are familiar with General Petraeus's recent \npositions in Iraq and Afghanistan, let me touch on some of his prior \nexperience. Prior to command in Iraq, he served at Fort Leavenworth, \nKS, during which time he oversaw the development of the Army and the \nMarine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual. The importance of that manual is \nthat it has stood the test of time since then.\n  Earlier in his career, General Petraeus served in Bosnia, where he \nwas the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations of the NATO \nStabilization Force and the Deputy Commander of the United States \nCounterterrorism Task Force-Bosnia.\n  Prior to his tour in Bosnia, he spent 2 years at Fort Bragg, NC, \nserving as the Assistant Division Commander for Operations of the 82nd \nAirborne Division, and then as Chief of Staff of the Airborne Corps.\n  In addition, he has served in a number of staff assignments, \nincluding aide to the Chief of Staff of the Army; Military Assistant to \nthe Supreme Allied Command-Europe; Chief of Operations of the United \nNations Force in Haiti; and Executive Assistant to the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Not only is this a man who has great experience, this is a man who \nhas commanded, who understands the military, and who has produced for \nthe United States of America.\n  From my meeting and discussions with him, his responses before, \nduring, and after our confirmation hearing, and based on his remarkable \nbackground, I am absolutely confident General Petraeus will make an \nexcellent Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. I hope his \nconfirmation vote will be unanimous. That makes it a real mandate.\n  While we are here to consider the nomination of David Petraeus, I \nalso wish to note and recognize some other people. First and foremost, \nDefense Secretary Bob Gates, a former Director of Central Intelligence \nand the Secretary of Defense whose term ends today.\n  Secretary Gates has been a tremendously dedicated public servant \nthroughout his career but never more needed and appreciated than his \nlast 4\\1/2\\ years as Secretary of Defense. He has presided over the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has managed the largest organization \nin the world at the Pentagon. He has earned the complete trust and \nrespect of both President Bush and President Obama and of every single \nMember of this body. That almost makes him an endangered species.\n  Secretary Gates is the model of the professional government official, \nand his leadership and his character is truly an example to us all. I \nwish him well as he goes back to the State of Washington. Candidly, on \na personal level, I will never forget his service to our country.\n  Next, today is Leon Panetta's last day as Director of the CIA. I was \nvery proud to be able to introduce Director Panetta as a native \nCalifornian at his confirmation hearing to be Secretary of Defense \nearlier this month. I can't say enough about the job he has done and my \nappreciation for the relationship we have had over the past 2 years. I \nthink it is well known that when it first cropped up that he might be \nconsidered for CIA Director, I thought the service could be best served \nby someone with CIA experience. I can say here I couldn't have been \nmore wrong. Director Panetta has stepped in when the Senate has had a \nhard time finding agreement and put together a note of confidence in \nthis body that is unsurpassed, and I believe that is true at the agency \nas well. He has raised morale. He understands the priorities. He has \nset the priorities. And he was eminently prepared to be the commanding \nofficer in the takedown of Osama bin Laden. Mr. Panetta's service as \nCIA Director was both unique and very special. And it is worth noting \nthat, in a time when the Senate has a hard time finding agreement, Leon \nPanetta received 100 votes on his confirmation to be the next Secretary \nof Defense.\n\n  I hope and expect the vote on General Petraeus will be overwhelming \nas well. It speaks of the President's choices of such qualified and \nrespected nominees and of their willingness to continue service.\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\n  Quickly, I would also like to recognize a person who will be, as of \ntomorrow, the Acting Director of the CIA, Michael Morell.\n  I notice that the vice chairman of our committee, the distinguished \nSaxby Chambliss, is on the floor. I believe both of us think that Mike \nMorell has given our Intelligence Committee nothing but the unvarnished \ntruth. He has come in to meet with us; he has been prepared to answer \nquestions; he has presented the facts. He is an articulate, strong \nbriefer. He knows the Agency. I believe he is going to lead the Agency \nwell until the beginning of September, as General Petraeus will \ncomplete his tour in Kabul in July, and then there will be a transition \nperiod as he returns home and resigns his commission. In the interim, \nMike Morell will be in charge at the CIA. I think we both believe the \nAgency will be well served by his service as Acting Director.\n  Finally, I want to thank Mrs. Holly Petraeus, the wife of David \nPetraeus and the Assistant Director of the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, responsible for the Office of Servicemember Affairs.\n  General Petraeus mentioned at his hearing that Holly has been with \nhim for 37 years and 23 moves, and we thank her for continuing to share \nher husband with our country.\n  Madam President, you and I both know how difficult it is when we have \na spouse somewhere else, let alone having a spouse somewhere in great \njeopardy in wartime far from America, in countries at which we are \nwaging war, year after year after year. She, indeed, is a very special \nwoman, and I think the general is very lucky to have her as his spouse.\n  In the position of Director of the CIA, he will carry out one of the \nmost important posts in our government. The Director is a senior member \nof the President's national security team and provides candid and \nobjective analysis on every single national security issue this Nation \nfaces. But the Director is also in charge of clandestine and covert \noperations around the globe. It is one of the reasons our oversight \nresponsibility is so important in these areas: to see that the law is \nfollowed and to see that missions are carried out with the full \noversight of our committee. The CIA Director is responsible for the \nsecurity of the people of his Agency and for making sure their efforts \nare in keeping, as I said, with the Nation's laws and ethics. It is a \nunique and difficult combination of management, of intellect, and, most \nimportantly, of character because things can go awry and one might \nelect not to follow the law. I believe that will not be the case with \nGeneral Petraeus. I believe he will follow the law and he will do an \nexcellent job. So I fully, 100 percent, absolutely support his \nconfirmation.\n  I am very pleased to yield the floor to the distinguished vice \nchairman of the committee, the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, first of all, let me thank and \ncommend the chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence for her \ngreat work not only on this issue but on every other issue we have had \nthe opportunity to work on together over the past 6 months. She has, \nNo. 1, reached out to me and my staff every day to make sure we are \ndoing the intelligence work in the way we both agree it ought to be \ndone. She has done a magnificent job of leading the committee.\n  The nomination of David Petraeus is a classic example of how she has \nled our committee; that is, we need a very smooth transition, a very \nquick transition when it comes to the leadership of the intelligence \ncommunity. What Chairman Feinstein did was, as soon as the announcement \nwas made on Director Panetta's move to be the nominee for Secretary of \nDefense and David Petraeus was going to be the nominee for CIA \nDirector, she made sure all the background was done immediately so we \ncould go ahead and schedule a hearing well in advance of the movement \nby Director Panetta to the office of Secretary of Defense, preparing \nfor the confirmation of General Petraeus to be the next Director of the \nCIA. That is not always easy, but she made sure it got done.\n  I wish to commend, too, the majority staff director, David Grannis, \nas well as the minority staff director, Martha Scott Poindexter, for \ntheir work in doing the background that was needed to be done to allow \nthis nomination to move very quickly.\n  It is a pleasure to work with Chairman Feinstein. She certainly has \nthe best interests of America and Americans at heart from an \nintelligence standpoint, and she is doing a terrific job. It is a \npleasure to work with her.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I also rise to speak in favor of the nomination of \nDavid Petraeus to be the next Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency. General Petraeus has had an exemplary military career, and I \nlook forward to his confirmation as the Agency's 22nd Director.\n  Before I talk about him, I, too, would like to acknowledge his wife \nHolly for her service and support. In addition to supporting a military \nfamily during a number of long and unprecedented deployments and 23 \nmoves, Holly Petraeus has also worked to protect military families from \npredatory lending practices. I appreciate her longstanding commitment \nand support of our men and women in uniform and want to thank her for \njoining her husband in answering our Nation's call of duty.\n  The strain on a military family cannot be overstated, and Holly \nPetraeus is certainly an individual who exemplifies everything that is \ngood about how a military family needs to support the military member. \nI truly commend her for her great service to our country in that \nrespect.\n  The nomination of David Petraeus comes at a pivotal moment in our \nhistory as we face threats from across the globe. As a warfighter, he \nbrings a unique perspective, having seen firsthand the tactical value \nof accurate and timely intelligence. This experience, in an era of \nunparalleled cooperation between the Central Intelligence Agency and \nthe Department of Defense, will not only benefit the military and the \nintelligence community but also the American people.\n  General Petraeus graduated from West Point in 1974, but he has spent \nthe better part of the last decade on the battlefields of Iraq and \nAfghanistan. No matter what the task, David Petraeus has always \nanswered this country's call. Most recently, after turning around the \nwar in Iraq and putting us on a path to success, he left his position \nas commander of U.S. Central Command when he was again called upon for \nan unexpected deployment to Afghanistan. General Petraeus understood \nthe importance of the mission and accepted the assignment with vigor.\n  After leading the surge in Afghanistan, many expected him to retire \nfrom the military and public service, but not David Petraeus. He has \ndecided to accept one of the most challenging positions in the U.S. \nGovernment. As Director of the CIA, General Petraeus will face a number \nof critical challenges, many of which cannot be anticipated. However, \nwithout a doubt, the threat from terrorism will remain the focal point \nfor the CIA and for the new Director.\n\n  The successful strike on bin Laden removed al-Qaida's leader but not \nthe threat from terrorism. The al-Qaida core has been weakened, but \ntheir extremism and violence continues to spread through affiliates \nsuch as AQAP in Yemen and other like-minded radicals. General Petraeus \nunderstands these threats, and I look forward to working with him to \nmake sure the Nation remains vigilant through these very uncertain \ntimes.\n  I recall very vividly my first encounter with David Petraeus. It was \nin Iraq when he was in charge of the training of the Iraqi security \npolice and the military personnel. I remember standing on a rooftop \noutside of Baghdad and observing an operation, a training mission that \nwas going on where Iraqi security police and military personnel were \ninteracting and carrying out this training mission with U.S. military \npersonnel. Just being around David Petraeus that first day, you could \nsense there was something special and something different about this \ngreat leader. The respect he commanded from all of his subordinates and \nthe respect he showed to his superior officers was evident, and it was \npretty obvious there was something very unique about David Petraeus.\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\n  Obviously, he has gone on to provide the right kind of leadership \nthat America has grown to expect from our great military leaders, and \ncertainly David Petraeus has exemplified the very best the U.S. \nmilitary has to offer.\n  It is also important that we note, as Chairman Feinstein stated, that \nthere are some other folks who are moving to different positions or \nleaving public service who have been so valuable to the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  I have had the privilege of working with Secretary Bob Gates as a \nmember of the Armed Services Committee on a fairly regular basis. \nSecretary Gates will be the first one to tell you, he and I have not \nalways agreed on everything. That is part of what makes this \ninstitution work so well and what makes our country such a great \ncountry. But what a professional individual he is. He has provided the \nexact kind of service as Secretary of Defense that has been needed \nduring his years at the Pentagon, which have not been easy years. These \nhave been very difficult years to move through the Iraq situation, the \nsurge into Afghanistan, as well as to deal with all the other myriad of \nissues--from personnel, to health care, to weapons systems--the \nSecretary of Defense has to deal with on a daily basis.\n  I admire and respect Bob Gates so much, and obviously we certainly \nwish him the best in the private sector.\n  Leon Panetta moving from the CIA to the office of Secretary of \nDefense is a natural. As I have stated on this floor previously, I will \nmiss him as the Director because I think he has done such an exemplary \njob. He came in without a lot of the experience from an intel \nstandpoint that some folks thought the Director should have. But having \nworked with Leon Panetta when he was Chief of Staff to President \nClinton, having worked with him as Director of OMB under President \nClinton, I knew what kind of man he is. I knew Leon would adapt very \nquickly, and that is exactly what has happened.\n  He rolled his sleeves up and went to work. He has traveled around the \nworld meeting not only with leaders of other nations, but he always \nmakes sure he goes down and visits not just the station chief in the \ncountries where he is visiting but the personnel who really are out \nthere putting their lives on the line every day to try to protect \nAmerica and Americans.\n  He has certainly gained the respect of every individual at the CIA, \nas well as Members of this body. Not only has he gained respect, but \nthe morale at the CIA today is probably the highest it has been since I \nhave ever been involved over the last decade with the CIA. I think he \nhas done a magnificent job, and he is going to do likewise as the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  The chairman is right--Mike Morell stepping in for the next couple \nmonths will allow us to have a very seamless transition during the \ninterim because Mike is such a gifted professional. He appears before \nthe committee on a regular basis, and he does provide the direct, \nunfiltered, raw kind of information we need to hear. He is a great \nindividual. He has been a great leader as the No. 2 person at the CIA, \nwhere he will continue to serve. During the interim, he is going to \ncontinue that kind of leadership we again have grown to expect from the \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency. So I am very pleased Mike \nMorell is in the position he is at this point in time so we will \ncontinue to have the right kind of leadership at the Agency.\n  Let me say, we had a unanimous vote in the committee on reporting out \nthe nomination of David Petraeus. I, like the chairman, hope we have a \nvery outstanding, unanimous vote today for General Petraeus to be \nconfirmed as the next Director of the CIA.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the vice chairman for his \nremarks. I would like to thank him also for his willingness to work as \na bipartisan team, which, as he said, we have done. I think the \ndividends have been great for our committee in that we have been able \nto get an authorization bill passed, we have been able to effect some \nchanges. We have been able to work together. Our staffs work together. \nIn particular, I would like to thank Majority Staff Director David \nGrannis, and I would like to thank Minority Staff Director Martha Scott \nPoindexter for her work in this regard.\n  I think it is extraordinarily important that Americans know there is \nin the Senate of the United States a team of oversight that is, in \nfact, working together on a true bipartisan basis.\n  So I say to the Senator, Mr. Vice Chairman, thank you so much for \nthat--it has been wonderful for me--and particularly for your \nfriendship as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I rise today to applaud the military \nservice of GEN David Petraeus and voice my support as he transitions \nfrom leading our Nation's troops in Afghanistan to leading our Nation's \nintelligence professionals at the Central Intelligence Agency. He is a \nman of outstanding moral integrity who has had a distinguished career \nin the U.S. Army.\n  Four years ago, General Petraeus was called ``General Betray Us'' by \nMoveon.org and other leftist groups. While I have always supported \nGeneral Petraeus, others in this body have not. The general's rise, \nsince 2007, to national prominence that supersedes party and ideology \nis indicative of the incredible nature of his service to our country.\n  When analysts discuss success of the Iraq surge in 2007 and 2008, \ncredit is given to counterinsurgency tactics or to counterterrorism \ntactics. The ``awakening'' of the Sunni leadership has often been \ntouted as the decisive factor as has the marginalization of the Shia \nextremist militias. But I would submit to the Senate that the success \nof the surge had a singular root in the leadership of General Petraeus.\n  After successfully leading U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq, our \nNation once again called upon General Petraeus to lead combat \noperations in Afghanistan. As in Iraq, he developed and executed a \nstrategy that took the momentum away from the enemy and began the \nprocess of providing a lasting stability in Afghanistan. General \nPetraeus has acknowledged that we have only begun to ``get the inputs \nright'' in that war-torn country. His leadership, rapport with the \ntroops, interaction with our coalition partners, and efforts with the \nAfghan government have been decisive to the successes we have had in \nAfghanistan to date.\n  General Petraeus now moves on to a new challenge. He will lead the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, which is now rightfully riding high in the \nwake of killing Osama bin Laden. His nomination to this position is an \ninspired choice that I am very happy to support. In General Petraeus, \nwe have a leader whom we can trust as our Nation continues to prosecute \nthe global war on terrorism.\n  Our Nation and its people owe General Petraeus and his family a debt \nof gratitude for their selfless service. They are an inspiration to \nthis Nation, young and old, to spend their lives in service and support \nof our Nation--in the military where possible or in government service \nor private endeavors. There will be many speeches and many accolades \nfor this inspiring leader, and rightly so. But let us give General \nPetraeus the tribute that any leader really craves--to look behind him, \nand see followers.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, it is my great honor to speak today \nin support of President Obama's nominee to be the next Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, GEN David Petraeus.\n  I want to take a few moments to describe what, I believe, Dave \nPetraeus has meant to our country and why he will be a great CIA \nDirector.\n  GEN David Petraeus is the most distinguished general officer of the \nU.S. Armed Forces of his generation--and his generation has many \nimpressive general officers. He is a true American hero who has twice \nbeen called upon by our commander-in-chief to assume leadership of a \nfaltering war effort. And twice he has not only answered that call, but \nled our forces out of the jaws of defeat and onto the path of victory. \nTo my knowledge, no one else in American history shares that record \nwith Dave Petraeus.\n  At a moment when cynicism too often infuses our national politics, \nand partisanship too often affects our national security, General \nPetraeus has\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\nwon the confidence, gratitude, and respect of the American people--\nDemocrats, Republicans, and yes, Independents. While commanding our \nextraordinary military in wars that have divided our country, General \nPetraeus has inspired and united our American family.\n  At a moment when too many of our fellow citizens fear our best days \nare behind us, General Petraeus' life and leadership have been a \nreminder that America is still a land of heroes--and that Americans are \nstill very capable of achieving greatness.\n  This special debt of national gratitude extends beyond Dave Petraeus \nto his family, beginning with his remarkable wife, Holly. Holly \nPetraeus shares her husband's strength of character, intelligence, and \ndevotion to the cause of public service. As many of you know, she is \ncurrently leading a noble mission of her own--protecting our military \nfamilies from exploitative and manipulative lending practices.\n  By my rough calculations, General Petraeus has spent more than twice \nas many months deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan over the last 8 years as \nhe has back home in the United States. Throughout all that time, Holly \nhas been supportive of her husband's service and taken care of their \ngifted children. So today I know we all want to say: Thank you, Holly \nPetraeus.\n  General Petraeus' background and accomplishments would make him a \nsuperb candidate for any of the top national security positions in the \nU.S. Government. But there are a special set of reasons why I believe \nhe will make a truly superb Director of the CIA in this time of war.\n  First, GEN David Petraeus is someone whose very name inspires the \ntrust and confidence of America's friends, and the fear and anxiety of \nAmerica's enemies. As our commander in Iraq, at U.S. Central Command, \nand now in Afghanistan, he has stood at the epicenter of some of our \ntoughest, most intensive, and most effective counterterrorism \noperations. David Petraeus knows our enemies.\n  At the same time, General Petraeus has also built close personal \nrelationships with our key partners and allies in the Middle East, \nSouth Asia, the Euro-Atlantic community, and around the world. Dave has \nalso proven himself to be a capable leader of large organizations, \nlarger even than the CIA. And because he is a scholar as well as a \nsoldier, he is well-suited to oversee and improve the critically \nimportant analysis done by so many who work at the CIA.\n  After all he has done, General Petraeus would be well-justified in \nseeking a quiet, personal retirement now. But fortunately for the rest \nof us, service to a cause larger than himself is General Petraeus' \ncreed and destiny. The brave and skillful men and women of the Central \nIntelligence Agency will be in very good hands when he is given the \nopportunity to become their leader, and all Americans will be fortunate \nindeed, and safer, when General Petraeus is at the helm there.\n  And that is why I feel so personally honored to vote today for the \nconfirmation of GEN David Petraeus to serve as the next Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I am pleased to support GEN David \nPetraeus to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. For the \nsecond time in as many weeks, this body endorsed an exceptional nominee \nfor a critical post. General Petraeus brings to his new position an \nincredible resume of warfighting knowledge and experience, strengthened \nby meaningful excursions into academia. After leading our troops in \ncombat operations overseas for nearly a decade, I think he is well \nqualified to lead our foremost Intelligence institution to serve the \nneeds of our Armed Forces and the Nation at large.\n  One of the most respected military thinkers of his generation, \nGeneral Petraeus literally rewrote the manual on counterinsurgency \noperations. Understanding that the ability to think is as critical as \nknowing how to fight, he translated difficult and sometimes \ncounterintuitive principles into a winning formula for a flagging Iraq \ncampaign. In his latest post, his leadership has inspired hope for a \npositive outcome to our endeavors in Afghanistan.\n  Threats to our national security are ubiquitous, with those who plot \nagainst us living in all corners of the world and in the elusive halls \nof cyberspace. To defend our liberty and way of life, we rely on an \nintelligence service that is agile and proactive to swiftly defeat \nthreats before they can harm us. General Petraeus has the rare \ncombination of professional acumen and keen intellect to lead the \nCentral Intelligence Agency in a way that anticipates the moves of our \nadversaries and keeps them off balance.\n  General Petraeus and his wife Holly will again unselfishly answer the \ncall of public service at a time when our Nation demands great leaders. \nAfter 37 years, they continue to serve with vigor and distinction and I \nlook forward to following their continued success.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today in ardent support of the \nnomination of GEN David Petraeus to be the 20th Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, CIA.\n  First and foremost, General Petraeus deserves our Nation's unending \ngratitude for his unwavering commitment to this country over the nearly \nfour decades that he has served in uniform. Since graduating from the \nU.S. Military Academy in 1974, General Petraeus has accumulated \nexceptional knowledge, acumen, and experience worthy of the legendary \nmilitary giants who have matriculated at West Point. Throughout his \nlong and distinguished career, he has demonstrated the highest levels \nof integrity and performance, exceeding our Nation's expectations time \nand time again.\n  His numerous awards, distinctions, and decorations reflect the fact \nthat General Petraeus is one of the superior military leaders of this \nor any generation, as he is the recipient of the Bronze Star Medal for \nvalor and two awards of the Distinguished Service Medal. His \naccomplishments extend beyond our own beloved shores around the world, \nas he has also received the Gold Award of the Iraqi Order of the Date \nPalm, the French Legion d'Honneur, the Polish Order of Merit, the Order \nof Australia, and the National Defense Cross of the Czech Republic. \nSuch accolades are a testament to the extraordinary leadership of \nGeneral Petraeus and speak to an individual whose name is synonymous \nwith excellence and respect.\n  One of the finest officers our Nation has produced, General Petraeus \nalso possesses a brilliance that is only matched by his bravery. \nConsider just a few of the military milestones that have occurred under \nGeneral Petraeus. He has directed operations that have halted and \nreversed the momentum in such Taliban strongholds as Kandahar and he \npositioned the United States to secure victory in Iraq when defeat \noften seemed inevitable. His tactical and strategic faculties are \nuniversally admired and are second to none. And as the commander \nleading U.S. and Coalition forces in both Afghanistan and Iraq, he \nclearly understands the absolute necessity of coordination between \nmilitary special ops and intelligence covert actions--an imperative \nthat was underscored with the remarkable May 1, 2011, take down of \nOsama bin Laden.\n  And I would be abjectly remiss if I did not recognize General \nPetraeus's wife Holly, their son Stephen, who has followed in General \nPetraeus's footsteps by serving in the Army, including a recent tour in \nAfghanistan, and his daughter Anne. His assignments since September 11, \n2001, have taken him away from his family, far too often and for far \ntoo long. In fact, it is my understanding that General Petraeus has \nbeen deployed for more than 6\\1/2\\ years over the past decade, and I am \nsure that there have been many missed birthdays, holidays, and other \nfamily moments along the way. And so I would like to take an \nopportunity to acknowledge the family that has endured ``23 moves'' and \nstate that all of you deserve recognition for your sacrifices and \ndedication to the Nation. Indisputably, our phenomenal military \nfamilies at every level and in every branch of our Armed Forces are \nnothing short of indispensable to America's ultimate success in our \nmissions. Our servicemen and women could not perform their duties as \neffectively without you nor could our Nation. Your sacrifices are your \nservice and we cannot thank you enough.\n  Today, the U.S. Senate considers General Petraeus to lead the CIA at \na time when daunting challenges to our\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\nnational security threaten America's unique position and stature in the \nworld, when the threat of retaliatory strikes in a post-bin Laden \nlandscape are alarmingly high, when uprisings across the Middle East \nand northern Africa continue to spread, when Iran continues to flaunt \nits nuclear ambitions, when the makeup of the Libyan opposition is \nstill unclear, when the threat of cyber intrusion and attack is \ndistressingly persistent, and when Islamic extremists continue to \ncontrol large swaths of territory in such locations as Yemen.\n  Former Director--and now Defense Secretary--Leon Panetta has left the \nCIA on firm footing, having successfully rebuilt the agency's \nrelationship with Congress, implemented efficiencies, and defended the \nbest assets of the agency. General Petraeus will undoubtedly continue \non this path, while striving to close such key intelligence gaps and \nothers, as our security may depend on such efforts.\n  General Petraeus also will be tasked with leading the agency during a \ntime of national austerity. As Senator Feinstein, the chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, stated during General Petraeus's \nnomination hearing, ``the nation's economic and financial struggles are \nrequiring a new level of fiscal discipline, which means that the major \nincreases of intelligence resources since 2001--and the CIA budget has \nvirtually doubled in that time--will likely end and the intelligence \ncommunity will have to do more with less.'' The arduous calibration \nbetween seeking efficiencies to reduce costs without diminishing in any \nway the agency's pivotal role in the national security apparatus \nrequires the discerning vision and deft judgment that have been \nhallmarks of General Petraeus's illustrious tenure in service to our \ncountry.\n  General Petraeus must at the same time strengthen the bridges between \nour military commanders on the ground and the analysts in Washington. \nIntelligence assessments, which are so critical to the creation of \nsound policy, must accurately depict the situation on the ground and \ntake into account the most recent tactical and strategic developments--\nfortunately, General Petraeus is supremely positioned to understand the \nneeds of those commanders and to ensure that our intelligence meets \ntheir needs. As he stated during his nomination hearing, General \nPetraeus intends to ``strive to represent the Agency position'' and \n``convey the most forthright and accurate picture possible.''\n  Like my colleagues in this Chamber, I applaud General Petraeus, who \nupon assuming the directorship, has pledged to retire from the military \nto which has given every fiber of his being. He recognizes and \nunderstands the necessity for independence. General Petraeus stated \nthat he has ``no plans to bring my military braintrust with me to the \nAgency'' and that he would ``in short, get out of [his] vehicle alone \non the day that [he] report[s] to Langley'' underscoring that \nunderstanding and avoiding the mistakes of some of his predecessors.\n  General Petraeus has described the professionals of the CIA as, ``the \nultimate selfless servants of our Nation, individuals with \nextraordinary expertise, initiative, integrity, and courage in the face \nof adversity and physical danger.'' I could not concur with this \nassessment more, and frankly, we would be hard-pressed to find a \nnominee with stronger credentials than General Petraeus to lead this \nkey national security organization.\n  The trust and the confidence that are lynchpins of General Petraeus's \nsterling reputation among all who have served under him extend to the \nU.S. Congress and the President. There is no doubt whatsoever that the \ngeneral will arrive at Langley with an unprecedented combination of \nintellect and courage, and without reservation of any kind, I could not \nbe more pleased to vote to confirm General Petraeus as Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona\n  Mr. KYL. First, let me acknowledge that two of the great leaders of \nthe Senate have just made very ringing endorsements of General Petraeus \nto head the CIA, which we will be voting on in about an hour and a \nhalf. I associate myself fully with their remarks because they are in \nsuch a good position to know, as chairman and ranking member, \nrespectively, of the Intelligence Committee.\n  I think my colleagues will defer to their judgment about this. But \nmore than that, most of us have gotten to know General Petraeus because \nhe has been so involved in so many of the important policy decisions of \nthis country, that we have all been able to form our own judgments and \nreach the same conclusion that the chairwoman and ranking member of the \ncommittee have articulated so well just now. I am glad to associate \nmyself with their remarks.\n  Noting that no one else is on the Senate floor to speak further about \nthis nomination, I would ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Higher Taxes\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, we are going to be foregoing a July 4 break \nto go back home to visit with our constituents in order to stay here, \nostensibly, to work on the problem of the accumulating budget deficit \nand huge debt that the United States has taken on and the need to do \nsomething about that, in conjunction with the President's request that \nwe raise the national debt ceiling.\n  What I would like to briefly address today is what seems to me to be \nan obsession on the part of the President to raise taxes. In fact, he \nis so fixed on this, it is so important to him to raise taxes, that he \nis willing to risk an economic crisis knowing that Congress will not \nraise taxes as part of this debt ceiling increase. And we should not. \nNot because we are trying to protect somebody but because higher taxes \non an already weak economy would just make things worse.\n  Now, we can point to a lot of what the President has done since he \ntook office that has made things worse, but I do not know of a single \neconomist who believes that American businesses will be more likely to \nhire people, will be more likely to create jobs, if they are faced with \npaying higher taxes.\n  They will not. Everyone knows that. So when the President talks about \nraising taxes, he is talking about killing jobs, and I would like to \nspeak about the three specific taxes that he has talked about. I know \nbecause I was the Senate Republican delegate in the meetings with the \nVice President at which this was discussed.\n  I am not going to break the commitment that we all made to each other \nto not discuss things that the President has not already made public. \nSo I will not discuss the many things the Democrats took off the table. \nThey talk about Republicans taking things off the table, I think they \nhave already made it clear that, for example, they took any changes in \nObamaCare off the table. I will not get into that. I will not discuss \nother things that were a part of our conversations.\n  But since yesterday the administration's spokesman and the President \nspecifically identified three of the things they did put on the table \nand wanted to discuss with us, I believe I might as well explain to you \nwhy we are not willing to raise these kinds of taxes. They are all job-\nkilling taxes. They would all inhibit growth, which is exactly the \nopposite of what we should be doing.\n  What are these job-killing tax increases on small businesses and \nAmerican families and other businesses? It is not, first of all, just \non millionaires and billionaires and corporate jets. President Obama \nand our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are obviously using \npoll-tested rhetoric about only raising taxes on millionaires and \nbillionaires and corporate jets. That sounds good. They want ordinary \nAmericans to believe they will not be affected by the President's tax \nincrease proposals. But the truth is, the provisions they put forward \nduring the debt limit meetings with Vice President Biden would target \nsmall businesses and other job creators and many Americans who are far \nfrom being millionaires or billionaires.\n  I should mention right off the top that they never discussed with us \nin these meetings anything having to do with corporate jets. So I have \nnot gone to look to see how many American workers are employed in the \ngeneral aviation business.\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\n  I note that it was on a list that they gave us, but they never \nchecked--I suspect that is more in the realm of political rhetoric \nsince it does not, even under their proposal I have seen, raise very \nmuch money. But in any event, what have they actually discussed with \nus?\n  Well, the first thing they discussed was repealing something called \nLIFO. LIFO is a term--last in, first out--that is used by accountants \nas one of the methods of inventory accounting. For years there has been \na question--and more than one-third of American businesses use this \nparticular method of accounting. It is perfectly appropriate and legal \nand so on. But there has been some talk: Well, should we have everybody \nuse the same standardized method of accounting? There have been \nproposals to do that in the past.\n  The problem is, what the Obama administration wants to do is not just \nto conform everyone to the same type of accounting but to actually go \nback and retroactively tax the businesses that have been using this \naccounting practice, which is perfectly legal, totally recognized by \nthe IRS, and nothing is wrong with it. But they are going to go back \nand say: Because we are interested in rasing revenue, we are going to \nput a retroactive tax on all of you who have been using this method of \naccounting.\n  They are more interested in getting money than in tax fairness, and \nthat is why we are opposed to this. It would represent a retroactive \ntax increase on the 36 percent of American businesses that use this \nperfectly legal method of accounting.\n  Now, who uses it? Mostly it is people in retail businesses and \nmanufacturers, many of whom are small businesses, I might add. To show \nwhat the impact of this would be--by the way, we first talk about \ncreating jobs in the retail sector where consumers come in and buy \nthings and in the manufacturing sector where they are made. These are \nthe very folks who use this method of accounting.\n  Here is the effect that it would have on small businesses. In \nSeptember 2009, the Small Business Administration's Office of \nAdvocacy--which is under the Obama administration--wrote to the Tax \nReform Subcommittee of the President's own Economic Recovery Advisory \nBoard that repealing LIFO ``would result in a tax increase for small \nbusinesses that could ultimately force many small businesses to \nclose.''\n  Why on Earth would we impose a tax retroactively on folks who \nprobably--at least according to the President's own Small Business \nAdministration--would ultimately have to close their business as a \nresult of the imposition of this tax? Why would we do that? Should that \nnot at least be taken into account before you propose something such as \nthis or are you so obsessed with finding somebody to raise taxes on or \ngetting revenue that it does not matter?\n  With unemployment at 9.1 percent, we should not raise taxes on \nAmerica's job creators.\n  Here is the second one they discussed: capping itemized deductions. \nThey proposed capping itemized deductions for upper income taxpayers \neither at the 28 or 35 percent level. Obviously, this reduces the \nability of taxpayers to buy homes, to make gifts to charity, to pay \nmedical expenses, all of the things for which deductions are taken.\n  As the Wall Street Journal editorialized on June 29:\n  The political point of this exercise is to raise marginal tax rates \nwithout appearing to do so.\n  That is exactly what would happen. That editorial points out that \nPresident George H.W. Bush agreed to a similar proposal as part of his \n1990 budget agreement that broke his ``read my lips'' promise not to \nraise taxes. But the fact is, half of all small business income falls \ninto the top two brackets. So the ability of small businesses to grow \nand create jobs would obviously be harmed by this proposal.\n  The fact is, most high-income taxpayers--individual taxpayers--\nalready lose the benefit of tax deductions and credits at their income \nlevel because of what is called the alternative minimum tax. Each year \nwe eliminate the effect of the alternative minimum tax except on those \nmaking, I believe it is above $250,000. So the very people who would be \ncapped are already capped under the AMT. Who would get hurt?\n  Well, we know 50 percent of the taxes paid by small businesses are \npaid by these two upper brackets because they pay individually. It is \nthose folks who cannot take this that would get hit by this because \nthey have to take the deductions as part of their businesses. They \nwould end up having their deductions capped and be unable, therefore, \nto invest that in hiring more people. Moreover, the tax increase would \nhit a much larger segment of American families than just millionaires \nand billionaires.\n  According to the IRS, in 2008, the last year for which we have \nnumbers, only 319,000 tax returns showed income of $1 million or more. \nBut in that same year, the number of returns falling in the 33- and 35-\npercent brackets, which are the brackets most affected by this \nproposal, numbered more than 3.6 million. In other words, more than 10 \ntimes the number of filers would be hit if only millionaires and \nbillionaires were affected.\n  So while the President likes to claim he only wants to tax \nmillionaires and billionaires, the fact is his proposal would hit small \nbusinesses and millions of Americans who are not millionaires. But as I \nsaid, most importantly, it affects job creation because the people who \nwould be hit by this are the people who are small business \nentrepreneurs, who pay their taxes under these provisions, and would no \nlonger be able to deduct their business job expenses.\n  Why, with economic growth at just 1.9 percent in the last quarter, \nwould Congress want to raise taxes on small businesses and on American \nfamilies? It just does not make sense.\n  Finally, oil and gas. It is always popular to talk about attacking \nBig Oil. Of course, millions of Americans and retired Americans own \nstock in oil companies, and raising taxes would have the effect of both \nreducing what they get in their pensions and so on, as well as \nundoubtedly result in higher gasoline prices because most of these \nkinds of taxes are passed right on through to the consumer.\n  So they want to raise taxes on U.S.-based oil and gas companies--not \nforeign-owned companies--U.S.-based oil and gas companies. Obviously, \nthis tax could result in higher gas prices which contradicts the reason \nfor releasing oil from the Strategic Oil Reserve. Why do that if it is \ngoing to get canceled out by imposing a new tax?\n  It could, obviously, hurt job creation because this industry supports \nover 9.2 million American jobs. It does not just target oil companies \nbecause they get some kind of special benefit. What these provisions do \nis eliminate a tax provision applicable to all businesses--any \nmanufacturing business, for example, has the benefit of these \nparticular three tax provisions.\n  So why single out one particular group of taxpayers, only about five \nin number, who would no longer be able to take advantage of provisions \nthat every other American business can take advantage of? They are \nbroadly available to American businesses in one form or another. They \nare three specific things: First, the so-called section 199 deduction \navailable to all manufacturers. Second, the U.S.-based businesses are \ngenerally able to prevent double taxation. When they have to pay taxes \nabroad, those taxes are then credited against their American tax \nburden. Third, most businesses can expense their research and \ndevelopment costs.\n  These are the three things that would be taken away just from oil \ncompanies, the folks who find American oil so that we can drive our \ncars and conduct our businesses. So raising the cost of producing \nAmerican oil would help our foreign competitors and make us more \ndependent on them, ship high-paying jobs offshore, increase our \ndependance on foreign oil, cause gas prices to rise, and hurt American \nfamilies already suffering with high food and energy costs.\n  Why would we want to do this except to demagogue a political issue? \nBecause it sounds good to punish success. America has never been about \npunishing success. America has been all about creating opportunities, \nand this President's ideas of raising taxes as the sine qua non of an \nagreement to achieve an increase in the debt ceiling, as he has \nproposed, would be absolutely contrary to what we are all trying to do \nright now--which is to help our economy get healthy so that it can \ncreate more jobs, so we can reduce this\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\ntremendously high unemployment rate that we have right now, put \nAmericans back to work, and help our families ironically, by getting \nhealthier economically, making more money, and producing more revenue \nfor the Federal Government to tax under our existing taxes. So if we \nwant economic growth, improvement in the economy, the last thing we \nshould be doing when our economy is ailing now is imposing a higher tax \nburden on it.\n\n  Why the President is so obsessed with this, I do not know. But I will \ntell you one thing: Republicans will resist these job-killing tax \nincreases, not because we are trying to protect somebody--except the \nAmerican people--but because we know that it is bad for our economy, \nfor our families, for our businesses, and for job creation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal editorial to \nwhich I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 29, 2011]\n\n    A Stealth Tax Hike--The Return of the Deduction Phase-Out Gambit\n       The White House wants Republicans to agree to tax increases \n     that no one wants to call tax increases, and for an insight \n     into this political method let's focus on one proposal in \n     particular--the phase-out of itemized deductions for upper-\n     income taxpayers. We hope the tea party is paying attention, \n     because this kind of maneuver is why people hate Washington.\n       The idea is that once taxpayers earn a certain amount of \n     money (say, $200,000), they would begin to lose the value of \n     the various deductions they're entitled to under the law. \n     These include such IRS Form 1040 line items as the personal \n     exemption, the deductions for state taxes and charitable \n     contributions, even those for spouses and children. Earn \n     enough money and soon the value of those deductions goes to \n     zero.\n       The political point of this exercise is to raise marginal \n     tax rates without appearing to do so. The top statutory \n     individual rate would remain at 35%, so the politicians could \n     claim they hadn't raised rates. But for those losing their \n     deductions, the marginal rate would increase by between one \n     and two percentage points until the phase-outs were complete.\n       We raise the alarm now because this sneaky bit of political \n     fiddling last became law during a previous bipartisan budget \n     summit--in 1990. Democrats proposed it then, too, and \n     President George H.W. Bush and his budget chief Dick Darman \n     agreed to it so they could appear to be raising tax rates \n     less than they really were.\n       Those deduction phase-outs continued to be part of the tax \n     code until the 2003 tax law finally phased out the phase-\n     outs. They are scheduled to return when the George W. Bush \n     tax rates expire at the end of 2012. While the statutory top \n     rate will then rise to 39.6%, millions of taxpayers will pay \n     a top rate closer to 41% as they lose their deductions. This \n     is in addition to the 3.8% payroll tax increase on investment \n     income that will hit millions of these same taxpayers when \n     ObamaCare gears up in 2013.\n       Only six months ago, President Obama endorsed the extension \n     of the Bush rates (and the end of the phase-outs) for two \n     more years, but now his negotiators want to renege on that \n     deal. They want to reintroduce the phase-outs as part of a \n     debt-ceiling deal, apparently so they can claim they got \n     Republicans to agree to some ``revenue increases'' in return \n     for spending cuts. Some Republicans might be tempted to go \n     along claiming they didn't raise tax rates.\n       They'll deserve only scorn if they do. Republicans will be \n     signing on to a tax increase, and one of the more dishonest \n     varieties at that. The phase-out gambit is an attempt to \n     shoe-horn more progressively into the tax code without \n     admitting it, and to do so in such a way that only tax \n     experts will know what's going on.\n       One goal of the tax reform that Republicans and Mr. Obama \n     keep talking about is to simplify the tax code, but deduction \n     phase-outs make the code far more complicated. Phase-outs \n     make it impossible for taxpayers to add up their income, look \n     at the tax tables, and know what they owe. The IRS taxpayer \n     advocate service and even the head of the American Bar \n     Association's tax section urged their repeal in the 1990s.\n       Democrats keep telling us Americans support raising taxes. \n     If that's true, the least they can do is try to raise them \n     honestly.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I thank Senator Kyl for \nhis eloquent speech on the issues of the day that are obviously very \nserious for the American people.\n  Madam President, I am here to speak on a couple of issues--first and \nforemost, regarding the Asset Forfeiture Responsibility Act of 2011, an \nact that I have filed and will speak on in a moment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I want to comment on \nSecretary Gates' last day over at the Pentagon. I was over there doing \nsome work, and I noted that he was being honored today. I thank him for \nhis dedication and service to our country. He leaves behind an \nincredible record of service.\n  Our military and families, while strained, have never been more \nprepared to fight and win in today's conflicts. From my interaction \nwith him, I have gained an enormous level of respect for his tireless \nleadership and committed resolve on behalf of our men and women in \nuniform and their families.\n  Mr. Secretary, thank you for your incredible service to this Nation. \nYou have made us all proud.\n  Madam President, today, one of our Nation's finest officers, GEN \nDavid Petraeus, leaves behind a distinguished record of military \nservice and moves on to a new job. The wealth of experience he brings \nto this critical post will be invaluable as he and the other dedicated \npublic servants at the Agency work to keep our Nation safe from harm. I \nhave the utmost faith in his leadership and look forward to the \ncontributions he will make to the Agency and to our country.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown pertaining to the introduction of S. 1312 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.)\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. On a side note, I am hopeful that we will \ncontinue to work together and try to get through a lot of these fiscal \nchallenges we have. I, for one, along with many others, look forward to \nfinding common solutions to move our country forward and step back from \nthe financial precipice we are approaching.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time during quorum calls be divided \nequally to both sides, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time to talk about the \nbudget issues and the debt ceiling vote that is approaching. It is a \nserious issue that we need to deal with.\n  First, I think it is important to know how we got here. I say that \nbecause we don't want to repeat the mistakes we made in the past. It \nwas just 10 years ago when we had not only a balanced budget, we had a \nbudget that looked like we were going to pay off all of our privately \nheld debt. I was part of the Congress that moved us toward that \nbalanced budget and surplus. It was the Democrats who were prepared to \ndo what was necessary to balance the Federal budget in the 1990s, and \nwe got there. We didn't have a single vote from Republicans, but we \nbalanced the budget in the 1990s. It was the right thing to do for our \neconomy. As a result, our economy picked up and did extremely well.\n  We also know that the previous administration cut taxes twice, in \n2001 and 2003. We also went to war in Iraq--a war that was one of \nchoice--and we went to war in Afghanistan, and we didn't pay for either \none of those wars. It was these unpaid-for wars and tax policies that \nled us from a surplus to a deficit. Our economy then turned, and we now \nhave these large deficits. I say that because we need to pay attention \nto how we got here to make sure we have a credible plan to get us out \nof this deficit.\n  I think it is very important that this country move toward a \nmanageable debt. It is very important for our economy, and for job \ngrowth, that we manage our deficit and bring it down.\n  Let me give you what I think needs to be done in any plan that is \npresented to us for consideration. I hope we all agree that we need to \nraise the debt ceiling. That is after the fact. We have already spent \nthe money. Now we have to pay the bill. We also would like to see a \nplan to bring our deficit under control. To do that, we have to have a \ncredible plan, one that really does\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\nbring us within the realm of a manageable deficit.\n  Secondly, it has to be fair. I notice that my Republican friends ask \nour children to give up some of their help for a college education. \nThey want to cut the Head Start Program, and they want seniors to pay \nmore for health care. How about the well off? Should they not be part \nof the plan? I think we need to have a fair plan in order to accomplish \nour goal.\n  Third, we need to allow our Nation to move forward with economic \ngrowth. Jobs are critically important to deal with the deficit. As we \ncreate more jobs, we help our economy grow, it brings our budget into \nbalance.\n  I am for a credible plan. To me, a credible plan needs to get the job \ndone. Managing our deficit needs to be fair, including all elements of \ngovernment spending, and it includes tax expenditures. It has to allow \nfor economic growth. If we are going to get the job done, we have to \nbring down spending--we all acknowledge that--on the domestic side and \nthe national security side. We can do better in bringing our troops \nhome from Afghanistan and save military dollars.\n  There are things we can do, and we need to do that. But we also have \nto deal with the revenue side. Quite frankly, we can't get the job done \nwithout dealing with the tax loopholes and shelters that we have in the \nTax Code. I am concerned that the Republican leader said we could not \nconsider any revenue. Well, I have heard from a lot of my Republican \ncolleagues who disagree with that. We need to include revenues in a \ncredible plan or it can't get done. We cannot manage the deficit \nwithout closing those loopholes and eliminating those shelters.\n  Yesterday, I talked about one of those--the ethanol subsidy. We have \nnearly $3 billion that we can save there. The ethanol subsidies are not \nneeded. The market is there. More damaging, it is hurting our economy. \nI have the honor of representing the people of Maryland and the \nDelmarva Peninsula. The poultry industry is suffering because of the \nethanol subsidies. It is costing more to produce poultry, making the \nindustry less competitive. We can save and create jobs by eliminating \nthe ethanol subsidy, which will help us in balancing the budget.\n  Today, I want to talk about another tax shelter and loophole that we \ncan deal with, and that is the section 199 manufacturing tax break used \nby the oil and gas industry. It is very interesting. We have seen \ngasoline prices rise, and we have seen the negative impact of that on \nour economy. But guess who is benefitting from the increase in the \ngasoline prices? You are right; it is the oil and gas industry. Their \nprofits are up, while our economy has been suffering.\n  In the first 3 months of this year, the gas and oil industry, the \nfive largest companies, had record profits of $35.8 billion. Big Oil \nbenefits from a variety of subsidies, including section 199, that \namount to some $4 billion annually. So we are subsidizing the Big Five, \nwho are on course to make a projected $140 billion profit in 2011, with \n$4 billion in taxpayer contributions. It is not needed. These funds \ncould be used to help reduce our deficit instead.\n  The worst part is that section 199 came about as a result of our \nForeign Sales Act. What was that about? We wanted to put American \nmanufacturers and producers on a level playing field for international \ncompetition. We tried to do that with a direct subsidy to help \nexporters, but the World Trade Organization held that to be illegal. So \nthen we came back with this general manufacturers' credit, section 199, \nto try to help our exporters.\n\n  The gas and oil industry are not manufacturers exporting a product. \nThey should never have qualified for this taxpayer-funded subsidy. I \nasked that question in the Senate Finance Committee when we had the Big \nFive oil companies' chief executive officers (CEOs) before us. Not one \nof the CEOs could justify the fairness of this subsidy going to the oil \nand gas industry. Their only answer was: Well, everyone else is getting \nit.\n  We need to reduce unnecessary government spending, whether it is on \nthe appropriations side or the tax expenditure side. With regard to the \noil and gas industry, repealing section 199 and the rest of the $4 \nbillion or so in subsidies these companies receive each year could help \nus balance the budget.\n  But the minority leader says we can't even consider that. He says we \ncan't consider any of the revenues. To me, it is not a fair proposal, \nnot a credible proposal, unless we tell the most wealthy and those \ncompanies that don't need the subsidies that they are going to be part \nof the plan to bring our budget into balance.\n  There are many more provisions in the Tax Code we can look at where \nwe can get the savings. I have just mentioned two. If we are going to \nhave a credible plan that will allow for economic growth and allow us \nto create jobs--and the best way to deal with the deficit is to create \nmore jobs--then we have to have a fair approach. So I urge my \ncolleagues to get together on this.\n  Look, I understand it is not going to be the budget the Democrats \nwant, but I will tell you this: it will not be the budget the House \nRepublicans want either. We have to work together, Democrats and \nRepublicans. I think we can find common ground. Earlier this year, I \nthink 62 Senators signed a letter saying, let's use the framework of \nthe debt commission. So I think there was that willingness. Let's get \nback to that.\n  Let's get the Democrats and Republicans working together in true \ncompromise. We don't have to compromise our principles. We can get the \njob done, and that job means let's get our debt into a manageable \nstate, let's do it in a way that is fair, so the well off also are part \nof a solution that includes revenues, and let's do it in a way that \nallows America to do what President Obama said we can do--out-educate, \nout-innovate, and out-build our competitors so we can create the jobs \nthat won't just help us balance our budget but will keep America \nprosperous, too.\n  That is our charge. That is what we need to do. Let's get on with the \nwork.\n  With that, I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, before I start my remarks, I would \nlike to say that in about an hour we will start voting on the \nnomination of General Petraeus to lead the CIA, and I am going to \nenthusiastically support that nomination because I do think General \nPetraeus has shown the kind of military leadership that makes our \ncountry proud. He has come in at some of the hardest times in both Iraq \nand Afghanistan. I have met with him in Iraq to see exactly what he was \ndoing, how he was implementing his counterinsurgency proposals, and I \nthink he is a gifted leader.\n  I also believe in this war we are in--the war against terrorists--the \nCIA and the military have such a necessary link, and in many ways they \nare codependent on the information and the capabilities that each \nuniquely has. So I think he will do the same great job he has done in \npublic service in this kind of arena that has become much more closely \nlinked to the military, for sure. So I will support his nomination.\n\n\n                              Debt Ceiling\n\n  Mr. President, today, so many people have been talking about this \ndebt ceiling issue, which should be what we are talking about because \nwe have perhaps only as long as 1 month--we are not exactly clear--when \nwe will reach that over $14 trillion debt ceiling. This is the most \nserious issue facing Congress and the President today, and we shouldn't \nbe doing anything else except talking about how we are going to bridge \nthis gap that would allow us to go forward with significant reforms.\n  I will not vote to raise the debt ceiling unless there are not \nsignificant reforms that assure we will not have to do it again; that \nwe will begin to bring down the deficit that is causing this huge debt \nto accumulate. So I am looking for the leaders who are meeting in the \ndifferent meetings--some I am privy to--to essentially come to an \nagreement so we can send that message.\n  People have talked about the message that would be sent to the world \nif the debt ceiling isn't lifted. I am concerned about the message that \nwould be sent if we lift the debt ceiling without reforms. I wish to \nsend the message to the global marketplace that we are going to deal \nwith our financial situation, and we are going to deal with it \nresponsibly; that we are going to cut the spending that has caused this \ndebt to accumulate to such alarming levels. The message I wish to send \nto the world is, we are going to take this\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\nproblem and we are going to solve it together; that we are not going to \njust do another pro forma lifting of the debt ceiling as if it were \nbusiness as usual. Because business as usual it is not. We don't have a \ntax problem in this country, we have a spending problem, and we must \nattack it if we are going to have credibility.\n  That brings me to a bill I have introduced because I think it is \nimportant, as we are looking at this looming deadline, to have a plan \nB. If, in fact, we are not going to be able to come to an agreement--\nboth Houses of Congress and the President--that would cut the spending \nlevels sufficiently enough that many of us would be comfortable with in \norder to pass a bill raising the debt limit ceiling--if we don't meet \nthat test--we should have a responsible plan B. This would be a plan \nthat would say: If, in fact, we can't agree on what it will take to \nlift that debt ceiling, this is how we are going to treat the money \nthat will be coming in. Because at that point our government will be \nlimited in its expenditures by the revenue that is coming in.\n  We can allocate that revenue, and that is where I think we must have \na plan B. We must make sure certain things are done. The No. 1 thing we \nall know that is going to be paid is the interest on the debt. That is \nour No. 1 responsibility because that will keep us from going into \ndefault, which none of us wants to do. The second thing is to pay our \nmilitary--the people who are deployed overseas, in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand the places that are supportive of those efforts. We must assure we \nare paying those people on time so their families, who are thousands of \nmiles away in other parts of our country, will know they can pay their \nrent and are not going to go into extremist positions.\n\n\n                              Military Pay\n\n  I wish to talk about a bill I have introduced that has 80 cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Heller of \nNevada to be a cosponsor of S. 724.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  S. 724 is the Ensuring Pay for Our Military Act of 2011. There are 80 \ncosponsors of this legislation. It is very simple and straightforward. \nIt ensures that in the event of a government shutdown, our Nation's men \nand women in uniform would continue to receive their military pay and \nallowances. That is what it does. This legislation will protect all \nActive-Duty men and women, including those in the Coast Guard and \nReserve components.\n  I introduced this bill earlier this year because we were in the \nprocess of having a meltdown with our appropriations. We need to have a \nlaw that assures if there is a shutdown, whether it is on an \nappropriations issue or on a budget issue or on a debt ceiling issue, \nwe know where the money will go--where the protections will be. I think \nour military should be front and center. I also think Social Security \nrecipients should be front and center, but this bill is for the \nmilitary because they are in harm's way as we speak in many places \naround the globe and we don't want to disrupt their families or have \nthem worry for 1 minute about their families while they are doing their \nduty.\n  These military families have faced stress from repeated deployments \nsince 9/11. The last thing they should worry about is not receiving \ntheir paycheck on time because Congress and the President have not been \nable to do the job they need to do.\n  Immediately after introducing this bill, I was contacted by a \nmilitary spouse. Her husband was on his 10th deployment in support of \noperations in the Middle East. The spouse was at home raising their 1-\nyear-old son. She was very concerned about whether she was going to be \nable to pay her bills. Multiply that story by many thousands and one \ncan imagine the stress of these families across our Nation who have \nloved ones in harm's way. This should not be compounded by adding an \nunnecessary financial stress that is the fault of a Congress unable to \npass an appropriations bill or a Congress and President unable to reach \nan agreement to cut our deficit so the debt ceiling will not have to be \nraised again.\n  At a time when our Nation has 100,000 troops in Afghanistan and \n45,000 in Iraq, it would be unconscionable to ask our troops to serve \non the front lines without ontime pay. From my home State of Texas, \nthere are more than 28,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \ncurrently deployed. This is second only to California in the highest \nnumber of deployed troops from one State.\n  I would like to especially recognize the soldiers from the 36th \nInfantry Division of the Texas National Guard. They are currently \nserving in the southern region of Iraq and are doing a great job. These \nbrave Texans are working long hours in the extreme heat, facing a \ndangerous enemy. But the most remarkable aspect of their service is \nthey all raised their hands to volunteer to do it. The very least we \ncan do is pay them on time. It would be tremendously damaging for \nmorale to tell our troops to go on long deployments, maybe multiple \ndeployments, away from their families, and then not pay them at the \nnormal time.\n  I know if there is one thing this Congress can agree on, it is our \ntremendous pride and support for the brave men and women in uniform. I \nthink Congress has shown that time and time again. We all learned a \nlesson after what happened during the Vietnam war and after the Vietnam \nwar, when the disagreement about the policies of the war were actually \nimputed to those who were following orders to implement that war. We \nwill never let that happen again. It hasn't happened since, and it will \nnot happen. There is not one Member of Congress who doesn't respect our \nmilitary and the service they are giving--even if they disagree with \nthe policies, which many often do. So I wasn't surprised when I \nintroduced this bill to get 80 cosponsors immediately.\n  It is becoming clear that negotiations on a long-term deficit \nreduction plan may go down to the wire. The President said yesterday he \nwill insist on tax increases to pay for a continued Federal spending \nspree. Republicans are clear: We must lower government spending to \naffordable levels, and there must be fundamental changes in how \nWashington spends the American taxpayer dollars. Now is the time for \nCongress to vote to assure that our troops will not miss a paycheck due \nto gridlock in Washington, not at midnight on August 2 or whenever we \nare adjourning, hopefully, for a recess so Members can get home and \nwork in their districts.\n  If the Senate cancels its July 4 holiday recess--which is now on the \nbooks--it is time for us to spend that time on nothing else but this \nissue--long-term deficit reduction. We should start our work by making \nsure we have a plan B that our troops and their families will not be \npolitical pawns in the struggle between raising taxes and cutting \nspending. If we are here, it should be for one purpose and one purpose \nonly; that is, debt reduction and the preparation for what happens if \nthat deadline passes and there is not an agreement.\n  I can't think of a better way to say we are preparing for the worst \nwhile we are hoping for the best, and that is that we make sure certain \nessentials are done.\n  Obviously, interest on the debt is our first obligation. The second \none is to pay our military personnel who are overseas, who are \ndeployed, and to make sure they are not worrying about their families \nat home having the money to pay the mortgage and the bills that must be \npaid on top.\n  So I hope the Senate will take up this bill, and I am going to ask \nthat we consider the Ensuring Pay for Our Military Act of 2011 is on \nthe agenda if we are in session next week. That seems to be what is in \nthe works right now. If that is the case, let's do something \nproductive. I can't think of something more productive and more \nreassuring to our military than to pass S. 724, with 80 cosponsors. If \nit comes to the floor, it is going to pass. It will go to the House, \nand I assure you it will pass.\n  So let's start that process. If we are going to be here next week and \na lot of plans are going to be disrupted, we are willing to do that. \nBut let's make it worthwhile by passing significant legislation, such \nas ensuring that our military is paid on time if for any reason we are \nlooking at a government shutdown.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Thanking Senator Hutchison\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n[[Page S4265]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while the Senator from Texas is \nstill on the floor, I just want to say how, personally, this Senator is \ngoing to miss her after the calendar year 2012, since she is retiring \nfrom the Senate. I say that with the utmost respect and affection for \nthe Senator from Texas because what a great partner she has been in \nsetting policy for this Nation's space program.\n  Had it not been for the Senator from Texas, we would not have that \npolicy etched into law in the NASA bill that we passed last year and \nwhich now is the skeletal structure that we hang all the appropriations \non going forward, giving a clear path, a clear direction, a clear \nroadmap for our Nation's space program. So I just wanted to thank the \nSenator from Texas in front of the Senate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate so much the words of the \nSenator from Florida because, of course, he is not mentioning the great \nleadership he has portrayed.\n  He is today the only Member of the Senate who has actually gone into \nspace as an astronaut, and his love for and zeal for our space \nexploration is unsurpassed, and I appreciated working with him.\n  It was our joint bill that passed last year that assures a way \nforward for NASA; that assures that there will be manned space \nexploration; that we will use the space station, in which we have \ninvested hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars, for not only health \nbenefits for our country but also learning about dark energy. The dark \nenergy and antimatter research that is being done right now, I \nwitnessed myself last week when I visited the NASA facility at the \nJohnson Space Center in Houston, TX. We are now getting information on \nthe cosmic rays that are coming into the spectrometer that has just \nbeen put on the space station by CDR Mark Kelly and his crew during the \nmost recent shuttle mission, and we are going to possibly learn the \ngenesis of the universe by this facility that was put aboard the space \nstation and the research that is going to be done on dark matter and \nwhat happens when it meets matter. It is really exciting, and I believe \nthat the way forward that Senator Nelson and I have put NASA on, I \nbelieve, is going to assure that we have private sector involvement; \nthat there will eventually be a transition to the private sector, but \nin an orderly way so that we don't lose the expertise in which we have \ninvested so much.\n  I hope later, before I leave, we will get a chance to talk about \nthat. I am looking forward to going to the last launch of the space \nshuttle that America will put up. The systems that we have had will end \nafter this last space launch that will happen in early July, and then \nwe will be in the process of building the new vehicle which we have put \nin place in the law to begin to shorten the gap between the time that \nwe can put Americans in space with our own vehicle. We are going to try \nto make that a shorter timeframe by the law that we passed.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida and look forward \nto having more opportunities to talk about the importance of space \nexploration and America's preeminence in that field.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator \nagain. We stood shoulder to shoulder and we were able to get these two \nadditional flights, which the Senator from Texas just chronicled, that \nno sooner had Mark Kelly and his crew put the alpha magnetic \nspectrometer up on the space station that it started collecting these \ncosmic rays.\n  These are subatomic particles that are flying around in space that we \ntry to duplicate down here on Earth by smacking atoms together in \naccelerators to understand subatomic particles, and we have them out \nthere being collected right now on the space station in the AMS. It was \non the station one day after they put it there. It is collecting this. \nIt is going to help us learn all the way back to the origin of the \nuniverse.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator would yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Of course.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. When I was there last week, Dr. Samuel Ting, who is \nthe Nobel laureate from MIT who built the spectrometer and talked about \nand convinced us of the importance of putting it on the space station, \nhe was there with Mark Kelly and myself, and he said they had 1 billion \nhits now of those cosmic rays and he was on a cloud, literally, about \nwhat they are learning already. Mark Kelly said, in a press conference \nthat we had, that it was the most significant achievement that he has \never made in his entire career as an astronaut. I believe he will be \nproven right, and I think Dr. Samuel Ting will be eligible for another \nNobel Prize in physics if we can really find the genesis of matter and \nantimatter in space, which he said we would; that you cannot duplicate \non Earth except by trying to put these atom smashers and electron \nsmashers on Earth but at much bigger expense than being able to do it \nin space where it just happens. Billions already, he said.\n  So thank you. I leave the floor. I know we digress, but it is very \nexciting.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Well, Mr. President, as the Senator is \nleaving, I just want to say that she and I did have to stand shoulder \nto shoulder, and we had some fights. Of course, in the process we had \nsome critics too. Now some of my critics wish that when I went into \nspace it would have been a one-way ticket. But the fact is, it was a \ntwo-way, and we stood another day. The proof is in the pudding of what \nis happening up there.\n  I will have something later to say, Mr. President, about the winddown \nof the space shuttle program. But while the Senator from Texas was \nhere, I just wanted her to know my profound gratitude for her \ncollegiality, her friendship, her expertise, and working in the way \nthis Senate ought to work, which is in a bipartisan way. I thank her \nprofoundly for that example that she set for the Senate and for this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, we are here about General Petraeus. I am a member of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee. I have had a chance to visit with \nhim on a number of occasions in his capacity as general, as well as now \nthe nominee, soon to be the new CIA Director.\n  I would simply say that I don't think for our national security's \nsake we could have two better nominees now: the former CIA Director, \nwho has been confirmed by this Senate as the new Secretary of Defense, \ntaking over from an extremely good and competent Secretary of Defense, \nSecretary Gates--and, of course, that is Leon Panetta--and then for his \nshoes, as the leader of the CIA, to be filled by General Petraeus. And \nwhat is happening today is illustrated by the modus operandi of the \ntakedown of bin Laden. It is a marriage between the intelligence \ncommunity and the military community.\n  Of course, the takedown of bin Laden was exactly that: painstaking \nyears of effort to get the intelligence, since bin Laden went dark \nafter he slipped through our fingers in Tora Bora, and we knew he was \ncommunicating by a courier. So the question was, How did we find the \ncourier? Once we identified who it was, where was he? Find him and \nfollow him. That, of course, led us to the compound, and when married \nup with all of that intelligence on what was going on at that compound, \nthen in came the U.S. military.\n  Although it was a CIA operation, as reported by the newspapers, led \nby Leon Panetta, in fact, it was a three-star admiral, a Navy SEAL, who \nconducted the actual raid from his headquarters. Of course, the SEALs \ntook care of business and did it in such a proficient, effective, and \nmagnificent way, and sequestered all of those women and children, save \nfor the one woman, as reported in the newspaper, who got caught in the \ncrossfire when the SEALs were fired at.\n  So it was an absolutely 100 percent operation, and it is illustrative \nof why this appointment of General Petraeus is so important and why the \nappointment of Leon Panetta as Secretary of Defense was so important. \nThese two are going to be just like that, as we are protecting the \nnational security for years to come.\n  That is what I want to say about General Petraeus.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak on another subject--the budget--\nso I ask consent that I speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the negotiation over this \ndeficit\n\n[[Page S4266]]\n\nreduction and the debt ceiling package has hit the critical stage. It \nis beginning to come into the consciousness of the country and most of \nthe people around here. Those people have in some cases wanted to push \nit off, in other cases have said: Oh, the debt ceiling? That is not \nsuch a big deal.\n  It is baffling that people would say that. The economic chaos that \nwould reign in this country and the world financial markets if the \nFederal Government was not able to pay all of its bills would be \ncatastrophic. How can any person in a responsible position say that?\n  But it is also baffling that there are so many people--and you know \nwho they are--who have decided to draw a line in the sand on any \ndeficit reduction and say: It is going to be my way or no way. That is \npart of the problem of what is going on in this country right now. This \nis a big, broad, diverse, complicated country. The very principle of a \nbody such as this is that you respect the other fellow's point of view. \nWhen you have differences of opinion, you try, as the Good Book says, \nto say, ``Come, let us reason together'' and to hammer out a workable \nsolution. Yet you hear the rhetoric--it is going to be their way or no \nway, so no matter whether you talk about closing corporate tax \nloopholes--no. That has to do with tax revenue. It sure does, but \ncertain people are not paying their taxes due to loopholes.\n  Two weeks ago, we acted on one of those tax loopholes overwhelmingly. \nThis Senate voted to get rid of one of those tax loopholes. It was for \ncorn ethanol, the big subsidy. It was multibillions of dollars per year \nthat was a tax credit--in other words, lost tax revenue. The Senate \nfinally realized that was not worthwhile.\n  Why are we saying we should not put that in as a part of the package \non deficit reduction? A dollar of deficit reduction is a dollar of \ndeficit reduction regardless of where it comes from, whether it comes \nfrom actually whacking Federal spending or whether it is cutting some \nof the special tax breaks for some of this country's most profitable \nmultinational corporations. The objective is to bring down the deficit.\n  What is a deficit? You have income coming in the form of tax revenue, \nyou have outflow going out in the form of expenditures, and when the \ntwo are equal, that is a balanced budget. When I came into the Senate \n11 years ago, we had 4 years of this. Tax revenue was above annual \nexpenditures, and for 4 years, we had a surplus. But this is what has \nhappened: The expenditures are up here and the tax revenue is down \nhere.\n  If you are going to get the budget eventually in balance over the \ncourse of a decade, you have to do this. That doesn't mean just tax \nincreases. It can be done by eliminating tax expenditures. Over the \nnext 10 years, tax expenditures in the existing Tax Code are $14 \ntrillion. You don't have to get rid of all of them. Some of them we \ndon't want to get rid of because they are good tax policy, they are \ngood public policy. But you can sure get rid of some of them.\n  But we have the other side over there who will not even talk about \nsome of these tax loopholes we ought to be cutting. They say that is \nincreasing taxes. Now, the truth be known, it is because most of them, \nwhether they like it or not, on that side of the aisle have taken a \npledge to a fellow named Grover Norquist and said they will not vote \nfor any new taxes, and it is being interpreted that tax expenditures--\nin other words, tax deductions, tax credits, or tax exclusions--that if \nyou close those tax loopholes, that is going to be new taxes. Well, \nthat is tax revenue that is not coming into the U.S. Treasury because \nsome special interest is getting preferential treatment that we ought \nto question. A good example of this is what we just voted on in the \nremoval of the tax subsidy for corn ethanol.\n  At the end of the day, for Americans, this debate is going to matter \nhugely. If we have to do something by just cutting expenditures and not \nremove the tax loopholes, then in order to address the deficit--\nremember, this is the deficit, this is expenditures, and this is tax \nrevenue, and if we have to bring that into balance by only moving down \nthe expenditures, we are going to have to take it out of the hide of \nretirees, out of the hide of hospitals, schools, what Senator Hutchison \nand I were just talking about, the space program, the coastal \npreservation programs, our national parks, and the Federal prisons. Are \nwe going to put an end to the narrow tax breaks for the well-connected \nor are we just going to whack all of those programs?\n  The view of this Senator is that if you really want to get a package \nthat is going to be serious and that is real money, that is not smoke \nand mirrors and budgetary sleight-of-hand, then you are going to have \nto get a package of about $4 trillion in 10 years of deficit reduction.\n  There is no reason, if you are going to be serious about budget \nreduction, that special benefits for oil companies, for pharmaceutical \ncompanies, hedge funds, and other special interests should be a sacred \ncow and not to be touched. What message does it send to the everyday \nAmerican about their government and whom that government represents if \nwe just take it out of the hides of people such as those I just \nmentioned, like retirees?\n  Basically, I suggest you take a page from one of our illustrious \nformer President, President Reagan. In 1984, the Federal Government was \nconfronted by deficits as far as the eye could see. I was a young \nCongressman at the time. President Reagan understood that it was \nappropriate to close those tax loopholes as part of the deficit \nreduction process, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 included more \nthan 60 provisions aimed at shutting down tax shelters and ending \nabusive special interest tax breaks. That 1984 bill targeted foreign \ninvestors who sought to use the offshore havens to dodge U.S. taxes, \nand it targeted Wall Street's use of financial derivatives to evade \nU.S. income tax, and it included a provision targeting the windfall \nprofits for oil companies.\n  That brings me to an example I want to discuss in some detail. For \ndecades, oil companies have been enjoying the generous tax subsidies of \nthe American taxpayer by using their ample resources to get tax \nbenefits very generously given from the Federal Government. Oil and gas \ncompanies are experts at figuring out the narrow tax break, and it \nbenefits their interest, and it does so particularly with regard to \noffshore drillers.\n  The largest of all the dedicated oil and gas tax breaks is the \nability of the oil companies to immediately expense intangible drilling \ncosts. These costs include drilling and development work completed \nbefore a well begins production. Oil companies are able to deduct--in \nother words, to write off as an expense--those costs and do so \nimmediately.\n  The tax break for intangible drilling expenses is going to cost the \nAmerican taxpayer $12.4 billion over the next decade if it is not \nrepealed. The President has proposed its repeal. Several of us in the \nSenate have proposed the repeal and have filed a bill to do it. The \nrepeal of this tax break on intangible costs for oil companies ought to \nbe included in a deficit reduction package. Remember, it is a choice: \nAre we going to cut people like retirees and the space program and \neducational expenses and the environment and the Federal prisons or are \nwe going to get tax revenue from special tax breaks like these?\n  For several years, oil companies working offshore have been devoting \nsignificant resources toward complex tax schemes to avoid paying taxes \nto Uncle Sam. Let's take a closer look.\n  Transocean, that is a name that ought to ring familiar. They were the \nones, remember, who operated the defective blowout preventer, the one \nthat did not work, that was supposed to jam the two cylinders together \nand cut off the oil flow when there was an explosion on the Deepwater \nHorizon oil rig.\n  Let's look at the record. In 1999, Transocean moved its place of \nincorporation from Delaware to the Cayman Islands. In 2008, it moved \nfrom the Cayman Islands to Switzerland. This tax-avoidance operation, \nreferred to as ``corporate inversion,'' had no real effect on where \nTransocean does business. Even after it moved to the Cayman Islands, it \ncontinued to be, in fact, managed and controlled from Houston, TX. It \ncontinues to have substantial drilling activities in American waters. \nAnd by changing its legal domicile from Delaware to a tax haven in the \nCaribbean, Transocean was able to cut its tax bill nearly in half. \nMartin Sullivan, a former economist at the Joint\n\n[[Page S4267]]\n\nCommission on Taxation, estimates that Transocean's offshore tax scheme \nsaved the company $1.9 billion from 2002 to 2009. That is an example of \none of these tax subsidies that ought to be eliminated. Congress shut \ndown those corporate inversions in 2004 but only on a going-forward \nbasis. Until Congress gets serious about taxing U.S.-managed companies \nthat deceptively claim to be foreign corporations, Transocean and \nothers will continue to benefit. Transocean is not alone. We know of at \nleast five oil companies involved in offshore drilling that moved their \nlegal domicile to a tax haven in the Caribbean in order to avoid paying \nU.S. income tax.\n\n  I will conclude by saying, unlike Transocean, BP has never been an \nAmerican corporation. But it has no problem in reaping the benefits of \nour porous Tax Code. We learned soon after the $20 billion claims \nfacility was announced that BP would be writing off the entire expense \nfor tax purposes, writing off all of that expense for the oil that was \nspilled that hurt so many of our residents in Florida and all up and \ndown the gulf coast. They are going to write that off as a tax \ndeduction, and, therefore, pay less taxes. We estimate this will reduce \nthe tax burden by nearly $9 billion for BP. Several of us have \nintroduced legislation to shut down this abusive tax break as well, and \nit is another that we ought to put in this deficit reduction package.\n  I conclude by saying these corporate tax loopholes for oil companies \nshould be part of any deficit reduction package, and this Senator is \ngoing to continue to stand up and fight to ensure they are a part of \nthat deficit reduction package.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the pending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Petraeus nomination. The Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In a few minutes we will be casting, I am sure, a 100-0 \nvote to confirm General David Petraeus as the new Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, and obviously his nomination is supported \nby all Members of the Senate, and I am sure all Americans, especially \nthose, such as the Senator from South Carolina and myself, who have had \nthe great privilege and honor of knowing General Petraeus for many \nyears and watching him lead the men and women serving in our military \nin a fashion that I have never seen surpassed. The Senator from South \nCarolina has had the unique privilege and responsibility to serve under \nGeneral Petraeus in uniform, because, as most of our colleagues know, \nthe Senator from South Carolina also serves as a colonel in the South \nCarolina National Guard and in the legal corps as a JAG officer.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has worked with General Petraeus both \nin Iraq and Afghanistan on many of the important issues concerning \ndetainees as well as other issues. Before I ask the Senator from South \nCarolina for his comments, I wish to repeat what I said before. I don't \nbelieve that in my life, which has been blessed to know many \noutstanding military leaders of all branches of the service, I have \never quite encountered a military leader or civilian leader, for that \nmatter, with the combination of charisma and intellect General Petraeus \npossesses. The Senator from South Carolina, the Senator from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, and I had the unique opportunity, among \nmany visits we made to Iraq and Afghanistan, one Fourth of July in 2007 \nto be present at a reenlistment ceremony that took place in the palace \nin Baghdad. There were a couple of thousand spectators and there were \nwell over 200 young men and women who had agreed to reenlist, to \ncontinue to serve in Iraq when they could have fulfilled their \ncommitment they made to serve in the military and gone home to their \nfamilies and a grateful nation. Instead, they chose to reenlist, to \nstay, and continue the fight. Part of that ceremony was to administer \nthe oath of citizenship to over 75 people who were not born in the \nUnited States of America, who were not citizens, who were green card \nholders, who were legally in the United States as green card holders \nbut had joined the military in order to serve and to achieve an \naccelerated path to citizenship.\n  What struck me at that ceremony was that in the front row there were \nthree empty seats with boots on them of individuals who were green card \nholders who were scheduled to take the oath of citizenship and who had \nbeen killed in the previous few days in action, serving their country \nin Iraq.\n  I was privileged to speak. The Senator from South Carolina spoke. The \nSenator from Connecticut spoke. But when General David Petraeus spoke \nto those assembled men and women who are serving their country, it was \nvery obvious of the not only respect but admiration every one of those \nyoung Americans felt for the inspirational leadership General Petraeus \nhad provided them. I might point out it was a time when most experts \nand many politicians and Members of this body predicted the surge would \nfail. Well, I think what they didn't take into account was the \nincredible leadership and implementation of a strategy that was \nembodied by GEN David Petraeus and the young men and women who are \nserving.\n  So I am confident as we continue the fight against al-Qaida and the \nradical Islamic extremists who want to attack and destroy our country, \nthat now General Petraeus, soon to be Director of the CIA, will provide \nour Nation with the very best strategy, tactics, thought, and action to \nkeep our Nation safe.\n  I don't very often come and talk about nominees and spend the \nSenate's time, but I know I express the appreciation and affection of \nall those men and women, both serving now and in the past, who had the \ngreat honor and privilege of serving under General Petraeus and to wish \nhim a well done and smooth sailing and following winds as he assumes \nhis new responsibilities which will continue to keep America safe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think our American military will be studying the \nPetraeus tactics and strategy that he implemented in Iraq and \nAfghanistan for generations to come. In January of 2007 when the surge \nwas announced, I had had the pleasure of being over in Iraq in April, \nbut I remember a letter issued by General Petraeus to all those under \nhis command and it was basically entitled ``Hard is not Hopeless.'' He \nexplained in great detail in the letter how we would move forward as a \nnation, that it would be difficult, it would be hard, but not hopeless. \nI have seen the inspiration he provides to our men and women in \nuniform, and I cannot tell you how much this country owes General \nPetraeus and his family. He has been deployed almost continuously since \n2001, but what he was able to accomplish in Iraq with the help of those \nunder his command, he will be the first to say, they deserve the \ncredit.\n  And now Afghanistan. He came into Afghanistan under very difficult \ncircumstances, losing a commander in the field. The progress in the \nlast year has been stunning. The Taliban in the south has been knocked \ndown hard. There is a 90,000 increase in the Afghan national security \nforces. We have a new training program to train Afghan security forces, \nand I think it will pay great dividends.\n  To the President, you have chosen wisely in picking David Petraeus to \nbe the Director of the CIA.\n  I am confident Director Petraeus will do as good a job for the \ncountry as General Petraeus, and that is saying a lot. Following Leon \nPanetta, who did a great job, we are in good hands as a nation. I don't \nbelieve any single person understands the threats America faces better \nthan General Petraeus. At the CIA he will have a chance to take the \nfight to the enemy in a different way. We will not have available \nforever 100,000 troops to be used in theaters of battle.\n  We are going to bring our troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan. I \nhope we do it smartly based on conditions. But this fight is morphing \ninto other countries, Yemen, Somalia, the Horn of Africa, and the \nNation is playing a more crucial role in our Nation's defense than at \nany time in the history of the CIA. We will be blessed to have\n\n[[Page S4268]]\n\nDavid Petraeus to be Director of the CIA. He understands the threats. I \nthink he will be able to marshal the resources of the CIA to keep the \nenemies on their heels and to reinforce to our allies that we are a \nreliable partner and to our enemies there is no place you can hide. \nThere is no passage of time that will keep you safe from American \njustice.\n  I hope the Congress--I know Senator Chambliss will, the Senate in \nparticular--will listen to General Petraeus, who will soon be Director \nPetraeus, about how to make sure the CIA is equipped and funded to take \non the enemy. In this war on terror, we are fighting an idea. There is \nno capital to conquer, there is no air force to down, there is no navy \nto sink. We are battling an idea. And the way we ultimately become safe \nis to empower those who have the will to fight the terrorists in their \nbackyard to provide them with the capacity to let the terrorists \norganizations know we will follow you to the gates of hell, that we \nwill never relent. The CIA and the brave men and women who serve in \nthat organization are becoming the tip of the spear in this battle. \nWhat happened in Somalia yesterday, what is going to happen in the \nfuture in Yemen and Somalia is a direct result of good intelligence and \nnational will.\n  To Senator McCain and those who have gotten to know General Petraeus, \nI can assure you that President Obama chose wisely. This is the perfect \njob for David Petraeus to take up for the Nation. He has the \nunderstanding of the threats we face and the CIA is the platform we \nwill be using against the enemy more effectively than any other \nplatform I know.\n  With that, I look forward to casting my vote for Director of the CIA \nDavid Petraeus, and I hope everybody in this body will provide a vote \nof confidence to General Petraeus.

Mr. President, I regret that our colleagues have \nobjected to a consent request to go to some of the most critical issues \nthe country is facing--to have the Finance Committee meet on trade \nagreements that could expand markets and ultimately create jobs in \nAmerica, and that is what we need in America--to create jobs. On the \nquestion of whether there\n\n[[Page S4269]]\n\nshould be a limited use of force, the Congress, and particularly the \nSenate, should speak, and not being able to do that is pretty amazing \nto me. So I hear a lot about wanting to get the people's work done, but \nthen I hear objections to trying to move to get it done. It is pretty \noutrageous.\n  I came originally to the floor after this vote to thank President \nObama for, yesterday, calling and echoing my call to end subsidies for \nBig Oil. It is a call that received a bipartisan vote in the Senate, a \nbipartisan majority vote in the Senate, but, of course, it did not pass \nbecause of our colleagues' insistence on a filibuster or a \nsupermajority amount. But it is time that our friends on the other side \nof the aisle put the interests of taxpayers ahead of Big Oil and allow \nthese wasteful subsidies to finally end.\n  As the President said, we have strategies to reduce the deficit, such \nas my legislation to cut oil subsidies, that are already introduced and \nready to go. All we have to do is pass it. A vote to allow that to \nhappen is a simple choice for everyone in this Chamber: Are you on the \nside of working-class families and seniors or are you on the side of \nBig Oil?\n  There are lots of ways to cut the deficit, but saving taxpayer \nsubsidies for Big Oil while ending Medicare as we know it and cutting \nstudent loans is not, in my mind, a solution. It makes no sense to give \na taxpayer-funded subsidy to the big five oil companies, which are \nearning $12 billion in profits a month--they are going to earn about \n$144 billion in profits this year alone--and say to families: Oh, no, \nyou have to sacrifice even more.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle would tell a middle-class \nstudent whose family earns a median family income of about a little \nover $50,000 that, no, you cannot go to college, you cannot get a Pell \ngrant from the Federal Government, but ExxonMobil, a company that will \nearn $42.6 billion in profits this year, needs government assistance. \nAnd they will continue to come to the floor and look Americans in the \neye and say that somehow is commonsense deficit reduction. There simply \nis no commonsense explanation for balancing the budget on the backs of \nworking families and letting multibillion-dollar oil companies keep \nbillions in taxpayer dollars.\n  We have this debate about the deficit and how we deal with the debt \nceiling, but we don't seem to want to have the shared sacrifice of \nhaving the special interests in this country, whether it is Big Oil or \nethanol, which had a huge bipartisan vote here in the Senate--that they \nshould not face any consequences but that, in fact, middle-class \nworking families should.\n  We all know oil companies are among the largest, most profitable \ncompanies in the world, but it is hard to understand the scale of their \nwealth. This chart shows it clearly. This is the median income for \nfamilies in this country, and this is Big Oil's profit.\n  Whose side are you on?\n  This is about closing loopholes and, given the current budget \nclimate, you would think we would all be for closing those loopholes.\n  Let me give an example of what one of those loopholes is. Under the \nlaw as it exists today, we allow the big five oil companies to go to \nother countries in the world and say to them: You know, tax us in a way \nthat we can ultimately reduce our obligations in the United States.\n  U.S. taxpayers are taxed on their income worldwide but are entitled \nto a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for any income they pay to a foreign \ngovernment, which makes sense because we don't want to tax our \ncompanies twice. But U.S. oil and gas companies have very smart lawyers \nand accountants. They figured out that if they go to a foreign \ngovernment, such as Indonesia, and say: Don't charge me a license fee \nor a royalty, which is what we do in the United States to permit these \ncompanies to explore on Federal lands and waters for oil and gas--no, \nthey say to Indonesia and other countries: Charge me a tax. Why? \nBecause then I can take all of that tax--which really is a license fee \nbut is now paid as a tax--and I can deduct it back here in the United \nStates. What does that mean? That means American taxpayers are \nsubsidizing foreign oil production. That is not in the national \ninterest of the United States, it is not in the interest of taxpayers \nin the United States, and it is not about shared sacrifice when we are \ntalking about how to deal with the deficit and debt in this country. \nJust closing that loophole would mean $6.5 trillion to the Treasury \nthat could be applied directly to deficit reduction.\n  As a matter of fact, I am only talking about closing two loopholes \nfor the big five oil companies, which are going to make $144 billion in \nprofit. Just closing those two loopholes would save the U.S. taxpayer \n$21 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Now, some of my friends on the other side of the aisle say: Oh, if \nyou do that to those poor oil companies, they are just going to raise \nthe price of gasoline. That is simply not true. First of all, we are \ntalking about $21 billion over 10 years or roughly $2 billion a year. \nSo those poor oil companies, if they would only make $142 billion in \nprofits this year instead of $144 billion in profits this year, would \nnot have to raise gas prices. They are making $142 billion a year, so \nthey certainly don't need to raise gas prices. And we certainly don't \nneed to incentivize their exploration because they are making record \nprofits in this country and in the world. They don't need us to \nincentivize them when they are making $144 billion in profits. So let's \nsave the taxpayers that $21 billion and put it directly to deficit \nreduction.\n  Only in Washington would my Republican friends suggest that stopping \nthose subsidies to Big Oil is somehow going to be a tax increase. Only \nin Washington could ending $21 billion in subsidies to the big five oil \ncompanies--we are not even talking about the independents--that are \ngoing to make $144 billion in profits this year--somehow be a tax \nincrease. Yet we can take away Pell grants or cut seniors under \nMedicare or the poor under Medicaid, and that is OK. Well, something is \nwrong with that vision of America.\n  To back up my point that the argument is simply fallacious, you need \nto look no further than the definitive report by the CRS that explains \nthat my proposal to end oil subsidies will not lower the production of \noil and will not raise gasoline prices.\n  So, Mr. President, you drive up to the pump, you pay nearly $4 a \ngallon already, which has a real impact on your family and on your \nincome, and it has a real impact on your choices and has a real impact \non food prices and has a real impact in so many areas, and yet we are \nstill supposed to give the oil companies another $21 billion in tax \nbreaks from the American taxpayers.\n  It is time to stand for the people's interests, not the special \ninterests. It is time to end these tax breaks. It is time to put it as \na revenue source into our challenges in terms of meeting our debt and \ndealing with our deficit, and our proposal would do exactly that.\n  I don't know how you can look the American people in the eye and say: \nWe are going to cut so many things that are going to affect your life, \nbut on this issue we are going to keep Big Oil whole. We will not touch \na penny from their pockets. That is fundamentally wrong, and the \nAmerican people know it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nenter into a colloquy with my colleagues for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. First of all, I am happy to hear that our \nDemocratic colleagues agree to allow us to come back next week and not \ngo on a recess. It is important that we start work on the single \ngreatest issue, the single most important issue facing this Nation--our \ndebt and deficit issue.\n  A couple of minutes ago, I objected to what the leadership wanted to \nmove to, which was an important debate on Libya, but it is not \naddressing what we need to address. The fact is that in the Senate this \nyear--we have been here 6 months, and we have not passed a budget. As a \nmatter of fact, we have not passed a budget in the Senate for over 2 \nyears. We have missed all of the budget deadlines. We should have \npassed a budget by April 15. Appropriations bills should have been \ncompleted by June 10. We are simply not addressing the single greatest \nissue facing this country--that we are bankrupting America. Only six \nbills have been\n\n[[Page S4270]]\n\npassed in the Senate that have actually become law. Three of those were \ncleaning up last year's business. They were continuing resolutions \nfunding the government, when what should have happened a year ago is \nthose bills should have already been passed. President Obama's budget \nthat he sent over here in January was so unserious that actually it \nlost 0 to 97 in the Senate. Not a single Democratic Senator voted for \nthat budget.\n  We have an awful lot of work to do. Our budget deficit this year--the \nhighest estimate I have heard is about $1.65 trillion. We have incurred \nover $4 trillion in just the last 3 years. If anybody in America wants \nto understand why our economy is in a coma, it is exactly that. People \nlook to Washington and they see how reckless and out of control our \nspending is.\n  As a former manufacturer, as somebody who made investments and \ncreated jobs, I realize that when the Federal Government is spending so \nmuch money that it doesn't have, eventually the Federal Government is \ngoing to take in the form of higher taxes, possibly in the form of \nhigher inflation.\n  The other thing that is overhanging the economy that is preventing \njob creation is overregulation. I cannot tell you how many Wisconsin \nbusinesspeople come into our office and talk about that regulation or \nthis regulation that one of the agencies is trying to impose on them.\n  One thing that is interesting about many of these regulations is they \nare not being implemented. Just like the health care law; over 3 \nmillion waivers have been granted. Why is that? I believe it is because \nthis administration actually understands that if they implement the \nhealth care law and these regulations--they understand exactly the \nharmful effect that will have on our economy and on job creation.\n  The fact is, what this administration has done--they came into office \nwith a tough situation, no doubt about it, but their actions--passing \nthe health care law, the 1,600-page Dodd-Frank financial bill--have \nmade job creation far harder. They have made the situation far worse.\n  I think Senator Rand Paul has a few things to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Johnson. I come to the \nfloor in support of this movement, which is that we should be talking \nabout what America says we should be talking about--the debt.\n  Yesterday, the President went on national television and chastised \nCongress. He said to Congress that Members of Congress need to cancel \nthings. Do you know what. I agree. I am here today, though, Mr. \nPresident. Where are you?\n  My understanding is that the President is campaigning and has a \nfundraiser in Philadelphia tonight. I don't believe he is here tackling \nthe Nation's problems today. He could send us the Vice President, but I \ndon't think he is here either. I think he is in Las Vegas campaigning \ntonight.\n  This is a two-way street. If he is going to go on television and \nchastise us for not doing work--we are saying we want to be working on \nthe Nation's problems; we are here saying the Nation's debt is a \nproblem; his administration has said the No. 1 national security threat \nwe face is the debt--where is the President? Campaigning.\n  We are here, Mr. President. We will have an offer. We don't want to \nraise the debt ceiling. We don't want more debt. Do you know what. As \nRepublicans, for the good of the country, we are willing to raise the \ndebt but only--and I repeat ``only''--if we have significant budgetary \nreform.\n  We have to balance the budget by law. Force Congress to do it by \nchanging the Constitution. It is the only way it will ever change. \nThere is a pathology here. The pathology is that we do not have a \nspine. We are spineless and cannot do what it takes to cut the \nspending, and we will only get there if we change the Constitution.\n  So, Mr. President, we are here. We are here, and we welcome you to \ncome back to town in between fundraisers and talk about how we would \nfix this. But we would fix this by saying: Yes, we will raise the debt \nceiling, contingent upon a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. Seventy-five percent of the public is in favor of saying \nwe have to balance our budget. Let's come back and discuss what the \nAmerican people want.\n  I commend Senator Johnson for leading this fight, and I think this is \njust the beginning. But I don't plan on saying we should go to any \nother subject until we have addressed the debt ceiling.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I totally agree with my colleague from \nKentucky, and I believe Senator Rubio has a few words to add to that.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I thank Senator Johnson, and I too yesterday watched the \nPresident's lecture on television. I watched it again this morning just \nto make sure I was well informed before I came here.\n  My reaction is twofold. One, I am disappointed, and the other is I \nwas alarmed. First, I am disappointed because America does not have a \ntradition of class warfare. It has never been a part of our Nation. In \nfact, one of the things that distinguishes us from the world is \nAmericans have never believed that somehow we have to take money away \nfrom somebody else in order to be better off. On the contrary, we have \nalways looked to advance the cause of everyone in the belief we can all \nbe prosperous and in the hopes of growing our economy that way. That is \nthe American tradition, and that has served our Nation well.\n  Unfortunately, you wouldn't know that from the speech yesterday--the \nrhetoric that, quite frankly, was deeply disappointing. The idea that \nif we raise taxes, as the President said yesterday, on millionaires and \nbillionaires, raise taxes on oil companies, raise taxes on owners of \nprivate jets, that will somehow make a difference in America's debt in \nterms of having a real impact, is not only misleading, it is, quite \nfrankly, disappointing. It is class warfare and the kind of language \nyou would expect from the leader of a Third World country, not the \nPresident of the United States.\n  I am also alarmed and worried about the speech because I think from \nit you can take only two things. Either the President doesn't truly \nunderstand the nature of the problem we face or he has decided this is \na political issue and not a policy one. I say perhaps he doesn't \nunderstand the nature of the case because, for example, he mentioned \nthe corporate jet tax six different times. Yet the impact that would \nhave is so insignificant, the White House, to this moment, cannot give \nan estimate of what that means in terms of a dollar figure. Going \nfurther, by the way, it is important to note that exact tax provision \nwas part of the President's now infamous stimulus plan that passed in \nFebruary of 2009.\n  The bigger problem, though, is maybe the President fundamentally \ndoesn't understand how jobs are created. Politicians don't create jobs. \nU.S. Senators don't create jobs. Senator Johnson pointed out that jobs \nare created by everyday people from all walks of life who start a \nbusiness or expand an existing one. Our job in government is to make it \neasier for them to do that, not harder. Threatening to raise taxes, \nthreatening to wage class warfare does not accomplish that purpose.\n  Here is what I would suggest to the President. I would suggest we \nhave done this before as a people in America--things such as a simpler \nTax Code; people around here are in favor of tax reform; simpler tax \nreform; a manageable and sane regulatory environment and, of course, a \ngovernment that doesn't spend money it doesn't have. These things have \nworked before and they will work again, and I urge the President to \nlead us in that direction.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I thank the Senator from Florida for those \ncomments, and I want to pick up on one point the Senator just made \nabout class warfare.\n  Certainly, as a job creator myself of 31, 32 years, I know an awful \nlot about entrepreneurs, and I have to point out how incredibly \ndispiriting it is to have leaders in Washington attack you day in and \nday out, demonize you, when all you are trying to do is make a good \nlife for yourself, your family, and provide solid employment for other \ngood Americans.\n  So, again, I need to point out class warfare does not work. It does \nnothing--it does nothing--to help improve our economy.\n  Senator Lee.\n  Mr. LEE. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n[[Page S4271]]\n\n  There is no issue that is more important or more pressing for the \nAmerican people than this one right now, where we have reached a point \nwhere our debt-to-GDP ratio is about 95 percent. Our economy can't long \nendure that kind of borrowing. It has an effect that will result in an \nestimated loss of about 1 million jobs a year for each year we remain \nabove the 90-percent, debt-to-GDP ratio. We simply can't endure that, \nand the American people can't endure that.\n  We need to increase revenues. The only way to increase revenues is to \nallow the economy to recover. That won't happen as long as we keep \nborrowing more and more money while doing nothing to control the \nunderlying problem--the systemic problem that requires a structural \nreform.\n  The American people understandably, justifiably, and very correctly \nare demanding that before we raise the Nation's debt limit yet again, \nbefore we extend yet another credit card for the United States of \nAmerica, we commit to some kinds of cuts. Future borrowing requires us \nto make future cuts. The problem with that is the moment that debt is \nactually used up, the moment it is incurred, the American people are \nunder an obligation. But if we make a promise today that we are going \nto cut, let's say, $2 trillion or $3 trillion or $4 trillion over the \nnext 10 or 12 or 14 or 15 years, that is a promise we can't make. That \nis a promise we can't really commit to because this Congress, the one \nthat sits right now, will not be the same Congress that convenes in \nJanuary of 2013 or January of 2015 or in future years.\n  We have to make changes right now. The only way we can commit to \nfuture cuts, to future structural reforms--the only way we can bind \nfuture Congresses--is by amending the U.S. Constitution to change the \nway we spend money, to limit spending as a percentage of GDP, and to \nrequire a supermajority to spend more than we have or to raise taxes.\n  That is what we are demanding. We are willing to work and to come to \nthe table on the debt limit, but we demand some kind of solution that \nwill put us on course toward sanity. That is why we are here.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I thank the Senator.\n  Senator Ayotte.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I thank my colleagues. I think those who are watching \nthis will see we are new Senators back here in the back corner of the \nSenate. As a new Member of this Chamber, I am deeply disappointed by \nthe lack of work that we have been doing in the Senate. The majority \nleader has put us in a position where we haven't been focusing on the \nfiscal crisis that is facing our Nation right now, when we look at the \nfact it has been 792 days since we have had a budget.\n  I was so excited as a new member of the Budget Committee to roll up \nmy sleeves and get together and put out a responsible blueprint for \nthis country. Unfortunately, we were told by the majority leader that \nwould be foolish--to put together a responsible blueprint for this \ncountry and to do the work of the Budget Committee.\n  One of the reasons I came to the Senate is I am tired of business as \nusual. I know my freshman colleagues back here share that. I am the \nmother of two children--I know the President mentioned his children \nyesterday--but if we care about our children and the future of this \ncountry, we owe it to our children to not continue to kick the can down \nthe road. We should be in the Senate today and next week talking about \nhow we are going to put together a blueprint that makes sure that we do \nnot continue to borrow from countries such as China; that we do not \ncontinue to enslave our children with the debt this country is \naccumulating.\n  We know if we do not address this, the greatest country in the world \nwill go bankrupt. I, for one, want to follow through on the American \npromise that we have always made to the next generation, which is that \nwe will leave them with a better country. That is so threatened right \nnow with what is happening in Washington.\n  I share with my colleague, Senator Johnson, the belief we should be \naddressing nothing next week but spending and debt. We have the debt \nceiling vote coming up, so why aren't we rolling up our sleeves right \nnow, working on a solution with real spending reforms and putting those \nhandcuffs on Congress that we know we need, such as a balanced budget \namendment, spending caps, and a budget for our country that reduces \nspending so we don't have to have this continuing resolution situation.\n  We do not have a tax problem in this country, we have a spending \nproblem. We need to create a positive climate for our private sector \nand do the hard work in Washington--the same way our families do--and \nlive within our means. So I think next week we should be doing the work \nthat needs to be done.\n  Mr. President, you called on us yesterday to work. We are here \nworking. The only financial and fiscal blueprint that you have \noffered--your budget for 2012--did not even get one vote from a member \nof your party in this Chamber. This budget blueprint would have added \nanother $14 trillion to our debt.\n  So I say to our President: We are willing to roll up our sleeves and \nget to work with you to avert this looming fiscal crisis, but where is \nyour plan that will reduce spending and get us on a responsible fiscal \npath to preserving the greatest country in the world?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I thank Senator Ayotte.\n  Senator Vitter.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank Senator Johnson, and I am honored to join him and \nall our colleagues here to echo the same important message. Everyone \nknows--everyone paying attention across the country knows--our greatest \nchallenge is out-of-control spending and debt. Everyone knows we face a \nmounting crisis and an important deadline in terms of the debt limit. \nSo when are we going to face these crucial issues, the top challenges \nwe face as a country? When are we going to face them squarely, \ndirectly, constructively on the floor of the Senate? It is just that \nsimple. Let's get to the important matter at hand. Let's debate in a \nconstructive way and let's vote on proposals to curb spending and debt.\n  Yesterday, we stood together, under Senator Johnson's leadership, and \nsaid just that. We said we are going to block any effort to go into a \nrecess or a pro forma session next week--the July 4 recess. We have \ndone that. We have successfully blocked that recess, and we did that \nbecause we need to roll up our sleeves. We need to go to work, not go \non vacation, and deal with this crucial challenge of spending and debt.\n  Interestingly, President Obama, in many ways, said the same thing \nyesterday. He chastised Congress and said: You need to go to work, not \ngo on vacation, and address this crucial issue. Well, great. We have \nsucceeded in canceling that recess. That is a first important step. But \nwhy are we continuing to try to move to every other issue under the Sun \nexcept the biggest challenge our country faces? Why don't we face this \nissue, debate it in a constructive way?\n  Senator Reid, why don't you put measures on the floor that directly \naddress this issue?\n  With that in mind, those of us who joined together yesterday to block \nour July 4 recess have written Senator Reid a letter today, and I think \nit summarizes our point and our position very clearly, so I will read \nit. It is not long.\n\n       Dear Leader Reid:\n       Yesterday we came together to make it clear that we believe \n     the Senate should not go on vacation while our country goes \n     bankrupt. We vowed to block any recess or pro forma session \n     next week.\n       We're glad you have accepted that reality. But let's not be \n     in session just to try to fool the American people into \n     thinking the Senate is working on the Nation's fiscal crisis. \n     Let's actually begin a constructive debate on the biggest \n     challenge our country faces--spending and debt.\n       With that goal, we write to ask a few simple fundamental \n     questions: When will you put serious bills on the floor to \n     directly address spending and debt?\n       The Budget Act of 1974 requires the Senate Budget Committee \n     to mark up a budget by April 15th, and tomorrow will mark the \n     793rd day since the Democratic-led Senate has passed a budget \n     and the 11th week since missing that deadline this year. When \n     will the Budget Committee meet to mark up a budget proposal, \n     and when will you put such a proposal on the floor?\n       The American people want us to enact meaningful, effective \n     spending caps. When will you put a spending cap bill on the \n     floor?\n       We clearly need the enforced discipline of a balanced \n     budget constitutional amendment. This measure failed by a \n     single vote last time it was debated on the floor of the \n     Senate. When will you put a balanced budget amendment on the \n     floor?\n       We await your response and your leadership.\n\n\n[[Page S4272]]\n\n\n  So, again, Mr. President, to summarize, we banded together yesterday \nand said: As the country goes bankrupt, we shouldn't go on vacation. We \nare going to block any recess, any pro forma session next week. And we \ndid. But we did it to turn to this challenge: to debate spending and \ndebt in a constructive way, to have votes on that, not to continue to \navoid the issue and turn to every other issue under the Sun.\n  So through the Chair, I would again ask Senator Reid, why don't we \nturn to this most important challenge of our country. Please put \nserious bills on the Senate floor that directly address spending and \ndebt. Let's get on with the people's work.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I thank Senator Vitter.\n  Senator Sessions.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Johnson for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  As the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, I share my \ncolleagues' disappointment that we have not functioned. It is good to \nsee Senator Ayotte and Senator Johnson, who are members of that \ncommittee. We worked hard to get prepared some weeks ago on the \nassumption that the Senate would meet its statutorily required duty; \nthat is, to produce a budget.\n  I am holding up title 2, section 632 of the United States Code, and \nit is the Budget Act. It requires that the Congress annually produce a \nbudget. We have now gone 792 days without a budget.\n  The first line of the act is: On or before April 15 of each year, \nCongress shall complete action on a concurrent resolution on the budget \nfor the fiscal year beginning October 1 for the next fiscal year.\n  We haven't done that. It also says we should meet by April 1.\n  Senator Conrad, our Budget chairman, Democratic chairman and able, \nexperienced chairman, was prepared to go forward. It is pretty clear to \nme that the majority leader decided we shouldn't have a budget process.\n  Last year, the Budget Committee produced a budget out of committee, \nbut the majority leader failed to bring it up for vote on the floor. As \nthe leader, he has the power generally to control that fact and was \nable to do so. This year, he said it would be foolish to have a budget; \nand, basically, we would not even meet in committee to have a budget.\n  So we are facing the most serious systemic debt crisis in our \nNation's history. The numbers are so serious and our path is so \nunacceptable that it is clearly the No. 1 issue of our time.\n  The Chairman of President Obama's debt commission gave a written \nstatement to the Budget Committee that said this Nation has never faced \na more predictable economic crisis. When asked, Erskine Bowles, \nPresident Clinton's Chief of Staff, said it could be 2 years, a little \nbefore, a little after.\n  What I am saying is, these individuals, particularly the ones who \njust finished a campaign, traveled all over their State, talked to \nhundreds of thousands, millions of people in their State, got a feel \nfor it. They are bringing new vitality and new insight into what is \nhappening, and what is happening is nothing. Six months have gone by, \nand we have not had any hearings, we have not had any votes on the \nfloor. We haven't seen any legislation. So I think this is an \nunacceptable method. I think it undermines the classic constitutional \nduty of Congress to appropriate money and deal with taxes.\n  It is our responsibility. But have you observed mayors who say: I am \nnot going to present a budget to city council. I am going to let them \ndecide. Do you see Governors not presenting budgets to the State \nlegislatures and then fight for what they believe in? Look what is \nhappening with Governor Christie, Governor Cuomo in New York, Governor \nBrown in California, Governor Bentley in Alabama.\n  It helps to have that one single person elected to represent \neverybody, to provide some impetus, and it is astounding to me that we \nhaven't seen that from the majority leader in the Senate or from the \nPresident. He submitted a budget but then backed away from it and it \nwas voted down 97 to 0 on the floor just a few weeks ago, but it was \nnever seriously considered.\n  So what are we looking to do? We are heading to a time where we may \nbe asked in a few hours to vote on a monumental multitrillion-dollar \ndeal to raise the debt limit of the United States. What will be in it? \nWill we be changing the trajectory of our Nation or will it be business \nas usual? We are not going to have time to review it. That should be on \nthe floor now. People should be standing and casting votes right now. \nHow much do you want to increase taxes? Do you? Which ones? How much do \nyou want to cut? Where?\n  Let's have the vote down here. That is what we should be doing. I \nthink it will help the American people understand how serious our \nproblem is, and what it will take to get out of it. It is much more \nserious and our problem is greater than most people realize.\n  I thank my colleagues for their good comments and the enthusiasm they \nhave brought and the passion they have brought to this critical issue.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I thank Senator Sessions. I will point out \nthat business as usual here in Washington is bankrupting America.\n  Senator Vitter.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank Senator Johnson.\n  I am glad our Republican freshmen did not get the memo that they were \nsupposed to be seen but not heard. It is exciting for this old dusty \nestablishment when the people who just walked in the door are the ones \nwho are leading it. So I thank all the freshmen who are sitting here.\n  Washington is addicted to spending, and the ``addict in chief'' is \nPresident Obama. He has promised many times to quit, to quit spending, \nto live within our means, but he keeps falling off the wagon. Now, for \nthe fourth time since he has been President, he is asking Congress to \nrefill the bottle so he can keep spending and keep borrowing and keep \nincreasing America's debt.\n  Members of the Senate often brag about the fact that we have the \npower of the purse. Part of that power is to pass laws to limit how \nmuch the administration can borrow. It has been a tradition. But both \nparties over the years have consistently blown through that legal debt \nlimit and increased it whenever we wanted another drink.\n  The debt limit is supposed to be a stop sign, to stop the \nadministration from spending more than we can afford as a nation. \nInstead, they have turned it into a green light, where we can just \nspeed through and continue to pour more and more debt onto our \nchildren.\n  But now we have gone from it being just a wink and a nod, where we \nbrag about how much bacon we take home to we are at the point where we \ncould seriously lose our Nation. I think Americans sense that \neverywhere.\n  Congressmen and politicians constantly exaggerate and cry wolf, but I \nthink there is a sense all across America that goes beyond partisanship \nto real worry. That is what I hear everywhere I go.\n  People somehow intuitively know that if we have debt almost the size \nof our economy and projecting to even double that over the next 10 \nyears, what they see on TV in Greece and around the world of countries \nliterally coming unglued could very well happen much quicker than we \nthink in the United States.\n  We have over $14 trillion in debt. We know the President is not \nserious about quitting this spending binge because the budget he sent \nus practically doubles that. As we have gone through these last few \nmonths of talking about raising the debt limit once again, we have not \ngotten one proposal from the President to deal with this issue. He has \nplayed dozens of rounds of golf and had many fundraisers around the \ncountry, but he has been AWOL on this issue.\n  So not only has he added over $3 trillion of debt since he became \nPresident, he has been missing in action when it comes to actually \ndealing with it. His condescending speech yesterday that told Congress \nto solve the problem ignored the fact that he was elected as President \nto lead. Yet he is not even following when it comes to this issue.\n  We do have a spending addiction, and the only way we are going to \nstop it and keep our country from going over the cliff is if we have a \nconstitutional requirement that we have to stop spending more than we \nare borrowing.\n  Outside Washington that doesn't sound as if it is an extraordinary \nthing to say. But here last week, one of the\n\n[[Page S4273]]\n\nDemocratic Senators called me extreme for suggesting we needed to \nbalance our budget. American families have to do it, businesses have to \ndo it, 49 States have to do it, and sometimes it is painful. But we \ndon't have to do it here. The reason we have an unlimited government is \nthat we have unlimited spending in Congress.\n  We are at a point where we have to make a decision. We have obligated \nourselves to borrow more money. We don't have a good choice at this \npoint. But if we are going to give the President more money to spend to \nmeet obligations he has already made, we have to make sure this is the \nend of this spending addiction. The only way for that to happen is if \nwe in Congress give the people of the United States, and the 50 States, \nthe opportunity to decide for themselves if they want their Federal \nGovernment to have a balanced budget.\n  That is what our condition is. We will help the President deal with \nthis debt ceiling, but he is going to have to agree with us, and so \nwill the Democratic Party, that we are going to send to the States a \nbalanced budget amendment that the States can ratify. Five years after \nthey ratify it, this Federal Government must be in balance.\n  If we can't do that, if we can't make that commitment to the American \npeople that we are going to stop this addiction, stop bankrupting our \ncountry, then we are going to have to go through the pain we have \ncaused ourselves, along with this President, when we don't raise that \ndebt limit.\n  We need the help of Americans today because the people in Congress do \nnot have the willpower to do what I just said. We need millions of \nAmericans to call us and e-mail us and tell the President and tell \nMembers of Congress that this debt limit should not be raised again, \never, unless we permanently solve this problem for the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator has used the 30 \nminutes of the colloquy.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, 2 minutes is granted.\n  Mr. VITTER. This is very little to ask this Congress to do--to agree, \nwithin 6 or 8 years, to do the hard work to balance our budget in \nreturn for giving the President more authority to borrow more money.\n  We owe it to the American people to let them decide for themselves \nand let the States ratify it. This is a huge decision. All we are \nasking our Democratic colleagues to do is to let America decide if we \nshould have a balanced budget. Let America decide if it is a radical, \nextreme idea that we live within our means and stop spending more than \nwe are bringing in. I know how America is going to answer that \nquestion, and that is why I want to give them the chance to answer it.\n  Mr. President, you have the money you need to meet our obligations, \nbut once and for all we need to mean what we say and stop spending this \ncountry into bankruptcy.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I thank Senator Vitter for his leadership \non this issue. It is the most important issue facing this Nation.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues for joining me and for the leadership \nthey have shown as well.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today with the \nsenior Senator from Colorado to talk about these important issues. The \nfirst thing I want to talk about is the debt ceiling itself. People at \nhome are asking me constantly: Michael, what in the world is going on \nback there? We are dealing with our budget at the local level, we are \ndealing with our budget at the State level, we are making choices that \nare not popular and are not easy to make but we are moving ahead and \nmaking decisions in our businesses and making decisions at home. We are \nmoving ahead. What is wrong with Washington, DC?\n  Part of the problem in this place is that people are not just \nentitled, it seems, to their own opinions, they are also entitled to \ntheir own set of facts. I think when you are getting paid by the \ntaxpayer you have an obligation to actually not play with your own set \nof facts but to come out here and say what the facts are.\n  What the facts are on the debt ceiling, the debt ceiling and the \nvote, is that this is not a case of deciding as you are sitting at the \nkitchen table and you are spending too much and so you are going to cut \nup your credit card. I would be for that. That is not what we are \ntalking about here. This is about bills that have already been incurred \nby the United States. These are debts already owed by the United \nStates. What this is about is not cutting up your credit card, it is \nabout sitting at home and saying: You know what, I didn't budget very \nwell last month, I didn't budget very well last year, so even though I \nwatched cable happily all year long, I am not going to pay my cable \nbill this month. I am not going to do it. Even though I lived in this \nhouse all year, I am not going to make my mortgage payment this month. \nI am not going to do it.\n  That is not fiscally responsible for a family to do and it is not \nfiscally responsible for the Federal Government to do.\n  At home, if you do that what you discover is that your mortgage rate \ngoes through the roof because the bank says to you: Michael Bennet, you \ndid not pay your mortgage last month and I am not going to lend you \nmoney on the same terms that I lent you money before because you are a \nlousy risk. That is exactly what this is about. It is not about new \nmoney. It is important for everybody to understand that because if we \ndo not raise the debt limit and we say to the creditors of the United \nStates you are not getting paid--not to mention our veterans and our \nseniors and the men and women who are fighting in Afghanistan--but to \nour bondholders, you are not going to get paid, they are going to raise \nour interest rates, and every percentage point increase in our interest \nrate is going to drive us 1.3 trillion more dollars into debt. There \nare people coming out here saying it is the fiscally responsible thing \nto do, not to raise the debt ceiling when, if we do not, we are going \nto have $1.3 trillion more of debt to pay and the interest on that debt \nand nothing to show for it.\n  It is not surprising to me that, Washington being Washington, there \nare people who see this as an opportunity to create leverage over \nthings, to have a negotiation about the direction of this country. I \nunderstand that. I believed for a very long time that we have to get \nhold of our deficit and our debt. We have a $1.5 trillion deficit. We \nhave almost $15 trillion of debt on our balance sheet. I think we have \na moral obligation not to constrain the choices of our kids and \ngrandchildren.\n  I have 3 kids of my own who are 11, 10 and 6. One of them heard me \nsay that during a townhall meeting and she followed me out to the \nsidewalk and she said: Daddy?\n  This is Caroline, the oldest, and I said: What?\n  She said: Just to be clear--\n  She was making fun of me because I use that expression sometimes.\n  She said: Just to be clear, I am not paying that back.\n  That is the right attitude for her to have. We need to be advocates \nfor Caroline Bennet and all the kids living across this country, not \njust to be fiscally responsible, which we need to be, not just asking \nwhat we are going to cut, which we need to do, but also prioritizing \nwhat we are spending to make sure we are maintaining the American \ndream, to make sure we are honoring the legacy of our parents and \ngrandparents and their parents and grandparents and honoring our \nnational creed.\n  It is our job, not as Senators but as Americans, to provide more \nopportunity, not less, to the people who are coming after us, and the \ndebt and deficit is a huge piece of that. But, you know what, it is not \nthe only thing. I lie awake at night worrying about the fact that if \nyou are poor in this country it is hard for you to get a decent \neducation. If you are born into a ZIP Code that is defined by poverty \nin the United States, your chances of graduating with a college degree \nin the 21st century in the greatest country in the world are 9 in 100. \nThat means 91 of you are consigned to a future where you cannot \nparticipate meaningfully in the democracy, you can't participate \nmeaningfully in this economy. We need to deal with that.\n  The fact is we have an economy that is not generating jobs, where \nmedian\n\n[[Page S4274]]\n\nfamily income for the first time in our history is falling, not rising. \nPeople are coming to my townhall meetings and saying: I have done \neverything I can do over the last decade, but I am earning less at the \nend than I was at the beginning. They are saying to me: Michael, we \nsent our first kid to the fancy school, but we are not going to be able \nto send our second kid there, or we cannot send our kid to the best \ncollege they got into.\n  We need to be working on that.\n  We have an energy policy in this country right now--maybe it is \nbetter to say a lack of an energy policy in this country right now--\nthat forces us to ship billions of dollars a week of our treasury to \nthe Persian Gulf to buy oil. That doesn't make any sense.\n  I was on a call last week with farmers from my State, saying to me \nthey are being driven out of business by the broken immigration policy \nwe have.\n  I think the people at home are sick and tired of the screaming match. \nI think people at home are sick and tired of the partisanship. I \nbelieve that people do not think it is going to address these issues \nand I think they look at this deficit and debt situation and they say \nto themselves: This is such a reflection of incompetence that we are \nfearful to have a conversation about all the other things we have to do \nfor our kids and for our grandkids. Their standard of what they want us \nto do is extremely clear to me.\n  The senior Senator and I are from the most beautiful State in this \ncountry, but we are also proud of the fact that it is a third \nDemocratic, a third Republican, and a third Independent. What I have \ntaken out of the townhall meetings I have had is this: They want us to \nmaterially address this problem. They do not believe we are going to \nfix it all at once--unfortunately, they are right about that--but they \nwant us to materially address it. They want to know we are all in it \ntogether, that everybody has some role to play in helping preserve \nchoice and options for the next generation of Americans and to make \nsure business understands that we are going to make good on the \naccounts we have.\n  That is not Washington speak, though; that is Colorado speak. It is \ntougher around here. And they want it to be bipartisan because they do \nnot believe in either party's go-it-alone approach on this question.\n  I would add a corollary to all of that, which is that the capital \nmarkets need to be assured that their paper is going to be worth what \nthey paid for it.\n  We need a comprehensive approach. It is an approach that is going to \nrequire us to cut discretionary spending. It is an approach that is \ngoing to require us to reform our entitlement system. It is an approach \nthat is going to require us to do real tax reform in this place. We are \nnot great here at walking and chewing gum at the same time but that is \nwhat we need to start doing. These are comprehensive and complicated \nquestions.\n  No one would rather vote on something than I would that did not raise \nany taxes, but the math doesn't work. It is clear at the end of the day \nfor us to move ahead we are going to have to have an agreement that has \nall of those aspects in it: discretionary spending cuts, entitlement \nreform, tax reform.\n  That is why Senator Johanns and I, a Republican here, circulated a \nletter to the President that had those three elements in it. Thirty-two \nDemocrats and thirty-two Republicans signed the letter--the Presiding \nOfficer of the Senate signed the letter--agreeing that all these \nelements were going to be part of a final product here.\n  What I want to do this afternoon is simply implore all of us to do \nour jobs, to get this behind us, to begin the building of America again \nin the 21st century, to make sure we are not the first generation of \nAmericans to leave less opportunity to our kids and our grandkids. \nThere is a lot more agreement behind closed doors in this place than \nthere is out on the floor. We need to bring some of that agreement out \nhere, because if we fail to reach some conclusion before this debt \nlimit vote and we unintentionally or intentionally end up in a place \nwhere we have turned our back on the debts we owe, we are not going to \nbe able to solve this problem. The choices are going to make these look \nlike easy choices.\n  We are going home for a few days this weekend, the senior Senator and \nI, to celebrate the Fourth of July, Independence Day, to spend some \ntime with our families and friends and our neighbors. Then we are \ncoming back next week. My hope is that everybody comes back--everybody, \non both sides--with more of a seriousness of purpose than we have had, \nwith an ability to see not just political benefit but the benefit to \nthe country of coming to agreement.\n  If I can go home and say to people that we have reached a deal that \nmeets the terms I mentioned earlier, my view is that will be perfectly \nfine in Democratic parts of the State and in Republican parts of the \nState. That is what we should strive to do.\n  I hope the American people will hold the people in this Chamber \naccountable in the way they hold people at the local level and the \nState level accountable. No mayor would ever say I am going to \nwillingly or wantonly jeopardize the credit rating of my city--the \nPresiding Officer was a mayor--and live to fight another day, and we \nshould not do that either.\n  I hope we move past the rhetoric of this debt ceiling discussion and \nactually get into a conversation that will solve the fundamental \nproblems and challenges that are facing our country, because if we do \nnot do that, we are not going to do the even more important work than \nthat, which is to support the aspirations all of us have for this \ncountry and for our children in a world that is becoming more complex \nand uncertain every single day.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Colorado for his incredible \nleadership on these issues. I believe if we continue to try to reach \nout and continue to try to work together, ultimately we are going to \nfind a path.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge the \nleadership of my colleague from Colorado, particularly underlining the \nsalient points he made during his remarks. I think most important to \nnote about Colorado is it is a third Republican, a third Democratic, \nand a third Independent in our political and electoral makeup. I think \nit drives us to find bipartisan solutions and bipartisan ground. That \nis why we came to the floor this afternoon. It was in the hope that our \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle would join us in the discussion \nabout how we move forward, not just on lifting the debt ceiling, for \nthe reasons Senator Bennet outlined, but for the reasons that we think \nare as follows:\n  We will lay a new foundation for our 21st century economy, we will \nsend a message to the markets and the business community that we are \nserious about dealing with our annual deficits and our long-term debt. \nIn effect, in doing such we will inject a healthy dose of confidence \ninto our country, into our markets, and into our business community. \nTaking those steps will be a way of moving forward, as the Senator \nsaid.\n  I ask unanimous consent to enter into a colloquy with my colleague \nSenator Bennet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. One of the things Senator Udall said reminded me of a \nconversation I had a number of months ago with somebody who is in the \ncapital markets and who watches everything going on down here pretty \nclosely, but quizzically. He cannot figure out what in the world we are \ndoing. I saw him, I think maybe it was in February, sometime in that \ntimeframe. I asked him, as I always do: What are you doing? He is one \nof the smartest investors I know.\n  He said: I am buying gold.\n  I said: Why are you buying gold?\n  He said: I don't have any confidence that you guys are going to be \nable to work this out and get our deficit and debt under control.\n  First, think how unproductive that is. I am not telling anybody to \nbuy or sell gold, but it doesn't create jobs in this economy. We want \npeople investing in companies so they can grow and hire people and \ncreate jobs.\n  Anyway, I saw him again about 6 weeks ago. We started talking about \nthe debt ceiling conversation.\n  He said: It is beyond the realm of my comprehension that you guys \nwould fail to lift the debt ceiling.\n  Here is a guy cynical enough about the way this place works who is \nsaying\n\n[[Page S4275]]\n\nhe is buying gold, but it is even beyond his comprehensive that we \ncould fail to lift the debt ceiling. The reason is, he actually \nunderstands what the facts are around this.\n  I think we will lift the debt ceiling. I certainly hope we will. But \nthe more important point is what the Senator has been working on for \nall these many months, which is coming to a comprehensive plan that \nactually addresses the underlying problem of our debt and deficit.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. My colleague and I hosted the Colorado Capital \nConference a few weeks ago. We had Coloradans from all sections of the \nState, all walks of life. We had the three main political points of \nview represented: Democrats, Independents, Republicans. They remarked \nto Senator Bennet and to me, as well as hearing from a broad range of \nour colleagues who were gracious enough to take time to speak to our \nconstituents and answer questions, that we all had identified the \nproblem and we all had identified the solution, which was a \ncomprehensive plan that we implemented together. We are here again on \nthe floor this afternoon to call on all of our colleagues to join us in \nworking together, finding that common ground, because there is a lot at \nstake but there is enormous opportunity. My colleague was a successful \nbusinessman in one of his previous lives, but he may want to comment on \nthe capital conference as well.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. It is clear to me, if this decision were left up to 100 \nColoradans, we would scratch our head and we would probably argue out \nsome things. But I think it would probably take about a day for us to \ncome to a set of solutions that would solve the problem or at least \nmove us down the road, and we would feel pretty patriotic about what we \nhad done; that we had done something useful for our kids at the end of \nthis process, if we are able to deliver something like that. I think \nthat is how we ought to feel. There are too many days around this place \nwhere I feel like we have lost sight of all that. In that conversation \nthe Senator talked about--Al Simpson was such a big part of, Gary Hart \nwas there, Alice Rivlin, and a number of people--it was abundantly \nclear, blindingly obvious to the people in that room that we couldn't \napproach this problem by drawing bright lines and saying: No, we cannot \ntouch this or, no, we cannot touch that.\n  They knew everybody was going to have to give a little bit in order \nto make this work. Unfortunately, some of that line drawing is what we \nare seeing around here that we have to find a way to get past.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. If the Senator would yield, I would comment on \ntwo elements my colleague just alluded to. Let's talk about Social \nSecurity. There are those in our party who have said keep your hands \noff Social Security. I know what a strong and important program Social \nSecurity has been. It has allowed me and my wife to raise our children. \nMy parents were treated with dignity in their latter years. They also \nhad the assurances of Medicare. If we think because Social Security on \npaper is solvent, we ought to think again because there is $3 trillion \nowed to the Social Security trust fund by the Federal Government, and, \nyes, Social Security isn't responsible for that shortfall because we \nhave taken those dollars and put them in the general fund, but that $3 \ntrillion is going to have to come from somewhere. There are some \ncommonsense fixes we can put in place that will protect and serve and \nstrengthen Social Security.\n  On the other hand, we hear in the Chamber tax revenues, I should say \nmore appropriately, are off the table. Every economist and every \nobserver points out we cannot get there from here, there being a \nbalanced Federal budget, without additional revenues. Why can't we \nstart, as the Bowles-Simpson commission proposed, eliminating many of \nthe subsidies and loopholes and special deals in our Tax Code that \ntotal something over $1 trillion. That is a great place to start. If we \nfollow that with tax reforms, lowering rates for corporations and \nbusinesses, that is an even bigger step we can take. There is a broad \nagreement in the Chamber--certainly in our conversations with people \nacross the country who represent their States here--those are \ncommonsense steps forward.\n  Mr. BENNET. I completely agree, and why wouldn't we want to look at \nour Tax Code and our regulatory code. I hear about that from the other \nside, and I share their view. I have been in government. Listen, I was \na school superintendent for almost 4 years. If one thinks I don't \nunderstand what it is like to be on the receiving end of well-\nintentioned legislation from Washington, DC, that by the time it gets \nto a school or classroom, makes no sense at all, believe me, I lived it \nevery single day. So why wouldn't we look at our Tax Code and our \nregulatory code and ask ourselves: Are these things more or less likely \nto drive innovation in the United States? Are these aspects more or \nless likely to grow our economy and to create jobs? It is clear we have \nthe highest corporate tax rate in the world now. It used to be second, \nbut Japan either changed theirs or is about to change theirs. That is \nsending a very uncompetitive message to the world.\n  On the other hand, we have so many loopholes, so many special \ninterest loopholes that underlie the Tax Code, we are not actually \ngetting the revenue we would be suggesting as high rates. So in a way, \nthis isn't a partisan issue, but it is the worst of all possible worlds \nbecause we are sending out an anticompetitive message to the world that \nsays we are closed for business, and we have a whole bunch of loopholes \nthat may or may not--and I suspect in many cases do not--drive \ninnovation in this country.\n  In fact, most of them are looking backward into the 20th century. \nThey may have made sense in the middle of the 20th century, but they \ndon't necessarily make sense to build new industries here, to develop \nthings such as a new energy economy that is so important to our State \nwhich, by the way, would help lead us toward energy independence from \nthe Persian Gulf. There is no reason to think all these things that \nhave been written down are written in stone, and, frankly, our job is \nto make sure it is working better for people. So I think the debt and \ndeficit commission made some excellent recommendations on that side.\n  The other side is on personal income tax. What they said there was, \nwe can actually lower rates and raise more revenue. Why? Because there \nare so many deductions that are part of the code, and only 30 percent \nof the people in this country itemize, get the benefit of those \ndeductions. We can imagine a world where everybody gets the benefit of \na lower rate but we are able to have revenue to drive us forward. We \ncan get there. The thing on the debt and deficit commission is, Tom \nCoburn, who is one of the most conservative Members of this body--I \ndon't think he would mind my saying that--and Dick Durbin, one of the \nmost liberal Members of this body, both voted for that deficit and debt \ncommission report. That is almost good enough for me.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I was proud of the Senate when five of the six \nSenators on the Commission voted for the Bowles-Simpson \nrecommendations, not without some concerns, not without an interest in \nworking to fill in and flesh out the plan, but five of the six Senators \nfrom across the political spectrum said this is a very good starting \npoint.\n  Mr. BENNET. I see we are joined by Senator Coons from Delaware, and I \nam going to stop, but along that line, just to give people who are here \nin the Chamber or might be watching some optimism, just 2 weeks ago we \ntook a vote on one subsidy, an ethanol subsidy, and I think it was \nSenator Coburn and Senator Feinstein who put it on the floor, a \nDemocrat and Republican, and it had like 73 votes. I get in trouble \nwith my kids. It wasn't ``like'' 73 votes, it was 73 votes to end that \nsubsidy.\n  By the way, there were around 40 Democrats and 30-some Republicans \nwho supported that. We need more of that around here. I think it \nwould--if we keep working at it and keep chipping away at it, in the \nend, we will be able to see common sense will prevail over politics.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, Senator Coons would like to \nshare his thoughts.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, the two Senators from Colorado have \ninspired me to come to the floor and join them in a colloquy about the \nchallenges facing our country. I say to the Senators\n\n[[Page S4276]]\n\nfrom Colorado, I am pleased and impressed with their leadership and \nhave greatly enjoyed serving with them to date.\n  I agree that the vote on one of our tax expenditures on the ethanol \nsubsidy was an encouraging and inspiring moment because we saw both \nDemocrats and Republicans from all over the country casting a vote to \nend a tax expenditure or subsidy that, many would argue, has outlived \nits usefulness in the current marketplace.\n  In my home State, we recently saw the bankruptcy of our second \nlargest poultry company, and they have communicated to me their grave \nconcern about the ethanol subsidy. There are lots of folks on both \nsides of that particular debate. I think the larger point that is \nimportant for us to get to is certainty in the markets. I spent a \nnumber of years in the private sector in business before running for \nand being elected to office, and I know the mantra Senator Bennet is \nwell familiar with, Senator Udall is well familiar with, both parties \nare well familiar with, is certainty is what the markets look for. \nCertainty is also what our people look for. We have alarmed them, \nconcerned them by not being able to reach a broad, bipartisan, \nresponsible plan that lays out a framework for how it is we are going \nto address both the Nation's record deficits and record debt. Our debt \ntoday, as we know, is roughly $14 trillion. Our deficit has hit an \nalltime record, and we are working on borrowed time. I have heard some \nsuggest we need to better understand the situation we are in. The \nsituation we are in, I believe, is that we are about to risk defaulting \non America's mortgage. We have made commitments as a nation. We have \nexpended ourselves at home and abroad in a lot of different ways, and I \nam worried we are on the verge of failing to meet our commitments. Just \nas America's households hesitate before ever defaulting on their \nmortgage, I think we, as a nation, as a people, have to hesitate, have \nto think deeply about the consequences of it.\n  I asked the folks who work with me on economic policy to quantify it. \nThey looked at a number of different studies around the country and \ngave me chilling numbers. Should we fail to meet the August 2 deadline \nthat Secretary Geithner has repeatedly, since January, in writing and \ntestimony, suggested to us is the absolute last date by which we can \nreach a bipartisan compromise and a path forward, we will lose hundreds \nof thousands of jobs. One study said 640,000 jobs. The markets may lose \nas much as 10 percent of their value, which would mean a loss of almost \n$1 trillion of market equity value. That means pension funds, personal \nsavings, 401(k)s would take an enormous hit. The average homeowner \nwould see an increase in costs, whether it is their credit cards or \nmortgages or car loans. It is easy to think this is an abstract \nargument. But in reality, I think the problem we are causing, the lack \nof confidence in the markets, could have a sudden, sharp, grinding \neffect on our economic world, and that is because investors act more \nlike animals than they do like machines. When spooked, they act the way \nherds do and they run off in a certain direction. My concern is, as a \ncountry, we are so used to having a AAA bond rating, to being the \nworld's reserve currency, to being the gold standard in security. I am \ngravely concerned that intransigence, an unwillingness to come to a \nreasonable compromise is putting us at real risk of spooking the \nmarkets, of harming the average American homeowner, and putting our \nrating at risk as a country.\n\n  At the end of the day, so far in my short 6 months here, I have \nobserved some things about how Washington works that worry me. If I \ncould offer a metaphor, it seems to me there are a lot of sacred cows \nhere. It seems to me the trillions of dollars we spend in our Tax Code \nthrough tax loopholes and special tax provisions and the trillions we \nspend through direct spending are broken up into these sacred cows, and \nI feel as if I have gone into dairy. I feel as if I am surrounded by a \nwhole herd of sacred cows, and what we need is a deliberate and clear \nbipartisan effort to thin the herd, to make some tough choices.\n  As I know Senator Bennet said previously, I wish to commend the hard \nwork of the Gang of 6, the so-called Gang of 6, the bipartisan group \nwho came up with processes and a path forward. The Bowles-Simpson \ncommission presented to those of us on the Budget Committee, presented \nto this body in writing, a proposal. There are paths forward. There are \nways to make these tough choices. I hope before the time runs out, this \nbody will embrace these proposals, make the tough choices and the \nsacrifices we need to come to the center and lay out a path. I, \nfrankly, don't think we have until August 2. If we are going to put at \nrisk the markets by injecting uncertainty, frankly, the timeline may be \nmore like the middle of July. It is my hope the Senators from Colorado \nwill be joined by Senators from both sides of this body and both sides \nof this Capitol in crafting a responsible bipartisan solution.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, the Senator, in effect, is \nsaying that rather than this being a problem, although it is, this is \nan enormous opportunity for the country to chart a new course. If we \nagree to do it first and foremost as Americans----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators have spoken collectively for 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. We thank the Chair for that notification. We \nlook forward to next week continuing this conversation.\n  I wish to thank my colleague for joining me and Senator Bennet in \nthis discussion this afternoon.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I would like to express my gratitude to the \nSenators from Colorado to allow me to join them and look forward to \ncontinuing this conversation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to listen to my \ncolleagues from across the aisle and while my purpose is to address \nanother subject, I do want to respond to what we have just heard from \nthree Democratic Senators and a number of Republicans regarding the \nneed to address the serious issue of debt and deficit and how we are \ngoing to proceed before we run into a situation of national default \nwith consequences we cannot begin to imagine, I think it is appropriate \nto say there is bipartisan support for serious debate and discussion. I \nwas disappointed, obviously--in fact, I was more than disappointed. I \nwas very frustrated yesterday with the President's press conference, \nthe President essentially said the Congress is not doing its job and \ncompared what was being done here to undisciplined children, who \ncouldn't do their homework. He was targeting the opposition, which \nsounded like a lot of campaign rhetoric. This is very disappointing. At \na time when we face a serious fiscal crisis, he shouldn't even be \nthinking about the election of 2012 and focusing on any campaign \nrhetoric--we ought to be thinking about and working to address the \ncrisis before us that is going to have implications for every American \nnow. If we don't come to an agreement on how to proceed before August \n2, we are going to see how the financial markets react to what we have \nnot been able to do. But to suggest we haven't been doing anything and \nthat the Congress needs to take the lead, I think, goes even against \nthe President's own thoughts when he was a Member of this body.\n\n  I wish to quote from a statement he made when President Obama was \nSenator Obama. That quote is as follows:\n\n       The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's \n     debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. . . . Increasing \n     America's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. \n     Leadership means that the buck stops here. Instead, \n     Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto \n     the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a \n     debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve \n     better.\n\n  Yes, Americans do deserve better. But, obviously, that famous sign \nthat used to be on the desk of Harry Truman when he was President, \n``The Buck Stops Here,'' has been taken off that Presidential desk and \nshifted over to the responsibility of the Congress. We do have a \nresponsibility, but it is fair to say and accurate to say that without \nPresidential leadership, no matter what we do here will not become law. \nThe President needs to be engaged in supporting what we do. Otherwise, \nit will not become law.\n  I think most of the American public thinks, based on the inferences \nmade yesterday by the President in his press conference, Republicans \nare on one\n\n[[Page S4277]]\n\nside, the Democrats are on the other side, and they don't see the \nproblem the same way. I think what we just heard--eloquent speeches and \nimportant speeches from both Republicans and just now Democrats--\nindicates there are adults here, not just children. We have been \nworking hard ever since day one of this session to try to address the \ntrain wreck we see coming. First, it was estimated to come on May 16, \nand now August 2. We bought a little bit of time, I guess. But the \nclock is ticking and we see a train wreck coming and we are trying to \ndo something about it.\n  There are serious people making serious efforts to have serious \ndialogue and debate as to how we best go forward in the interests of \nour country and not in the interests of the 2012 election; in the \ninterests of our grandchildren and children, not in the interests of \nour political careers.\n  I came back to the Senate for one reason and one reason only, and \nthat is that I was not going to stand idly by and watch our country \nsink deeper into debt. I was not going to watch my generation be the \nfirst generation to hand our children a country in worse shape than the \none we inherited and a hole they could never dig out of. They will not \nbe able to enjoy all the benefits my generation has had of peace and \nprosperity.\n  It is clear--and I am not here to go through all the statistics. I \nhave made several speeches on this topic and we hear this on the floor \nevery day. There are so many facts in support of the need to take \nserious action to address this serious problem. There is so much \nhandwriting on the wall, and the wall is about to collapse. Economists \nfrom the conservative side to the liberal side and everybody in \nbetween--analysts, financial markets, and so forth--are taking action \nand saying we need to take action here. We see Democratic and \nRepublican Governors across this country in various States taking \naction.\n  I am proud of what we have done in the State of Indiana in the last 6 \nyears under the leadership of Governor Daniels. We have balanced our \nbudget. We have dug out of a deep deficit left by his predecessor. We \nhave a AAA credit rating. We have made some tough choices. We have had \nto cut and slash government jobs. There was a lot of bloat and a lot of \nexcess there. We made tough choices, and we paid a financial price for \nit, but we are in better shape today than we have been in a long time \nas a result of taking these actions.\n  We see countries around the world having to belly up to the reality \nof the facts. They have overspent and have promised more than they can \ndeliver. Yet the United States of America should be the leader of this \neffort in terms of getting its economy in shape. It is a place where \nthe dollar was sound. It is the place to invest your money and know it \nwas the safest place. All of that now has come into question.\n  I have been a part of these talks across the aisle. The two Senators \nfrom Colorado who just spoke, the Senator from Delaware who just spoke, \nand others, are taking this seriously. They are not putting their \npolitical fortunes ahead of the necessity to deal with these issues. \nThey are saying that what transcends politicians, what transcends \nreelection is the fact that we have a serious crisis that has to be \ndealt with now and tough choices have to be made. We are talking in \nearnest behind closed doors, working in open sessions and closed \nsessions, trying to fashion an appropriate response. But without the \nPresident's leadership, no matter what we do, no matter what package we \nput together, we cannot succeed.\n  So it appears the President has decided to engage in the politics of \nthe 2012 elections, and it is very disappointing. I hope that is not \nthe case. I hope this shift we have seen from needing to get involved \nto ``what is wrong with you men and women?'' is just a temporary lapse. \nWhen we get frustrated, it is easy to say childish things, and that is \nwhy I waited overnight so I wouldn't come down here to be characterized \nas someone who says childish things. The problems we face are too \nserious for us not to take seriously.\n  I too believe we can fashion a plan that is in the best interests of \nthe American people and the future of America, but we can't do it by \npointing fingers at each other. We can't do it without Presidential \nleadership. Right now, the one missing element is Presidential \nleadership. As has been said before, the President was invited to come \nand meet with us today and to talk to us about the seriousness of this \nissue. We are willing to demonstrate to him that our doors are open and \nwe are willing to go there, but it takes a commitment on both sides in \norder to accomplish that. Instead, I guess a couple of fundraisers were \nscheduled--one in Philadelphia, one in Las Vegas--and, apparently, that \ntakes precedence. So I think the President's words are pretty hollow.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  I came here to talk about another issue, and I wish to do that now. \nOur necessary focus on the economic situation and what we need to do \nand the impending debt crisis we are facing should take precedence, but \nwe can't overlook the fact we have serious issues on an international \nlevel that will have an impact on our country in the future. Those of \nus here have a responsibility to deal with not only domestic issues but \nwith international security and foreign policy issues. Tomorrow is the \nfirst anniversary of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability \nand Divestment Act that was passed by an overwhelming majority--\nbipartisan majority--in the last Congress. In fact, the vote in the \nSenate was 99 to 0.\n  This act expanded sanctions on the Iranian regime as it continues its \nquest for nuclear weapons capability. Clearly, more needs to be done. I \nam here to talk about it and the implications, but I needed to say \nsomething about what has happened in the previous 24 hours that has \nbeen so disconcerting to not only me but to the American people and \nboth Republicans and Democrats who are trying to make a serious effort \nat solving the problems we face.\n  Put on the back burner because of all these discussions is this \nquestion about Iran and where it is going and what the consequences of \nthe future with a nuclear-armed Iran would be. This month my colleagues \nand I, because we believe these sanctions have not yet accomplished the \ngoal we have intended and that we need even tougher sanctions against \nIran, have introduced a bill entitled ``The Iran, North Korea, and \nSyria Sanctions Consolidations Act of 2011'' that further tightens the \nnoose on the Iranian regime. We need strong support from this body and \ncollective efforts to prevent a nuclear Iran.\n  I will take a few minutes now to explain why I believe this work is \nof such dramatic and growing importance to our Nation.\n\n  The enormous changes being wrought by the Arab spring and the \npotential consequences--both positive and negative--of that movement \nhave captured our attention. Those of us who care passionately about \nthe future of the Middle East and understand the consequences to our \nnational security as a consequence of that, whether it is economic \nsecurity because of energy resources we get from the Middle East or \nwhether it is diplomatic security or just national security in terms of \nconflict that potentially draws us into that effort, all of this is at \nstake. We are hoping, of course, that the democratic instincts of the \nArab spring will develop, but we look at this with a mixture of both \nhope and concern.\n  The democratic impulse in the region has not yet brought meaningful \nchange to the Iranian people who continue to suffer under an \nautocratic, savage, and ruthless regime. As that regime continues to \ncrush every plea for greater democratic liberties, it also pursues its \nvision of nuclear weapons capability. Welcome signs of democratic \nprogress elsewhere in the region must not deflect our attention from \nthe growing danger in Iran.\n  Three American Presidents, including this current President, have \ndeclared that a nuclear weapons-capable Iran is unacceptable. To give \nmeaning to that repeated commitment to do whatever is necessary to \nprevent Iran from gaining that dangerous capability remains an urgent \nand highly significant matter facing the United States and \ninternational security. The consequences of a nuclear weapons-capable \nIran are not tolerable, not acceptable, and must motivate the most \npowerful and effective efforts possible to prevent that from happening.\n\n[[Page S4278]]\n\n  A nuclear-armed Iran would threaten the entire region and its \nenormous energy resources. It would motivate broad nuclear \nproliferation throughout the Middle East. It would further destabilize \nthe region already in turmoil. It would encourage radicalism and \nterrorism, and it would threaten the destruction of the State of \nIsrael.\n  This last danger alone--the potential destruction, the declared \ndestruction of the nation of Israel--that alone potentially raises the \ndanger to which Israel is the last resort, but almost certainly we have \nto respond to it to ensure its survival. That alone compels us to be \nclear-eyed and determined to find a solution before we have to face \nthat potential decision.\n  I have been working in recent years with the Bipartisan Policy Center \nto press for a robust, comprehensive three-track effort to raise the \nstakes on the Iranian regime and to compel it to live up to its \ncommitments and halt its weapons program. The first track we proposed \nwas enhanced diplomatic efforts. People say, Why diplomatic efforts? \nThat is just going nowhere.\n  We felt we needed to enhance those efforts to at least give that a \nchance, so that those who would say sanctions should not be imposed \nuntil we have tried diplomatic efforts--we said: OK, let's continue to \ngive that a shot, but let's do that in parallel with some of these \nother approaches.\n  But this enhanced diplomatic effort, where we create and invigorate \nand motivate an international coalition devoted to the same objective \nto prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons, has been tried, and it \nhas not succeeded.\n  Now, this effort does not mean simply repeated outreaches to the \nIranian regime to engage them in dialog. The Obama administration came \ninto office promising such discussions, but this has gone nowhere. \nInternational talks in Geneva last year accomplished nothing. Talks in \nTurkey earlier this year broke down in the afternoon of the very first \nday. Clearly, lack of any flexibility and goodwill on behalf of the \nIranian regime has dissuaded any further attempt to renew dialog \nefforts. Dialog with the Iranians is in a deep freeze.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator has used his 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I was not aware I had asked for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order is for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. That is news to me.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will just try to see how I can wrap this \nup.\n  I might ask, Mr. President, is there an order in place that I am not \naware of?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order is that the Senate is in morning \nbusiness with 10 minutes to be consumed by each Senator.\n  Mr. COATS. All right. I apologize. I did not know that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Although consent has been given for larger \nblocks of time, and the Senator has just been given consent.\n  Mr. COATS. All right. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The second track for solutions are sanctions. We currently have the \nSanctions Act in place. We want to impose an additional sanctions \ntrack. That is why I have sponsored and cosponsored this new act. The \nimpact of this, I think, could potentially be significant. But, so far, \nwe have not seen success as a result of sanctions.\n  Since the international community first began to face this \nchallenge--in the form of IAEA inspections and reports, various U.N. \nSecurity Council sanctions resolutions, and protracted negotiations to \nconstruct an effective coalition strong enough to have meaning--none of \nthese actions have seriously thwarted the Iranian regime's nuclear \nambitions.\n  That takes us to the third track of a comprehensive approach. Those \nof us in the Bipartisan Policy Center, working with experts on all \nsides of this issue, came to the conclusion that certain military \noptions can be put in place that deserve serious and open discussion. \nSince diplomacy and sanctions have proven to be too weak, we need an \nextra kick to this process in order to achieve the desired result.\n  I am suggesting discussion and debate and dialogue. No one should \nsuppose that including a military option in this package means anything \nother than preparing the ground for the logical, necessary access to \nmeasures of last resort, should they be needed.\n  Through the Bipartisan Policy Center, we participated in an \nexhaustive analysis of all the means and consequences of potential \nmilitary action against Iran's nuclear weapons program. There were no \nwar advocates in that room--none of us. Nevertheless, if it is true \nthat a nuclear weapons-capable Iran is ``unacceptable,'' then our \nNation and the international community as a whole must see with vivid \nclarity what measures remain, should the first two tracks fail.\n  The Iranian regime must be especially clear-eyed and nondelusional \nabout those potential consequences should it not change its behavior. \nIndeed, to give the diplomatic and sanctions tracks the essential \ncredibility they require, the military option must be entirely \nbelievable.\n  Military options themselves include a multipronged, comprehensive \nstrategy, not all of which are ``kinetic'' or mean an actual attack \nwith our Armed Forces. Such a strategy would include constructing the \nalliances needed to station U.S. forces in position to confront Iran \nand then a series of steps designed to demonstrate to Iran that the \nUnited States and its coalition partners are capable of decisive \nmilitary action, if necessary, to stop its nuclear program.\n  At the end of the day, we have to decide whether we will tolerate an \nIran with nuclear weapons. If other States, including, importantly, \nChina and Russia, become convinced of this core reality, they will make \ndifferent calculations about their own self-interests in this matter. \nIf they come to believe that we so desperately need them to accept \nmodest sanctions on Iran, then they can compel us to take off the table \nthe sanctions proposals with real teeth. We have become hostage to \ntheir views on this vital issue and also to their related economic \ninterests.\n  So if these and other States come to realize that when we say \n``unacceptable,'' we mean it, they will come to different conclusions \nabout how their own interests can be best served.\n  In conclusion, a nuclear weapons-capable Iran that we believe can be \ncontained is not one that we are therefore prepared to tolerate. If we \nthink we can solve this problem through diplomatic efforts and \nsanctions, we have not been able to do so, and the likelihood of doing \nso diminishes as every day goes by. The nuclear clock keeps ticking in \nIran. This is an illusion and one that makes our task much harder. If \nothers, however--especially Iran, but also including our allies and \nother coalition partners--come to believe that we would consider \ntolerating a nuclear Iran because it can somehow be contained, then \nnone of this will work. The result then will not be a contained and \ntolerated nuclear Iran; it will be the military action we all hope to \navoid, whether it is ours or another's.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4278-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4278-S4281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nlend my voice to the others who have been here--my colleagues--to talk \nabout the need to come to the table and come up with an agreement \naround how we are going to deal with raising the debt limit by the \nAugust 2 deadline and include some sort of package to address our debt \nand our deficits.\n  I listened carefully to my colleague and friend from Indiana, and I \nthink we agree on a lot of what he said. I certainly agree that both \nsides of the aisle have been working hard to look at ways we can \naddress this issue. I agree we need Presidential leadership to address \nthis challenge we are facing. That is why I was so pleased to see the \nPresident come out yesterday and say, very strongly, that in order to \naddress this, we are going to have to put revenues on the table, make \nsure they are in the mix, because we cannot get there without looking \nat revenues, with just looking at cuts to the budget.\n  So I think there is a lot of agreement. But every negotiation I have\n\n[[Page S4279]]\n\nbeen part of means that every side has to give a little. So drawing a \nline in the sand and saying: We are not going to look at revenues at \nthe same time we are looking at spending cuts is not the way for us to \nsolve this challenge.\n  Now, we all know that negotiations are ongoing between the President \nand leadership in both the House and the Senate. They are looking at \nall kinds of measures to reduce the deficit and raise the legal debt \nlimit. There is no doubt we have to address the long-term debt and \ndeficits. I repeatedly called for a bipartisan package that includes \nreforms to everything that is deficit related. So that means domestic, \ndefense, and mandatory spending, as well as looking at revenues. I \nsupport including deficit-reduction measures in the vote to raise the \ndebt limit. I believe that reducing the deficit is important to \nstrengthening the long-term health of our economy.\n  But that being said, failure to increase the debt limit would do \nexactly the opposite. It would devastate the economy. To be clear, \nraising the debt limit does not mean spending more. It means meeting \nour existing obligations--obligations made by both parties over many \nyears. Failure to raise the debt limit means default. It means, for the \nfirst time in the history of the United States of America, we would not \npay our creditors, and that disruption would cause the worldwide \neconomy to have devastating consequences--consequences that would be \nincredibly expensive to American taxpayers.\n  I think Warren Buffett said it very well when he said: If Congress \ndid that, it would be the ``most asinine act ever.''\n  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said it would cause severe disruptions in \nthe financial markets, it would slow our economic recovery, and make \nthe deficit problem worse.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it absolutely must be done, the \ndebt limit must be raised.\n  Economist and former Reagan adviser Larry Kudlow said default would \nbe ``catastrophic.''\n  All these experts have pointed out that the disruption to world \nfinancial markets would plunge us into another financial crisis, and \nAmerica would lose the trust of world investors, which would result in \nhigher borrowing costs for the government, and that would ultimately be \nborne by taxpayers.\n  It would also mean higher interest rates for consumers, making it \nmore expensive to buy a house, pay for college, or even pay your credit \ncard bill.\n  In a recent report, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \nestimated that if we do not raise the debt limit, the Federal \nGovernment would have to eliminate all spending on discretionary \nprograms, cut nearly 70 percent of spending for programs such as Social \nSecurity and Medicare, or increase taxes by more than 60 percent. That \nis not just speculation. That is what will happen if we fail to raise \nthe debt limit.\n  We should not be playing politics with this issue. We all have a \nstake in making sure this gets done. That is why it makes no sense to \nme that the leadership on the other side of the aisle is refusing to \nentertain any discussion about eliminating any tax loopholes.\n  I think it is important to highlight some of those tax loopholes, and \nthere are two I want to talk about that have been mentioned on the \nfloor in the last couple of days. I would think we could all agree that \nthese are the kinds of tax loopholes we ought to be closing.\n  First, we have a special deduction for yacht owners. If the yacht is \nbig enough, like the yacht shown in this picture I have in the \nChamber--so if it has beds and a bathroom and a kitchen--then yacht \nowners can claim it as a second home, and they can get the same \nmortgage interest deduction on their taxes that we give to middle-class \nhomeowners.\n  I think this is a clear abuse of the Tax Code. The mortgage deduction \nprovision is meant to increase home ownership, not yacht ownership. \nThere are as many as a half million yachts in the United States that \nqualify for this exemption, and the yacht industry actually includes \nthis tax loophole in their marketing.\n  Now, the second loophole that, again, has been mentioned before on \nthe Senate floor is a tax break for racehorse owners. The current Tax \nCode allows racehorse owners to depreciate the cost of their horses at \nan accelerated rate.\n  Yachts and racehorses, these are tax breaks that just do not make \nsense. We all know we are grappling with a truly historic long-term \ndeficit. To continue to ignore the revenue side of that deficit is \nirresponsible. Our Tax Code is riddled with hundreds of arbitrary tax \nbreaks just like the one for racehorses and the one for yachts. In \nfact, we give away more in tax breaks in a year than we take in through \nindividual and corporate income taxes. These tax breaks are, too often, \ngranted based on who has the most clout in Congress rather than based \non what is best for the economy or what is fair for people in this \ncountry.\n  So the result is that some businesses are paying nearly the full \ncorporate tax rate while others are paying almost nothing. We need a \nfairer system. We need a tax system that drives innovation and keeps \nour economy competitive on the global stage.\n  Do we really want to continue supporting tax breaks for yachts and \nracehorses? If we want to eliminate waste in government, isn't this \nexactly the kind of spending we should be targeting?\n  Lastly, we must consider the price of refusing to deal with these tax \nbreaks, of refusing to say we are going to look at these kinds of tax \nbreaks because we know that meaningful deficit reform will mean \ntrillions of dollars in changes. In avoiding revenues, Republicans \nhave, instead, proposed steep cuts that are dangerous both to the \nhealth of the American people and to the strength of our economy.\n  Eliminating funding for basic women's health care, ending Medicare as \nwe know it, dangerous cuts to nursing home care, slashing Pell grants \nthat will help train the next generation of engineers, stopping the \ndevelopment of new energy technologies, and halting efforts to retool \nthe economy to compete in the 21st century--these are the alternatives \nthat Republicans are proposing to save tax breaks for yachts and \nracehorses.\n  We know we need to continue these kinds of basic services and \ninvestments in the economy. The President's bipartisan commission has \nsaid it, the business community has said it, and Americans know it. We \nalso know that finding a compromise on the debt limit is critical if we \nwant to avoid plunging our economy back into chaos. We know that many \nof these tax breaks just do not make sense.\n  So I urge my colleagues, let's look at the facts. Let's work together \nfor what we all know needs to happen--reduce the deficit, raise the \ndebt limit, and keep America working.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Jack Reed from Rhode Island be \nthe next speaker on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business. The Senator is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the bills from a decade of ineffective tax \ncuts and unpaid wars and a recession fueled by lax regulation have come \ndue. I did not support the policies that generated these bills, but \npretending these bills do not have to be paid is not an option. Indeed, \nplaying chicken, literally, with the full faith and credit of the U.S. \nGovernment is a recipe for disaster. If the U.S. defaults on its debt, \nevery single expert tells us, it will have a huge and immediate impact \non the lives of every American all across this country, from the \npoorest to the most well off. And particularly for those who are \nstruggling, it will be devastating at a time when they can least afford \nit. Not only could it cause a stoppage of Social Security and veterans' \nbenefits checks, but, more systemically, it would undermine our \nNation's opportunity to build a more lasting and more prosperous \nrecovery.\n  We have seen some progress, but it is not enough. This step, if we \ndefault, would seriously undermine our ability to function as an \neconomy and would seriously, perhaps decisively affect our ability to \nmount and continue to mount a reasonably recovery. We are still \nrecovering from the worst depression since the 1930s. Much of it is \nbased on the policies I mentioned previously: two unfunded wars, the \nexpansion of an\n\n[[Page S4280]]\n\nentitlement program that was unpaid for, deep tax cuts that were unpaid \nfor--all of it put on the tab, and the tab is coming due. But now to \nsuggest that we walk away from our obligation to provide at least the \nlegal means to pay our debt is irresponsible.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to talk about \ntaking a scalpel to wasteful spending and about the primacy of severely \ncurtailing investments in our society. They continue to talk about an \neconomic philosophy that I think has been disproven by the last several \nyears, particularly from 2000, when President Bush and the Republican \nCongress inherited a projected multitrillion-dollar surplus and turned \nit into a huge deficit under the premise that these types of cuts in \ntaxes, these types of policies would stimulate jobs.\n  In fact, there has been talk that we are now focusing on cutting \nspending on Medicare and Medicaid, which is so central to all \nAmericans. It is difficult also to imagine that they are asking for \nthese cuts at a time when so many families throughout this country are \nstruggling--struggling to stay in their homes, struggling simply to pay \ntheir bills each week, struggling to ensure their children can continue \non with their education. All of this needs a government that supports \nthese Americans, not reneging on commitments we have made, particularly \ncommitments we have made financially to essentially pay for the \nobligations that have been run up, particularly beginning in 2000 and \ncontinuing through the Bush administration.\n  We all understand we have to reach a principled compromise, but in \nthat compromise, as so many of my colleagues have suggested, an \nexclusive focus on cutting expenditures will not get us there, I think, \nsimply based on the arithmetic, but more than that, it will impose huge \nburdens on families who are struggling, and it will continue to reward \nthe most prosperous in this Nation. I do not think that is the right \nway to do it or the fair way to do it.\n  The priorities I have heard expressed on the other side are to \ncontinue to talk about very deep tax cuts, at a time when we have the \nlowest revenues we have had in decades, and then talk about cutting \nexpenditures--education, health care, and, indeed, under their proposed \nbudget, Medicare and Medicaid, which is so central to so many people.\n  We know we have to focus on not just expenditures but also revenue, \nand we also have to begin the very difficult and arduous task of \nentitlement reform. We began that in the last Congress. In fact, I \nthink it is ironic, as I recall the debate on the affordable care act, \nthat most of the amendments my colleagues on the other side were \noffering were to send back to committee proposed changes in Medicare \nthat would have reduced costs and, I would argue, would actually have \nimproved quality. That was their focus. Now their focus has suddenly \nshifted to how we must cut Medicare and Medicaid.\n  What we have to do is provide the same kind of reasonable, balanced \napproach that took place in the 1990s. Again, without any Republican \nsupport in 1993 and 1994 but with a Democratic President and Democratic \nvotes, we were able to begin to balance the budget. It was a multiyear \nprocess. It required difficult choices. But we have to continue to \npursue that path of a balanced, reasonable response to this problem.\n  As I said before, one of the issues that is so central to this \ncountry is not directly related just to the issue of the deficit, it is \nalso related to jobs. They are obviously closely interrelated. The more \njobs we have, the more people who are participating in the economy, the \nbetter our fiscal position is in Washington.\n  Sadly, what we saw, particularly at the tail end of the Bush \nadministration, was a collapse in our jobs market. The U.S. economy \nlost 8.7 million private sector jobs in 2008 and 2009. We experienced--\nunder the Bush administration principally--25 consecutive months of job \nlosses. That, again, has contributed to these huge deficits. If people \ndo not work, they do not contribute to the taxes. If people do not \nwork, they are likely to get unemployment benefits. People who lose \npart of their wages may qualify for other programs.\n  Since the President has come to office, we have seen a rebound. We \nhave not seen the full, robust recovery we need, but we have seen a \nrebound. We gained 2.081 million jobs, a little over 2 million jobs in \n2010 and 2011. We have experienced 15 consecutive months of private \nsector job creation--not enough, but we have reversed the collapse and \n25 months of job decline by creating jobs and continuing on a sustained \nbasis as a result of difficult decisions that were made by President \nObama and the Democratic Congress in the Recovery Act.\n  My home State of Rhode Island has been particularly hard hit by the \npolicies we saw in the first part of this decade. We have the third \nhighest unemployment rate at 10.9 percent. We have seen a significant \nforeclosure problem. We have seen very crippling impacts on the working \nfamilies of Rhode Island.\n  Now we hear that the only solution we have and the best way to \ncorrect jobs is to continue to do what was done under the Bush \nadministration: Let's just cut taxes, particularly for the wealthiest \nAmericans. The evidence suggests that does not produce the kinds of \njobs--not even the kinds of jobs we have seen in the last 15 months. \nThe economy did not add a single new job during the 3 years under the \nBush tax cuts. The economy had 132 million jobs in June 2001 when we \npassed--against my opposition--the Bush tax cuts. That was the month it \nwas first signed into law. Three years later, in June 2004, there were \njust 131.4 million jobs. We actually lost some jobs.\n  If you take a step back and look at the course of the entire Bush \nPresidency, from January 2001 through January 2009, there was a decline \nin the number of private sector jobs of approximately 650,000. That is \nover the course of the whole administration. In fact, the only net job \ncreation that occurred was in the public sector. Nearly 1.75 million \ngovernment jobs were created over the course of the Bush Presidency.\n  Revenue as a percentage of our economy, as a percentage of GDP, was \n14.9 percent in 2010. It is the lowest level since 1950 when it dropped \nto 14.4 percent. By comparison, government revenue was averaging about \n18 percent over the previous 30 years. So you see, under the Bush \npolicies, which essentially my colleagues want to emulate, \nreconstitute, no job growth and a significant decline in revenue.\n  At a time when revenue as a percentage of GDP is the lowest it has \nbeen in 60 years, now we are talking about further tax cuts in the \nRepublican budget, but we are certainly talking--my colleagues are \ntalking about maintaining the current taxes. Frankly, there are so many \ntax expenditures that my colleagues talked about that are not worthy of \nretention, that are loopholes that we can, in fact, eliminate, and we \nshould. Some examples: tax break for people who breed alpacas; \ndeductions for film and TV production; favorable tax depreciation for \nracehorse owners, horse breeders tax credit; an exemption for wooden \npractice arrows used by children; NASCAR motorsport racing facility tax \ncredit; withholding tax breaks on horse and dog track winnings. The \nlist can go on and on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his deference.\n  We understand we have to make tough choices. They have to include \nexpenditure cuts. We have already started with the continuing \nresolution of the last year where we reduced spending significantly. \nBut we have to have revenue on the table. As Federal Reserve Chairman \nBernanke said:\n\n       [ . . . ] a sharp fiscal consolidation focused on the very \n     near term could be self-defeating if it were to undercut the \n     still-fragile economy.\n\n  We need to create jobs. We need to balance deficit reduction with job \ncreation. We need to put everything on the table, and we need to \nrecognize that the consequences of default on our debt will be \nstaggering, felt by every American. One figure that continues to be \nimpressed upon me is the fact that for every 1 percent increase in the \ninterest rate over the 10-year period, we increase our deficit by over \n$1 trillion.\n\n[[Page S4281]]\n\nI think the first response to a default would be a rise in the interest \nrates we have to pay for our debt.\n  I would urge progress on the efforts to have a comprehensive \nsolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.

Mr. President, beyond the debt limit extension, which has \nrightly consumed the attention of this body, we face another \nchallenge--the funding for our roads, airports, and railroads.\n  Our best estimate is that current needs would total $225 billion \nannually, but revenue from the main source of funding for these \nprograms, the gasoline tax, only totaled $90 billion.\n  The law requires balance in the transportation trust fund. So how \nwould we respond? There are basically three major options.\n  Option 1: Let funding fall. This would be a catastrophe, especially \nfor the construction industry, where already in Illinois upwards of 30 \npercent of construction workers are without work.\n  Option 2: Increase the gas tax. But that is one of the most \nregressive taxes that hits the working poor harder than almost any \nother citizen in our country. The slowdown in our economy as a result \nof a gas tax increase would probably cause unemployment to go up and \ncould jeopardize our extremely fragile recovery.\n  There is a third option, but before I describe that, let me ask a \nquestion. Arguably, what is the third biggest thing that the Lincoln \nadministration was known for? First would be the emancipation \nproclamation. Second would be the victory in the Civil War. What is No. \n3? I argue that it was the 1862 Transcontinental Railway Act--an act \nthat, in 1862, when the Lincoln administration was borrowing as much \nmoney as it could from as many creditors as possible to fund the \nexpansion of the Union Army, with credit already stretching to the \nlimit--and does this sound familiar--the Lincoln administration \nlaunched the largest infrastructure development program in the history \nof the United States. We built a 2,000-mile railroad in only 6 years, \nand created 7,000 American towns. We did it with only $50 million in \nappropriations.\n  How did we fund the rest? The answer is that this was the ultimate \npublic-private partnership. I am particularly worried that in this \nCongress--especially as it considers a transportation bill next year--\nwe have forgotten our own economic legacy, especially from the time \nthat we built one of the largest infrastructure development projects in \nhistory.\n  To recall, the Federal Government granted 20 square miles in \nalternating sections on either side of the railroad for every mile of \ntrack they laid for those railroads. The railroads were also granted \ntimber, stone, and mineral rights on this land. In addition, for every \nmile of track they laid, the railroads were authorized to issue a set \namount of bonds--loans they received--which interest payments were \nbacked by the Federal Government. This guarantee allowed 30-year bonds \nto be issued at a low rate of 6 percent. This was one of the largest \ndevelopment projects in the history of the United States. That is why \nit is an example for how we respond to our transportation needs today.\n  When we look at our own economic legacy and look at the funding \nshortfall for new roads, airports, and rail, I think we should recover \nthat legacy to respond to the challenge for next year. That is why I \nhave introduced the Lincoln Legacy Infrastructure Development Act.\n  This legislation removes a number of Federal restrictions on public-\nprivate partnerships, providing States greater flexibility to generate \ntransportation revenues and enhanced access to private capital for \nroad, rail, aviation, transit, and port infrastructure. Under the \nLincoln Legacy Infrastructure Development Act, we could mobilize over \n$100 billion for new infrastructure investment.\n  Specifically, this legislation lifts caps on cost recovery programs \nfor highways; it incentivizes partnerships in transit; it removes \nbarriers to airport privatization; it increases resources for the \nTransportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act, sometimes \ncalled TIFIA; and it makes improvements to the Railroad Rehabilitation \nand Improvement Financing Program, which are backed by the U.S. High \nSpeed Rail Association and the American High Speed Rail Association.\n  The legislation also stands on the premise that the taxpayer should \nbe protected in these types of arrangements. Indiana showed us what a \nproperly structured deal should look like. Governor Mitch Daniels \nreaped a windfall from the 2006 lease of the Indiana toll road that \nnetted his State $3.8 billion for new transportation upgrades. Most of \nthe money has now been reinvested in highway projects throughout his \nState, but leaders shrewdly placed $500 million in an interest-bearing \naccount to fund future road projects. This is one of the many reasons \nwhy the Indiana economy has grown at twice the rate of the Illinois \neconomy.\n  We have seen public-private partnerships take off not only in our own \ncountry, where they were invented, but in other countries, especially \nBritish Columbia and Australia, where they have authorized $30 billion \nfor transportation infrastructure--almost 20 percent of their total, \nusing this innovative financing means.\n  In these times of deficit and debt, we could let America grind to a \nhalt, we could raise taxes and sock it to the working poor, we could \nslow down our economy with a new government burden, or we could recall \nour own economic legacy, written by Abraham Lincoln's administration \nitself, to use public-private partnerships as a way of growing jobs and \nincomes in the United States, without increasing taxes.\n  I urge this body to review this legislation as we come up with a new \ntransportation bill, and to see it as a way to improve jobs, income, \nand our infrastructure--which is so critical to the crossroads of the \nNation, Illinois--and do it in a way that doesn't hurt our economy or \nthe working poor.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4281-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4281-S4286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we must raise the debt ceiling, period. \nThis is not an opinion, it is a fact. The consequences of failing to \nact are simply too catastrophic to consider any other course. \nNegotiations are underway now to seek an agreement to raise the debt \nceiling as part of a larger agreement on deficit reduction. But there \nis a major obstacle to agreement: a refusal on the part of the \nRepublican leadership to compromise, a refusal to understand that \nsacrifice must be shared.\n  The sacrifice, they say, must come from middle America--those \nstruggling to pay for a college education or for health care for their \nkids or for long-term care for their parents. The Republican leader \ndemands that this sacrifice be made by the middle class in order to \nprotect the Bush tax cuts and other tax breaks for the wealthiest among \nus--despite the huge and growing gap in the distribution of income in \nour country between the wealthy and the middle class.\n  One example of the kind of tax breaks and tax loopholes that we \nDemocrats seek to change is the unconscionable tax break given to hedge \nfund managers. Hedge fund managers generally make their money by \ncharging their clients two fees. First, the manager receives a \nmanagement fee, typically equal to 2 percent of the assets invested. \nSecond, the manager typically receives 20 percent of the income from \nthose investments above a certain level. This 20-percent share of the \ninvestment returns from hedge funds is known as ``carried interest.'' \nUnder current law, most hedge fund managers claim that this carried \ninterest qualifies as a long-term capital gain, currently subject to a \nmaximum tax rate of 15 percent, rather than being taxed as ordinary \nincome, currently subject to a maximum tax rate of 35 percent.\n\n  But a moment's analysis shows that this money is ordinary income by \nany fair definition and should be treated that way. The 20-percent fee \nis not capital gains, because it applies not to capital that the hedge \nfund manager\n\n[[Page S4282]]\n\nhas invested, but to the payment he receives for investing capital that \nother people provide. Pretending that the 20-percent fee is capital \ngains when, in fact, it is payment for a service is an ``Alice in \nWonderland'' argument that elevates fiction over fact.\n  We Democrats seek to end this fiction. We are ready to call carried \ninterest what it is--ordinary taxable income. Recognizing carried \ninterest for what it is would increase tax fairness for working \nAmericans who pay their fair share of taxes. They have the right to \nexpect that the wealthy do the same. It would reduce the deficit--if we \ndid this--by an estimated $21 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Republicans seek to protect this loophole. They say the income of \ninvestment managers is at risk from year to year and, therefore, \ndeserving of a lower tax rate. Well, ask the factory worker, who just \nsaw his or her job move overseas; ask the store clerk, who saw his \nemployer close because of the damage from the financial crisis; ask the \npart-time worker, whose hours and earnings go up and down from week to \nweek--ask all of them just how much risk working Americans face right \nnow.\n  Republicans say taxing this income as ordinary income would \ndiscourage investment in job creation, and that is absurd. The people \nwho are actually risking their capital--investors in these funds--will \ncontinue to see their profits taxed at the lower capital gains rate. \nThe issue in this case is income that these managers receive for \nserving their clients. If you are a hedge fund manager, your job is to \nmanage a hedge fund. The income you receive for that job is no \ndifferent than the income a waitress receives for waiting tables, or a \njanitor receives for scrubbing floors. The idea that the income of \nmillionaire fund managers should be taxed at a lower rate than that of \ntheir staff or other workers is an absurdity.\n  This nonsensical loophole is deeply unfair at a time when working \nfamilies are struggling, while the wealthiest among us continue to \nprosper greatly. Recent decades have seen a massive and growing \nprosperity gap between ordinary Americans and the wealthy. How wide has \nthat gap become? In 1980, the top 1 percent of American earners took \nhome about 10 percent of our Nation's total income. A few decades \nlater, that figure had increased to 24 percent of our Nation's total \nincome. That is just the wealthiest 1 percent that now have over 20 \npercent of our total income. It is hard to argue that properly taxing \ntheir income will impose great hardship on investment fund managers, \nwho have done awfully well in recent years.\n  How well have those investment fund managers done? According to a \nsurvey by a magazine covering the hedge fund industry, the top 25 hedge \nfund managers earned $22.7 billion last year. The two managers who \ntopped the list earned $80 billion each--that is billion with a ``B.'' \nThe typical American household earned perhaps $60,000 or $62,000 in \n2008. Those hedge fund managers earned in about 4 minutes what it took \na typical working family a year to earn. Yet they paid drastically \nlower rates on those massive incomes than the low-wage worker who \ncleaned their office. The Republicans would protect these \nunconscionable tax breaks while, at the same time, wanting to cut \nprograms that provide an education for our kids and provide health care \nfor our seniors.\n  It gets worse. Adding insult to injury, Republicans are protecting \nanother tax loophole--one that many of these hedge fund managers, by \nthe way, use to avoid taxes entirely. This loophole allows corporations \nand wealthy individuals to take income earned here in the United States \nand shift it to overseas tax havens, dodging U.S. taxes that they \nrightly owe.\n  I have long sought to end this abuse, because these offshore tax \nhavens increase the tax burden on those who pay the taxes they owe. In \nthe last Congress, I introduced the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, which \nwould seek to recover tax revenue now lost to offshore tax dodging.\n  Ending this loophole is significant if we seek to properly tax the \nincome of hedge fund managers. At one hearing of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, three well-known hedge \nfunds that claim to be based in the Cayman Islands admitted under \nquestioning that they did not have a single employee in the Cayman \nIslands. Closing the offshore loophole would make our effort to \nequitably tax carried interest all the more effective, by shutting off \na major avenue that hedge funds and other investment funds use to dodge \ntaxes.\n\n  Democrats have rightly proposed addressing the carried interest \nloophole and offshore tax havens and other unfair tax loopholes as part \nof a balanced deficit reduction strategy. We believe it is grossly \nunfair to cut programs that help young Americans get a college \neducation or help train working Americans for new jobs in order to \nprotect tax loopholes that benefit the wealthiest Americans.\n  The Republican response? To walk out of negotiations and say they \nwill not accept any deficit reduction package if it includes revenue \nmeasures.\n  Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If there is no other Senator waiting, I ask unanimous \nconsent to be permitted to continue for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  What the Republicans have done is to walk out of negotiations and say \nthey will not accept any deficit reduction package if it includes \nrevenue measures. So let's call this what it is. If Republicans refuse \nto consider compromise solutions, they are threatening all of us, the \nwhole country, with economic catastrophe in order to protect the sky-\nhigh income of millionaire hedge fund managers and offshore tax \navoiders. Those are two of the loopholes--two of many loopholes--we \nhave identified that should be closed that Republicans refuse to \nconsider closing. So what they are doing--and we should make no mistake \nabout this--is holding the well-being of all Americans hostage to the \ntax breaks of a wealthy few.\n  We all agree we must act to reduce the deficit. We have acknowledged, \nas Democrats, the need for spending cuts, even painful cuts to programs \nwe support. That is why I am so troubled by the utter refusal of the \nRepublicans to consider even modest compromises in the direction of new \nrevenue.\n  There is an overwhelming consensus among budget experts that we \ncannot achieve serious deficit reduction with spending cuts alone. \nThere is an overwhelming consensus among economists that drastic cuts \nin Federal outlays will threaten our economic recovery--just as such \ncuts have throttled recovery in other nations. And despite the \nfantasies of some in Congress, it is abundantly clear a failure to \nraise the debt ceiling would do incalculable harm to the recovery and \nto our standing in the world. Drawing lines in the sand, as the \nRepublicans have done, and refusing to compromise by walking out, has \nno place in the situation we face.\n  I urge the Republican leadership to abandon their uncompromising \npositions, to embrace solutions to the deficit and recognize that we \nall must sacrifice to address the deficit problem. The well-being of \nall of us, of all Americans, should not be held captive in the service \nof the most fortunate few.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if people have been following the debate \non the Senate floor this afternoon, they understand it is focused \nalmost exclusively on the Federal budget deficit and what we are going \nto do about it. It is a legitimate and timely question, because we are \nnow in negotiations at the highest levels--between the President and \nthe leaders in the House and Senate--to try to find some way through \nour impasse.\n  The challenge is to find a way to reduce America's deficit and, at \nthe end of the day, to extend our debt ceiling. The debt ceiling has a \ndeadline of August 2. We have never in our history\n\n[[Page S4283]]\n\nfailed to extend our debt ceiling. To fail to do so would be the \nequivalent of defaulting on a mortgage payment. And, of course, we all \nknow the consequences to any homeowner or family if that occurs. You \nunderstand your credit rating is not going to be the best after you \nhave defaulted. The same thing would be true with America. You also may \nfind the next time you need a mortgage that particular bank may not \nwant to lend to you again. The same thing is true with America. It has \na negative impact on your lifestyle. All of a sudden you are in a \nsuspect class and it isn't as easy to borrow money to buy a car or to \nmake some other purchase.\n  That is the risk we are running at the highest possible level when it \ncomes to this debt ceiling vote on August 2. We have never--underline \nthe word never--defaulted on a debt ceiling extension in the history of \nthe United States of America. That is the reason why the securities and \nbonds and stocks that are sold in this country enjoy a financial \nreputation better than most of the world. The United States is \npowerful, big, and trustworthy. We are going to lose that last word--\ntrustworthy--if we default on the debt ceiling. That is what we face on \nAugust 2.\n  There is a group in town here called the Bipartisan Policy Center, \nand they have kind of spelled out in specific terms what it would mean \nif we end up in default, and it is pretty grim. I have some charts here \nthat talk about what we would face if we defaulted on the debt ceiling \nextension on August 2.\n  The revenues for the month of August if we default will be $12 \nbillion in the United States, and the bills due on August 3 will be $32 \nbillion. The first day we will be $20 billion in the red, which means \nchoices will have to be made if we fail to extend the debt ceiling. And \nthey are hard choices. Let's take a look at some of those choices we \nwould have to face if we didn't have enough money to pay our bills.\n  Which of these don't get paid if Congress doesn't raise the debt \nceiling? Social Security? Medicare/Medicaid? Veterans' benefits? Those \nfirms that are supporting our war in Iraq and Afghanistan? IRS refunds \nto individuals and businesses? All of these would have to be brought \ninto question, because we cannot pay them all if we fail to extend the \ndebt ceiling.\n  This bipartisan policy center said, Let's consider one of the \noptions. Let's protect the biggest programs. Let's pay interest on \nAmerica's debt so we don't have any further default. Let's of course \npay Social Security; elderly folks, many of them, have no other source \nof income. We had better pay Medicare and Medicaid, because hospitals \nand doctors across America are taking care of sick people who are \nelderly and poor. We had better pay those defense firms, because if \nthey withdraw their services it can endanger our troops. And we had \nbetter pay unemployment compensation, because for these families there \nis no other source of income. So if we pay those, the ones I just \nlisted, we would be unable to pay the salaries of those in active \nmilitary service. We would be unable to pay veterans' benefits. We \nwould be unable to keep the courts open or pay the FBI. We couldn't \nprovide the money for education--that would be Pell grants, college \nstudent loans--and virtually everything else in government. What would \neverything else include? Air traffic controllers, the guards at Federal \nprisons.\n  If you think what I am describing here is just a scare tactic, it is \nnot. It is the reality of what happens when you default, and it is a \nreality that is being ignored by many on the other side of the aisle.\n  In fact, a fringe publication called the Washington Examiner, which \nis a very conservative Republican publication, today said: Don't worry \nabout it. Default on the debt ceiling. We can figure out a way through \nthis.\n  Well, I am sorry, but the reality of the choices facing us is that if \nwe choose not to extend the debt ceiling, then we are going to have \nnothing but terrible choices.\n  Here is another scenario, if you thought the first one was stark. \nLet's assume that we want to protect the most vulnerable in America \nwhere, in the month of August, we have $170 billion in income and $300 \nbillion in bills. So we pay interest on the debt, Social Security, \nMedicare/Medicaid, veterans, food stamps, housing for people who are \npoor, unemployment benefits, and education for the kids. Unpaid would \nbe the defense firms again, those men and women serving in our \nmilitary, even those in combat, the FBI, the courts, and everything \nelse in government. The options are grim and real.\n  I have heard my colleagues on the Republican side come to the floor \ntoday, and they are upset. They are upset at a speech given by the \nPresident yesterday. Well, the President understands the gravity of the \ndecision that is before us. The President has urged Members of Congress \nto get busy and help to solve the problem. I think he has a right to be \nupset, to some extent, and impatient.\n  It was 2 weeks ago that we had a negotiation underway with Vice \nPresident Biden, a bipartisan negotiation, Democrats and Republicans \nfrom the House and Senate. It fell apart when Congressman Cantor, Eric \nCantor, the House Republican leader, walked out and announced publicly, \nI am no longer part of this conversation. I think we have to stop this \nnegotiation, this bipartisan negotiation. I am handing it over to the \nSpeaker of the House John Boehner. He can talk to the President.\n  That, to me, was the height of irresponsibility. If you are given a \nresponsibility to sit in those sessions to try to spare the United \nStates from this terrible outcome, picking up your marbles and going \nhome is not a good option, even if you hand it over to your boss, the \nSpeaker of the House. What it did was to break down those bipartisan \nnegotiations. What we thought might lead to a solution has fallen apart \nwhen the House Republican leader walked out. Now the President is \ntrying to pick up the pieces and put it back together and move us \ntoward a solution, and if he was impatient about it yesterday, he has a \nright to be.\n  One of the very serious problems we face is if we want to deal with \nthis deficit in real terms, make a real impact on it, we have got to \nhave more bipartisan cooperation. That is a cliche around here, but it \nis a fact.\n  I was on the President's Deficit Commission, the Bowles-Simpson \nCommission. I sat there for almost 10 months, and I listened to \neverything. I tried to learn as best I could what we were facing, and \nat the end of the day I voted for the Commission report. Eleven out of \n18 of us did, a bipartisan report. It was tough and it wasn't easy, and \nthere were parts of it that I hated as a Democrat. Yet I knew that if \nwe were going to solve this problem, there was no other way to do it. \nWe had to say to those on the Republican side of the aisle, you have to \nstep up with us and find ways to bring revenue to our government.\n  Today we are bringing in 14 percent of our gross domestic product in \nFederal revenue, Federal tax receipts. Gross domestic product is the \nsum total of our economy, all the production of goods and services; 14 \npercent of it comes in in Federal revenue, 24 percent goes out in \nFederal payments, spending. That 10-percent difference equals the \nannual deficit.\n  Ten years ago, we were in balance. When President William Jefferson \nClinton left office, the Federal budget was balanced, 10 years ago. At \nthat moment in time, the net national debt of the United States of \nAmerica, from George Washington through William Jefferson Clinton's 8 \nyears, was $5 trillion.\n  Eight years later, when President George W. Bush left office, the \nnational debt had grown from $5 trillion to $11 trillion, more than \ndoubled in an 8-year period of time. You ask yourself, how could that \nhappen in 8 years that we would fall so deeply into debt? There are \nthree basic reasons it happened:\n  We fought two wars and we didn't pay for them. So the expense of \nthose wars was added directly to our national debt. The President's \neconomic theory was: The best way to move the economy was for us to \ngive tax breaks to the wealthiest people in America, and he did it in \nthe midst of a war, something no President had ever done, which \ndirectly added to the debt, and he signed into law programs that \nweren't paid for, expensive programs. So we ended up with an $11 \ntrillion debt facing the new President, then President Obama, being \nsworn in and a failed economic policy with hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans out of work\n\n[[Page S4284]]\n\nand losing jobs by the day. That is what the President inherited.\n  He has tried to right the ship and move us forward, and it has been \nhard and it has been slow and it has been frustrating. I think he has \ndone his best, and I think he has done a good job at it.\n  First, he put in a stimulus package of about $800 billion. As the \nPresiding Officer here knows, 40 percent of that was tax cuts, tax cuts \nto the families across America to help them out of the recession. \nAnother 25 percent of it went to building roads and bridges and \nhighways and high-speed rail, infrastructure that will serve America \nfor generations. The remainder of that went into helping State and \nlocal governments get through difficult times. We sent extra money to \nStates because we knew a lot of people were out of work. They would \nneed unemployment checks, they would need help to pay their hospital \nbills. We put that money into a stimulus package to stop what was a \nhemorrhaging in this economy, and I think it worked to slow down the \ndecline. It did not turn it around as quickly as we liked.\n  Then last December the President said, on a bipartisan basis I will \nagree with the Republicans to extend all tax cuts for everybody, \nhighest income to lowest income, and extend unemployment benefit \npayments. We passed that as well.\n  The President has tried, and we are coming forward out of the \nrecession ever so slowly. Now we run the very risk of not extending the \ndebt ceiling and plunging ourselves back into a recession even worse \nthan where we started. So is the President impatient? You bet he is. \nImpatient to the point where he invited Congress to maybe come to work \nnext week.\n  Many of us had felt we could spend a few days back home. I was going \nto spend the time after the 4th of July traveling around my State. It \nis a big State; but I guess it is clear now that my job is to be here, \nand I will be, along with other Members.\n  The House will be in session. We are in a strange period of time here \nwhere the House of Representatives comes and goes even when the Senate \nis in session, so we kind of see each other in passing. Well, we will \nboth be together next week, and I hope we will stay here and get this \njob done. The House is scheduled to go into another recess July 17 to \n23, and I certainly hope they don't do that. They had better stay in \ntown. Let's get this done before August 2.\n  We have a serious problem facing us with job creation in this \ncountry. There is no question about it. I think we can move forward as \nlong as we understand some basics.\n  The key to creating jobs in America is an expanding positive economy. \nIt is a feeling by people in this country and around the world that we \nare moving forward. And, sadly, people are not going to get that \nfeeling unless we get our act together in Washington. It means \nDemocrats and Republicans working together.\n  I have tried for about 5 or 6 months now with a bipartisan group of \nSenators to come up with a way to do this; and, unfortunately, one of \nthe Republican Senators from Oklahoma walked away from that \nconversation as well. But we still have a job ahead of us, and it is \none that we ought to face.\n  I sincerely believe that the Bowles-Simpson Commission is the right \nparadigm, the right direction for us in terms of where our Nation and \nour budget should go. It calls for some changes many Democrats will \nfind painful and changes Republicans will have to struggle to accept as \nwell, but those are the changes that will be needed.\n  If we fail to include revenue in this discussion about reducing the \ndebt, if it is just spending cuts, it can only go so far. If we include \nrevenue, we can talk about a much bigger package of deficit reduction, \nmuch more credible, with a more positive impact.\n  During the course of the last 2 days, we have tried to identify on \nthe floor some parts of the Tax Code that can be changed to save money \nfor our economy. Each year, our Tax Code, that body of laws relating to \ntaxes in America, provides deductions and credits and exclusions and \nspecial treatment that spares individuals and companies from paying \n$1.1 trillion in taxes each year. It includes such things as the \nemployers exclusion of health insurance premiums, mortgage interest \ndeductions, charitable deductions, State and local tax payments. All of \nthese things and many others are included in that Tax Code. It is rare \nthat we open that Tax Code and ask the question, Is this needed?\n  In the last few days we have come to the floor and talked to the tax \nsubsidies and tax breaks that aren't needed that, frankly, have to be \nsacrificed in order to get this economy back on its feet. We talked \nabout one that is incredible. In the first quarter of this year, \nExxonMobil declared profits of $10 billion, one of the most profitable \nquarters in the history of American business, and we as taxpayers \ncontinue to subsidize ExxonMobil. Why? They are doing quite well. And \nremember the last time you filled your tank with gas? It doesn't look \nas though they are sparing us when it comes to raising the price of a \ngallon of gas. So I think that subsidy should go. Subsidies to the oil \nand gas companies at this moment in history are unacceptable. We have a \nthriving profitable industry that does not need a Federal tax crutch.\n  Take a look at some of the others we have talked about as well. Do \nyou know we provide tax subsidies for American businesses that want to \nship their jobs overseas? We call it deferral of income. It is one of \nthe most expensive parts of the Tax Code. It says if you want to move \nyour business overseas and produce overseas and generate a profit, you \ncan hang on to that money. You don't have to pay taxes on it. We defer \nthe payment of taxes. There is a tax break for a company that has \ndecided to pick up and leave America and go someplace else. Why? Why \nwould we create a tax incentive to do that? If a company decides that \nis the way to make a profit, so be it. I am sorry they would be leaving \nAmerica, but for goodness sake, they shouldn't expect us and we \nshouldn't volunteer to subsidize that decision that costs good-paying \njobs in our country.\n  There are a variety of other smaller tax subsidies, those we have to \nraise questions about. That is for sure. Tax subsidies for people who \nare lucky enough to own a yacht? We want to give them a tax subsidy? Or \npeople who are lucky enough to own a jet plane? People who are lucky \nenough to have thoroughbred horses? Most of the winners who stand at \nthe winner's circle of these race don't look like regular working \nstiffs. They look like folks who are doing pretty well in life. Why is \nthe Tax Code subsidizing that particular industry? I think it is a \nvaluable and important question.\n  Why don't we put these things on the table? Why don't we ask \nourselves whether, at a time of deficit, when we need to not only \nreduce spending but come up with revenue, that there are some things we \ncan no longer afford under our Tax Code?\n  Bowles-Simpson went a step further and said, If you start making \nsubstantial changes and reducing the tax expenditures, deductions, and \ncredits, you can actually reduce marginal income tax rates for \nindividuals and businesses. I think that is a valuable thing to look \nat. We don't have to eliminate everything in the Tax Code, but making \nsubstantial changes could result in a fairer, more comprehensive tax \nsystem.\n  Let me say one other thing that I think is guiding me in this debate \nand I think you as well. I think about an America, a nation of values \nthat has always said we have got to care for the most vulnerable people \nin our country. Some of these people, through no fault of their own, \nwere born with physical and mental shortcomings and limitations. Some \nof them are dealing with illnesses that we wouldn't wish on anyone. \nMany come from an impoverished background and are struggling to make do \nwith the basics in life. I feel, at the end of the day, we can make \nthis economy move forward, and we can do it in a sensible and humane \nway. We can protect the basic safety net. One of the elements in that \nsafety net is Medicaid.\n\n  Yesterday, I had a meeting with some people I respect very much. They \ncame in to see me. They represented the heads of children's hospitals \nfrom all over the United States, even from your State. My family has \nrelied on those children's hospitals in Washington, DC, and in Chicago \nand other places, and thank goodness they are\n\n[[Page S4285]]\n\nthere. I do not know of a more caring, competent profession in America.\n  More than most hospitals, children's hospitals bring in patients on \nMedicaid. These are patients who are not from families who are wealthy, \nthey are not from families who have private health insurance policies--\nno, by and large, they are the poorest families.\n  One-third of the children in America are covered by Medicaid. That is \nwhere they get their health care. If we talk about cutting back on \nMedicaid, this program for low-income and disabled people, those \nchildren will be unfortunate victims in that budget discussion. Also, a \nlarge part of Medicaid goes for elderly people who have spent their \nlife savings and are living their last years in nursing homes and \nconvalescent centers. Medicaid pays that. Cutbacks in Medicaid run the \nreal risk of pushing those people out of quality care into lower \nquality care or the streets.\n  Is that what America is all about? Would we preserve a tax break for \na person who owns thoroughbred horses and then say that unfortunately \nthat elderly lady has to leave the nursing home she has been in? Would \nwe preserve a tax break for someone who owns a yacht and say that \nunfortunately we will not be able to cover the cost of a needed surgery \nfor a poor child at a children's hospital in Chicago.\n  If that sounds like an exaggeration, it is not. That is what this \ndebate comes to--whether we want to defend tax breaks for the well-off \npeople in America at the expense of the most vulnerable. We are better \nthan that, and most well-off people whom I know--and I have friends who \nare doing very well in life--would not be afraid to pay a little bit \nmore in taxes to make sure America continues to move forward. They feel \nblessed to be part of this country and blessed to be successful in this \ncountry, and they do not resent the suggestion that they need to pay a \nlittle more when times are difficult. They are certainly prepared to \nsacrifice.\n  Some come to the floor here and think it is an outrage to ask oil \ncompanies not to take a subsidy in their most profitable year. They \nthink it is an outrage to ask the most wealthy people in America to \ngive up a tax break on a jet they happen to own and use for personal \npurposes or business purposes. I don't think that is what America is \nabout, and I don't think that is what we should be about.\n  Let's come together in a bipartisan fashion and make the spending \ncuts which need to be made, both on the defense side and the nondefense \nside, and then deal with revenue sources, either making certain that \nthose in the highest income categories are paying their fair share of \ntaxes or at least do not receive the current tax subsidies that are \ngoing their way, and let's deal with the reality of this budget \ndeficit.\n  Time is a-wasting. If we wait until August 1 to get this done, it may \nbe too late. At some point, if we are not careful, 30 bond dealers \nsomewhere in the United States or some other country may start this \nball rolling before we do. If they do, questioning the credit \nreputation of the United States of America, interest rates will start \nmoving up and we will not be able to move fast enough to stop it. That \nis why the President was impatient yesterday. That is why we should be \nin session this next week. And that is why we need to start rolling up \nour sleeves and stop walking out of meetings on budget negotiations and \nstay in the room until we get the job done.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to be sure where we are now. \nAre we in morning business at this point in time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask that only so I have some \nrecognition of what the time availability is. I do not plan to take too \nlong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10-minute grants.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wonder what the American public \nthinks about when they see an empty Chamber, hear mutterings about \nclass warfare. What puzzles me is, which class is making war against \nwhich class and where are the casualties? As we look around, I ask the \nquestion, Are we picking on the poor rich folk, those with abundant \nwealth, those who earn over $1 million a year, those who have been \nfortunate enough to have been able to bring their talent, their \nability, to the world's most important stage? Are they immune from \ntaking a bit part on the stage of human concerns once in a while \nbecause they are being asked to make an extra contribution to the well-\nbeing of our country? I don't think so. I don't think so. I am one of \nthose who are fortunate and feel lucky enough to succeed because of a \ngovernment action. Few of us--certainly not me--who served in the \nmilitary achieved the status of a hero like our friend, Dan Inouye, who \nsacrificed so greatly for his country and has the highest medal awarded \nfor bravery America can give. But because I did my duty, I was serious \nabout it, and I served overseas, I was rewarded with the GI bill to pay \nmy college education and even given a little stipend with that. It \nturned my life around. It enabled me to be one of three founders of a \ncompany called ADP, a company employing 45,000 people.\n\n  Our parents were poor. We worried about meals on the table. We \ncouldn't afford the right kind of clothing. We couldn't afford a \nbicycle that my mother bought me for my birthday. My father argued \nabout whether it had to be taken back because it was $1 a week and we \ncouldn't afford it.\n  Mr. President, 45,000 people. ADP is one of America's most successful \ncompanies. I don't want to dwell on this, but it's one of the companies \nwith the longest growth record in profits, 10 percent each and every \nyear, for 42 years in a row--42 years in a row. A kid from the back of \nthe candy store.\n  So I look at our country, and I look at what it is we are trying to \ndo, and it is hard to figure out. What happened? Why are we looking at \nthese drastic cuts in programs that can help people? Why are we not \nengaged in ways to help people, to continue to provide help and \nassistance to help them get along in life and to be prepared to take \nover the leadership of the future.\n  Are our friends on the Republican side willing to end Medicare as we \nknow it, decimating one of the most successful programs in the history \nof our country? They are willing to unravel the very fabric of our \nNation and critical services that helped families struggling to give \ntheir kids a decent education, good health, a future, a job \nopportunity? What is it they want to take away with these cuts?\n  I can tell you, as a businessman for a long time--30 years before I \ngot here--I am accustomed to looking at business sheets and financial \nstatements. And one doesn't have to be an accountant or executive to \nunderstand that on a financial statement there are two parts, two \nsignificant parts: one is expenses, costs; the other is revenues. \nRevenues is the income you have to get in order to be able to afford to \npay the expenses. If all you want to do is just cut expenses, then you \nare cutting the sinew and the flesh and there is not much left.\n  Here is what ought to happen--we should be saying to those who are \nthe wealthiest: living with wealth is a pleasure, but that doesn't mean \nyou don't have an obligation to the country and to have to do something \na little different. Instead, they are making the wealthy wealthier, the \nmost privileged more privileged than they have been, and that is true.\n  When you look at the big oil companies pocketing $4 billion a year \neach and every year, those are tax breaks that are unconscionable. But \nwhen you look at this--and I think about a period of time when I was \ngrowing up, and I look at a time during the war, World War II, and we \nhad a program called the Excess Profits Tax. We said those companies \nare making so much money, they have to do their share and be helpful to \nthe country at large and to make certain they pay some share of what \nthe country is going through.\n  I just checked because I wanted to be sure. To date we have lost \n4,400 Americans to the war in Iraq. We have lost over 1,600 to the war \nin Afghanistan. Those are homes that are without a son, a daughter, a \nbrother, a father at\n\n[[Page S4286]]\n\nhome. Where is the sacrifice on the part of the others here? No, no. We \nhave to take care of the rich. We have to make sure they are more \ncomfortable than they are. Whether it is a bigger yacht or a bigger \nairplane or a bigger house, we have to protect those people. They don't \nneed any protection. What they need to do is share in the pain America \nis going through, and this is a reminder for me.\n  Make no mistake, greed is the fuel that drives Big Oil, and it is \ntime we end their free ride on the taxpayers' dime. The big five oil \ncompanies have made almost $1 trillion in profit in the past decade. \nThat is quite a reward for these folks. BP, $7.1 billion in the first 3 \nmonths of 2011 as they ground out the environment in the Gulf of \nMexico. Imagine, $7.1 billion. ExxonMobil, $10 billion in a quarter. \nShell, $8 billion. These are rounding numbers in a quarter. They don't \nneed help. What they need is to help their country work its way through \nthe crisis that we are in now.\n  But then we see what is being asked by those on the other side: They \nwant us to have sympathy, have sensitivity toward the wealthiest among \nus because they cannot afford extra money. They cannot afford it--no, \nthey cannot afford it because the other people are doing the \nsacrificial work and they don't want to help those kids get an \neducation. They don't want to help those families to be able to provide \na future for their children. They don't want to be able to help the \nfamilies who need health care for the job market. That is not what they \nare about. So why should we use some of the money to invest in America, \ntake down our debt, prepare young people for responsibilities for the \nfuture.\n  Big Oil's greed is helping to inflate our deficit and every day \nAmericans are footing the bill, going up to the gas station. When \nsomebody has to spend $40 to $50 to fill up a tank of gas, very often \nit is at a sacrifice for other things in their lives. It is terrible. \nAnd you see this all over.\n  We have a Republican Governor in the State of New Jersey right now, \nwho is doing major cutting, and the result is that a family who makes \n$24,000 a year now, family income, will have to spend over $1,000 a \nyear more for their health services. Mr. President, $1,000 to a family \nmaking $24,000 gross. A family who earns $60,000 will have to spend \nover $3,000 to pay for their health care.\n  Why wouldn't my colleagues on the other side--there are a lot of \nintelligent people, and I am sure they are sympathetic people--want to \nput a stop to this madness? Why wouldn't they say: Time to run up the \nflag, and we are all proud to be Americans, and we are grateful for \nwhat has happened to us? Instead they are saying: You have to have \nmore. If you make $10 million a year, you have to have more. If you \nmake $20 million or more--whatever it is--you need more. It is an \noutrage.\n  Big Oil is doing everything in its power to protect its subsidies, \nand the Republicans are doing everything in their power to help them. \nLast month 45 Republican Senators voted against ending these wasteful \nsubsidies and using the money to reduce the deficit. Last week they \nchose to walk out on deficit-reduction negotiations rather than even \nconsidering putting a stop to Big Oil giveaways.\n  Making oil companies pay their fair share in taxes is not going to \nhurt the industry. It just means Big Oil executives might have to do \nwith a smaller swimming pool or wait a little while longer to buy a \nbigger yacht. It is clearly offensive, and they are not helping. They \nare not helping lift the spirit of America. People are discouraged. \nThey are worried about losing their homes. They are worried about their \nkids not be being able to get an education that they are emotionally, \nintellectually qualified for because they don't have the money because \nit is not available to them.\n  When we look at what has happened here--and you have to be fair. When \nthis poor guy, the CEO of Exxon, is earning only $29 million a year, \ncome on. Give him a break. He has to have a chance to preserve more of \nthat income. Why should he pay to help this country weather the storm, \nweather the wars, weather the recession?\n  ConocoPhillips, he is not doing as good as the first guy. He only \nmade $18 million in 2010. The third one, Chevron, their CEO only made \n$16 million. You know how the money gets to them? Through nickels, \ndimes, quarters, and dollars at the gasoline pump. That is how the \nmoney gets to them. How else can this CEO pay be afforded except from \nthose who pull up to the gas station and say they have to buy 10 \ngallons of gas. Mr. President, 10 gallons of gas around here is about \n$45. It is a lot of money.\n  But instead of being fiscally responsible by ending the Big Oil big \nwindfall, Republicans have another idea. They want to cut the deficit \nby ending Medicare as we know it, the most successful program in \nAmerican history, perhaps, next to Social Security.\n  Seniors are struggling, Big Oil certainly is not. I don't think these \nfellows are struggling. I don't think they are doing without anything. \nI wish the other side would listen a little more closely to what the \nAmerican people want. Almost three-quarters of the Americans want us to \nstop giving billions of tax breaks to big oil companies each year. The \nAmerican people know these subsidies are unnecessary, ineffective, and \nbasically immoral.\n  We should take the $4 billion we give away to Big Oil each year and \nuse that money to pay down our deficit. That is a good idea. If we can \ndo that, then it starts to make things a lot easier to continue to \nprovide the services that are critical, essential to the average \nfamily.\n  We cannot restore fiscal sanity here until we start paying more \nattention to the revenue column in our ledger. As I said before, I was \na CEO for many years, 30 years before I got here, and I know you cannot \nrun a company or a country without a good, strong revenue flow. So I \ncall on my colleagues, please, listen to what your country needs. See \nwhat you can do to make the country stronger. If our middle class, our \nmodest-income class starts to fail along the way, we will not be able \nto conduct business as usual. It is for your own protection. Get with \nit. Make sure they understand that you cannot just get more of what is \ncoming out; that you have to give something back to this great country \nof ours.\n  I call on my colleagues: Get Big Oil off the Federal welfare roll. \nLet's invest in our country's future and not have larger windfalls for \noil industry lobbyists and lawyers. We have to make sure our children \nand our grandchildren inherit a country that is fiscally sound, morally \nresponsible, able to provide health care, able to provide an education, \nable to guarantee that a child can prepare to be a leader in the \nfuture. We have to make sure that everybody sees a chance for \nthemselves to succeed, to not be dependent on government programs, but \nat least be able to have those programs to get them started in life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4286-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4286-S4287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                 Chief Warrant Officer Kenneth R. White\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today we honor the life and heroic \nsacrifice of CWO Kenneth R. White of Fort Collins, CO. He died on June \n5, 2011, in Khost Province, Afghanistan, of injuries sustained when his \nhelicopter crashed during combat. He was 35 years old.\n  Chief Warrant Officer White's family remembers him as a wonderful man \nof God, an extraordinary husband, and a loving father to his three \nchildren. He was a respectful and courageous friend, who demonstrated \nthose attributes in abundance as a successful officer.\n  After joining the Army in 1994, Chief Warrant Officer White grew in \nhis career and attended warrant officer flight training in 2002. He \nfought bravely during two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. Most \nrecently, he served in support of Operation Enduring Freedom as a \nmember of the 1st Battalion, 10th Aviation Regiment, 10th Aviation \nCombat Brigade, 10th Mountain Division based at Fort Drum, NY.\n  His bravery and outstanding service quickly won the recognition of \nhis commanders. Chief Warrant Officer White earned, among other \ndistinctions, the Bronze Star Medal, the Air Medal, the Army \nCommendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal, the National Defense \nService Medal with Bronze Service Star, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal \nwith Bronze Service Star, the Iraq Campaign Medal with Bronze Service \nStar, and two Global War on Terrorism Service Medals.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A\n\n[[Page S4287]]\n\nman who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Chief Warrant \nOfficer White's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by \nselflessly putting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He \nlived with a sense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  I stand with people in Colorado and nationwide in profound gratitude \nfor Chief Warrant Officer White's tremendous sacrifice. At substantial \npersonal risk, he fought in Afghanistan with unwavering courage to \nprotect America's citizens and the freedoms we hold dear. For his \nservice and the lives he touched, Chief Warrant Officer White will \nforever be remembered as one of our country's bravest.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Chief Warrant Officer \nWhite's parents, John and Linda, his wife Sarah, their three children, \nand his entire family, who carry on his memory and will forever remind \nus of his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4287-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FOURTH OF JULY MESSAGE FOR THE TROOPS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, 235 years ago this weekend, \nJohn Adams proclaimed that July 2 would mark the most memorable epoch \nin the history of America. It was on that day the Continental Congress \ndeclared the 13 colonies free and independent of Great Britain's Crown. \nIt was 2 days after that when Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of \nIndependence was adopted.\n  And when did Americans first celebrate their independence?\n  Philadelphia threw a big party on July 8, 1776, including a parade \nand the firing of guns. George Washington, then camped near New York \nCity, heard the news on July 9 and celebrated then. But in 1781, \nMassachusetts became the first State to recognize July 4 as a State \ncelebration. Ten years later, the young Nation's celebration was dubbed \nIndependence Day.\n  This Independence Day I hope every American will stop and think for \njust a minute about our freedoms--and just how much we owe those who \ncame here long before us and mutually pledged to each other their \nlives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor. And let us also remember \nthe young men and women who have died in defense of those freedoms.\n  We traditionally observe the Fourth with fireworks and fanfare, pomp \nand parade. But today we remain engaged in far-away struggles to \npromote and protect the rights of others who, like us, value freedom \nand independence. Many of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and \ncoastguardsmen are spending their Fourth in Iraq and Afghanistan and \nother parts of world.\n  I recently was reminded of the commitment and selfless sacrifice \ndemonstrated by one of America's World War II veterans, who lives in my \nState of Florida.\n  U.S. Army SSG Robert Rickel, of Boca Raton, served as a waist gunner \non a B-17 Flying Fortress. Sergeant Rickel survived the daring bombing \ncampaign of Schweinfurt, Germany, in October 1943, and was awarded the \nDistinguished Flying Cross for his heroism or extraordinary \nachievement.\n  Sergeant Rickel and all the military members and all their families \nknew the risks and sacrifices they were making were worth it. As \nPresident Reagan once said, ``Some things are worth dying for . . . \ndemocracy is worth dying for, because it's the most deeply honorable \nform of government ever devised by man.''\n  Indeed, our democracy is something to celebrate. Mr. President, I \nwish everyone a Happy Fourth of July.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4287-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WOMEN WORKING IN NON TRADITIONAL (WIN) JOBS ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I strongly support the Women Working in \nNon Traditional Jobs Act, introduced by Senators Gillibrand and myself \nlate last week. This legislation would encourage local and State \nworkforce systems to think differently about how they train and prepare \nwomen for jobs in which they are not well-represented. Women currently \nrepresent half of our Nation's workforce, but two-thirds of these women \nare concentrated in 21 of 500 occupational jobs. Nontraditional jobs, \nin which women make up 25 percent or less of employees, pay 20-30 \npercent more than traditionally female jobs. Because of this \ndiscrepancy, it is important to establish a program that will aid women \nin moving away from occupations they have traditionally held, which are \nby and large lower paying than occupations where men are concentrated. \nI have always been a strong advocate for equal opportunity in the \nworkforce. This bill would create a new Federal grant program designed \nto help women find these high-wage nontraditional jobs.\n  Currently, there is only one Federal grant program designed to train \nwomen for nontraditional jobs: the Women in Apprenticeship and \nNontraditional Occupations, WANTO, but this program is under-resourced \nand overly narrow in scope. WANTO is 17 years old, has been funded at \nonly $1 million for years, and is specifically designed to increase \nwomen's participation in the construction industry. The Women WIN Jobs \nAct would expand the work of WANTO by authorizing up to $100 million \nfor recruiting, training, placing, and retaining women in \nnontraditional occupations that are high-demand, and high-growth.\n  Women have difficulty entering nontraditional fields because they \nlack sufficient information about career opportunities and pathways. \nWithout sufficient training, preparation, or information, women will \nnot be able to fully participate in the Nation's workforce and will \ncontinue to be underrepresented in high-earning and in-demand fields. \nThis bill would address that problem by encouraging workforce systems \nto give women the support and preparation they need to compete for \nnontraditional jobs. Preparing women for work in nontraditional fields \nis crucial to success in the workforce and general economic success for \nour country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4287-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4287-S4288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO GLENN M. ENGELMANN\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \nrespected member of Delaware's business community and a valued leader \nin our community, Glenn M. Engelmann, as he embarks upon his retirement \nfollowing a long and distinguished career.\n  A native of Brooklyn, NY, Glenn earned a bachelor of arts degree in \npolitical science from the State University of New York at Binghamton \nand later went on to receive his juris doctor from the prestigious \nUniversity of Chicago Law School.\n  In 1986, Glenn joined the law department of ICI Americas Inc, later \nknown as Zeneca Group PLC. In that role, he provided legal advice \nprincipally for ICI Americas' pharmaceuticals business. Glenn then \nserved as counsel to the advanced materials business and, in 1991, was \nappointed as group counsel for ICI Pharmaceuticals. A few years later, \nin 1993, Glenn was appointed vice president, general counsel and \nsecretary for Zeneca. He remained as the leader of Zeneca's, and later \nAstraZeneca U.S.'s, legal affairs and promotional regulatory review \nuntil today. This month, Glenn will leave his post as vice president \nand general counsel for AstraZeneca U.S. and commence his retirement.\n  Outside of AstraZeneca U.S., Glenn is no stranger to his community. \nIn addition to helping to lead one of the world's largest \npharmaceutical companies, Glenn is the president of the board of \ndirectors for the Jewish Federation of Delaware and honorary board \nmember of Children & Families First, an organization that provides \nservices, training and support to thousands of people across the State \nof Delaware each year. He has also served on the board of Jewish Family \nServices of Delaware, where he was president from 2000 to 2002.\n  When he is not working or serving our community, one could probably \nfind Glenn at Citizens Bank Park watching the Philadelphia Phillies or \nat the Wells Fargo Center cheering for the Philadelphia 76ers. Or \nperhaps he might be reliving his ``glory days,'' listening to The Boss \nBruce Springsteen--the Rolling Stones or the Beatles. And while I have \nheard nothing but jokes regarding Glenn's golf game, I assume he is \ntrying to get better. Maybe he can improve during retirement.\n  A devoted family man, Glenn and his wife Michelle have three \nchildren: Harris, Jason and Rachel, as well as a dog\n\n[[Page S4288]]\n\nnamed Cleo. He has no doubt had a profound influence on his children's \nacademic and career paths. Harris is going to be a junior at Washington \nUniversity in St. Louis this fall. Jason is embarking on his second \nyear at Duke Law, and Rachel recently earned a master's in Public \nHealth from the University of Michigan and now works for Abbott \nPharmaceutical. Upon his retirement, Glenn will leave behind a legacy \nof commitment to his work and public service both for his children and \nfor the generations that will follow them.\n  I join Glenn's family and colleagues in congratulating him--a leader \nin his field and in our community--as he celebrates the completion of a \nsuccessful career and begins a new chapter in his life. I wish him and \nhis family only the very best in all that lies ahead for each of \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4288-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING PAULINO ``PAUL'' ZATICA\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, this year we are celebrating the \n100th birthday of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Incorporated. Next week, \nthousands of members and guests from all over the world are coming to \nIndianapolis, IN, to participate in a week-long program of forums and \nseminars with a focus on leadership, brotherhood, and service, known as \nthe 80th Grand Chapter Meeting and Centennial Celebration.\n  Kappa Alpha Psi was founded on January 5, 1911, on the campus of \nIndiana University in Bloomington, IN. Led by the vision of Elder \nWatson Diggs, it was founded by 10 God-fearing, serious-minded young \nmen who possessed the imagination, ambition, courage, and determination \nto defy custom in pursuit of college educations and careers during an \noppressive time in American history for African Americans.\n  Now, the membership has grown to more than 360 undergraduate chapters \nand 347 alumni chapters located throughout the United States and five \nforeign countries including 35 chapters in Louisiana. Today, the \nfraternity boasts a membership of more than 150,000 college-trained \nyoung men.\n  Kappa Alpha Psi has been an instrumental group in raising the profile \nof African-American men and has worked tirelessly to knock down \nbarriers to advancement in our society. The brotherhood has \nconsistently encouraged achievement in every field of human endeavor.\n  I also would like to take this opportunity to commend attorney Dwayne \nMurray. Professionally, Dwayne not only founded and continues to manage \nhis own law firm but he became the first African American appointed to \nthe District 7 Panel of Trustees for the U.S. Middle District \nBankruptcy Court. He was recognized by the Louisiana Legislature as an \n``Honorary State Representative'' and the Governor's Office as an \n``Outstanding Citizen'' for his community service and efforts to bring \nlay and professional people into the political process. Today Dwayne \ncurrently serves as the 31st Grand Polemarch of Kappa Alpha Psi \nFraternity, Incorporated, and is a resident of the great State of \nLouisiana. Under his extraordinary leadership, the organization has \ninitiated several community service projects, including ``Sunday of \nHope.'' Through this effort, Kappa Alpha Psi has raised well over \n$500,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital during the past 2 \nyears. Dwayne has also spearheaded the ``Greeks Learning to Avoid \nDebt'' or GLAD Program. This program will ensure that college students \nreceive the necessary training to use credit wisely and remain \nfinancially stable through college and beyond. A final noteworthy \naccomplishment, Dwayne founded Kappa Kamp, a rigorous leadership \ninstitute for elementary and middle school aged young men. The Baton \nRouge Alumni Chapter continues to raise money to support Dwayne's \nproject through the annual Walter Banks Golf Classic.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, Kappas from \nall over the country came to the aid of hurricane survivors along the \ngulf coast and helped with our recovery effort.\n  Thus, it is with great pride that we not only congratulate all \nmembers of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. on the occasion of their \ncentennial celebration, but I would also like to recognize my \nconstituent and friend, Dwayne Murray, as he approaches the end of his \ntenure as Grand Polemarch of this great organization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4288-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             PROFESSIONAL VOWS OF SISTER MARY OF THE SAVIOR\n\n Mr. LEAHY.

MARSH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Henry \nG. Marsh, a tireless and dedicated community leader in Saginaw, MI, who \npassed away on May 11, 2011. Mr. Marsh was an important figure in the \ncivil rights community in Saginaw, as well as in politics, for many \nyears. He accomplished much throughout his professional life and has \nforged an impressive legacy that will surely inspire many for years to \ncome.\n  Henry G. Marsh was born on October 11, 1921, to Thomas and Saidye \nMarsh. Upon graduating from Greenwood High School, Mr. Marsh joined the \nArmy. After his military service, Mr. Marsh earned a degree from \nKnoxville College in Knoxville, TN, and later a law degree from Wayne \nState University.\n  In 1954, Mr. Marsh moved to Saginaw and quickly became actively \ninvolved in community affairs in the city. He would soon accept a \nposition as legal counsel for the NAACP, and would eventually become \nchairman of the Human Relations Commission. Henry Marsh was committed \nto serving the needs of the Saginaw community and served in various \npositions and as chairman of many committees and boards throughout his \nadult life in Saginaw, MI.\n\n[[Page S4289]]\n\n  In 1961, Mr. Marsh became the first African American to be elected to \nthe Saginaw City Council, and in 1967, became Saginaw's first Black \nmayor. Shortly after becoming mayor, he formed a 220-member Committee \non Civil Rights, made up of homemakers, factory workers, ministers, \nbusiness owners and members of civil rights organizations, that sought \nto bring the city together to solve the many issues the city faced at \nthe time. Reflecting on his stint as mayor, he was quoted in the \nSaginaw News in a 2000 interview as saying that the commission was \n``the most important thing I ever did. We discussed the legitimate \nconcerns of this city.''\n  Henry Marsh was a devoted husband and family man. He was married to \nhis wife Ruth for 63 years, and they were blessed with three children, \nMichael, Walter and Teresa.\n  This is, indeed, a great loss to the many people who knew Henry Marsh \nand to the many more that have benefited from his life's work. I know \nmy colleagues join me in paying tribute to the life and work of Henry \nG. Marsh. I am sure his family takes comfort in knowing that his \naccomplishments will be honored and remembered for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4289-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL ROBERT E.

Durbin will retire \non August 1 after more than 36 years of distinguished service to the \nArmy and the Nation.\n  Throughout his career, General Durbin has personified the Army values \nof duty, integrity, and selfless service across the many missions to \nwhich he has contributed.\n  General Durbin, a resident of Pennsylvania, graduated from the U.S. \nMilitary Academy in 1975 and then went on to receive a master's degree \nin mechanical engineering from Pennsylvania State University.\n  He has served in a variety of command and staff assignments, leading \nmen and women during times of peace and war. Over the course of almost \nfour decades of service, he has commanded at the platoon, company, \nbattalion, and brigade levels.\n  Furthermore, he served as the commanding general of the Combined \nSecurity Transition Command--Afghanistan, the command that plays such a \ncritical role in training the Afghan National Security Forces. He \nsubsequently became the commanding general of the 1st Infantry Division \nand Fort Riley.\n  General Durbin has spent the last 3 years serving as the director of \nthe Army's Office of Business Transformation, where he was responsible \nfor leading the Army's efforts to operate more cost-consciously while \nstill providing the best trained and equipped force. During one of the \nmost challenging economic periods in our history, General Durbin has \nhelped foster and institutionalize better business practices among our \nArmy's senior leaders. His personal efforts were instrumental in \nleading the Army through significant changes in the way it grows, \nresets, modernizes, and transforms. He made these processes more \nrelevant to current operational requirements and significantly \nincreased the Army's capability to support combatant commanders.\n  In all of his assignments, General Durbin has provided outstanding \nleadership, integrity, and sound advice on numerous issues of \nimportance to the Army and our nation.\n  I would like to thank General Durbin, his wife Diana, and his entire \nfamily for their commitment, sacrifices, and service to our nation. \nCongratulations and best wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4289-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN CALLOVI\n\n Mr. RUBIO.

Mr. President, my home State of Maine is home to \ncountless young entrepreneurs who are working to ensure that our State \nand Nation have a vibrant, growing economy for years to come. Two of \nthese remarkable individuals reside in northern Maine, where they have \nbegun a booming business based on a college project. Today I recognize \nthe founders of the Northern Maine Distilling Company for their \ntremendous accomplishments in such a short period of time.\n  Scott Galbiati and Jessica Jewell were students at Rensselaer \nPolytechnic Institute when they worked on a class project together to \ndesign a business plan. They chose to create a distillery. And after \ngetting married in 2006, they took their venture to the next level, \ndeciding that this would not remain an abstract plan developed in a \nclassroom, but that they would see this business to its fruition. Most \nexciting of all, they decided they would create their company in Maine.\n  After many trial runs and much hard work, Scott and Jessica based \ntheir company in Houlton, a small community on the State's eastern \nborder with Canada. By utilizing the town's high quality water supply, \nthe locally made and distilled Twenty 2 Vodka, the distillery's \nflagship product, has quickly become recognized as a truly unique \nproduct of Maine.\n  Northern Maine Distilling uses only American made products in their \nproduction process, resulting is the creation of 50 gallons of vodka \nper batch. Additionally, by using their Web site and other social media \nsites in a smart and effective manner, Scott and Jessica have been able \nto reach out to communities across the country, sharing recipes and \nideas with people nationwide.\n  Twenty 2 Vodka has won several awards over the course of its short \nexistence on the shelves. It received the bronze medal at the New York \nInternational Spirits Competition and the 2010 World Beverage \nCompetition, and last year bested all competitors at both the Consumer \nJudged SIP Awards and San Francisco World Spirits Competition, taking \nhome the gold at both. The vodka has quickly won wide acclaim, and can \nbe found in a variety of locations across the State.\n  But perhaps the biggest achievement for Scott and Jessica thus far \nwas being named the 2011 Entrepreneurs of the Year by the Leaders \nEncouraging Aroostook Development, or LEAD, and Momentum Aroostook. \nThese two organizations are dedicated to fostering economic growth and \ndevelopment in Maine's northernmost county, and by recognizing Jessica \nand Scott with this prestigious award, they have identified two of \nMaine's rising stars in the business world.\n  Starting and growing a business is not any easy task, as any \nentrepreneur will tell you. But successful business owners demonstrate \ncritical characteristics, like perseverance, commitment, and \npragmatism. The Northern Maine Distilling Company was born out of these \ntraits, which clearly shine through in Jessica Jewell and Scott \nGalbiati. I thank everyone at the Northern Maine Distilling Company for \ntheir hard work, and wish them much success in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4290-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4290-4", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4290-5", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following joint resolution was read the second time, and placed \non the calendar:\n\n       S.J.

A bill to establish and clarify that Congress does not \nauthorize persons convicted of dangerous crimes in foreign courts to \nfreely possess firearms in the United States; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the No \nFirearms for Foreign Felons Act of 2011. This bill would close a \nloophole in current law, by ensuring that people convicted of foreign \nfelonies and crimes involving domestic violence cannot possess \nfirearms. We must close this gap in our laws before it is exploited by \nterrorists, drug gangs, and other dangerous criminals who threaten our \ncommunities.\n  Under current Federal law, people who are convicted in the United \nSates of violent felonies like rape, murder and terrorism are \nprohibited from possessing firearms. But, shockingly, Federal law does \nnot bar criminals convicted of these same violent crimes in foreign \ncourts from possessing guns. This outrageous loophole for foreign \nconvicts is the result of a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the \ncase of Small v. United States.\n  In that case, the Court analyzed the 1968 Gun Control Act, which \nstates that anyone who has been convicted of a felony ``in any court'' \ncannot possess firearms. The Court concluded that the phrase only \napplied to American courts, despite the fact that the Gun Control Act \nhad been applied to foreign felonies since 1968, the year it took \neffect.\n  At the time, the Supreme Court was very much aware that its ruling \ncould have serious consequences. As Justice Clarence Thomas noted in \nhis dissent, ``the majority's interpretation permits those convicted \noverseas of murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, terrorism and other \ndangerous crimes to possess firearms freely in the United States.'' But \nwhatever one may think of the Court's ruling, it is now the law of the \nland.\n  We must make every effort to close this dangerous loophole and the \nbill I am introducing today would do just that.\n  Under this bill, section 921 of Title 18 would be amended to state \nthat ``[t]he term `any court' includes any Federal, State, or foreign \ncourt.'' Similar changes would be made in other sections of the Gun \nControl Act. Where there are references to ``state offenses'' or \n``offenses under state law,'' the bill would expand these terms to \ninclude convictions of offenses under foreign law.\n  In other words, the bill would make it clear that if someone was \nconvicted in a foreign court of an offense that would have disqualified \nhim from possessing a gun in the U.S., then they\n\n[[Page S4294]]\n\nwill be disqualified from gun possession under U.S. law. The only \nexception will be if there is reason to think the conviction entered by \nthe foreign jurisdiction is somehow invalid.\n  Under the bill, a foreign conviction will not constitute a \n``conviction'' under the Gun Control Act, if either: the foreign \nconviction resulted from a denial of fundamental fairness that would \nviolate due process if committed in the United States, or the conduct \non which the foreign conviction was based would be legal if committed \nin the United States.\n  I expect that these circumstances will be fairly rare, but the bill \ndoes take them into account and will provide a complete defense to \nanyone with an invalid foreign conviction. In any event, it is clear \nthat we should not keep in place a dangerous policy which essentially \ntreats every foreign conviction as invalid.\n  Particularly in these times, America cannot continue to give foreign-\nconvicted murderers, rapists and even terrorists the right to buy \nfirearms in the United States.\n  With each passing day, we run a risk that foreign felons are \nexploiting this loophole in our law. This is unacceptable.\n  Criminals convicted in foreign courts should not be able to have guns \nwhen U.S. law forbids those convicted of the same crimes on U.S. soil \nfrom possessing guns. We should not wait for lives to be lost before we \nact to close this loophole.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1305\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect \nto child pornography and child exploitation offenses; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help \nprotect children from Internet predators and pornographers. I am joined \nby the distinguished senior Senator from Minnesota, Senator Klobuchar, \nwith whom I serve on the Judiciary Committee and who is herself a \nformer prosecutor. The same bill has been introduced in the House by \nJudiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Lamar Smith and Rep. Debbie Wasserman \nSchultz.\n  Technology can do so much for us today, but it also has a dark side. \nStudents and Senators can use it, but so can predators and \npornographers. Sadly, in some ways children are more at risk than ever \nand we must do whatever we can to protect them. This means equipping \nlaw enforcement with the tools they need to combat the sexual \nexploitation of children wherever it occurs.\n  This bill does several things. First, it makes it a crime to \nfinancially facilitate access to child pornography. Second, this bill \nrequires companies such as Internet service providers to retain \ninformation such as subscriber network addresses for at least 18 \nmonths. Third, it expands existing authority to issue administrative \nsubpoenas while investigating federal offenses involving the sexual \nexploitation or abuse of children. Fourth, it provides for protecting \nfrom intimidation or harassment child witnesses and victims in criminal \ninvestigations and prosecutions. Finally, it provides for enhancing \ncriminal penalties or sentences for crimes such as the sex trafficking \nof children or child pornography.\n  Several of these provisions may look familiar. The provisions \nrelating to subpoena authority, protection of child witnesses, child \nsex trafficking, and sentencing come directly from S. 2925, the \nTrafficking Deterrence and Victims Support Act of 2009, which Senator \nWyden introduced in the 111 Congress.\n  In preparing this bill for introduction today, Senator Klobuchar and \nI met or spoke with law enforcement groups, financial institutions, \ncommunications companies, and child advocates. Many of them are \nstepping up their own voluntary efforts through coalitions such as the \nFinancial Coalition Against Child Pornography and the Family Online \nSafety Institute. I have worked with many of these organizations and \ncompanies for years and look forward to doing so again on this \nimportant legislation.\n  This is a strong bill, a balanced bill, which will provide effective \ntools for addressing these threats to our children. I know that many \ndivisions exist today, in the country and in the Congress, on many \nissues. But I trust that those divisions will disappear when it comes \nto protecting children from sexual exploitation. That must be an \nongoing commitment and I hope that all of my colleagues, on both sides \nof the aisle and across the political spectrum, will join me and \nSenator Klobuchar in supporting this legislation and helping us get it \nenacted into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1310. A bill to improve the safety of dietary supplements by \namending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require \nmanufacturers of dietary supplements to register dietary supplement \nproducts with the Food and Drug Administration and to amend labeling \nrequirements with respect to dietary supplements; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

A bill to strengthen and improve monitoring in the fisheries \nacross the United States and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise to speak about \noverregulation--something that is really putting a wet blanket on many \nbusinesses throughout our country, and especially in Massachusetts. \nThat is why I am introducing a bill to reform the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration's--or NOAA's--asset forfeiture fund.\n  The fund, as you may know, is authorized by the Magnuson-Stevens \nFishery and Conservation Act and allows NOAA to retain fines and \npenalties collected as a result of enforcement actions for legitimate \nenforcement purposes.\n  As the Department of Commerce inspector general's excellent work \nrevealed, NOAA has mismanaged that fund for many years, wasting \ntaxpayer funds on exorbitant foreign travel and unauthorized purchases \nof vehicles. As a matter of fact, they purchase more vehicles than they \nactually have employees. So that speaks for itself. They also purchased \na $300,000 luxury boat with the funds collected in that forfeiture \nfund.\n  The reason I am standing on the floor of the Senate today is because \nthe way the fund has been implemented has actually corrupted the \nrelationship between the fishermen and the regulators. Fishermen have \ncomplained for years about the arbitrary fines, overzealous \nenforcement, and violations of their due process rights when it comes \nto dealing with NOAA. After decades of such complaints, mostly in the \nNortheast, the Department of Commerce appointed a distinguished retired \njudge to serve as a special master and investigate enforcement actions \nand abuses by NOAA.\n  In one case, a New Bedford, MA, fisherman lost his livelihood and a \nfarm that had been in the family since the 1640s. He was forced to sell \ndue to punitive NOAA penalties. Incredibly, the Commerce Department's \nown special master concluded that the perverse incentive to fill the \nasset forfeiture fund with funds was a motivating factor in how NOAA \nhandled that case. Larry Yacubian got not only a check but an apology \nfrom Washington because of those abuses, but he will never get his home \nback.\n  That is why in my role as ranking member of the Federal Financial \nManagement Subcommittee, I, along with my dear friend, Senator Tom \nCarper of Delaware, held a field hearing in Boston on June 20 to \nidentify a lot of these longstanding problems and identify the problems \nwith the asset forfeiture fund itself.\n  Unfortunately, the hearing revealed that while NOAA has instituted \nsome reforms to its management of the asset forfeiture fund, including \nauditing the funds for the first time in nearly four\n\n[[Page S4296]]\n\ndecades, it still intends to utilize the seized assets of fishermen to \npay for foreign travel, which is inappropriate.\n  The years of NOAA's mismanagement and abuse of the asset forfeiture \nfund have bred mistrust among fishermen and Federal officials, and it \ncan only be broken by removing the fund from NOAA.\n  It is for these reasons that today I am introducing the Asset \nForfeiture Responsibility Act of 2011, which will hopefully end this \nsad chapter in Federal financial management by this agency by replacing \nthe existing funds with a new fisheries investment fund. Funds will be \nkept--like most every other fund--at the Treasury Department for the \nbenefit of regional councils and NOAA, and the fund will be audited for \nthe next 3 years to make sure they are getting their act together.\n  The fishing investment fund will direct monies from those fishermen \nwho break the rules toward assisting fishermen with the ever-growing \ncosts of regulatory compliance and to reimburse the legal fees incurred \nby fishermen whose fines were remitted by the recommendation of the \nSpecial Master.\n  Currently, appropriated funds assist fishermen with the costs of \ncompliance, but in these difficult fiscal times this funding is \nactually at risk. This legislation would provide a more reliable source \nof funds to offset the increasing cost of compliance, while allowing \nthe fishing councils the flexibility to address other priorities, such \nas preparing fishing impact statements and addressing other priorities \nto rebuild or maintain the fishery and the fishing stocks.\n  As I have always said, since I was elected and got involved in this \nissue, all the fishermen want is to have a level playing field and an \nassurance that those who break the rules will be caught and they will \nbe fined appropriately. That is why I have maintained funding for \nNOAA's legitimate law enforcement responsibilities.\n  However, in the end, we should be focused, quite frankly, in this \nChamber on bettering the economic security and ability of the American \npeople to make an honest living. This bill will bring back jobs to the \nhard-working men and women of the American fishing industry while \nrestoring their trust in government. It is the right thing to do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1320. A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to offer to enter \ninto temporary used fuel storage facility agreements; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to help \naddress one of the glaring issues our domestic nuclear industry faces--\nwhat to do with the used nuclear fuel being stored at over 100 sites \nacross the country. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Mary Landrieu \nin introducing this bill.\n  Typically, a nuclear power plant stores its used fuel in a spent fuel \npool located within the reactor site's exclusion zone. When there is no \nmore room in the pool, and the used fuel is sufficiently cooled, the \nfuel can be moved to dry cask storage nearby the plant in what are \ncalled independent spent fuel storage installations.\n  Although there are 104 nuclear reactors producing power across the \nUnited States, not all have been in operation long enough to fill their \nspent fuel pools and require dry cask storage. So at present, the are \n63 independent spent fuel storage installations at 56 sites in 33 \nStates. Of those, 7 sites are from decommissioned plants. Two \ndecommissioned plant sites still have fuel in their spent fuel pool. \nThat means there are 9 sites, from 10 decommissioned reactors, with \n2,800 metric tons of used fuel that is being stored and guarded, \nwhether in dry cask or fuel pools, but no operating power plant nearby. \nThese are orphan sites, and but for the remaining spent fuel the land \ncould be used for other purposes.\n  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the Federal Government is \ncontractually obligated to take title to spent nuclear fuel from \ncommercial nuclear power plants starting in 1998. Our Government has \nnot fulfilled that requirement and as a result we face continuous \nlawsuits from the utilities operating those commercial power plants to \ncover the costs of storing the spent fuel on-site.\n  According to the Department of Justice, as of June 24, 2011, $1.12 \nbillion has been paid out in settlement of these lawsuits, with an \nadditional $220 million paid in judgments. Another $157 million is \nauthorized, but has not yet been paid in settlement. And $937 million \nin outstanding judgments remains on appeal or remand. So, the total \nauthorized payment level, so far, is roughly $1.5 billion, with close \nto another $1 billion dollars in payment going through the legal \nprocess. These are not lawsuits that go away once they are settled. \nEvery year that the Government is in breach of its contractual \nobligation, the same company can bring a similar lawsuit as had been \npreviously settled. As more nuclear power plants fill up their spent \nfuel pools and turn to dry cask storage, more lawsuits for breach of \ncontract will be filed. The Department of Energy estimates that even if \nthe Government starts to accept the spent fuel by 2021, the total cost \nof the lawsuits will be $13.1 billion.\n  While the Government anticipates a liability of $13.1 billion, \nutilities estimate the final tally could exceed $50 billion. But both \nthe DOE and private sector estimates were developed before the \nAdministration took steps to withdraw the Yucca Mountain application. \nMore recent estimates suggest a cost of $100 billion.\n  I take special note of what our future liability could be. The \nDepartment of Energy expects the Federal Government's liability to \nincrease by $500 million annually if waste is not accepted by 2021--10 \nyears from now. It took us 30 years to get this far on Yucca Mountain. \nIf we are to begin the search for a permanent repository anew, as it \nappears the Administration would like us to do, it seems increasingly \nlikely the Government's liability costs will greatly exceed the earlier \n$50 billion estimate. At a time when we are already racking up \ntrillions of dollars in debt for future generations, the administration \nhas freely chosen to incur additional future taxpayer liability in \nterms of tens of billions of dollars by withdrawing the Yucca Mountain \nrepository license application.\n  Fortunately for the administration, I have a solution. The Nuclear \nFuel Storage Improvement Act of 2011 that I am introducing seeks to \nestablish up to two interim used nuclear fuel storage facilities to \ncentralize the used fuel spread across this nation, end the lawsuits \nagainst the Federal Government, and help the domestic nuclear industry, \nand the communities that host nuclear power plants, partially resolve \nthe long-standing problem of what to do with the used nuclear fuel \nstored on-site.\n  The bill would provide financial incentives to a local unit of \ngovernment, as well as the state in which that unit of government is \nlocated, to serve as a host of an interim used nuclear fuel storage \nfacility. The facility itself would be privately owned and operated, \nand licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but the host entity \nwould be entitled to financial payments from the Federal Government for \nits willingness to locate the storage facility within its jurisdiction. \nUp to two locations would be eligible for the financial agreement, \nfunds for which would come from the Nuclear Waste Fund set up by the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n  Importantly for the Federal Government, under the legislation the \nSecretary of Energy can contract with the private entity operating an \ninterim storage facility to store used fuel from civilian nuclear power \nplants. Priority of acceptance is given to the used fuel being stored \nat plants that have been permanently shut down and decommissioned--the \norphan sites. The Secretary is then authorized to enter into an \nagreement with those which it has contractual obligations to under the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act, to settle all claims and liabilities for the \nGovernment's failure to take title of the used nuclear fuel, thus \nsaving the Government, and future taxpayers, billions of dollars.\n  I want to be clear. In no way shape or form does this legislation \ndiminish or replace the need for a permanent repository. I have been, \nand continue to be, supportive of using Yucca Mountain for that \npurpose. Until such a repository can be opened, however, we have a \nresponsibility to put a plan into action\n\n[[Page S4297]]\n\nthat will consolidate the used fuel sitting at all of these sites \nacross the nation, as well as settle the Federal Government's liability \nfor its failure to take title to that spent fuel, costing the American \ntaxpayer millions of dollars each year. I believe this legislation \nmoves us in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1320\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. Cohen previously served as the Assistant Secretary for \nTerrorist Financing, and has previously served in the Department of the \nTreasury's General Counsel's Office. His strong record of service is \ncommendable and his expertise will serve him well in this new role.\n  Mr. Cohen's nomination has been carefully considered by the Committee \non Finance and the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \nboth of which favorably reported the nomination of Mr. Cohen to the \nfull Senate.\n  The Committee on the Judiciary has jurisdiction over some of the \ncrimes that Mr. Cohen will fight in his new role at the Department, \nboth at the international and domestic level. I appreciate Mr. Cohen's \ncommitment to me that he will make himself available to the Committee \non the Judiciary for hearings and activities within the committee's \nlegislative and oversight jurisdiction that overlap with the \nUndersecretary's responsibilities. As the committee considers terrorism \nfinancing, material support for terrorism, and money laundering, among \nother topics, I look forward to working with Mr. Cohen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/30/senate-section/article/S4303-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NOMINATIONS DISCHARGED\n\n  Mr. REID.
