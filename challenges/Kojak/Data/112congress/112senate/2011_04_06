Madam President, as the deadline looms, our budget \nnegotiations continue nonstop. The Speaker and I met with the President \nyesterday morning, and we met with one another yesterday afternoon. As \nin any ongoing negotiation, the status of those talks is constantly \nevolving, but I will give the Senate a snapshot of where we stand at \nthis moment in time.\n  The bottom line has always been the same, and it is this: We want to \navoid a shutdown. We want to pass a budget that makes smart cuts--cuts \nthat save money but that don't cost jobs. This has been our bottom line \nthroughout this process. So we have made some tough choices. We have \nmade those choices because we know at this late stage of the game \nreality is more important than ideology. We know sacrifices are the \ncost of consensus, and we think they are worth it. Our bottom line \nhasn't changed because our objective hasn't changed. We want to keep \nthe country running and keep the momentum of an economic recovery that \nis creating jobs.\n  I wish I could say the same about those on the other side of the \nnegotiating table. The Republicans' bottom line has changed at almost \nevery turn. First, Republicans refused to negotiate until we tried it \ntheir way. We gave the reckless House-passed proposal a vote. The \nSenate resoundingly rejected it. Then, once talks began, Republicans \nstaked out their position. They asked for $73 billion in cuts. When we \nsaid: Let's meet in the middle, they said no. Then we said: In the \ninterest of getting this done, we will agree to your number, and they \nstill said no. Republicans refused to take yes for an answer. Every \ntime we have agreed to meet in the middle, they have moved where the \nmiddle is. They said no when we met them halfway, and now they say: It \nis our way or the highway.\n  That is no way to move forward.\n  People ask: Why is this so difficult? They ask: Can't you just get it \ndone? I understand how they feel, and I share their frustrations, but \nthis is why it is so tough. It is like trying to kick a field goal and \nthe goalposts keep moving.\n  The Democrats' bottom line has not changed. The Republicans' bottom \nline hasn't stayed still. Our bottom line hasn't changed because our \npriorities have not changed. We all want to lower\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\nthe deficit. But Democrats will not sacrifice seniors' retirement \nsecurity, women's health, our children's education, or our Nation's \nveterans. The cuts we make have to be smart cuts, and those aren't \nsmart. They are radical. We want an agreement that is reasonable and \nresponsible.\n  I wish I could say the same about those on the other side of the \nnegotiating table. They forget that not one of those people led us into \na recession, and punishing seniors, women, children, and veterans will \nnot lead us to a recovery. Their budget would cost 700,000 jobs and \nslow economic growth. It would take us backward, not forward. That is \nas counterproductive as it comes. The point of this entire exercise is \nto help the economy. Democrats won't stand for a budget that weakens \nit.\n  Our bottom line--our strongest desire to reach an agreement--hasn't \nchanged because our willingness to compromise hasn't changed. We long \nago accepted the reality that getting something done means not getting \n100 percent of what we want. We long ago accepted the fact that the \nonly way to reach consensus between a Democratic Senate and a \nRepublican House is to compromise.\n  I wish I could say the same about those on the other side of the \nnegotiating table. The Republicans have demanded a budget that can pass \nwith only Republican votes. Instead of seeking a bipartisan budget, \nthey are actively seeking the opposite.\n  The Republican leadership has the tea party screaming so loudly in \ntheir right ear that they can't hear what the vast majority of the \ncountry demands. The country demands that we get this done. As I have \nsaid before, the biggest gap in these negotiations isn't between \nDemocrats and Republicans; it is between Republicans and Republicans. \nSo the Speaker has a choice to make and not much time to make it. He \ncan either do what the tea party wants or what the country needs.\n  Madam President, I will close with two pieces of advice that we would \nbe wise to heed today, one from American history and one from ancient \nhistory.\n  Henry Clay served in both Houses of Congress, in the House and in the \nSenate. He actually held the same seat the Republican leader now holds. \nHe was a Senator from Kentucky. He also held the same gavel Speaker \nBoehner now holds at three different times. Henry Clay served as \nSpeaker of the House, I repeat, on three separate occasions. In his \nesteemed career, he earned the nickname ``The Great Compromiser.'' So \nHenry Clay knew what he was talking about when he said:\n\n       All legislation is founded upon the principle of mutual \n     concession.\n\n  This legislation--this budget--is no exception. But it is important \nto remember that the most important word in that quote isn't \n``concession,'' it is ``mutual.''\n  We all have a responsibility to be reasonable, which brings me to the \nsecond piece of advice: To everything there is a season. To paraphrase \na passage we all know well, a passage much older than the old statesman \nHenry Clay, there is a time to campaign and a time to govern. There is \na time to be partisans and a time to be partners. We stand here with \nless than 72 hours on the clock. It is time to get to work. It is time \nto get the job done. This is the season for action.\n  Will the Chair now announce morning business, please.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2146-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to speak about the issue of Wall \nStreet reform, which I know is near and dear to the Senator from New \nYork, who represents Wall Street.\n  I do believe what Congress achieved last year on Wall Street reform \nwas wise not only for our Nation but also to avoid the possibility of \nanother recession. There are many financial institutions across the \nUnited States, including New York, but the fact is, many of their \npractices led us into the recession we are now experiencing.\n  It was quite a battle last year. Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, \nnow retired, led the battle on the floor of the Senate to try to make \nsure we had the necessary oversight and balance when it came to our \nfinancial institutions to avoid the likelihood of another recession. \nThe banks fought back, but in the end we prevailed and Senator Dodd \npassed the measure here in the Senate, and it was passed in the House \nof Representatives under the leadership of Congressman Barney Frank of \nMassachusetts and signed by the President. It really gave us a chance \nto move forward with oversight, regulation and reform on Wall Street.\n  It was signed last July by the President, but many of the most \nimportant elements of the Dodd-Frank bill will not go into effect until \nJuly 21 of this year. Several of them are very important to America and \nimportant to me as an individual because as a Senator I offered an \namendment to this bill. It was a controversial amendment and, for the \nbanks, an expensive amendment. For the Wall Street banks and credit \ncard companies, the interchange fee amendment, which I introduced and \npassed with 64 votes--17 Republicans and 47 Democrats--was an amendment \nwhich will cost the biggest banks and credit card companies in this \ncountry a portion of the up to $1.3 billion a month they collect in \ndebit interchange fees. Imagine that. In any given year, $15 billion or \n$16 billion is being collected by these banks through credit cards from \nmerchants, retailers, and consumers all across America.\n  From the moment that bill was signed into law, these Wall Street \nbanks and credit card companies have been involved in an all-out, \nnonstop campaign to repeal the law. Now, they can't just flat-out \nrepeal it because they know that looks a little too obvious. So \ninstead, what they are calling for is postponement--just postpone it \nfor 2 years while they study it. That is their argument. They believe \nwe need to look into this a little more closely. Well, the record \nsuggests they are not after a study. They are after $1.3 billion a \nmonth in profit. It turns out it is actually 30 months that the delay \nwould take place, so that is about a $40 billion postponement that the \nWall Street banks and credit card companies are asking for. And who \npays the $40 billion? Merchants and retailers and customers all across \nAmerica. That is why leading consumer advocacy groups support my \namendment and oppose this $40 billion delay which has been suggested in \nthe amendment that is being offered.\n  Last year, when we passed landmark legislation to reform the debit \ncard swipe fees that are enriching Wall Street banks and crushing \nbusinesses and consumers on Main Street, they started organizing to \nrepeal.\n  For years, the banking industry has been engaged in a collusive \npractice. Banks have let the Visa and MasterCard monopoly credit card \ncompanies fix the interchange fee rates that banks receive from \nmerchants each time a debit card is swiped. The so-called swipe fee is \nthe fee the banks get, but they don't set the fees, the credit card \ncompanies set them. This is unregulated price fixing by the VISA and \nMasterCard duopoly on behalf of thousands of banks, primarily the \nbiggest banks in America. The same banks we bailed out are now coming \nback here and saying don't cut into our profits, don't in any way \nreform or change\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\nthe interchange fee that affects merchants, retailers, or consumers.\n\n  Incidentally, when the Federal Reserve took a look at the interchange \nfee that we pay every time we use a debit card, for example, it \naverages about 40 cents. The actual cost of using the debit card: less \nthan 12 cents. So what they are doing is imposing this fee on every \ntransaction in every place across America. This is unregulated price \nfixing by VISA and MasterCard. It is a sweetheart deal for the banks, \ntoo. According to the Federal Reserve, banks make about $1.3 billion \neach month, as I mentioned, in debit interchange fees and the fee rates \nkeep going up even though the cost of processing continues to drop.\n  Last year, Congress decided we should place some reasonable limits on \nVISA and MasterCard. We did this to ensure that they cannot use their \nmarket power and price-fixing ability to funnel excessive fees to the \nNation's biggest banks. Congress said if VISA and MasterCard are going \nto continue fixing interchange rates that merchants pay banks, the \nrates ought to be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of \nprocessing the transaction. It is a narrowly targeted reform and we \nmade a major exemption of small banks and credit unions. If they had \nassets of less than $10 billion, they were exempt. You wouldn't know \nthat. They are acting as if this is going to apply to them. I recommend \nthey read the law, which specifically exempts them.\n  There are two arguments which have been raised recently in opposition \nto interchange reform. The first is we need more studies. I know banks \nand credit card companies believe that interchange reform needs to be \nstudied to death but many studies have already been done. There were at \nleast seven congressional hearings specifically on interchange fees \nbefore we passed the amendment. I chaired one of them. Another two \nhearings on interchange fees have been held since the amendment became \nlaw. There were also at least three different GAO studies on \ninterchange fees prior to the amendment's passage. It is not as if this \nmatter has not been studied; it has been.\n  That is not all. Economists and payment systems experts at the \nFederal Reserve have been studying interchange fees for years. They \nhave put out at least 10 significant reports. Do we need another study?\n  One of them was the January of 2010 study by Fumiko Hayashi, a senior \neconomist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City. She did an \ninternational comparison of interchange fees in the United States and \n12 other countries. Listen to what she found: ``In general, the United \nStates has the highest debit card interchange fees'' and that ``the \nUnited States has the highest interchange fees for both credit and \ndebit cards among the 13 countries where adoption and usage of payment \ncards are well advanced.''\n  I can see why the banks and credit card companies want to ignore that \nstudy. Americans are paying more every time they use plastic than any \nother of 13 of the largest nations in the world that use credit and \ndebit cards. Do you know what the debit fee is in Canada, from VISA and \nMasterCard? Zero--40 cents a transaction for the United States of \nAmerica, God bless them for treating us so kindly; zero for Canada. \nWhy? Because the Canadian Government spoke up for retailers, merchants, \nand consumers, and said stop this. It is price fixing. Now we have done \nthe same and the Wall Street lobby and the credit card lobby are coming \ndown here hitting hard to repeal this interchange fee reform.\n  There was another comprehensive study, a 2009 paper put forward by \nthe Federal Reserve's Divisions of Research and Statistics entitled \n``Interchange Fees and Payment Card Networks: Economics, Industry \nDevelopments, and Policy Issues.'' This study analyzed the structure \nand economic theory behind the interchange system and discussed various \nways of reforming the system.\n  Then there was a 2008 paper by James McAndrews and Zhu Wang of the \nKansas City Fed on the economics of the payment card markets. Their \nstudy found, incidentally, that ``privately determined card pricing, \nadoption and usage tend to deviate from the social optimum, and \nimposing a ceiling on interchange fees may improve consumer welfare.'' \nThe Kansas City Federal Reserve came up with this finding but the \ncredit card companies ignore it. They want another study. They don't \nlike a study that says interchange fee reform is good for consumers.\n  The Boston Federal Reserve did a study in 2010 and found on average \nevery year, each cash-using household pays $149 to card-using \nhouseholds.\n  The studies go on and on. I will put them in the Record. I see \nseveral of my colleagues on the floor, but I want to make one other \npoint as well. Whenever I talk about Wall Street banks and the credit \ncard companies and the costs associated with debit card fees charged to \nAmerican consumers and retailers, the first thing I hear is: There he \ngoes again, defending Walmart.\n  There is no question about it, Walmart is the largest retailer in \nAmerica. When it comes to the use of credit and debit cards, I am \ncertain they have a larger volume of sales from that than any other. \nBut let's do some comparison here for a moment. According to \nForbes.com, in 2010, Walmart, the largest retailer in America, had $17 \nbillion in profits.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. They had $17 billion in profits and a 4-percent profit \nmargin. That sounds like a lot and it is, but not compared to the big \nbanks. JPMorgan Chase, one of the largest issuers of debit cards, had \n$17.4 billion in profits last year. That is more than Walmart, \nincidentally. And their profit margin wasn't 4 percent like Walmart, it \nwas 15 percent.\n  This is the same Chase that has said any regulation of interchange \nfees will force them to raise fees on consumers. One of the most \nprofitable banks in America threatens consumers that if they cannot \ncharge the interchange fees they want to charge, they are going to \nraise fees on consumers. Isn't that great? ``Your money or your life,'' \nwhen it comes to Chase. Chase has more profits than Walmart and a 15-\npercent profit margin.\n  For the record, let me go back and discuss a few more of the studies \nthat have already been done on interchange fees. For example, Terri \nBradford of the Kansas City Fed published a report entitled \n``Developments in Interchange Fees in the United States and Abroad.''\n  This report, which was published in 2008, said the following:\n\n       While regulation of interchange fees is still just a point \n     of discussion in the United States, regulation abroad is a \n     reality. In about 20 countries, public authorities have taken \n     actions that limit the level of interchange fees or merchant \n     discount fees. Many of these actions require interchange fees \n     to be set according to cost-based benchmarks, although the \n     cost categories that are eligible for the benchmarks vary by \n     country. In several countries, interchange fees are set at \n     zero.\n\n  Federal Reserve researchers are not the only ones who have studied \ninterchange fees.\n  In 2006 the Antitrust Law Journal published an article by Alan \nFrankel and Allan Shampine called ``The Economic Effects of Interchange \nFees.''\n  This article found that the interchange fee ``acts much like a sales \ntax, but it is privately imposed and collected by banks, not the \ngovernment. It significantly and arbitrarily raises prices based not on \ntechnologically and competitively determined costs, but through a \ncollective process.''\n  And in March 2010, Albert Foer, president of the American Antitrust \nInstitute, published a study that found the following:\n\n       Governments around the world have been taking actions to \n     eliminate or severely reduce interchange fees based on \n     studies and investigations that clearly establish that these \n     fees are abuses of market power. Moreover, the results \n     demonstrate that interchange fee regulation works. Despite \n     the protests of MasterCard and Visa and their giant card-\n     issuing banks, mandated interchange fee reductions have \n     increased competition in foreign payment card markets and \n     have benefitted consumers through lower prices.\n\n  In short, there have been a large number of studies done about \ninterchange fees. And this does not count the enormous amount of \nresearch, information collection, and analysis that the Fed has done \nsince my amendment was enacted last July.\n  The problem from the perspective of Visa, MasterCard and the big \nbanks is that they simply don't like what these\n\n[[Page S2148]]\n\nstudies have found. So they pretend these studies never happened and \ncall for new ones where they are guaranteed a more industry-friendly \noutcome. It is obvious that their calls for more study are an effort to \ndelay reform indefinitely. The big banks will do anything to prolong \nthe status quo and to keep collecting $1.3 billion per month in \nexcessive debit swipe fees.\n  I want to further address another argument that has been raised \nrecently.\n  Some have argued that we should not follow through with interchange \nreform because it will only benefit big box retailers. Of course, this \nis not true. Swipe fees impact retailers of all sizes, from the \nsmallest mom-and-pop stores to the largest retail chains. They also \naffect universities, charities, government agencies--everyone who \naccepts plastic as a form of payment. And they affect all consumers, \nwho pay higher prices at retail because of the cost that swipe fees add \nto every transaction.\n  But many still like to portray this debate as a struggle between the \nbanks and card companies versus the big box retailers. Well, let's look \nat those big box retailers and compare them to the big banks and credit \ncard companies. Some of my colleagues may be surprised to learn that \nthe big banks and card companies are significantly more profitable than \nthe big retailers.\n  According to Forbes.com, in 2010, Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in \nthe country, had $17 billion in profits and a 4 percent profit margin.\n  Sounds like a lot, right? Well, not compared to the big banks. Last \nyear, according to Forbes.com, JP Morgan Chase, one of the largest \nissuers of debit cards, had $17.4 billion in profits--more than Wal-\nMart. And Chase's profit margin was a robust 15 percent.\n  This is the same Chase that has said that any regulation of \ninterchange fees will force them to jack up fees on consumers. Chase \nhas more profits than Wal-Mart and a 15 percent profit margin. Why are \nthey pleading poverty and threatening their customers with higher fees?\n  Well, what about other giant retailers? How are they doing? Target, \nthe well-known retail chain, had profits of $2.9 billion and a 4.3 \npercent profit margin last year. Let's compare that to Wells Fargo, \nanother giant debit card-issuing bank. Wells Fargo last year had $12.4 \nbillion in profits and a 13.3 percent profit margin.\n  Large retailers would love to have the profit margins of the big \nbanks. But they don't. Last year the largest drug store chain, CVS \nCaremark, had profits of $3.4 billion and a 3.6 percent profit margin. \nThe largest grocery store company, Kroger, had profits of $1.1 billion \nand only a 1.4 percent profit margin.\n  Historically we have seen low profit margins and intense competition \nin the retail sector. According to a June 8, 2009, article in Fortune \nMagazine, Wal-Mart has only an 11 percent market share of the retail \nmarket, and Target has only a 2.3 percent market share. This shows that \nretail is an intensely competitive sector.\n  Let's compare that level of competition to the debit card industry. \nThis past Monday, an article on CNBC.com reported that the Visa and \nMasterCard duopoly now control around 90 percent of the debit card \nmarket.\n  It is pretty profitable to be a duopoly. According to Forbes.com, in \n2010: Visa had $3.1 billion in profits and a 37 percent profit margin, \nand MasterCard had $1.8 billion in profits and a 33 percent profit \nmargin.\n  It must be nice to be a big bank or a credit card company these days. \nBig banks and their card network allies are making money hand-over-fist \nthese days while retailers of all sizes are struggling to turn a \nprofit. Rising interchange fees are a key part of this equation.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. If we can constrain Visa's and \nMasterCard's price-fixing on behalf of the 1 percent of biggest card-\nissuing banks, we will reduce the cost of interchange for every \nmerchant and other entity that accepts debit cards. Competition in the \nretail sector will mean consumers will benefit through discounts and \nlower prices. Given the large profit margins at the nation's biggest \nbanks, they will be able to stay in business once swipe reform is \ncompleted.\n  In fact, we know that banks and card companies can continue to offer \ndebit cards profitably with lower interchange rates.\n  They did it before--up until the mid-1990s, banks used to offer debit \ncards with minimal or no interchange in the United States.\n  And they are doing it right now in other countries around the world, \nwhere there are thriving debit card industries with very low or \nnonexistent interchange rates.\n  I am going to reserve the remainder of my time and let my colleagues \ntake the floor. I will return on the subject but I remind my \ncolleagues, this amendment, this effort by the Wall Street banks and \ncredit card companies to repeal interchange fee reform, is a $40 \nbillion amendment--$40 billion that will be transferred to the biggest \nbanks in America and credit card companies from consumers across \nAmerica. We did the right thing with interchange fee reform. Let's \nstand by it and say to Wall Street, major card issuers, VISA and \nMasterCard, they have had enough. They can get a reasonable fee, but \nnot an unreasonable amount out of our economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2148-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, across the country this morning, \nAmericans are wondering what is going on in Washington this week. They \nwant to know why it is taking so long to fund the government. Americans \nwant to know how we got to this point, and they deserve an answer, so \nhere goes.\n  Each year, the majority party in Congress is responsible for coming \nup with a budget plan that explains how they are going to pay for all \nthe things that government does. It is not just a good idea--it is the \nlaw. Congress has been required to do it since 1974.\n  Last year, Democrat leaders in Congress decided they didn't want to \ndo it. They didn't want to have to publicly defend their bloated \nspending and the debt it is creating. So Republicans have had to come \nup with temporary spending bills to keep the government running in the \nabsence of any alternatives--and leadership--from Democrats.\n  Republicans even passed a bill in the House that would keep the \ngovernment funded through the rest of the current fiscal year, and \nwhich takes an important first step toward a smaller, more efficient \ngovernment that helps improve the conditions for private sector job \ngrowth.\n  This House bill would save us billions of dollars on our way to a \nconversation about trillions. And Congressman Ryan has done a service \nthis week by setting the terms of that larger debate--by outlining a \nplan that puts us back on a path to stability and prosperity.\n  Unfortunately, Democrats have made a calculated decision that they \ndidn't want to have either debate--so they have taken a pass on both.\n  Frankly, it is hard not to be struck by the contrasting approaches to \nour Nation's fiscal problems that we have seen in Washington this week. \nOn the one hand, you have a plan by Congressman Ryan that every serious \nperson has described as honest and courageous. On the other hand, you \nhave people like the new chairwoman of the Democratic National \nCommittee and the previous Speaker of the House dismissing that plan in \nthe most cartoonish language imaginable.\n  While thinking people have seen in the Ryan plan an honest attempt to \ntackle our problems head on, ideologues on the left have seen a target \nto distort while offering no vision of their own to prevent a fiscal \nnightmare that we all know is approaching.\n  And they still haven't come up with an alternative to the various \nRepublican proposals we have seen to keep the government up and running \nin the current fiscal year. They have just sat on the sidelines taking \npotshots at everything Republicans have proposed while rooting for a \nshutdown.\n  That is why the Republicans in the House have now proposed another \nbill this week that will fund the military for the rest of the year, \nkeep the government operating, and which gets us a\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\nlittle closer to a level of spending that even the senior Senator from \nNew York has called ``reasonable.''\n  The fact that Democrats are now rejecting this offer, which even \nmembers of their own leadership have described as ``reasonable'' is all \nthe evidence you need that Democrats are more concerned about the \npolitics of this debate than keeping the government running.\n  Let's be clear about something this morning: throughout this entire \ndebate, Republicans have not only said that we would prefer a \nbipartisan agreement that funds the government and protects defense \nspending at a time when we have American troops fighting in two wars. \nThere is a Republican plan on the table right now that would do just \nthat.\n  Democrats can accept that proposal, or they can reject it. But they \ncan't blame anyone but themselves if a shutdown does occur. Because \nthey have done nothing to prevent it.\n  With the clock ticking, I would once again encourage our Democratic \nfriends to get on board with this proposal, and to support the kind of \nspending cuts that the American people have asked for--and that their \nown leadership has already endorsed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2149-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE EPA AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, later today, the Senate will vote on \nan amendment that one leading newspaper described last week as one of \nthe best proposals for growth and job creation to make it onto the \nSenate docket in years. More specifically, this amendment, which is \nbased on legislation proposed by Senator Inhofe, would prevent \nunelected bureaucrats at the Environmental Protection Agency from \nimposing a new national energy tax on American job creators.\n  Everyone knows that this attempt to handcuff American businesses with \nnew costs and regulations is the last thing these job-creators need \nright now. That is why even Democrats in Congress have sought to secure \nthe same kind of exemptions from the law for favored industries in \ntheir own States that we saw others from their party trying to secure \nfor favored constituencies in the health care law.\n  Democrats from auto States tried to have the auto industry exempted. \nAnd Democrats from farming States tried to have farmers exempted.\n  What these efforts show, is that Democrats themselves recognize the \ndangers of these EPA regulations. Yet instead of just voting for the \none amendment that solves the problem, they are hiding behind sham \namendments designed to give them political cover.\n  Republicans have a better idea--let's try to make sure everybody is \nexempted. Let's not pick winners and losers. Let's let America's small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs compete and grow on a level playing field \nwithout any more burdensome government regulations, costs, or redtape.\n  The amendment I have offered on behalf of Senator Inhofe would do \nthat.\n  The amendment would give businesses the certainty that no unelected \nbureaucrat at the EPA is going to make their efforts to create jobs \neven more difficult than the administration already has. So once again, \nI thank Senator Inhofe for his strong leadership on this issue. He has \nled the way in protecting American jobs from this burdensome proposal \nwith determination and common sense. He deserves the credit.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Upton and my good friend, Congressman \nWhitfield, for fighting against this effort by the EPA and moving \nlegislation to prevent it in the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2149-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COLOMBIA TRADE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there are some signs today the \nadministration is beginning to take seriously a pending trade agreement \nwith Colombia. Republicans have been urging the administration to act \non this critical trade deal for months. This agreement would help \nAmerican businesses compete on a level playing field with businesses \noverseas. It would help create American jobs. And it would help our \nrelationship with an important ally in Latin America.\n  Hopefully these reports are true, and the President will send this \nagreement, along with similar agreements related to Panama and South \nKorea to Congress soon.

Madam President, I rise to the floor to speak in \nmorning business and to comment on the terrible situation we find \nourselves in. We are in a terrible situation. The Republican leader is \nexactly right, the clock is ticking on a shutdown.\n  But I have a couple principles as we head into the midnight witching \nhour on Friday. First of all, my first principle is no shutdown. Let's \nhave a sitdown. Let's not shut down government and cut off the funding \nfor private sector contractors that do business with the government. \nLet's have a congressional sitdown and arrive at an orderly, rational \nagreement that does create a more frugal government but does not \ntorpedo our economy.\n  But my second principle is, if we shut down the government and \nFederal employees and contractors do not get paid, Congress should not \nget paid. Not only should Congress not get paid, no back pay, no way. I \nspoke about the congressional no-pay position yesterday.\n  Today, I wish to talk about the consequences of the shutdown. I am \nagainst a government shutdown. Shutting down the government breaks \nfaith with Federal employees, jeopardizes our economic recovery, \nthreatens the viability of small- and medium-sized businesses that do \nbusiness with the Federal Government and even threatens the safety of \nour families and our economy.\n  That is why I am for a congressional sitdown, not a shutdown of the \nFederal Government. Democrats and Republicans should negotiate over \nspending cuts. But what is not open for negotiation is whether the \nFederal Government is worth keeping open. Parties must come together.\n  There is a belief that a shutdown will occur only in Washington. Oh, \nthe lights will go out in the Washington Monument, maybe a museum will \nbe closed here or there, maybe even a national park will be closed here \nor there. Both on the Senate floor, the House floor, and even in the \nmedia, it is followed by kind of a snicker or even a snarl. How \nfoolish, how they do not understand the functioning of the Government \nof the United States of America.\n  I am afraid the lights will go out. I am afraid the government \nagencies will be shuttered. I am concerned that people who work on \nbehalf of the Federal Government as those contractors, small- and \nmedium-sized contractors, disabled veteran contractors will not get \npaid.\n  I am for cuts. I voted for the Democratic package with over $51 \nbillion in cuts. In my own appropriations bill, I reduced agency \noverhead by 10 percent. I cut out lavish conferences and so on by 25 \npercent. I could eliminate that year by year. But cuts alone are not a \nstrategy to reduce the deficit.\n  What I do not want is to make sure our government will not be funded. \nThere are other ways of doing it, and I will talk about that more \ntomorrow, about how we can actually pay for this, but today I wish to \ntalk about the consequences of what we are doing. There is nobody on \nthe Senate floor talking about it. I appreciate the minority leader, \nbut on my side, if nobody is going to talk about it, I am going to talk \nabout it.\n  A possible government shutdown creates uncertainty in consumer \nconfidence and further damages the economy. Mark Zandi, the chief \neconomist of Moody's, says it will damage the confidence in the economy \nand could result in the loss of 700,000 jobs. Well, let me tell you--\nand everybody says: Oh, well, that is government. I am going to talk \nabout: Oh, well, that is government in a minute.\n  But let's take the private sector. Let's take that snickering and \nsnarling over national parks. Do you know the national parks--we have \n365 of them, 49 States, 300 million visitors. Do you know those \nnational parks generate 270,000 private sector jobs in campgrounds, \nrestaurants, gas stations, vendors to the national parks.\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\n  Oh, yes, you can laugh about closing down Yellowstone, and maybe that \nis not the explosive thing--270,000 jobs, mostly in the West. I did not \nhear that the West had such a low unemployment rate that they do not \ngive a darn. Local communities near national parks will lose $14 \nmillion a day. That is the national park argument.\n  Let me go to the contractors. I represent the State of Maryland, \nwhere we have a lot of contractors. Take the Goddard Space Agency, \n3,000 civil servants who do everything from help run the Hubble \ntelescope and green science, to figuring out how we can fix the \nsatellites through robots in the sky. But there are 6,000 contractors--\n6,000 contractors. Some of them are small business, 8(a) contractors \nworking their way up.\n  Many of them--some of them are women. Many of them are veterans who \nstarted small- to medium-sized businesses. These people, if there is a \ngovernment shutdown, will not get paid. Hello, colleagues. This is not \nonly going to happen in my State, this is going to happen in your \nState.\n  There was a major article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday about \nwhat the shutdown means to the private sector. Well, let's wake up and \nlet's move more quickly to this sitdown.\n  I wish to talk about essential versus nonessential. In my State, I \nrepresent over 100,000 Federal employees. Three of them are Nobel Prize \nwinners I will talk about in a minute--Nobel Prize winners who are \ncivil servants. Those are not even the gangs at Hopkins and the \nUniversity of Maryland. Those are three Nobel Prize winners who are \nactual civil servants.\n  Under this shutdown we are headed for, they are going to be told they \nare nonessential. We have a Nobel Prize winner at NIST who works on the \ndevelopment of new work on laser light. Secretary Chu was his partner.\n  We have a Nobel Prize winner at NIH who won the Nobel Prize for \nproteins and cellular communication that could lead to a cure for \ncancer and a Nobel Prize winner at Goddard in physics. I am not going \nto call their names; I do not want to feel awkward. But what am I going \nto do midnight Friday? Am I going to call these three Nobel Prize \nwinners and say: Hey, guys, you are nonessential. We know you could be \nin the private sector making millions of dollars, but you are staying \nhere to do research to save lives, save the planet, and lead to saving \nour economy. But, hey, I guess you are nonessential.\n  In other countries, they carry you around on their shoulders and so \non. But here, no, we are told they are nonessential. It is not only \nNobel Prize winners, it is all the other people who are working. We are \ngoing to turn out the lights at the National Institutes of Health. We \nare going to say to a researcher: I know you are working on that cure \nfor cancer. I know you are working on that cure for Alzheimer's or \nautism or arthritis--sticking just with the ``A'' words. But you know \nwhat, Washington, the Congress says, you are not essential.\n  What about Social Security? I have over 10,000 people who work at the \nSocial Security Administration. You say: Well, my God, that is a lot. \nThat is 24/7 to make sure it all functions properly and efficiently. We \nhave the lowest overhead of any ``insurance company'' in America. But \nthese lights are going to be shuttered at Social Security, not only in \nSenator Barb's and Senator Ben Cardin's State, but it is also going to \nbe shuttered, Madam President, in your State. When people want to come \nto apply for benefits they are eligible for, when people who are \ndisabled want to apply for those benefits, they are going to come to a \nshuttered Social Security office. They are going to be told they are \nnot essential.\n  Well, then, let's wait until Monday morning. Are they not going to \ncome to work fired up, ready to work for America, ready to help America \nbe great again? They are America's essential employees doing the work \nthat goes on at NIH, Social Security, the National Institutes of \nStandards. They come up with new ideas.\n  Then look at commerce. I represent the great Port of Baltimore. Ships \nare going to come into the port. Who is going to inspect their cargo? \nTraffic coming into airports, who is going to inspect their cargo?\n  But, oh, no, we are going to tell them they are nonessential. Well, I \nam telling you, this is not going to be good. But you know what is not \ngood, not only the consequences but the way we are functioning.\n  Madam President--hello? Madam President. I do not know if my speech \nis not that attention-getting, but can I have your attention?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 10 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well, then, my time is up. Well, maybe the Senate is \nnot paying attention, but the American people are paying attention. I \nam telling you, this is a situation of enormous negative consequence. I \nthink we are going to rue the day at the way we are functioning. We \nneed to come to the table, and we need to sit around and act like \nrational human beings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as Congress and the Obama \nadministration grapples with how to responsibly address our long-term \ndeficit, we need to remember why it is so important to get on a path to \nbalanced budgets. We need to a dress the long-term deficit because it \nis a threat to America's future prosperity. It is about economic growth \nand jobs. That is why the deficit matters. The deficit is not just some \nmath problem where it is solved if the numbers add up right. The \nchoices we make, which spending programs we cut which tax expenditures \nwe eliminate, where we continue to boost investment, matter.\n  The overarching challenge facing our country is how we keep our \neconomy competitive.\n  We cannot compete with India and China for low-wage manufacturing \njobs. That is not our future.\n  America's future is in continuing to be the global leader in science \nand technology. America makes the best, most innovative products and \nservices, and that ingenuity and excellence is our chief economic \nstrength as a nation.\n  But we are in danger of losing that edge. Science, technology, \nengineering and math, what we call the STEM fields, are the skills that \ndrive innovation.\n  And jobs in the STEM fields are expected to be the fastest-growing \noccupations of the next decade. However, not enough students in our \ncountry are pursuing an education in STEM subjects to keep up with the \nincreased demand.\n  For those students that do pursue education in STEM fields, they are \nbeing outperformed by international competitors. Studies show that by \nthe end of eighth grade, students in the U.S. are 2 years behind their \ninternational peers in math. American students rank 21st in science and \n25th in math among industrialized countries. In addition, the U.S. has \nproduced a declining number of Ph.Ds in science and engineering \ncompared to the European Union and China over the past 3 decades. It is \nclear that to remain competitive internationally, we must encourage and \nstrengthen the supply of STEM-trained graduates.\n  That is why this week Leader Reid and Senators Klobuchar, Kerry, \nBegich, Coons  and I introduced legislation, the Innovation Inspiration \nSchool Grant Program, which will bolster our Nation's ability to \ncompete in the global economy.\n  My legislation will provide new incentives for our schools to think \noutside the box and embrace extracurricular and nontraditional STEM \neducation programs. It establishes a competitive grant program that \nwill encourage schools to partner with the private sector, both for \nfinancial support and to provide mentors who can serve as guides and \nrole models to students.\n  I am proud that New Hampshire is the home to the FIRST Robotics \nprogram. For over a decade, teams of students have been designing \nrobots to compete against one another in regional, then national, \ncompetitions. On Monday we hosted FIRST teams from Maryland and \nVirginia who demonstrated in the Dirksen building how the robots they \ndesigned and built actually work. It is these kinds of nontraditional \nSTEM programs that make\n\n[[Page S2151]]\n\na difference in the students' lives and inspire them to continue in \nSTEM careers or postsecondary education.\n  In fact, research shows that 99 percent of students who participate \nin FIRST Robotics graduate high school and almost 90 percent go on the \ncollege. And once in college, these students are nearly seven times \nmore likely to major in engineering and twice as likely to major in \ncomputer science. They are also significantly more likely to attain a \npostgraduate degree. The data speaks for itself: investments in these \nsorts of programs matter and make a difference.\n  I urge colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation \nthat will inspire our students to become scientists, engineers, \ncomputer programmers and mathematicians. Our country's economic future \ndepends on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Madam President, I know it is pretty serious business \ntalking about a government shutdown and things of this nature that \naffect all Americans. I certainly hope we can reach some accommodation. \nI wish to do a little bragging on behalf of my home State.\n  We are pretty proud of our basketball heritage in Kansas, but I note \nthat we have not received national recognition to the extent I think we \nshould in regards to the recent accomplishment I wish to highlight.\n  I rise to congratulate the Wichita State University Shockers. The \nShockers won the 2011 Men's National Invitation Tournament in the Big \nApple, the championship in New York City. In claiming the championship \ntrophy, Wichita State set the school record with 29 victories in the \nseason. Wichita State advanced to the NIT championship with four \nstraight wins in the tournament. They beat the University of Nebraska \nin the first round, Virginia Tech in the second round, the College of \nCharleston in the quarter finals, Washington State University in the \nsemifinal, and, finally, the University of Alabama in the championship \ngame. All of these schools have good basketball teams, and Wichita \nState came out on top.\n  Graham Hatch was named the NIT's most outstanding player and a member \nof the All-Tournament Team, while Garret Stutz was named to the All-\nTournament Team as well.\n  Wichita State and head coach Gregg Marshall were not only successful \non the court but in the classroom as well. Earlier this year, Coach \nHatch and Garrett Stutz were named to the 2011 Missouri Valley \nConference Scholar Athlete first and honorable mention teams, \nrespectively. I congratulate the Wichita State University Shockers, \ntheir head coach Gregg Marshall, the athletic director Eric Sexton, a \ngood friend of mine, and Wichita State University president Don Beggs. \nDon, you are back again, and you certainly did us proud.\n  Specifically, I congratulate each member of the team for an exemplary \nseason: Gabe Blair, Derek Brown, J.T. Durley, Aaron Ellis, Jerome \nHamilton, Graham Hatch, Trey Jones, David Kyles, Toure Murry, Ehimen \nOrukpe, Joe Ragland, Tyler Richardson, Ben Smith, Garrett Stutz, \nRandall Vautravers, Josh Walker, and Demitric Williams.\n  If I mispronounced any name, I am terribly sorry. They did not do \nanything wrong with the tournament in terms of winning the NIT. \nCongratulations to all Shockers basketball fans. The coach has made the \ndecision to stay at Wichita State. Good news for Kansas. Good news for \nWichita State, an exemplary action on the part of the coach after a \nvery successful team effort and winning the NIT and then staying at \nWichita State University. Good news for Kansas, good news for Wichita \nState, and good news all the way around.\n  By the way, we will not shut down the team. They are going to keep on \nfighting.\n  I think the signal there was not four quarters and let's go play \nhard, but the 4 minutes are up.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I come to the floor today as a doctor \nwho has practiced medicine in Wyoming for about 25 years. During that \ntime I was medical director of something called Wyoming Health Fairs \nwhere we provide employees low-cost blood screening for early detection \nand early treatment of medical problems. We know one of the things that \nwas attempted to be solved with the discussion on health care was to \nhave people involved in their own health care decisions and early \ndetection, as well as prevention of disease.\n  I attended a health fair last weekend in Worland, Washakie County, \nWY, where I had a chance to meet with a number of folks, including \npeople from small businesses. First, I wish to congratulate this body, \nand specifically Senator Johanns from Nebraska, for the repeal of the \n1099 form regulations which significantly burden small businesses all \naround the country.\n  I also come to the floor as someone who has practiced medicine and \nhas been watching the health care law closely. It is one that I believe \nis bad for patients, bad for providers and nurses and doctors who take \ncare of the patients, and bad for the American taxpayers because I \nthink this is going to add significantly to our growing debt problem. \nThese are things that need to be addressed.\n  One part of the health care law, the 2,700-page law that was passed, \ndealt with something called accountable care organizations. Those are \nintended to help people coordinate care and have that coordinated care \nincrease people's health by early detection of problems and to help \nminimize problems but also attempt to save money.\n  The six pages of the health care law that dealt with accountable care \norganizations has resulted in the release of regulations on March 31, \n429 pages of regulations which have a significant impact on \nrestructuring the way medicine is practiced.\n  As I look at this in terms of our growing debt, my concern is that \nthe administration is bragging that the regulations save Medicare \nmoney, about $960 million total, best care scenario, over a 3-year \nperiod. So savings of less than $1 billion, a restructuring of the way \nmedicine is being practiced, a savings of less than $1 billion, at a \ntime when Medicare will be spending over those 3 years over $1.5 \ntrillion, a savings of less than $1 billion on an expenditure of over \n$1.5 trillion.\n  The other aspect that was so interesting in watching this \nadministration is they have come out with a statement about \nregulations.\n  The small businesspeople I talked to in Worland last weekend at the \nhealth fair told me that increased government regulations add to the \ncost of doing business and make it harder for them to hire more people. \nSpecifically, it is related to increased costs.\n  It was interesting to see the administration saying that an increase \nin labor demand due to regulations may have a stimulative effect that \nresults in a net increase in overall employment. The administration \napparently believes if we increase the rules and regulations on \nbusinesses, it will make it better for them, when they will tell us \nuniversally that it will make it worse.\n  Additionally, last Friday night the Department of Health and Human \nServices released their new next round of ObamaCare waivers. We have \ntalked about those in the past on this floor as part of a doctor's \nsecond opinion. If this health care law is so good, why do millions and \nmillions of Americans say: We can't live under this, and the\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\nadministration agrees and grants them waivers?\n\n  So this past weekend, Secretary Sebelius added another 128 waivers \ncovering another 300,000 Americans to say: No, for the next year, you \nget a 1-year waiver, you do not have to live under the mandates of \nObamaCare.\n  So now we are at a point where the total number of waivers granted \nhas been over 1,000, covering 2,930,000 people. So, wow, what is the \nbreakdown of those people? Who are they? How can they get those \nwaivers?\n  Well, it is interesting. In this country, where union workers are \njust a small percentage of the total workforce, 49 percent--almost \nhalf--of all of the waivers have been granted to people who get their \ninsurance through the unions.\n  I just looked at this list that came out, and it is interesting \nbecause one of the waivers that had been granted for 13,000 employees, \nenrollees, is for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. So \nlet's see what we can find out about them. If we go to their Web site \nand go to the area that deals with health care, what it says is this:\n\n       Thanks to your hard work--\n\n  This is to people in the union--\n\n       Thanks to your hard work over the last year, Congress \n     passed a health care reform bill that was signed into law by \n     President Obama. This landmark reform is a hard-fought \n     victory for [the United Food and Commercial Workers Union]. . \n     . .\n\n  Well, wait a second, these are the same people who went in and asked \nfor and got a waiver from the Secretary of Health and Human Services--a \nwaiver so they do not have to live under it.\n  Now, it is interesting, if you go to this Web site, you can click to \nother things, and what you can find is that you can actually watch a \nvideo on the Web site of the people who just got a waiver--a video of \nthe members of this union ``rally and talk about health care reform.'' \nOh, the health care they are rallying for, but they do not want it to \napply to them. The Secretary of Health and Human Services says: That is \nfine, you can have a waiver. Oh, you can actually ``see the pictures of \n[union] members taking action on health care reform.'' But it is not \nthe action of applying for the waiver--a waiver they have just been \ngranted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  Now it says:\n\n       Call your members of Congress to thank them for passing \n     real reform.\n\n  Oh, you are supposed to thank the Members of this body for passing \nsomething, but then they applied for a waiver that has been granted for \nover 13,000 members who get insurance through this program?\n  They say you can also check an area to read the background \ninformation on this union's ``advocacy of health care reform''--\nadvocacy for a program they wanted to force down the throats of the \nAmerican people but yet do not want to live under themselves.\n  This health care law is bad for this country, it is bad for our \npatients, it is bad for our health care providers, and it is bad for \ntaxpayers. The union members who absolutely lobbied for it are now \nsaying--now that they have read the bill, now that they know what is in \nthe law, they are saying they do not want it to apply to them, so much \nso that one of the unions that has gotten a waiver, on their recent Web \nsite, said:\n\n       . . . we are . . . challenged by how to implement the law \n     under prevailing circumstances.\n\n  Well, the prevailing circumstances are the law they wanted passed.\n  It says:\n\n       The Trustees of the Fund have no ability to secure \n     additional contributions needed to cover the increased costs \n     of providing these required--\n\n  Required by the people on the other side of the aisle who voted for \nthis--\n\n     additional benefits.\n\n  It says:\n\n       The Trustees are requesting a waiver from HHS to preserve \n     the annual benefit limitation now in place for the part-time \n     plan of benefits to minimize the cost impact of transitioning \n     to the requirements of the reform act. . . .\n\n  Well, what it basically says is that these folks who want the waiver \nare saying what I have been saying on this floor since the beginning of \nthe debate: that this is going to be bad for taxpayers, it is going to \ndrive up the cost of care, it is going to drive up the cost of \ninsurance, in spite of the President's promise that if we pass this, \nfamilies will see premiums drop by $2,100, in spite of the President's \npromise that if you like your plan, you can keep it. What we are \nseeing, for the people who proudly lobbied for this, is that they do \nnot want it to apply to them. They realize now it is going to cause \ntheir plans to have significant problems.\n  I believe every American ought to be able to have a waiver, every \nAmerican ought to not have to live under this health care law. To me, \nit is unaffordable, it is unmanageable, and I believe it is \nunconstitutional. That is why I come to the floor, as I have every \nweek, with a doctor's second opinion that we must repeal and replace \nthis health care law.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2152-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2152-S2153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ENSURING PAY FOR OUR MILITARY ACT\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I wish to speak about the urgent \nfiscal crisis that is facing our Nation. We know the Congress right now \nis in negotiation for a resolution that will take us until the end of \nthe fiscal year, and it is in an atmosphere in which so many people are \nworried about our overwhelming debt and the deficit that would be in \nthe budget that was submitted by the President. We now are trying to \ncut that budget responsibly.\n  The United States is averaging $4 billion a day in debt. A $1.6 \ntrillion deficit is projected by the end of this year. That is just the \ndeficit. That is adding to the debt. Federal spending in 2010 was 23.8 \npercent of gross domestic product. The CBO, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, predicts it will be 24.7 percent of GDP in 2011.\n  As a nation, we must remain competitive by reducing Federal spending \nand spurring economic growth in the private sector. It is jobs in the \nprivate sector that will take our economy out of the doldrums where it \nis now.\n  For the sake of the American people, I hope we can come together to \nstop the reckless Federal spending. Continuing the spending, the \nborrowing, and the taxing in Washington will halt job creation and \ntriple the debt by the end of this decade. That is what is predicted.\n  We must make bold cuts where we can by carefully also prioritizing \ninvestment in areas of strategic national importance. What we need now \nis for the President, the Senate majority leader, and the House Speaker \nto sit in a room and not come out until a deal is made that has the \nvotes to pass.\n  I do not want a government shutdown. The consequence of a government \nshutdown will be enormous, and so many people who are talking about \nthat as an option, as if it is not a big deal, just do not realize how \nmany lives it will touch and how hard it is going to make life for so \nmany people--people who have depended on benefits, such as veterans.\n  We do not know what will happen in a government shutdown. We do not \nknow what will happen to our military because that is not clear. That \nis what I want to talk about today.\n  A government shutdown will put people in peril in many areas, but now \nwe have a situation in which our military, our Active-Duty military--\nalmost 90,000 are in Afghanistan, 47,000 in Iraq--is put in a position \ntoday of now also wondering if their spouses at home with children are \ngoing to get their paychecks. If we have a government shutdown that \nwill affect their ability to pay their mortgages.\n  Madam President, let me ask, are there time limits in place?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is an order to recognize \nSenator Ayotte for her first speech at 10:40 a.m.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Let me just say that I have introduced legislation. I have \ncosponsors--Casey, Inhofe, Snowe, Murkowski, Collins, Ayotte, and \nHoeven. It is the Ensuring Pay for our Military Act of\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\n2011. It is very simple. It just ensures that in the event of a Federal \nGovernment shutdown--which I do not want to happen and do not support--\nour military will be paid. It also will allow anyone who is serving our \nmilitary--civilian defense employees or contractors who do the food \nservices--to also be able to go to work and not have to worry about \nwhat is going to be happening back home, especially for those who are \nserving in harsh conditions overseas.\n  I so hope we will be able to pass this bill. I do not want 1 more \nminute of stress on our military. The bill is very simple, and it is \nvery short and very clear: Our military personnel and their support \nwill not be affected by a government shutdown.\n  I hope I can have more colleagues signing up. We have introduced this \nbill, S. 724, and I hope we can get a vote on this bill in very short \norder so this is off the table.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2153-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2153-S2154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FACING ENORMOUS CHALLENGES\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Madam President, with humility and a deep sense of \nreverence for this body, I rise today to address my colleagues in the \nSenate. Serving in this historic Chamber is truly an honor. On this \nfloor, men and women of strong character gather together to continue \nthe unfinished work of building a more perfect union.\n  It is an even greater privilege to stand here representing the people \nof New Hampshire. A place of distinct beauty that places a premium on \nself-governance and informed public discourse, New Hampshire reflects \nthe very best of our Nation.\n  As America faces enormous challenges, I am reminded of the words of \nwisdom from one of New Hampshire's revered statesmen, GEN John Stark. \nAfter fighting bravely and heroically in the Revolutionary War, General \nStark gave New Hampshire its treasured State motto: ``Live Free or \nDie.'' This famous quote perfectly captures the spirit and character of \nthe people of the Granite State. Fiercely independent and strongly \nprotective of our personal freedoms, we place a high premium on self-\nreliance, personal initiative, and individual liberty. We believe \nstrongly that government cannot and should not be allowed to get in the \nway of each of us reaching our full potential. That is what ``live free \nor die'' means. Yet, as I stand here today and as I have heard from so \nmany of my fellow Granite Staters, we are at a time when our government \nhas grown so large and we have become so indebted that the size of our \ndebt threatens the full potential and future of the greatest people and \ncountry on Earth.\n  ADM Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said \nthat America's debt is the greatest national security threat we face. \nThat debt now stands at a historic level of over $14 trillion, about \nhalf of which is held by other countries. The single biggest foreign \nholder of our debt is China, a country which does not share our values. \nWe are borrowing $4 billion a day, or 40 cents of every single dollar, \nto fund our ever-expanding government.\n  In the month of February alone, we ran a record monthly deficit of \n$223 billion. That $223 billion shortfall--accumulated in just 1 \nmonth--puts into perspective the current spending debate we are having \nin Congress. House Republicans came up with a plan to cut $61 billion \nfor the rest of this fiscal year, which is an important start. But \nthose cuts only cover a little more than a quarter of the deficit we \naccumulated in just 1 month.\n\n  Yet all I hear from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is \nthat $61 billion in cuts is extreme. In my view, the only thing that is \nextreme is failing to confront the endless flood of red ink that \nthreatens our economic strength and threatens our national security.\n  The debt we owe is so much more than just numbers. This is about us--\nwho we are as Americans--and what kind of country we want to leave \nbehind for our children. My husband Joe and I are the proud parents of \ntwo children--Kate, who is 6 years old, and Jacob, who is 3 years old. \nI am determined to keep alive the American dream for my children and \nfor all of our children and for future generations in this country. But \nour addiction to spending in Washington threatens that dream. I, for \none, will not sit by while our children become beholden to China.\n  Hollow words paying lip service to fiscal responsibility have been \nused by too many in Congress for far too long. New Hampshire families \nsit around their kitchen tables and find ways to make their family \nbudget work. With limited resources, they make hard choices to \ndistinguish between wants and needs. It is time for our Federal \nGovernment to do the same.\n  That is why the first step we should take is to pass a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. Almost every State in the Nation \nis required to balance its budget, and our Federal Government should be \nno different. Last week, I was proud to join with all 46 of my \nRepublican colleagues in supporting such an amendment that caps \nspending, requires the budget to balance, and makes it more difficult \nto raise taxes. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \njoin us in passing this important measure and to put this vote to the \nStates for ratification.\n  I appreciate that amending the Constitution is no light matter, but \nour Founding Fathers could not have anticipated how unwilling Members \nof Congress would be to actually pass a balanced budget and to make \nfiscally responsible decisions. Our Founding Fathers were well aware of \nthe threat posed by debt. It was Thomas Jefferson who wrote:\n\n       To preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers \n     load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election \n     between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.\n\n  In 1997, the Senate came close to getting its arms around the debt \nwhen a balanced budget amendment failed to pass this Chamber by just \none vote. At that time, our national debt was a little over $5 \ntrillion. It has nearly tripled since then. Imagine how much stronger \nour Nation would be today had the Senate approved a balanced budget \namendment back then and the States adopted it.\n  A constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget is a key first \nstep, but getting spending under control will take a multipronged \napproach. That is why we must also move quickly to pass serious \nstatutory limits on spending.\n  One of my honorable predecessors from New Hampshire, Warren Rudman, \nhelped author the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act to require sequestration of \nfunds if Congress failed to act to cut spending within deficit targets. \nUnfortunately, Congress circumvented the law's provisions by finding \nloopholes. While that effort may not have ultimately succeeded, we \nshould take the lessons learned from that experience. We need statutory \nspending caps with teeth that Congress cannot easily undermine.\n  While I realize that this week we are working to pass funding for the \nrest of fiscal year 2011, Congress must do something this year that it \nfailed to do last year: Pass a budget. Back home in New Hampshire, \npeople--especially small business owners--are astounded to learn that \nour Federal Government is operating right now outside the confines of a \nstrict budget. Frankly, it is shameful the last Congress did not \napprove a budget for fiscal year 2011. Their failure to act is why we \nare in the difficult place we find ourselves today. Here we are, trying \nto fund government through a series of patchwork, short-term funding \nbills.\n  We need a fiscally responsible budget that cuts Federal spending and \nputs us on a path to eliminating our debt altogether. State governments \noperate within a budget, families operate within a budget, small \nbusinesses operate within a budget, and the Senate should not be \nworking on any other legislation until we resolve funding for the rest \nof this fiscal year and pass a responsible budget for 2012.\n  We have to begin by reviewing every program in our government and \neliminating the waste, fraud, and duplication we all know is there. We \nknow there is so much more we can do to streamline our Federal \nGovernment. A GAO report released in March identified hundreds of \nredundant programs costing us billions of dollars.\n  Finally, it is clear we cannot address our country's fiscal crisis \nwhile continuing to focus on only 12 percent of\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\nspending. That is certainly an important start--and there is plenty to \ncut--but in order to truly get our fiscal house in order, we must look \nat the entire budget. We must repair our entitlement programs--\nMedicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.\n  Entitlement reform should be an issue that brings us all together--\nRepublicans, Democrats, Independents--to ensure we keep our promises to \nthose who are relying on those programs, while making sure future \ngenerations don't pay for our failure to address the fiscal reality of \nthese programs right now. This is certainly an issue that requires \nPresidential leadership, and I join others in my party in inviting the \nPresident to work across party lines to address this urgent priority. \nThe American people deserve a substantive, responsible debate on how we \ncan preserve these programs in a fiscally sustainable way. We simply \ncannot continue to put off making the difficult decisions today and \npassing them on to the next generation.\n  With our trillion dollar-plus deficits and rapidly accelerating debt, \nwe are again closing in on our debt ceiling. Having to repeatedly \nincrease the debt limit represents a broad failure of leadership by \npoliticians from both parties. As a new Member of the Senate, I refuse \nto perpetuate that cycle. We cannot let this moment pass us by, and I \ncannot in good conscience raise our debt ceiling without Congress \npassing real and meaningful reforms to reduce spending. That plan \nshould include a balanced budget amendment, statutory spending caps, \nspending cuts, and entitlement reform.\n  We can no longer afford the status quo or business as usual in \nWashington. The days of spending as though there is no tomorrow to \nbring home the bacon must end. The fiscal crisis that threatens our \nUnion threatens all of us. We will have to make sacrifices. There will \nbe times when we have to put aside our parochial interests and \nappreciate that the only way we will be able to cut spending is for all \nof us to take shared responsibility and to make shared sacrifices for \nthe great country we love.\n  Make no mistake, out-of-control spending jeopardizes our Nation's \neconomic strength and costs us jobs. One thing is for sure: We cannot \nspend our way to prosperity. We need look no further than the stimulus \npackage to prove that stubborn fact.\n  The reality is that government doesn't create jobs. Small businesses \nand entrepreneurs create jobs. What we can do in the Senate is to help \ncreate the right tax and regulatory conditions to allow our businesses \nto thrive and grow.\n  Despite the circumstances we face, we are blessed to live in the \ngreatest country in the world. There has never been a challenge we have \nnot faced and met and overcome and been better for.\n  When I think of what it will take to address the challenges before \nus, I am reminded of my 95-year-old grandfather, John Sullivan, who is \na World War II veteran and what his generation went through and what he \ndid. My grandfather landed on the beaches of Normandy, and he is part \nof what is known as the ``greatest generation'' of our country.\n  Every generation is called upon anew to preserve our country. In my \nview, this generation's greatest challenge is having the courage and \nthe will to take on and fix our fiscal crisis and get our fiscal house \nin order once and for all. This is our time to show we have the \nfortitude and the courage to do what is right to preserve the greatest \nNation on Earth.\n  I know we can do this, and it is truly humbling to have the \nopportunity to serve in this body at a time when I know leadership and \ncourage will make all the difference. On behalf of the people of New \nHampshire, I stand ready to fight for our great country and to work \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address our fiscal \ncrisis. I remain confident that America's best days still lie ahead of \nus.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I wish to congratulate our new \ncolleague on her initial speech related to the twin problems we have in \nthis country of spending and debt, as well as to say to her that it is \npretty clear to all of us that she is a worthy successor to our good \nfriend Judd Gregg whose seat she now occupies and who was also a leader \nin this body--some would argue the leader in this body--on the \nquestions of our Nation's fiscal crisis and how to get it in order. So \non behalf of all of our colleagues, I congratulate Senator Ayotte.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I also wish to congratulate my \ncolleague from New Hampshire. It is an extraordinary privilege to serve \nin this Chamber and it is a long tradition of the Chamber to utilize \none's first speech or maiden speech as an opportunity to address \nsomething that is close to one's heart. I extend a warm welcome to her \nand to her voice, her intellect, and her passion on issues that we \nmust, on both sides of the aisle, work to resolve in order to build a \nbetter America and put America back on track.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2154-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Coburn \namendment No. 281 replace amendment No. 223 in the agreement we reached \nlast evening. This is an updated version of Senator Coburn's amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, under the previous agreement that was \nreached last evening--and I want to thank both leaders, Senators Reid \nand McConnell, for working so hard with Senator Snowe and me to try to \nbring our caucuses to conclusion points on this very important bill, \nthe small business innovation bill, that we have been negotiating now \nfor almost 2 weeks. It is a very important program that deserves to be \nreauthorized.\n  This bill will reauthorize this important program for 8 years. We \nhave been operating the last 4 years with 3 months at a time and 6 \nmonths at a time. Madam President, representing New York, you know that \nmany of your small businesses have accessed this program, many of your \nuniversities, to acquire or to reach cutting-edge technologies that not \nonly our\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\nFederal agencies need but taxpayers benefit from directly.\n  This program is a job creator. It is an innovative program, and it is \na job creator. So I appreciate the work our two leaders have done with \nSenator Snowe and myself to get us to this agreement.\n  We will be having seven votes this afternoon. Just to recap, they \nwill be Baucus No. 236, Stabenow No. 277, Rockefeller No. 215, Coburn \nNo. 217, Coburn No. 281, Coburn No. 273, which is a side-by-side, I \nthink, and Inouye No. 286. Those have already been agreed to, but, \nMadam President, our challenge is that we have 124 additional \namendments that have been filed, most of which have nothing to do with \neither the Small Business Administration or this program. We understand \nSenators are frustrated and want floor time for their issues, but \ntaxpayers need this program that works.\n  We are eliminating some programs at the Federal level that don't \nwork, but this one does. So we need to try to find a way to get it \nauthorized and continue the good economic numbers we are hearing coming \nout of Treasury and other independent think tanks that are saying jobs \nare being created.\n  The recession looks as though it is potentially coming to an end. We \nare creating net new jobs every month. This is a program that supports \nthat. It is a great foundation program based on cutting-edge research \nand innovation that helps small businesses in the country who are the \njob creators.\n  So I ask Members on both sides to work cooperatively throughout the \nday today. We are going to have a vote on these seven amendments this \nafternoon, as previously agreed to, and we will be considering and \ntrying to work with Members on some of their other issues. If we could \nget a good, strong small business bill agreed to this week and sent \nover to the House as we resolve these very tough negotiations on the \nbudget, we can be proud to, at some point very soon, send this bill \nwith a few attached amendments, hopefully--not many but a few--to the \nPresident's desk for signature.\n  So, again, I thank the Members for their cooperation, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  I am sorry, Madam President. Let me take back that request.\n\n\n         Amendments Nos. 236, 277, 215, 217, 281, 273, and 286\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, under the previous agreement we were \nable to get to last evening, I call up the amendments I previously \ncited.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSanders' amendment No. 207 now be modified with the changes at the \ndesk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Social Security is the most successful and reliable \n     social program in our Nation's history.\n       (2) For 75 years, through good times and bad, Social \n     Security has reliably kept millions of senior citizens, \n     individuals with disabilities, and children out of poverty.\n       (3) Before President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social \n     Security Act into law on August 14, 1935, approximately half \n     of the senior citizens in the United States lived in poverty; \n     less than 10 percent of seniors live in poverty today.\n       (4) Social Security has succeeded in protecting working \n     Americans and their families from devastating drops in \n     household income due to lost wages resulting from retirement, \n     disability, or the death of a spouse or parent.\n       (5) More than 53,000,000 Americans receive Social Security \n     benefits, including 36,500,000 retirees and their spouses, \n     9,200,000 veterans, 8,200,000 disabled individuals and their \n     spouses, 4,500,000 surviving spouses of deceased workers, and \n     4,300,000 dependent children.\n       (6) According to the Social Security Administration, the \n     Social Security Trust Funds currently maintain a \n     $2,600,000,000,000 surplus that is project to grow to \n     $4,200,000,000,000 by 2023.\n       (7) According to the Social Security Administration, even \n     if no changes are made to the Social Security program, full \n     benefits will be available to every recipient until 2037, \n     with enough funding remaining after that date to pay about 78 \n     percent of promised benefits.\n       (8) According to the Social Security Administration, \n     ``money flowing into the [Social Security] trust funds is \n     invested in U.S. Government securities . . . the investments \n     held by the trust funds are backed by the full faith and \n     credit of the U.S. Government. The Government has always \n     repaid Social Security, with interest.''.\n       (9) Social Security provides the majority of income for \n     two-thirds of the elderly population in the United States, \n     with approximately one-third of elderly individuals receiving \n     nearly all of their income from Social Security.\n       (10) Overall, Social Security benefits for retirees \n     currently average a modest $14,000 a year, with the average \n     for women receiving benefits being less than $12,000 per \n     year.\n       (11) Nearly 1 out of every 4 adult Social Security \n     beneficiaries has served in the United States military.\n       (12) Proposals to privatize the Social Security program \n     would jeopardize the security of millions of Americans by \n     subjecting them to the ups-and-downs of the volatile stock \n     market as the source of their retirement benefits.\n       (13) Social Security is a promise that this Nation cannot \n     afford to break.\n       (b) Protection of Social Security Benefits.--It is the \n     sense of the Senate that, as part of any legislation to \n     reduce the Federal deficit--\n       (1) Social Security benefits for current and future \n     beneficiaries should not be cut; and\n       (2) the Social Security program should not be privatized.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that any time \nspent in a quorum call prior to the votes at 4 p.m. be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, we are at a unique and enormously \nimportant moment in American history. The decisions that will be made \nby the Congress and the President in the coming days, weeks, and \nmonths, will in many ways determine how we go forward as a nation and \nwill impact the lives of virtually every one of our 300-plus million \ncitizens.\n  The reality today, as I think most Americans know, is that within our \neconomy we have a middle class which is collapsing. In the last 10 \nyears, median family income has declined by $2,500. Millions of \nAmerican workers are working longer hours for lower wages. If you look \nat real unemployment rather than the official unemployment, we are \ntalking about 16 percent of our people unemployed or underemployed. \nNumbers may be even higher for certain blue collar workers and for \nyoung workers. The middle class is in very dire straits.\n  Poverty in America is increasing. Since 2000, nearly 12 million \nAmericans have slipped out of the middle class and into poverty. As a \nnation we have 50 million Americans today who have no health insurance \nand that number has increased. In recent years we have the highest rate \nof child poverty of any major country on Earth. We are \ndeindustrializing at a rapid rate. In the last 10 years we have lost \n50,000 of our largest manufacturing plants as many of our largest \ncorporations have decided it is more profitable to do business in China \nand other low-wage countries rather than invest in America.\n  That is one reality. Then there is another reality that we don't talk \nabout too much. It is while the middle class disappears and poverty \nincreases, people on the top are doing phenomenally well. Today, about \n1 percent of top income earners earn about 23 percent of all income. \nThat is more than the bottom 50 percent--the top 1 percent earn more \nincome than the bottom 50 percent and the gap between the very rich and \neverybody else is growing wider.\n  Not widely discussed but true, in America today the wealthiest 400 \nfamilies own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans--400 \nfamilies, 150 million Americans. That is an unbelievable gap in terms \nof wealth, between a handful of families and the vast majority of the \nAmerican people. That gap is growing wider.\n  In 2007, the wealthiest 1 percent took in 23.5 percent of all the \nincome earned in the United States; the top 0.1 percent took in 11 \npercent of total income. The percentage of income going to the top 1 \npercent has nearly tripled since the 1970s, and between 1980 and 2005, \n80 percent of all new income generated in this country went to the top \n1 percent.\n  We are living in a society where the very wealthiest people are \nbecoming wealthier; the middle class is disappearing; poverty is \nincreasing. That takes us to the budget situation our Republican \nfriends are pushing.\n  At a time when the richest people are becoming richer, what the \nRepublicans say is the answer is let us give millionaires and \nbillionaires even more in tax breaks. At a time when the middle class \nis in decline, poverty is increasing, what our Republicans are saying \nis let us attack virtually every significant program that improves \nlives for low-income or moderate-income people. The rich get richer, \nthey get more. The middle class gets poorer, they get less. Maybe that \nsense of morality makes sense to some people. It does not make sense to \nthis Senator and I do not believe it makes sense to the vast majority \nof the American people.\n  Our Republican friends outlined their immediate budget proposals for \n2011, for the CR, in their bill H.R. 1. Let me briefly review it \nbecause I want everybody in America to understand what these folks want \nto see happen and it is\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\nimportant that we discuss it. Fifty million Americans have no health \ninsurance today. The Republican solution is slash $1.3 billion for \ncommunity health care centers that provide primary health care to 11 \nmillion patients.\n  What happens when you are sick, you have no insurance, you don't have \nany money, you can't go to a doctor--what happens? Perhaps you die, \nperhaps you suffer, perhaps you are lucky enough to get into a \nhospital. We spend huge sums of money treating you when you could have \nbeen treated a lot more cost effectively through a community health \ncenter.\n  Today, in my office and I suspect in your office, people will tell \nyou that it takes too long for them to get their claims from the Social \nSecurity Administration, the disability claims--the waiting line is too \nlong. The Republican solution is slash $1.7 billion from the Social \nSecurity Administration, making seniors and the disabled wait even \nlonger. Everybody in America knows how hard it is for a middle-class \nfamily to send their kids to college. The most significant Federal \nprograms, such as the Pell grant program, make it easier for low and \nmoderate-income families to afford college. The Republican solution is \nslash $5.7 billion from Pell grants which means that over 9 million \nAmerican students will lose some or all of their Pell grants. Many of \nthem will not be able to go to college.\n  Everybody, every working family in America, knows how hard it is \ntoday to find quality, affordable childcare. In most American middle-\nclass families the husband works, the wife works--they want to know \ntheir kids are in a safe, good-quality childcare center. For decades \nnow, Head Start has done an excellent job in providing quality early \nchildhood education for low-income kids. In the midst of that childcare \ncrisis, the Republican solution is slash Head Start by 20 percent, \nthrow 218,000 children off of Head Start, lay off 55,000 Head Start \ninstructors.\n  On and on it goes. In my State it gets cold in the winter, 20 below \nzero. Many seniors living on Social Security cannot afford the \nescalating costs of home heating oil. The Republican solution: Slash \n$400 million in funding for LIHEAP, making it harder for seniors and \nother low-income people to stay warm in the wintertime.\n  What we should be very clear about as we discuss the budget is the \nRepublican proposals for the continuing resolution for the remainder of \nfiscal year 2011 are only the first step in their long-term plan for \nAmerica. Yesterday what we saw is the real vision of the Republican \nParty, for where they want to take this country into the future. While \nI applaud them for being straightforward about that vision, I think the \nmore the American people take a hard look at where they want this \ncountry to go, the more outraged will be millions and millions of \ncitizens as they understand the Republican proposal for the future.\n  Right now, if you are a senior citizen and you get sick and you need \nto go to the hospital, you have a health insurance program called \nMedicare, which has been lifesaving for millions of seniors. The \nRepublican budget as outlined by Congressman Ryan yesterday essentially \nends Medicare as we know it and converts it into a voucher-type program \nthat will leave seniors paying out of pocket for many lifesaving health \ncare costs.\n  In other words, if you end up, at the age of 75, with cancer or \nanother illness, what the Republican proposal does is give a voucher to \na private insurance company--$6,000, $8,000, we are not exactly sure--\nand after that, good luck, you are on your own. You have an income of \n$15,000, you have cancer, how are you going to pay for that? The \nRepublicans say there will be a voucher, ending Medicare as we know it \nright now.\n  The Republican proposal would force seniors to pay $3,500 more for \nprescription drugs. The proposal would reopen the prescription drug \ndoughnut hole, requiring that seniors pay full price for prescription \ndrugs. At a time when so many of our people have no health insurance, \nthe Republican budget contains $1.4 trillion in Medicaid cuts over 10 \nyears by turning it into a block grant program. We are now reading in \nvarious States that have budget problems that their solution to the \nbudget problems is simply to throw people off of Medicaid, including \nchildren. What happens if you have no health insurance and you get \nsick?\n  We are beginning to talk about death panels. That is what we are \ntalking about. If you are sick, you have no health insurance, what do \nyou do? My guess--we have options--you die, you get sicker, you suffer \nin ways that you did not have to suffer.\n  The Republican proposal, as outlined by Congressman Ryan yesterday, \nalso includes over $1.6 trillion in cuts over the next decade for \neducation, Pell grants, infrastructure, affordable housing, food \nstamps, food safety, and other vital programs for the middle class, the \nelderly, the sick, and the children.\n  What is also interesting--it is literally beyond belief to me--is \nwhile Republicans are slashing programs for low- and middle-income \npeople, what they are also doing--I think people will think I am not \nserious, but I am--at the same time as the rich are getting richer and \nthey are slashing programs for low- and moderate-income people, the \nRepublican budget plan would significantly lower taxes for millionaires \nand billionaires.\n  So we cut Head Start, we cut Pell grants, we cut community health \ncenters, but at the same time we give huge tax breaks for millionaires \nand billionaires. Furthermore, the Republican proposal would also lower \ntaxes for the largest corporations in this country. My point is, we all \ndo understand that this country has a serious deficit problem and a $14 \ntrillion national debt. I think every Member of the Senate is concerned \nabout the issue and wants to address it.\n  The question is, Do we move toward a balanced budget on the backs of \nthe weakest, most vulnerable people in our country, on the backs of the \npoor, the children, the elderly, the disabled? That is one way we can \ndo it or do we ask for shared sacrifice? Do we say to the wealthiest \npeople in the country, do we say to the largest corporations in this \ncountry: You are part of America, too, and you have to help us get out \nof this deficit crisis.\n  Last week, I issued a list of 10 major corporations--10 major \ncorporations that paid nothing in taxes in recent years, and, in some \ncases, actually got a rebate from the Federal Government after making \nhuge profits. To my mind, instead of cutting back on Head Start and \nPell grants and community health centers--which will have a devastating \nimpact on low- and moderate-income Americans--maybe we might want to \nask General Electric, which made $26 billion in profits over the last 5 \nyears and received a $4.1 billion refund from the IRS, maybe we might \nwant to ask them to pay something in taxes.\n  I think it is a bit absurd that the average middle-class person pays \nmore in Federal income taxes than does General Electric. Maybe we want \nto change that. Maybe we want to ask Chevron, which made $10 billion in \nprofits in 2009, which got a $19 million dollar refund from the IRS, \nmaybe to pay something in taxes so we can move toward deficit reduction \nin a way that is fair.\n  Here is the bottom line: corporate profits are at an alltime high. \nThe richest people in this country are doing phenomenally well. The \nmiddle class is in decline. Poverty is increasing. Republican answer: \nMore tax breaks for the very rich, lower corporate taxes, but stick it \nto working families in a horrendous way, which will cause massive pain.\n  We are at a fork in the road in terms of public policy. Do we develop \npublic policy which protects all our people, which expands the middle \nclass, or are we at a moment in history which moves this country \naggressively toward oligarchy, in which we have a small number of \npeople at the top with incredible wealth and incredible power, while \nthe middle class continues to disappear.\n  Now is the time, in my view, for working families all over this \ncountry to stand and say: Enough is enough. We need shared sacrifice as \nwe go forward. We do not need to see the middle class in this country \nfurther disappear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 236\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to speak to amendment No. \n236 to exempt farmers, ranchers, and small businesses from EPA \nregulation of greenhouse gases.\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\n  The science is clear: greenhouse gas pollution is causing climate \nchange. Climate change is here, it is real, it is human caused, and it \nwill hurt our economy and the health of our kids and grandkids.\n  In Montana we are already seeing the effects. According to Dr. Steve \nRunning at the University of Montana, the duration of the wildlife \nseason in the western United States has increased by 78 days since the \n1970s. This trend is driven by earlier snowpack melt and less summer \nprecipitation due to climate change. And this trend costs jobs in \nMontana's tourism and timber industry.\n  Climate change also endangers our national security. According to a \nreport recently authored by retired Navy ADM Frank Bowman, ``Even the \nmost moderate predicted trends in climate change will present new \nnational security challenges.'' That is why the Pentagon included \nclimate change among the security threats identified in its Quadrennial \nDefense Review.\n  I believe that we all have a moral responsibility to leave this world \nto our kids and grandkids in better shape than we found it. That means \nwe ought to deal with climate change by reducing our emissions of \ngreenhouse gas pollution. But we must do so in a manner that does not \nhurt the economic recovery.\n  Small businesses and agriculture are the drivers of our economic \nrecovery and job creation. Of the 200,000 jobs added in March, over \nhalf were created by businesses with 50 or fewer employees. And over 90 \npercent of the 200,000 jobs created last month were created by \nbusinesses with 500 or fewer employees. My amendment ensures that these \nbusinesses can continue to add jobs.\n  My amendment is very simple. It exempts farmers, ranchers, and small \nbusinesses from EPA's greenhouse gas pollution regulations.\n  Under my amendment only about 15,000 of the more than 6 million \nstationary sources that emit greenhouse gases in the country would be \nregulated by EPA. These 15,000 sources are large plants run by big \ncorporations. And over 96 percent of these 15,000 sources already have \nto get permits under the Clean Air Act for emissions of criteria \npollutants. Moreover, these 15,000 polluters account for 70 percent of \ngreenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources in the country. So \nunder the Baucus amendment, small businesses would be protected, while \nthe biggest polluters that account for the vast majority of emissions \nwould have to comply with the law.\n  EPA is going forward with regulations to reduce greenhouse gas \npollution. We ought to ensure these regulations preserve our outdoor \nheritage, protect our children's health, promote our national security, \nand protect small businesses, farmers, and ranchers. My amendment does \njust that, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Fiscal challenges\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, we find ourselves in dangerous territory. \nWhile Republicans and Democrats continue to point fingers and hold \nfiery press conferences, a government shutdown is quickly approaching. \nThe blame game is like quicksand: it has the ability to drag down not \nonly the Senate and the House but the entire economy and our country. \nNo matter how one looks at it, a shutdown would be reckless and \nirresponsible.\n  We can get this short-term budget problem resolved if all parties \nwould turn off the rhetoric and stop the campaigning. A few extreme \npartisans stand in the way of progress, blocking a good-faith effort of \nmany others seeking common ground. I ask them to take to heart what it \nsays in the book of Isaiah: Come now, let us reason together.\n  We need to overcome this budget impasse and live up to the oath we \ntook and to the people we represent. Larger challenges await our \nattention. It is not in our best interest to see the government shut \ndown. I don't think it is in the best interest of the Nation to \ncontinue on this deficit-spending cycle we have been on. We owe it to \nthe American people and the world that is watching us to show American \nleadership on both our short-term and long-term fiscal challenges.\n  I would like to see us turn our effort to the blueprint provided by \nthe debt commission. I commend the bipartisan group of Senators who \nhave begun to turn part of this plan into legislation.\n  We must find ways to reduce spending, address entitlement programs, \nand reform the Tax Code. Now, with all the momentum and opportunity \nbuilt up over the last few months, is the time to lead. We must make \nthe serious decisions to get our Nation out of the red so we can be \ncompetitive in the future. Again, I say let's turn off the rhetoric and \nbe part of the solution, not part of the problem.\n  In Washington, the blame game has become par for the course. It has \nbecome politics as usual. In fact, it is one thing that people in my \nState are sick and tired of and one of the reasons why they have lost \nconfidence in the Congress and in our government. Besides that, how in \nthe world does holding press conferences and pointing fingers at others \nhelp resolve anything? Besides that, it is not true because the truth \nis that we are in this fiscal situation we are in today because of \ndecisions all of us have made over the last decades. In fact, I saw \nyesterday in the paper where Speaker Boehner was talking to some of his \ncaucus about getting ready for the shutdown, and there were ovations \nover there. There are no ovations over here for a government shutdown. \nWe do not want to see it. I am not only talking about Democrats. I \ndon't know of any Republicans in the Senate who want to see a shutdown. \nIn fact, from my standpoint, one of the tests I use when I look at \npoliticians is, the louder they are and the more often they have press \nconferences to blame other people, that probably means the more they \nare to blame for the problems we have today.\n  I certainly hope that as the elections roll around next year, the \nAmerican people will remember many of the politicians' attempts in \nWashington to avoid responsibility for this terrible fiscal crisis.\n  One thing we need to keep in mind is that what we are talking about \nthis week in terms of shutting down the government--and I hope that \ndoesn't happen--is really only important for the next 6 months. We are \nonly talking about for the rest of this fiscal year. The real battle, \nthe more meaningful discussion and debate and fight, even, that we need \nto have is over long-term fiscal policies. The next 6 months--I don't \nwant to say that is not important, because it is--is a time for us to \ndemonstrate to the American people, to the markets, and to the world \nthat we can come up with political solutions to the very challenging \nproblems we face.\n  I am also concerned in this fragile economy that if we do shut down \nthe government, that might be something that would shake this economy \nand actually, possibly, stop it in its tracks. I hope it will not \nreverse it, but I do have a concern about an abrupt cutoff of \ngovernment spending, what that might do to the economy.\n  Our fiscal challenges that the debt commission focused on and many of \nus have focused on are beyond politics. They are bigger than politics. \nThey are more important than the next election. In fact, they are more \nimportant than our own personal political fortunes. This fiscal \nsituation we are in is not about the next election; it is about the \nnext generation.\n  If we look back at the time that we call the Battle of Britain, one \nof the things Winston Churchill said that always stuck with me is, \n``Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to \nso few.'' He was talking about those brave men who flew the airplanes \nover Great Britain to protect the skies and the British people and to \nwin the war, to stop Nazi Germany from invading and defeating the \nBritish Empire.\n  The ``so few'' we have today are Tom Coburn, Dick Durbin, Mark \nWarner, Saxby Chambliss, Mike Crapo, and Kent Conrad. Those few have \nbeen\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\nmeeting for weeks, even months, to try to come up with a comprehensive \nbudget agreement based on the blueprint of the debt commission. These \nsix Senators are not politicians; they are statesmen. They are trying \nto do what is right for the country. They are trying to do what is in \nthe country's best interest, not their own. I guarantee my colleagues, \neach one of the six will face tremendous criticism from their own \nparties and from other quarters about what they are trying to \naccomplish. To me, that is courage, leadership; that is what being a \nSenator is all about.\n  I know right now there are six of them meeting. I know that at some \npoint, once they come out and once they are ready to announce what they \nwant to do, many others will join that effort. But we need to cheer \nthem on and encourage them to finish the hard task they have begun.\n  I am reminded, when I think about those six sitting in the Capitol \nand in various rooms around the Capitol, of that phrase in the \nDeclaration of Independence right before our Founding Fathers signed \nthat great document where they say: ``We mutually pledge to each other \nour lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.'' This is our time to \nput it all on the line. We need to put our political lives on the line, \nour political fortunes on the line, and our honor. We need to honor the \ncommitment we have made to this country when all 100 of us stood up--in \nfact, when all 535 of us stood up--and took the oath of office that we \nwere going to do what was right for the country.\n  I mentioned the Book of Isaiah a few moments ago. I am reminded that \nmany times in the Old Testament, whether in the prophets or Proverbs, \nwe are always encouraged to do right, to do justice, to show mercy. We \nwant to really be upright and true. That is what they call us to do and \nwhat they want us to do.\n  I am also reminded that in the New Testament, when Jesus is talking \nto the political and religious leadership of his day, he says: Are you \nso blind?\n  Are we so blind that we cannot see the forest for the trees, that we \ncan't understand how important it is for this country to get our debt \nand deficit where it needs to be? Are we so blind that we are not able \nto see that we need to put everything on the table, that this is a time \nfor great leadership and shared sacrifice, and we all have to give up \nsomething to get this done?\n  It is our time to lead. This may be the greatest challenge of our \ngeneration, of any of us who are serving either in the House or Senate \nright now. This may be our one moment in history for greatness. I \nsincerely hope we rise to the challenge because I believe the future of \nthe Republic depends on it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Pesticide Regulation\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about another \nexample of an EPA that, I believe, is out of step with American \nagriculture.\n  EPA continues to pursue regulations that would require farmers to \nfile for an additional permit if they want to apply pesticides, while \njust last month EPA Administrator Jackson mentioned ``the critical work \nthat farmers are doing to protect our soil, air, and water resources.'' \nYet the EPA continues, I believe, to handcuff our farmers and our \nranchers with very stringent new regulations but still expects them to \ndo all they can to feed a hungry world.\n  Time and time again, farmers have consistently proven to be excellent \nstewards of the environment. They make their living from the land, and \nthey are very mindful of maintaining and protecting and improving it. I \nspeak from experience. I grew up on a farm.\n  Unfortunately, we have watched organizations use the courts to twist \nlaws against American agricultural production. A Democratic Congressman \nfrom California recently noted that EPA ``often pursues a course of \nagency activism.'' He points out that EPA is using the settlement of \nlawsuits to give them jurisdiction over issues that may not be allowed \nunder existing law.\n  More and more we are seeing important policy decisions that impact \nagriculture arise not from the legislative process, where it should \narise from, but from the litigation process where a lawsuit settlement \nresults in policy decisions being made.\n  In January 2009 a court overturned the normal practice of allowing \nfarmers to apply pesticides as long as they complied with labeling \nrequirements under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide \nAct, which is known as FIFRA.\n  The Sixth Circuit Court ruled that EPA doubly regulate pesticide \napplications under FIFRA and the Clean Water Act. Well, at least 25 \nSenate and House Members, including myself, supported an amicus brief \nurging review of the court's very ill-advised decision. But, instead, \nthe Obama administration chose to wave the white flag, ignoring the \nscience and caving to activists. They urged the Supreme Court not to \nhear the case and to let the ruling stand.\n  For years EPA managed pesticide permitting within established \nenvironmental and safety requirements. Yet the administration refused \nto defend what was a very established, longstanding approach. The EPA \nasked for a 2-year delay to write the permit and set up a compliance \nregime. They moved forward with onerous permitting requirements for our \nproducers that will provide no environmental gain. This would subject \nthe pesticide applicators to new and duplicative requirements--a \ndistinct shift in how the EPA regulates pesticides. It created a whole \nnew world. This additional permitting is now inefficient, it is \nunnecessary, and I would argue it is inappropriate for agriculture.\n  EPA's permitting requirements also present a challenge to local \npublic health officials who work to control mosquitoes and prevent the \nspread of disease. The American Mosquito Control Association estimates \nthat complying with the additional regulation could cost each pesticide \nuser at least $200,000 and potentially $600,000 in California \nalone. The dual permit requirement may reduce the availability of \npesticides proven to control mosquito populations. Thus, the ability of \npublic health officials to control mosquitoes and the spread of disease \nwill be hindered.\n\n  We all know bugs and weeds won't wait on another additional permit \nfrom EPA, and I surely don't think farmers and public officials should \nhave to go through this additional process. Last week, the House of \nRepresentatives passed the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act--H.R. 872. \nIt passed with overwhelming support. I am very pleased to report it was \na bipartisan vote of 292 to 130. Democratic Congressman Collin \nPeterson, with whom I worked when I was Secretary of Agriculture and \nwhom I have a lot of respect for, said this:\n\n       It was never the intent of Congress to burden producers \n     with additional permit requirements that would have little to \n     no environmental benefit.\n\n  I could not agree more with the former chair of the House Agriculture \nCommittee. But he is not alone. Fifty-seven of his Democratic \ncolleagues supported this bipartisan legislation to set the record \nstraight and send a clear message to the EPA.\n  Here in the Senate, I am a cosponsor of a similar bill Senator \nRoberts introduced this week. I am pleased to stand here today and \nsupport his bill. Both of these bills are designed to eliminate this \nburdensome, costly, redundant permit requirement for pesticide \napplications. I commend his efforts here. He is trying to do something \nto solve this problem while protecting farmers and ranchers from \nadditional regulation, but also very mindful of our environment.\n  I urge the majority leader to act quickly on the legislation to \naddress the EPA's redundant and costly double-permitting requirements. \nWe can address this in the Senate. If we don't find a solution, our \nproducers will continue being told how to operate in a very difficult \nenvironment. Our producers already deal with the uncertainty of Mother \nNature. We should\n\n[[Page S2161]]\n\nnot infuse even more uncertainty into their lives in the form of these \nregulations that duplicate with no discernible benefit.\n  President Obama recently promised to eliminate programs that \nduplicate each other. In fact, he issued an Executive order calling for \na governmentwide review to identify programs that either duplicated or, \nas he said at the time, were just plain dumb. I submit to my colleagues \nthat this pesticide double regulation is unnecessary and as dumb as it \ngets.\n  We should support our farmers and ranchers as they produce safe, \naffordable food. They are working to protect the land. American \nagriculture can continue to feed the world, and our farmers will \ncontinue to care for the land, unless we set up unnecessary roadblocks.\n  This redundant pesticide permitting requirement is another example of \noverreach. I hope the Senate will follow the example of the House which \nvoted resoundingly in a very bipartisan way to correct this situation. \nWe cannot afford to delay, with the compliance date right around the \ncorner. It is a deadline we simply cannot ignore.\n  Mr. President, thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 183\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to express my \nstrong opposition to any attempt to prevent the Environmental \nProtection Agency from doing its job and protecting our families and \nour environment. The amendments being considered here in the Senate \nwould hurt our environment and harm our national security by increasing \nour dependence on foreign oil. They would devastate our public health \nefforts, and take us in the wrong direction as we fight to compete and \nwin and create jobs in the 21st century clean energy economy.\n  The positions of leading scientists and doctors and public health \nexperts are clear. Global climate change is real, it is harmful, and it \nhas to be addressed. Rolling back EPA's standards would be devastating \nto the health of our families, and especially our children. These are \nsettled issues in the scientific world. We shouldn't be spending time \ndebating them over and over on the Senate floor.\n  By the way, with the price of oil spiking and families paying more \nand more at the pump, we ought to be focused on ways to move our \ncountry away from our dependence on foreign oil. These amendments would \ndo exactly the opposite. They will disrupt efficiency standards that \nsacrifice billions of gallons of fuel savings and increasing our \nforeign imports. They will derail the cooperative efforts of automakers \nand autoworkers and EPA and States to develop these unified, national \nstandards that provide certainty for businesses to invest in new \ntechnologies. Frankly, they would be harmful to our national security. \nEvery dollar we spend overseas to pay for oil is more money in the \npockets of countries that are too often far from friendly to our \nnational security interests, and that doesn't make any sense to me.\n  But this debate isn't just about health and the environment, and it \nis not just about our national security dependence on foreign oil. It \nis also about jobs and the economy, which is exactly what we ought to \nbe focused on right now.\n  We are currently working on legislation on the floor to help small \nbusiness owners to innovate and grow, to give them the resources they \nneed so they can expand and add jobs and compete in a global economy. \nThese amendments being considered to that bill will move our country in \nthe opposite direction.\n  First of all, they are going to cause massive uncertainty and \nupheaval for clean energy companies such as the McKinstry Company in my \nhome State of Washington that is working right now to create jobs and \ngrow and create a clean energy economy. If the rules of the game keep \nchanging, businesses are never going to have the confidence they need \nto invest and add workers.\n  Second of all, we all know America needs to move quickly into the \n21st century clean energy economy. Other countries such as China and \nIndia are pouring resources into investments that are creating jobs and \nbuilding infrastructure. We need to make sure we position ourselves to \ncompete and win in this critical sector.\n  That is why instead of harmful legislation and amendments that would \ntake us in the wrong direction--instead of doing that--we should be \ntalking about policies that reduce our dependence on foreign oil, \nsupport our national security objectives, and unshackle our economy, so \nwe can tap the creative energy of our Nation's workers and support good \nfamily wage jobs, and make sure our workers continue leading the way in \nthis 21st century economy. That is the direction our country needs to \nbe moving--toward a healthy and clean environment and toward the clean \nenergy jobs of the future. We can't bury our heads in the sand and \nexpect our energy and our environmental problems to somehow disappear.\n  The longer we put off dealing with these issues, the more it is going \nto cost us in the future, and that is exactly what the amendments on \nthe floor today will do. They are bad for the environment, they are bad \nfor the economy, and they are dangerous to our family's health.\n  The science on these issues is very clear and it is something the \npeople in my home State of Washington take very seriously. Because when \nfamilies across America go outside for some fresh air or turn on their \ntap and hope to have a clean glass of water, they expect these \nresources to be just that: clean.\n  Once again, I strongly oppose any attempt to take away the EPA's \nability to do their job, and I hope we can work together to find real \nsolutions to the critical problems that face our country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today the President is heading to \nPhiladelphia to talk about energy. Well, the President talks a good \ngame but, unlike energy, talk is cheap.\n  The President plans to host a townhall meeting about his new energy \npolicy. I think it is time the rhetoric face the reality of what the \ncountry is seeing, experiencing, and dealing with. If the President \ntruly wants to get a handle on energy costs, he needs to start by \nimmediately stopping his Environmental Protection Agency from \nattempting to enact backdoor cap-and-trade regulation.\n  That is exactly what the EPA is doing. The only effect that can have \nis to increase energy costs on American families. The President himself \nadmitted as much in 2008. At that time, in an interview with a San \nFrancisco newspaper, he said: ``Under my plan of a cap-and-trade \nsystem, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.''\n  Is the President serious about decreasing U.S. dependency on foreign \noil? If so, he should then rescind his veto threat against today's \ncongressional legislation regarding the policies of the EPA.\n  That is why I am here in support of the McConnell amendment. The \nMcConnell amendment keeps energy prices low. It prevents the EPA from \nblocking the development of domestic energy. It restores the Clean Air \nAct to its original congressional intent. I support the McConnell \ncommonsense amendment.\n  Most likely, today we will hear more of the same from the President \nin his speech and townhall meeting in Philadelphia, and more of the \nsame is the last thing the American people need right now. American \nfamilies are facing increasing gas prices. Our national security is \nbeing jeopardized by dependence on foreign sources of energy. Unrest in \nthe Middle East and North Africa is driving high prices even higher.\n  The Department of Energy has made an estimate that families all \nacross this country will spend $700 more on gasoline this year than \nthey did last year. Meanwhile, the President will most likely deliver \nanother speech with great goals but limited action.\n\n[[Page S2162]]\n\n  With gasoline at over $3.50 a gallon, the President fails to \nappreciate the effect his administration's policies have on families \nwith bills, with kids, and with mortgages to pay.\n  In 2008, President Obama, then a candidate for President, said that \nthe problem wasn't that gas prices were too high but that they had \nrisen too fast. In his words, he said he ``would have preferred a more \ngradual adjustment.'' This may explain why the President spent his \nfirst 2 years in the White House undermining and abandoning an all-of-\nthe-above approach to energy. It is no wonder that he is now trying to \ncast blame on those who are offering a responsible alternative.\n  The President says he wants to cut our imports of foreign oil by a \nthird by 2025. Well, to me, he doesn't appear to have the right vision \nor political will to get there. The United States has the most combined \nenergy resources on Earth, but when faced with new sources of U.S. \nenergy, the administration's automatic response has been to regulate, \ndelay, or to shut down.\n  The President's ``say one thing, do another'' policy is making the \npain at the pump even worse. His approach is long on making promises, \nshort on taking responsibility. He talks of his concern for the people \naffected by the gulf oilspill. Yet his drilling shutdown in the Gulf of \nMexico killed their jobs and strangles energy production even today. \nU.S. offshore oil production is expected to drop 15 percent this year \nthanks to the policies of this administration.\n  The President's claim that blaming his administration for ``shutting \ndown oil production''--he says it doesn't track with reality. But I \nwill tell you that the administration's stalling on gulf oil and gas \ndrilling permits is so antibusiness that even former President Bill \nClinton called it ``ridiculous.'' Even as the President says he wants \nto cut oil imports, he told an audience in Brazil a week or two ago \nthat he wants the United States to become ``one of Brazil's best \ncustomers'' for oil. He said he would expedite new drilling permits. He \nclaims oil companies are ``sitting on supplies of American energy just \nwaiting to be tapped.'' But the biggest thing standing in the way is \nredtape from his own Interior Department and EPA. While ``use it or \nlose it'' makes for a nice sound bite, it ignores the reality that the \nObama administration's own policies are the most significant roadblock \nwe have to drilling and exploring for American energy.\n  The President also claims to support alternative fuels. Yet he didn't \nonce mention converting coal into fuel or tapping oil shale. Oil shale \nproduction could produce an estimated 800 billion barrels of \nrecoverable oil. That is three times the amount of Saudi Arabia's oil \nreserves.\n  The way we can address our economic and national security needs is by \nproducing more American energy. We can't afford to pick and choose our \nenergy at a time of uncertainty. We do need it all. This means allowing \nmore U.S. exploration and lifting the burdensome regulations that make \nit harder for Americans to produce more energy.\n  Renewable energy is part of it, it is important, but there is no way \ngreen energy and green jobs can replace the red, white, and blue energy \nand jobs that have continued to power our country for over a century. \nUntil the administration acknowledges this, the administration's \npolicies will continue to make the pain at the pump even worse. That is \nwhy I urge the Members of this body to adopt the McConnell amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nMcConnell amendment. I listened to my distinguished colleague from \nWyoming, and I enjoy working with him, but this is one subject on which \nwe fundamentally disagree.\n  This isn't about energy production; this is about clean air. This \namendment is a blatant attack on the Clean Air Act, and, from my \nperspective in New Jersey, any attack on the Clean Air Act is an attack \non New Jersey.\n  Primarily because of dirty, old, out-of-State coal plants, every \ncounty in New Jersey is noncompliant with the Clean Air Act--not by \nwhat we do but what other States do. One of those coal powerplants is \nthe aging Portland Generating Station, located just across the Delaware \nRiver. This plant emitted 30,000 tons of sulfur dioxide in 2009. That \nis almost three times the amount of all seven of New Jersey's coal \nplants combined. So we have cleaned up our act. Others need to do it \nfor the collective air we breathe as Americans. Its pollutants waft \nacross the Delaware River into numerous New Jersey counties, causing \nand exacerbating a whole host of respiratory illnesses, from asthma to \nheart disease. If not for the Clean Air Act, my State or any other \nState similarly situated would not have been able to petition the \nFederal Government to stop the pollution this Pennsylvania plant spews \ninto New Jersey's air.\n  Just last week, New Jerseyans received some good news. Under the \nauthority of the Clean Air Act, the Federal Government proposed a rule \nthat would grant my State's petition. If finalized in coming months, \nthe rule would lead to an over 80 percent reduction in the Portland \ncoal plant's sickening sulfur dioxide emissions. If not for the Clean \nAir Act, my State would not have this victory within its grasp. It \nwouldn't have the opportunity to protect its citizens. We simply cannot \ngut the one piece of Federal legislation that protects the air we \nbreathe.\n  Imagine having to tell your children they cannot go outside to play \nbecause the wind is not blowing quite the right way, because the air \nthey will breathe will damage their lungs. The McCloskeys from Delran, \nNJ, don't have to imagine that scenario; they know it. Let me tell you \nabout Erin McCloskey. On poor air quality days in the summer, their \ndaughter Erin could not even make it to the family car, much less go \noutside and play, without starting to wheeze. Family activity began to \nrevolve around trips to the doctor, treatments, and stays at the \nhospital. It was a severe economic hardship on the family not just \nbecause of costs but also because all of these trips made it difficult \nfor Erin's mother Natalie to hold down a job.\n  The McCloskeys are not alone. Four-year-old Christian Aquino, from \nCamden, NJ, suffers from severe asthma. He takes six different \nmedications a day to control asthma attacks, but still his mother, Iris \nValerio, lives with the constant fear that an attack is around the \ncorner. On bad air days, they avoid going outside, and when on the \nhighway in traffic, the windows are kept closed.\n  Fourteen-year-old Samaad Bethea, of Elizabeth, NJ, also suffers from \nsevere asthma. He has been on daily steroid medication to control his \nasthma for 3 years. If he skips a day, his lungs start to falter and he \ncan't catch his breath. His mother Sharon realized that pollution in \ntheir old neighborhood was triggering attacks and had an opportunity to \nmove the family. Since that move, Samaad has been doing much better, \nbut he still requires daily steroid medication.\n  These children are part of a sobering national reality, a New Jersey \nreality. Their days revolve around inhalers, steroids, and constant \nanxiety over when air pollution will trigger another severe asthma \nattack.\n  According to the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \neach year over 10,000 New Jerseyans are hospitalized due to asthma \nattacks triggered by air quality problems. Thousands of sick days are \ntaken each day in New Jersey by either asthmatics or parents of \nasthmatics, with huge consequences for the New Jersey economy. Asthma \nattacks triggered by air pollution cause scores of premature deaths in \nmy State each year.\n  Erin McCloskey, Christian Aquino, and Samaad Bethea bring these \nstatistics to life. While the causes of their asthma are many, air \npollution is a common trigger. The Clean Air Act directly impacts their \nhealth, their quality of life, and even the ability of their parents to \nget or keep a job. For them and for thousands of children like them, \nweakening the Clean Air Act will mean more days sequestered in their \nhomes and more emergency room visits.\n  The McConnell amendment--the one I call the dirty air amendment--is \nthe first of many amendments we can expect to see that are aimed at \npreventing the Federal Government from regulating polluters under the \nClean Air Act.\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\n  Caring about children's health means not allowing polluters to place \nprofits ahead of people, ahead of the well-being of our children--and I \nmean all children, no matter their race, ethnicity, or class. Low-\nincome and minority Americans continue to be disproportionately exposed \nto pollution that is harmful to their health. A recent analysis showed, \nfor example, that two-thirds of U.S. Latinos--about 25.6 million \nAmericans--live in areas that do not meet the air quality standards \nunder the Clean Air Act. Perhaps this begins to explain why Hispanic \nAmericans are three times more likely than Whites to die from asthma \nattacks, why Latino children are 60 percent more likely than Whites to \nhave asthma.\n\n  Low-income and minority Americans will also be disproportionately \naffected by the impacts of climate change. Let's be clear. The \nscientific consensus is overwhelming. Climate change will increasingly \ncreate more frequent and more extreme storms, more violent and \nsustained heat waves, meaning more costly and dangerous floods and \ndroughts. Hotter summer days will mean more ozone formation and more \nbad air quality days. In this way, climate change directly endangers \nall of us, our children, and our children's children. But changes in \nweather patterns and increasingly extreme weather events also result in \nindirect effects. The security of our food supply will be at risk due \nto more frequent heat stress. The security of water supplies will be at \nrisk due to droughts.\n  For all of these reasons, scientists agree that climate pollution \nendangers public health and welfare. That is well understood, and we \ncan curtail these risks by regulating climate pollution. But, no, big \npolluters want to kick the can down the road. They want to pretend they \naren't polluting. Big polluters want to pretend these risks aren't \nreal. They want the McConnell amendment to pass so they can continue \nbusiness as usual.\n  This is not about energy because if the New Jersey coal-fired plants \nultimately reduced their emissions by 80 percent, it is a question of \nan investment. They are still producing energy. There are 9.3 million \npeople in the State. They are producing energy, but the reality is that \nthey are doing it in a cleaner way. That is what this issue is about.\n  We must not allow polluters to set our priorities. How many children \nin New Jersey or in other parts of the country face the reality of \ndirty air? How many children are we willing to have deathly ill in \norder to allow polluters to continue to spew toxins into the air we \ncollectively breathe? Doing so risks not only our health and that of \nfuture generations, it risks the promise of a green economy built on \nclean energy jobs, energy-efficiency innovations, and reduced waste and \npollution.\n  I urge my colleagues to stop the effort to gut the Clean Air Act and \nto defeat this amendment. Let's make sure we bequeath to future \ngenerations the ability to have air that, ultimately, we can \ncollectively breathe, that doesn't sicken our families and undermine \nour collective health.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe McConnell amendment. This amendment prevents EPA from continuing to \nreach beyond Congress's clear intent under the Clean Air Act.\n  Congress did not authorize greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean \nAir Act. This amendment is an appropriate response to clarify the law \nthat is being misinterpreted. The EPA should not be making policy \ndecisions beyond the authority clearly granted to the Agency by \nCongress.\n  Let us remember, last year, Congress rejected the cap-and-trade \nagenda on a bipartisan basis. The EPA's agenda is a job-destroying \nagenda. It will raise the price of energy, food, and gasoline. The cost \nof this policy will be transferred to the people of Arkansas and all \nAmericans every time they shop at the store.\n  The EPA's agenda will not lead to a cleaner environment. American \nmanufacturing will be hurt, and our manufacturing capacity will be \nreplaced by foreign competitors with weak environmental standards. This \namendment will allow individual States to keep existing policies in \nplace by permitting them to regulate emissions as they see fit.\n  This amendment also enables the EPA to focus on the important \npurposes of the Clean Air Act, which I strongly support. The Clean Air \nAct must be used to protect the public from harmful pollution. The \nClean Air Act was not intended to address climate change concerns.\n  Finally, let me address a myth we keep hearing. Some have stated the \nSupreme Court is forcing the EPA to take this heavy-handed, backdoor, \ncap-and-tax approach. This is wrong. The Supreme Court stated that the \nEPA can decide whether greenhouse gases endanger public health and \nwelfare. Many Senators believe the Supreme Court's interpretation of \nthe law is wrong. Yet EPA made a political decision based on the \nCourt's ruling to expand their jurisdiction far beyond what Congress \nintended. This amendment will correct that action.\n  Others have stated this amendment would permanently eliminate the \nEPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases. This is also wrong. No \npolicy is permanent unless it is part of our Constitution, and even the \nConstitution can be amended. We can enact this amendment and still have \na debate in this body about needed policy changes in the future.\n  Finally, let me quickly address some of the alternatives to this \namendment that are being suggested. Some of my colleagues have \nsuggested delaying the EPA's actions by 2 years. Others have suggested \nthat one sector of the economy or another should be exempted from EPA's \nunnecessary and burdensome rules.\n  I would suggest these proposals do not provide the cover some \nSenators want. Bad policy is bad policy whether carried out this year \nor 2 years from now. Our job creators need certainty. Restraining the \nEPA for 2 years will not provide the certainty they need to invest and \ncreate more jobs. Exempting one sector of the economy is also not \nenough. There is no excuse for protecting just one sector while \nwatching Americans in other sectors lose their jobs to foreign \ncompetitors.\n  At the moment, our priority must be job creation, protecting our \nindustrial and manufacturing sectors, and keeping gas and food prices \nlow. We must make sure the EPA avoids politically driven initiatives \nand becomes focused on its core mission: protecting air and water \nquality and preventing exposure to toxic contamination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Franken pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n133 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few moments on \nbehalf of the McConnell-Inhofe amendment. I thank them for their \nleadership in dealing with governmental regulation of carbon dioxide \nand other greenhouse gases, amendment No. 183. I want to share a few \nthoughts about a matter that is important to me. I served several years \nas ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee. I am interested in \nour legal system and how it works. I have to say that the Supreme Court \nruling that resulted in the situation we are in today is a classic \nexample of how unelected officials--not just judges--can make laws and \nregulations in a manner that is dramatically contrary to the ideals of \nthe American Founders, and in a manner that is contrary to the ideals \non which this country was founded, ideals that require accountability, \nthat require responsibility and that allow the American people to hold \ntheir officials responsible and accountable for what they do.\n  For this reason alone I believe the McConnell-Inhofe amendment should \nbe agreed to, because we are talking about a situation in which \nunelected\n\n[[Page S2164]]\n\ngovernmental employees are systematically going about regulating \nemission of CO2 in the country under a very attenuated \ntheory. They were never given the explicit authority to do so.\n  They will, under the power they have asserted, have the ability to \nregulate your automobile, the heating unit in your home, hospitals, \nbusinesses, cities, and anything else that utilizes carbon fuels to \nproduce energy. This is what it is all about.\n  How did it happen? What occurred here? Well over forty years ago, \nCongress passed the first Clean Air Act, and since then, Congress has \namended the Act several times. Congress was focused on cleaning up the \nair and dealing with smog, particulates, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur \ndioxide--all of these pollutants were being emitted into our atmosphere \nand were affecting the health and well-being of Americans, particularly \nin cities, and Congress took action to contain that, and it has helped \nproduce a much cleaner environment. Pollution was far worse 40 years \nago than it is today. Our atmosphere has far fewer dangerous pollutants \nin it and, in that regard, the Clean Air Act has been very successful.\n  But since this Earth was created we have had a marvelous balance. \nHuman beings and animals breathe in air. They take in oxygen out of \nthat air and they breathe out carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is not a \npollutant. We have never considered it to be a pollutant. Plants, as \nyou know from your basic high school classes, take in carbon dioxide \nand emit oxygen as part of a life cycle process that is marvelous and \nwonderful beyond our ability to express.\n  Over the course of centuries and millennia, plants in the world took \nin carbon dioxide and, eventually, were buried in the earth. As a \nresult, the carbon dioxide in those plants was trapped underground and \ndeveloped into coal, oil, and other fuels. In recent years we have been \ntaking those fuels out of the ground and burning it and, as a result, \nreleasing the carbon dioxide.\n  When the Clean Air Act was passed, there was no discussion or thought \nabout any potential danger of a warming planet. Congress did not have \nthe slightest idea at that time that thousands of bureaucrats would be \nable to one day take the Clean Air Act that they passed and control \nevery home, every business, every city, every car, and every hospital \nin America.\n  What happened? The concern over global warming arose. Whatever people \nbelieve about that, the concern certainly is out there. Many people \nbelieve it is a serious threat. Others think it is not so serious. But \nat any rate, a lawsuit was filed. That is what we have so much of in \nthis country. People file lawsuits, especially on environmental issues. \nThey said: The planet is warming, and one reason it is warming is \nbecause there is a global warming gas, CO2, that is being \nemitted more today, and this is a danger to us and we believe it is a \npollutant now. So, they would call CO2, which naturally \noccurs in our atmosphere and is used by plants and vegetation, a \npollutant because the planet is warming. What do you say, Supreme \nCourt? The Court responds: We say it is a pollutant, and the EPA should \nbe allowed to regulate it. By a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court \nseems to say, but not with much clarity, that EPA should look at \nregulating CO2 because that is what they said the Clean Air \nAct meant to allow.\n  First of all, I don't think the statute meant that. I agree with the \nfour judges who dissented. I believe Congress never had any intent \nwhatsoever to give EPA the ability to control the emission of \nCO2 all over America. I have no doubt of that. It is not in \nthe statute in a way that would clearly enable the Supreme Court to say \nthat. I suspect it was a product of activism. Judges got excited about \nthe claim several years ago regarding the danger of CO2 and \nglobal warming. Never mind that there seems to be actually less concern \ntoday about global warming. In any event, those judges wanted to see \nCO2 regulated and they interpreted the statute in a manner \nthat would allow for it. Now the Environmental Protection Agency is \nsetting about to do so. It is a major intervention by the U.S. \nGovernment in every aspect of American life.\n  EPA regulation of carbon dioxide has the potential to drive up costs \nfor individual Americans as they heat their homes and drive their cars \nand will place a real burden economically on the American economy. It \nwill put us in a bad situation economically.\n  So the McConnell-Inhofe amendment says: Wait a minute. Congress did \nnot approve that. We do not want to do that yet. We do not want EPA \nregulating CO2 all over the country unless we direct them to \ndo so--unless we, the elected representatives, decide it ought to be \ndone. This important decision should not be made by five out of the \nnine members of the Supreme Court with lifetime appointments, totally \nunaccountable to the American people, or tens of thousands of \ngovernmental employees--public servants, bureaucrats--in the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. They do not get to do it either.\n  It is our responsibility. If we are going to impose a massive \nregulatory burden on every American in this Nation, this Congress ought \nto decide when and how and under what circumstances it should be done. \nWe have people in this Congress and in this government who act like \nCongress has no control over it. They think: The Supreme Court rules, \nand EPA issues its regulations.\n  Well, why do you not do something about it? They say: Oh, that just \nhappens. We do not have any responsibility. It is not our \nresponsibility. Do not blame me. You do not like it. Well, it was not \nmy fault. I did not pass the Clean Air Act over 40 years ago. I was not \non the Supreme Court. I am not an EPA bureaucrat.\n  But we are the United States Congress, and we are accountable to the \nAmerican people. It is a question of constitutionalism. It is a \nquestion of separation of powers. This a question of responsibility. If \nwe were to decide that the emission of CO2 is a significant \ndanger to our environment and it ought to be regulated, let's vote to \nsay so.\n  At this point in time, we are not able financially and there is not \nenough scientific evidence or justification for going forward with the \nregulation of CO2. And I am constrained to believe massive \nregulation is not the appropriate thing to do today--but that is a \ndecision Congress ought to make.\n  We ought to be held accountable for the decisions we make. That is \nthe way our country was set up to conduct issues of importance. I have \nto tell you, this is a big issue that is before the Senate. We should \nhave tremendous debate, weeks of debate, because federal regulation of \nthese kinds of emissions could result in hundreds of billions of \ndollars in cost--or even trillions of dollars in cost, if we set about \nto regulate all CO2 in America. It just is.\n  I do not see how it can be disputed. Unfortunately, we act like we \nare washing our hands of it. The Supreme Court did not make a policy \ndecision that this was the right thing to do. That is not their role. \nIn fact, they will deny that is what they did. They would say: All we \ndid was take a statute passed long ago, before global warming was even \nconsidered an issue to be confronted by the Congress, and decided that \nthe statute Congress passed then allows EPA to regulate CO2 \nnow. And because of five justices, an unelected group of American \nemployees are setting about to regulate carbon dioxide and other \ngreenhouse gases. We do not need to do that.\n  The American people should not allow this to happen. They should \ndemand that their Congress be responsible for what it does when it \nimposes such a monumental cost on the economy and the American people. \nThat is our responsibility. The McConnell-Inhofe Amendment before the \nSenate today faces up to that squarely. It says we are not going to \nallow this circuitous route of interpretation of statutes to result in \none of the most massive governmental intrusions in American life to \noccur. It ought to be a matter of intense public debate and national \ndiscussion before such a thing happens.\n  I salute my colleagues for offering their amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 215\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we are going to be voting this \nafternoon on a number of EPA amendments, one of which is mine, which \ncalls for a short 2-year waiting period but does not shut down in any \nway the EPA, particularly on CAFE standards.\n  So I have two messages: One is that I hope but doubt--but \nnevertheless hope--people will vote for my amendment. As of last \nDecember, I would have gotten every Republican vote, but when they \nbroke away from the omnibus reconciliation agreement those votes all \nwent out the window. I think they will all vote for the McConnell \namendment, which I think is a mistake. So let me explain.\n  First of all, I am very opposed to the McConnell amendment. I think \nit is foolish. It overreaches. It is briefly satisfying and devastating \non a long-term basis. A case in point: It undermines the ability--\nbecause it obliterates the EPA--to set CAFE standards. Too few people \nin this body understand that 31 percent of all carbon emissions come \nout of the rear end of trucks and cars and other vehicles and that the \nright and the power and the science to set CAFE standards is an \nincredibly--incredibly--important mission of the EPA.\n  Under the McConnell amendment, that, along with everything else EPA \ndoes, is out the window on a permanent basis. It is goodbye EPA \nforever. That strikes me as not a mature approach to legislation.\n  I understand the frustration. We have that in West Virginia. The EPA \ndoes not understand necessarily the nuances of economic situations, \nthat there is a more exacting way to present legislation. So I call for \na 2-year timeout period, but I do not abolish EPA. I just say for a \nperiod of 2 years they should not do regulations on power stations, \nmanufacturing plants, or oil refineries. That strikes me as not being \nfatal; it strikes me as something that could become law.\n  The most important point I can say about the McConnell amendment--I \njust pray this sinks in; it will not, but I pray that it will--there is \nnot one chance in 10 trillion that the McConnell amendment will become \nlaw. It will not happen. He shuts the EPA down permanently, in all \nrespects, forever. It will never happen. I doubt it will pass the \nSenate. It will certainly not pass at any other level where it counts.\n  So why do they do that? They do that because it does not solve the \nproblem; it makes a point. It makes people feel good because they are \nmad, but, in fact, it does great destruction to our future. It does not \nsolve a problem, and I am here to solve problems.\n  What I think we do need is a timeout just to stop the imposition of \nEPA regulations that do not allow for development of clean \ntechnologies--and that would hurt the economy at a very critical point \nin our still slowly moving recovery--but to do it in a way that keeps \nus all focused and working on a long-term energy policy.\n  Yes, we have had problems with the EPA in West Virginia, but the \nanswer is not to get rid of the agency forever. It is just \nincomprehensible to me that mature people could actually be for that, \nvote for that, espouse that, but they have.\n  As of last December, when we were doing the Omnibus appropriations \nbill, every Republican had agreed more or less to vote for my bill--\njust a 2-year timeout which should not affect CAFE standards. Then all \nof a sudden nine Republicans defected. The election had already been \nheld. The House was about to go into Republican hands. Once they \ndefected, then everything crashed down. All of the votes I would have \ngotten from the Republican Party are now gone. I doubt I will get any \nvotes from the Republican Party and not many from my own party, which I \nregret but I understand.\n  I believe in clean coal. People say ``coal.'' I much like it better \nif they say ``clean coal'' because if it is just coal the way it is in \nthe ground, we are not going anywhere, and natural gas will overtake \ncoal, put them out of business. I have said this to the coal operators \nquite frequently. They do not believe me, but I think it is true.\n  It has happened in North Carolina in 12 powerplants. It is happening \nin Ohio. It is happening in lots of places. I have nothing against \nnatural gas. We have a lot of natural gas. Natural gas, however, has \none-half of the carbon that coal does. It has one-half. They call \nthemselves a clean fuel, and in relation to coal in the ground, they \nare, but 50 percent is a long way from what we are already doing in \nWest Virginia, which is taking 90 percent of the carbon out of coal as \nit comes out of the ground.\n  It goes to a powerplant, where there is Dow Chemical Company on the \none hand, and American Electric Power on the other, and they have \nalready--and I have been to see their plants, and I have seen their \nresults, and I went with Secretary Chu--they are taking 90 percent of \nthe carbon out of coal. That is not bad. You can call that clean coal.\n  We have a gigantic energy problem. We need everything we can get. I \nwas even prepared to be for nuclear, which is about 20 percent of our \ncurrent power structure. I am not sure where I am right now. I have to \nthink more deeply about that. I am worried because our powerplants are \nold, also, as the Japanese ones are.\n  So all I can say is, I am for keeping our eye on the ball. I am not \nfor making us sort of feel good on a very temporary basis. Everybody \ngets mad at the EPA. It is just sort of like an opening day in American \nbaseball. You just do it and people cheer. But if you do it the way it \nis done in this amendment, by abolishing the agency, that is a long \nseason, and it is a bad win-lose record.\n  So I hope my amendment will get sufficient votes. I am not sure. I do \nnot think it will because I think the folks on the other side of the \naisle have completely deserted it because they feel a great solidarity, \nwant to show their power, and along comes an elimination bill. I just \ncould not be for that. Morally I could not be for that.\n  I am strongly for West Virginia coal miners. I just came back last \nnight from the first anniversary of the 29 coal miners who died. It was \nnot an anniversary; it was a memorial. It is a powerful, powerful life \nbeing a coal miner. It is unknown to most people what it is like, what \nthe dangers are, but they do it and they are strong. But what they \nproduce could be cleaned up. The technology is there. That is what my \namendment would do: give a 2-year timeout to let us work the \ntechnology, try to be convincing to Wall Street, and then we could be \non our way to have not only natural gas but every single alternative \nenergy that you and I could possibly think of--perhaps minus ethanol, \nbut that is a different story--and we would be on our way.\n  In any event, it is a clear choice. Clean coal has to play a role in \nmeeting our energy needs. It is abundant. It can be clean. The \ntechnology is there. More is on the way. So I hope people will vote for \nmy amendment, and I hope very strongly they will vote against the \nMcConnell amendment.\n  In the final analysis, I guess if they do not, and they vote for the \nMcConnell amendment, they are going to lose anyway because it is never \ngoing to get anywhere. It is a guaranteed loser in the legislative \nprocess. I think mine could be helpful.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 183\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in a couple of hours from now the Senate \nwill vote on the Inhofe-McConnell amendment which would prevent the EPA \nfrom moving forward with dangerous--I said ``dangerous,'' but certainly \nharmful to business and certainly costly--greenhouse gas regulations. I \nwould hope my colleagues in the Senate will support that amendment for \na number of reasons because it bears heavily on one of the great \ndebates we are having in the country today. I think the American people \nmust find it confusing--I certainly do--when you get all these mixed \nsignals coming from the elected leaders in Washington, DC.\n  The American people must be incredibly confused because the President \nhas said--rhetorically, at least, he has talked about the need to \nreduce our dependence, our dangerous dependence, upon foreign energy. \nHe talked recently about getting the number of barrels of oil we import \nevery day down by one-third at the end of this decade. The fact is, we \ndo spend $1 billion every single day on foreign oil. There is $1\n\n[[Page S2166]]\n\nbillion we export from this country because of the addiction we have to \nforeign sources of energy.\n  The problem is, everything this administration is doing is contrary \nto that goal. If we look at policies that are coming out of Washington, \nDC, right now, today, they completely contradict this idea that we \nought to be moving toward energy independence and getting away from \nthis dangerous dependence we have on foreign sources of energy.\n  I will make a couple of points.\n  We have, of course, in the Gulf of Mexico the so-called permitorium. \nWe have not been issuing permits to explore, to continue the work that \nis being done down there in terms of energy exploration. The Outer \nContinental Shelf has been put off limits by this administration, and \nmany Federal lands where there are abundant energy resources have also \nbeen placed off limits. In fact, there were some areas that had been \ndeveloped or where there were going to be permits issued for \nexploration in some of the States in the West where we know we have \nabundant energy resources that have now been repealed or pulled back by \nthe administration--just recently, 77 in the State of Utah, 1 in the \nState of Montana. We have enormous resources right here in our own \ncountry we could be developing that would get us away from sending this \n$1 billion a day, every single day, to countries around the world \nbecause of our addiction to energy.\n\n  The other thing tried in the Congress last year was a cap-and-trade \nbill. It passed the House of Representatives. It passed narrowly. It \nwas never voted upon in the Senate because there wasn't political \nsupport for it. That legislation would have also dramatically increased \nthe cost of energy in this country, making it more expensive for our \nsmall businesses to run their operations, and imposed dramatically \nhigher electricity and fuel costs on American consumers. That was a \ngiven. I think everybody conceded that was the case. But because there \nwasn't political support for it on Capitol Hill, it ended up not \nbecoming law.\n  What we have now coming out of the EPA is essentially a cap-and-trade \nbill through the back door. The EPA has decided they will do by \nregulation what they could not get done--the administration could not \nget done--through the political process in Congress.\n  The point I wish to make about that is the cap-and-trade bill, which \nwas widely debated and discussed at the time, would have driven up \nenergy costs for people in this country. This proposal by the EPA would \nhave the exact same impact and effect. In fact, if one is concerned \nabout economic growth and job creation, which we all should be--Lord \nknows, when we have almost 9 percent unemployment and lots of people in \nthis country looking for work, that ought to be our No. 1 priority--the \nfact that we would be putting policies in place that would be counter \nto creating jobs and getting capital deployed out there in our economy \nprobably defies explanation, at least for most Americans.\n  In fact, the American Council for Capital Formation projects that the \nuncertainty created by the EPA's climate change regulations would \nincrease the risk premium of capital by 30 to 40 percent.\n  The additional uncertainty is projected to reduce U.S. capital \ninvestment by as much as $400 billion per year.\n  So I would argue that if we are serious about creating jobs, if we \nare serious about growing the economy, why would we want to sideline \nhundreds of billions of dollars of capital every single year because of \nthese onerous and costly regulations?\n  This is a major reason why there is $2 trillion today sitting on the \nsidelines. It is talked about a lot, but nobody seems to be concerned \nabout changing that. What I hear repeatedly from those who are able to \ninvest and have capital to put to work is, they don't like the economic \nuncertainty coming out of Washington. In most cases, if not in every \ncase, it is focused on these regulations, on regulatory agencies, \nparticularly the EPA, that continue to come up with new proposals to \ndrive up the cost of doing business in this country.\n  There was a Charles River Associates study which projected the EPA's \ncap-and-trade regulations could increase wholesale electricity costs by \n35 to 45 percent and reduce average worker compensation by $700 per \nyear.\n  What is unfortunate about this whole situation is that the \nregulations will drive up energy and gasoline prices the most for \nmiddle- and low-income families. That is where the impact is going to \nbe most felt.\n  Roger Bezdek, who is the former Director of the Bureau of Economic \nAnalysis at the U.S. Department of Commerce, concluded recently that \nEPA's regulations:\n\n     . . . will impact low income groups, the elderly, and \n     minorities disproportionately, both because they have lower \n     incomes to begin with, but also because they have to spend \n     proportionately more of their income on energy, and rising \n     energy costs inflict great harm on these groups.\n\n  I would go on to point out that perhaps the greatest burden of \nincreased energy costs resulting from these new greenhouse gas \nregulations will fall upon the elderly Social Security recipients who \nrepresent 20 percent of all households in this country and who depend \nprimarily on fixed incomes. They have limited opportunity to increase \ntheir earnings from employment. They get hit the hardest. What these \nregulations are going to do is target and hit the people who can least \nafford to deal with them.\n  So we have an opportunity to do something about that. I think what we \nare seeing with the EPA and many of these government agencies is an \nexample of overreach, which is a function, in my view, of bureaucracies \nthat have gotten too big. We all talk about government. There is going \nto be, I think--I hope, at least--a great debate over the next couple \nyears as we address this issue of spending and debt, about the size of \ngovernment and how much government intervention we ought to have, and I \nthink most Americans have concluded that government has gotten too big \nand it has grown too fast. Perhaps the greatest example is these \nFederal agencies that have this tremendous propensity to want to \nregulate everything they can out there, to the detriment of many of our \nsmall businesses and those who are trying to create jobs.\n  As an example of how much our government has grown, the historical \naverage for this country and what we spend on the Federal Government as \na percentage of our total economy, as a percentage of our GDP, is about \n20.6 percent. This year, it is over 25 percent. So the government \ncontinues to expand, continues to grow relative to the economy. The \nprivate economy continues, by virtue of comparison, to shrink. We ought \nto be looking at what we can do to grow the private economy, what we \ncan do to create jobs, what we can do to create economic growth in this \ncountry as opposed to the things that are being done to expand \ngovernment.\n  The solution we have put forward today, the Inhofe-McConnell \namendment, is--there has been a lot of discussion about what it would \nor wouldn't do, but I wish to point out for my colleagues some things \nit would not do because it does get at the heart of this issue, which \nis preventing the EPA from moving forward with these costly and \nburdensome regulations.\n  There are a number of things it does not do. It does not prohibit \nStates from regulating greenhouse gases and addressing climate change. \nThe amendment expressly allows States to keep existing policies in \nplace and allows States to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as they \nsee fit. The bill also makes clear that any changes States have adopted \nin their State implementation programs and title V operating permit \nprograms pertaining to greenhouse gases are not federally enforceable.\n  The McConnell amendment does not overturn the agreement between the \nWhite House, California, the automakers, the EPA, and the Department of \nTransportation on greenhouse gas emissions from cars. A lot has been \nmade out of that issue. That is something the McConnell amendment does \nnot do. In fact, the amendment expressly preserves the auto agreement \nand the most recently enacted fuel efficiency standards.\n  In 2017 and beyond, the amendment ensures that any future national \nauto regulations concerning greenhouse gases will be decided by \nCongress, which, frankly, is where it should be\n\n[[Page S2167]]\n\ndecided, which is why this overreach is such an example of big \ngovernment gone bad.\n  The McConnell amendment does not overturn clean air and public health \nprotections under the Clean Air Act. The amendment maintains all the \nClean Air Act's provisions to protect the public from harmful \npollution. Thousands of Clean Air Act regulations would remain \nuntouched by this amendment. Certainly, this amendment does not, as has \nbeen suggested, gut the Clean Air Act. In fact, it is the contrary.\n  The amendment does, however, clarify that Congress never gave the EPA \nthe authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases for \nclimate change purposes. That responsibility, as I said before, lies \nand should lie with the Congress.\n  Finally, the McConnell amendment does not stop the U.S. Government \nfrom taking any action to address climate change. The amendment puts \nCongress in charge of U.S. climate and energy policy. Also, the bill \nexpressly preserves Federal research development and demonstration \nprograms addressing climate change.\n\n  So if Democrats in Congress want to enact climate change regulations, \nI would encourage them to bring a climate change bill to the floor. \nThis is where it should be debated, by the people's representatives, \nnot decided by bureaucrats in some Federal agency, which is what the \nEPA regulations would, in effect, do.\n  There are a number of amendments that have been offered by our \nDemocratic colleagues which I would describe as political cover \namendments. They are hearing the same thing we are from their small \nbusinesses, from agricultural groups, and from consumers across this \ncountry about what these regulations would do and how they would \nadversely impact electricity and fuel costs in this country. So they \nare trying to give themselves some cover to be able to vote for \nsomething.\n  I wish to point out that all these other amendments being offered by \nour Democratic colleagues as alternatives to the Inhofe-McConnell \namendment don't get the job done. We talked a little bit and we heard a \nlittle bit earlier today about the Rockefeller amendment, which has the \n2-year delay in it. But, again, there is a very limited scope to that \namendment. The temporary nature of the amendment is going to provide \nvery little relief for businesses and consumers across this country. If \nit is enacted, permits for new projects and the jobs associated with \nthose projects could be stalled until after the 2-year period. There is \nno assurance that any of these permits would be issued during this 2-\nyear period when this amendment would be in effect.\n  The Rockefeller amendment would not stop or delay other EPA methods \nfor increasing energy prices, such as the national ambient air quality \nstandard for CO2. The Rockefeller amendment does not prevent \nclimate change nuisance suits sponsored by environmental activist \ngroups hostile to energy development.\n  I can say the same thing essentially about some of the other \nproposals out there. The Stabenow amendment also has a 2-year delay, \nbut it allows EPA to continue moving forward with rulemaking. It just \nwouldn't allow them to finalize those rules until the end of the 2-year \nperiod. If the amendment is enacted, permits for new projects and the \njobs associated with those projects could again be stalled until the \nend of that 2-year period.\n  There are a number of flaws in all these amendments, none of which \nare designed to do the job. If we are serious about doing something to \naddress what the consumer groups, the farm organizations, and the \nbusiness organizations are asking us to do; that is, to prevent the EPA \nfrom moving forward with something they don't have the statutory \nauthority to do and should be reserved for the Congress, but they are \ngoing to move forward with it anyway--if we are serious about \naddressing that issue, the only alternative is to support the Inhofe-\nMcConnell amendment. It is that simple. It is that straightforward. All \nthese political cover amendments that are being offered by our \nDemocratic colleagues are simply that. They are cover amendments and \nthey don't get at the heart of the issue.\n  I would again go back to where I started; that is, to say we ought \nto, in this country, be seriously debating policies that will move us \naway from the dangerous dependence we have on foreign energy. As I said \nearlier, every policy coming out of Washington, in my view, is designed \nto make it more difficult to develop the very energy sources that will \ncreate a domestic energy supply in this country that would release us \nfrom this grip that foreign countries have on us with regard to energy.\n  I hope the Inhofe-McConnell amendment will pass today and will have \nbipartisan support. It has already been talked about that perhaps none \nof these will reach the 60-vote threshold. What I would say to my \ncolleagues is, again, if we are serious about trying to solve this \nissue, if we are serious about trying to make sure electricity and fuel \ncosts don't go up dramatically for our constituents, then this is the \namendment we need to be for. The other amendments don't get at the \nissue. They are political cover amendments.\n  I think it is pretty straightforward when we look at the number of \ngroups that have come out opposed to those amendments and in favor of \nthe Inhofe-McConnell amendment. I will just mention briefly, again, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce and other small \nbusiness organizations that have come out in support of the Inhofe-\nMcConnell amendment and opposed to the amendments offered by our \ncolleagues.\n  I wish to read a quote from one of those letters:\n\n       Congress, not the EPA, should be guiding America's energy \n     policy. Without action by lawmakers, EPA's regulations will \n     make it difficult to attract new manufacturing capacity and \n     jobs in the United States, let alone double U.S. exports in 5 \n     years, which is what our goal has been, as President Obama \n     has pledged.\n\n  This letter is signed by a number of organizations, including the \nNational Association of Manufacturers, the National Association of \nWholesaler Distributors, the National Association of Independent \nBusiness, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. As I said before, I have \nother letters from major farm organizations, including the American \nFarm Bureau, in support of the Inhofe-McConnell amendment and opposed \nto the other political cover amendments that are being offered by our \nDemocratic colleagues.\n  Let's get this done right. Let's send a message to the EPA and to the \nadministration that this is the job for the Congress to deal with. This \nis something the people's representatives should be dealing with, not \nunelected bureaucrats and Federal agencies that clearly have an agenda \nbut an agenda that is completely contrary to capital formation, to \ncompetitiveness, to job creation, and to economic growth. That is what \nthis Congress should be focused on, and that is why a vote in support \nof the Inhofe-McConnell amendment is so important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of rhetoric on the \nfloor of the Chamber today defending why air pollution is just fine, \nexplaining why dismantling air pollution regulations is really in the \ninterest of our economy and our families. Indeed, my colleague from \nSouth Dakota has listed a little shop of horrors--that the status quo \ncreates economic uncertainty, that the air pollution regulations \nincrease the risk rate of capital, that they destroy jobs, that they \neven hurt the elderly, that they are an abuse of power, unauthorized by \nCongress. I am wondering what else is left on the list of reasons to \ndefend the dismantling of air pollution regulations that protect the \nAmerican people, that are popular in the eyes of American citizens \nbecause they want to live in a world where they can enjoy breathing the \nair throughout our Nation.\n  Let's start by recognizing that the truth about the McConnell \namendment is that it increases our dependence on foreign oil. We have \nheard something about it driving up the cost of oil. Is that right? \nWell, no, it is not. Repealing the endangerment finding and taking away \nEPA's part of the regulation of mileage standards is estimated to \nincrease our consumption of oil by 455 million barrels.\n\n[[Page S2168]]\n\n  Gas prices are about $3.50 a gallon right now. So the McConnell-\nInhofe amendment represents a $68 billion expenditure on additional \noil. It means importing $68 billion more of oil. It means exporting $68 \nbillion in additional American dollars overseas to strengthen the \neconomies in the Middle East, Nigeria, or Venezuela. That energy tax--\nthe McConnell-Inhofe tax--is one that goes out of our country and hurts \nus in the worst way. It goes directly to oil companies--out of the \npockets of working families, to some of the most profitable \ncorporations in the history of human civilization. Gasoline prices are \nset by the law of supply and demand. If you increase demand for oil, \nyou also drive up the price. So, if anything, the McConnell-Inhofe \namendment doesn't decrease the cost of gasoline; it increases the cost \nof gasoline.\n  Politifact.com took on this issue because Members of Congress backing \nthis amendment were arguing that it keeps gas prices from increasing. \nPolitifact.com--that independent evaluator of claims made on the floor \nof the Senate, House, and other places--ranks that claim as false.\n  I can tell you that it is in our interest as a nation to decrease our \ndependence on oil, not to increase it. We need to decrease that \ndependence because it is important for our national security. We need \nto decrease that dependence because millions of dollars that are sent \noverseas often end up in the hands of those who don't share our \nnational interests. We need to decrease our dependence on foreign oil \nbecause when those dollars leave our economy, they leave our family's \nfinances. They don't end up in the retail stores or circulate here in \nAmerica. Indeed, our purchase of foreign oil accounts for about 50 \npercent of our foreign trade shortfall.\n  At a time when both parties should be working together to put \nAmerica's interests first on energy, the McConnell-Inhofe amendment \nincreases our addiction to oil--foreign oil--and creates a supply \nimpulse that raises the price of oil. Isn't that context completely \nmisguided?\n  Perhaps the real issue is public health. This McConnell attack on the \nClean Air Act asks Congress to vote in lockstep against the scientific \njudgment of EPA's scientists and to tell the agency charged with \nprotecting the public health and the health of our children to ignore \ndangerous carbon pollution.\n  In 2010 alone, the Clean Air Act prevented 1.7 million asthma \nattacks, 130,000 heart attacks, and 86,000 emergency room visits \nbecause clean air isn't just pleasant, it is, in fact, healthy. It is \ngreat for the American quality of life to be healthy. You know, that is \namazing progress that has been made over the last 20 years under the \nbipartisan Clean Air Act of 1990.\n  Instead, this amendment would yield to those short-term impulses that \nhave come up on all sorts of aspects of the Clean Air Act. Each time \nthe agency has moved to say that this is a concern, there are those who \nsay: No, no, in the short-term, that might cost me to adjust and we \nmight have to do things slightly differently. Ten years later, \neverybody says: You know, it is good that we thought about mercury in \nthe air, it is good that we took on lead in the air, and so on and so \nforth. Taking a longer term view, we need to stay together and resist \nthese short-term impulses to take and dismantle the Clean Air Act.\n  The American Lung Association has specifically said the McConnell \namendment is ``a reckless and irresponsible attempt to once again put \nspecial interests ahead of public health. The American Lung \nAssociation, the American Public Health Association, and the Asthma and \nAllergy Foundation of America have urged that we resist the temptation \nto dismantle the Clean Air Act, which the McConnell-Inhofe amendment \ndoes. There is a very simple reason for that: Each of these amendments \nwould have EPA put aside the practice of using science to set \ncommonsense standards to protect public health. Instead, these \namendments would have the science world put their head in the sand \nabout these problems.\n  Indeed, I am not just concerned about the McConnell amendment; I am \nconcerned about all of the amendments we are considering today that are \ndesigned to deflect, delay, and dismantle the protection of clean air. \nThe Baucus amendment would take away EPA's ability to use the best \nscience to continue to modify and tailor the standards they are setting \nfor carbon pollution and their ability to make sure major polluters are \nall covered. The Stabenow and Rockefeller amendments would put a 2-year \ndelay on pollution standards. It is tempting to think that a 2-year \ndelay might be an acceptable middle ground, but a 2-year delay in \nprotecting public health is 2 years too long.\n  Let me be very clear about this debate. The McConnell amendment and \nother associated amendments we will consider are wrong because we \nshould not increase our reliance for energy on the most unstable \nregions of the world. We should not ship American dollars overseas for \nenergy. We should not tolerate more pollution in our air and water. We \nshould not decrease our ability to build on America's foundation of \ningenuity and its inventiveness and respond to air pollution challenges \nand make those environmental decisions in clear partnership with a \nstronger economy.\n  I think that all of our constituents across this country, as they \nthink, as parents, about the future of their children, know clean air \nis the right course. But our children probably understand better than \nwe do another key aspect of this, because this conversation today is \nlargely about carbon pollution.\n  We need to wrestle with the fact that carbon pollution has a very \nsubstantial impact on the temperature across this planet. Before the \nIndustrial Revolution, we had a carbon dioxide level of about 270 parts \nper million. The basic scientific consensus is that the level of carbon \ndioxide in the atmosphere needs to be kept somewhere below 350 parts \nper million. I would be pleased to report to you today that before we \nget to that point of 350, we are going to be able to make the \nadjustments necessary so that we don't end up in a situation where we \nare creating long-term adverse consequences for our planet. Indeed, we \ncrossed that 350 boundary long ago. We are at 390 now, headed for 400. \nTen to 15 years ago, it was going up one part per million per year; now \nit is going up two parts per million. So the curve is getting steeper, \nthe pace is getting steeper. We are seeing this reverberating from \ncoral reefs, to Arctic tundra; we are seeing it in ice sheets, in \nglaciers; and we are seeing it in insect populations that are thriving \nand decimating the forests of the Northwest, where I come from, that \nweren't there a few years ago. We are seeing it in all kinds of \npatterns across this planet.\n  When I visit university campuses, as students talk about the issues \nnearest to their hearts, the top issue is that we must address this \nthreat to our planet. This conversation goes to the heart of it. My \ngeneration isn't as up to speed as our college students are about this, \nbut the planet cannot wait for them to graduate, pursue their careers, \nrun for office, and arrive here on the floor of the Senate. So it is \nour responsibility as Americans who are concerned about our dependence \non energy, as Americans who are concerned about keeping our dollars in \nour economy and creating jobs, and as Americans who are concerned about \nthe sustainability of our practices, to say no to McConnell-Inhofe and \nno to the other amendments being brought forward to delay or destroy or \ndismantle the Clean Air Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 281\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we are going to have a series of stacked \nvotes at 4 o'clock. I want to spend a few minutes on three or four \namendments and clarify some of the things I have heard rumbling.\n  One is that we have an amendment that will, in fact, take away \nunemployment insurance for millionaires. Mr. President, 2,840 \nhouseholds who reported an income of greater than $1 million or more on \ntax returns were paid $18.6 million in unemployment insurance benefits \nin 2008. That number is higher in 2009. We don't have the final numbers \nyet. This included over 800 earning over $2 million and 17 with excess \nincome of $10 million collecting unemployment benefits. We have an \namendment that will prohibit that.\n  There has been some concern to say that the costs associated with \nthat, the way it was scored by CBO, would neutralize it; the savings \nversus the cost\n\n[[Page S2169]]\n\nto eliminate that would be even. Even if that is true--and we have done \na calculation, and we think it costs about $900,000 a year to have \npeople applying for unemployment sign a statement that their income is \nnot above $1 million. But even if it costs the same as what we are \nspending, we should not be giving unemployment benefits to people who \nare earning $1 million a year. It is foolish, and it exacerbates the \ntendency of enriching those who are already there versus what \nunemployment insurance is for--so those who are truly dependent on it \ncan survive. I wanted to clarify that point.\n  Regarding the second amendment, in March the GAO, in response to an \namendment I put on the last debt limit, issued a report listing what \nthey think are billions of dollars in savings in terms of duplication. \nI would be remiss to not say that our President embraced that. In his \nState of the Union speech, one of the goals of his administration is to \neliminate duplication and consolidate.\n  So we have two amendments that are going to be on the Senate floor. \nOne is mine and one is the amendment of the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Inouye. They are both designed to \nsave us $5 billion, but there are two big differences between those \namendments.\n  My amendment tells OMB to have the study, find the $5 billion, report \nto us what they can do themselves and what they need us to do to help \nthem. Senator Inouye's amendment waits 6 months from the time we pass \nthe bill--5 months for the study to come back, and then for us to do \nit, which means we won't have any savings at all until we are well into \nfiscal year 2013. Every year we waste $5 billion on something we \nshouldn't is a year we are borrowing $2 billion of it just to pay the \nbill.\n  So I understand it is a cover vote, but what it means is we will \nnever get the $5 billion in savings, whereas my amendment will get us \n$5 billion worth of savings this year. The way we get rid of a $1.6 \ntrillion deficit is $1 billion or $2 billion or $5 billion at a time.\n  Everybody recognizes the duplication. What we are asking the \nadministration to do is take the very low-hanging fruit they can \nrecognize right now, do the rescission, recommend to us, and then we \nact on it, rather than waiting 2\\1/2\\ years to get that done.\n  So it is very straightforward. We know there is significant \nduplication in the Federal Government. Let me just give some of the \nfindings of the GAO report. Remember, this isn't Tom Coburn's report; \nthis is a GAO report, and they only looked at one-third of the Federal \nGovernment--the first third. They have two more reports to come to us, \nwith the second and third, and then yearly. We will get this report \nyearly on the problems of duplication in the Federal Government.\n  We have 47 job-training programs across 9 different agencies that we \nspend $18 billion on, and not one of them has a metric on it to see if \nit is effective. We are doing a study now in the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations on what were the reports of the people who have been \nthrough this as to where it is helpful and where it is not because in \nour legislation, where we pass these job-training programs, we didn't \nask for metrics to see if they were effective. So this is an area where \nwe can consolidate one or two. Only three of those have charges that \nare totally separate from the others. The rest of them overlap one \nanother.\n  There are five departments, eight agencies, and over two dozen \nPresidential nominees overseeing bioterrorism. We know we can \nconsolidate that. We will actually be much better when we do in terms \nof our efficiency and communication between agencies. That is $6.48 \nbillion a year.\n  We have 20 agencies, 56 programs dedicated to financial literacy, and \nwe don't even know what they cost. The GAO couldn't determine what they \ncost. So 56 different programs on financial literacy, and we are \nteaching people? We have a $1.6 trillion deficit, and we are teaching \nAmericans financial literacy? If we should teach them that, which is \nnot a bad goal, why do we need 56 programs to do that?\n  We have 80 economic development programs across 4 different agencies. \nWe are spending $6.5 billion. Just consolidating administrative costs \nacross those agencies could save $100 million, $200 million, $300 \nmillion.\n  We have 15 agencies for more than 30 food-related laws. Even the \nPresident mentioned salmon. If they are in saltwater, they have one \nagency; if they are in fresh water, they have another agency. That is \nfoolish. Why duplicate the work of one agency with another?\n  We have 18 nutrition programs--they are very important to our kids \nand those who are dependent on them--at $62.5 billion. Do we need 18 \nprograms to do that? Could we do it with 10, 8, 2, 3? The questions \nhaven't been asked, but let's ask the OMB to look at the low-hanging \nfruit and to take the $5 billion out and work with Congress to get it \ndone in the next appropriations cycle.\n  There are 20 homeless programs across 7 agencies at $2.9 billion; 82 \nteacher quality programs, 16 agencies and $4 billion. Why would we have \n82 teacher training programs? It just shows the magnitude of the \nproblem that we have in terms of getting our budget under control, not \nmanaging effectively, and not doing the oversight we should.\n  We have 52 programs for entrepreneurial efforts. I don't have any \nproblem with that, but why do we need 52? We have 35 programs to \noversee infrastructure. Overseeing infrastructure is important, but why \ndo we need that many programs? There are 28 programs to oversee new \nmarkets--28 different programs funded by the Federal Government across \n6 different agencies to oversee new markets. We could consolidate a lot \nof that.\n  So the President has said he wants to do this. We ought to give him \nthe tools that will help him do it more quickly because every day we \nwait it costs us more money.\n  Finally, we will have a vote ultimately on the ethanol blenders' \ncredit. I have been remiss not to give the No. 1 leader on that--who \nhas a bill of her own--Senator Feinstein, credit because she has led on \nthis for a long time. Her bill is slightly different than the one we \nare going to offer, but she has led on that issue. She understands the \nimportance of the environmental impact of burning ethanol, when we are \nactually burning more fuel and putting out more CO2 than we \nwould with pure gasoline because of the inefficiency of ethanol.\n  So I wanted to recognize her, and when we come to the vote on the \nblenders' credit I will ask her to speak on that, if she would.\n  Finally, I would say in regards to that issue, for people who don't \nunderstand, we are going to spend $5 billion this year paying the major \noil companies 45 cents a gallon to blend ethanol into gasoline. There \nis a Federal law that requires a mandate. It is called the renewable \nfuels mandate. Last year it was 12.5 billion gallons; this year it is \n13.2. It is over 22 billion gallons 5 years from now that have to be \nblended.\n  We have a letter from the people who receive this tax credit--who are \ngoing to receive this $5 billion--who say they do not want the $5 \nbillion; they do not need the $5 billion. Yet we are going to have some \nresistance around here of not stopping a payment to those who receive \nit, and who don't want it, for something that is already mandated by \nlaw. They have put it in a letter saying they do not want it. It is \nalready in the record.\n  Now, why would we continue to spend $5 billion of our kids' money on \nsomething they do not want, that isn't going to change the outcome, and \nthat we will have to borrow 40 percent of to make the payment? It is \nbeyond me that we would do that, and so it is my hope we will be \nsuccessful in overturning that.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Before the Senator from Oklahoma leaves the \nfloor, I wanted to join him in supporting the commonsense amendment he \njust outlined. The Coburn-Udall amendment would fix what I think most \nAmericans, if not every single\n\n[[Page S2170]]\n\nAmerican, would be shocked to discover; that is, millionaires and \nbillionaires have been drawing unemployment benefits.\n  Now, unemployment insurance is a critical temporary safety net for \nAmericans who need help to get by when they fall on tough times, but \nproviding unemployment insurance for millionaires, much less \nbillionaires, who do not need it for their basic necessities is \nfiscally irresponsible, to put it mildly. Frankly, it doesn't make much \nsense.\n  I think Senator Coburn put it best when he said it is foolish. We all \nrecall that for months last year we struggled to find ways to put \nunemployment benefits in the hands of Americans who were really \nstruggling in the face of this tough economic downturn. It was \ncontroversial and we worked hard on that in the Senate. It was drawn \nout because unemployment benefits are expensive, but I supported \nextending those benefits for out-of-work Americans because they help. \nWe found a way, ultimately, to pay for them. But little did we know, in \ntaking care of these good Americans, it was made even harder because \nliterally--and this number astonishes me--thousands of millionaires and \nbillionaires were abusing the system to draw extra payments for \nthemselves. So it increased the price tag for all the rest.\n  In the end, we are talking about values. We are talking about hard \nwork and playing by the rules. That is how most Americans operate. But \nthere are a few folks always looking to game the system, and I can't \nbelieve that some of the most well-off among us have been asking for a \ngovernment paycheck while out-of-work Americans, day in and day out, \nlook for jobs. They want to provide for themselves, and they want to do \nit in an honest way. They don't want to draw those unemployment \nbenefits. That is a decision and action of last resort.\n  We have had 13 straight months of private sector growth. We have \nadded almost 2 million jobs. But our economy is still fragile, and too \nmany Coloradans and too many Americans are looking for work. Families \nin my State, and I know in the neighboring State of Oklahoma, are \nworking to balance their budgets and find a way to set aside money for \ncollege, taking care of their kids. Asking them to pay for unemployment \ninsurance for millionaires is unbelievable.\n  So I am truly honored to work with my colleague from Oklahoma. This \nwould save $100 million. As the Senator said, every day we wait, we \nwaste money. Every day we don't take an opportunity to save money, we \nare doing a disservice to the taxpayers.\n  So I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. It is a smart \nchange, and it avoids tarnishing an otherwise worthy and critical way \nto temporarily assist Americans who have fallen on tough times.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator for his cosponsorship and support on \nthis amendment. I haven't had a chance to share this with the Senator--\nbecause I just received it--but I have a breakdown from the IRS of the \n22 States that don't have any millionaires because they screen for it. \nActually, it is not millionaires, it is those earning more than $1 \nmillion a year. In other words, these are people who actually have \nincomes of greater than $1 million a year in terms of adjusted gross \nincome.\n  There are probably many more who have less than that, but we are \nsaying here is a cutoff. It is a legitimate cutoff. So there are 22 \nStates that don't allow this right now in their process.\n  I was wrong in my statement on the $600,000 or $800,000. The \ncalculation of the cost of putting this in is $200,000 a year. So for a \nvery minimal cost, we will save $20 million a year, at minimum. We are \nalso going to create a system that will do what it is designed to do--\nnot to help those who are already very comfortable but to help those \nstruggling to make ends meet and find themselves out of a job.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe report of unemployment compensation and adjusted gross income of $1 \nmillion or more.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n FILERS REPORTING UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION AND ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME OF\n                               $1M OR

Mr. President, the Senator makes important \npoints, and it is a small investment, if you will, the $200,000, in \nsaving the taxpayers significant amounts of money. As the Senator \npoints out, the important outcome is that the integrity of the \nunemployment insurance system is maintained.\n  I also would note, as the Senator from Oklahoma did, the point that \nit is $1 million in income or more, not whether an individual has \nassets or something in that amount--in other words, a rancher who is \nfortunate enough to have lands valued at significant enough levels but \nwho is illiquid and may be struggling to make ends meet. This applies \nto people, as the Senator points out, who have incomes of over $1 \nmillion annually. That makes sense.\n  This is an important amendment. I urge all our colleagues to support \nit. We have a chance to vote for it later today.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that I was speaking on Senator \nCoburn's time, and I ask unanimous consent that the agreement reflect \nsuch allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this afternoon, this Chamber is going \nto face a clear question: What matters more, children's health or \npolluters' profits? We will be voting on amendments that would cripple \nthe government's ability to enforce the Clean Air Act.\n  This is a landmark law that protects our children from toxic \nchemicals in the air and illnesses such as asthma and lung cancer. In \n2010, the Clean Air Act prevented 1.7 million cases of childhood asthma \nand more than 160,000 premature deaths. The numbers are big, but \nnumbers do not mean much unless it is your child. If it is your child, \nthere is no number that is too large to take care of that child's \nhealth.\n\n[[Page S2171]]\n\n  If you want to know the real value of clean air to American families, \ntalk to parents who live in fear of their child's next asthma attack. \nIt is a fear my family knows very well. I have a grandson who is a \nterrific athlete, who is very energetic. He suffers from asthma. He is \nan athletic child. Every time he goes to play soccer, my daughter--his \nmother--will check first to see where the nearest emergency room is. \nShe knows very well that if he starts wheezing, she has to get him to a \nclinic in a hurry. No parent should have to worry about letting their \nchildren play outside.\n  The fact is, the Clean Air Act has improved life for millions of \nyoung people. The Supreme Court and scientists agree that the Clean Air \nAct is a tool we must use to stop dangerous pollution.\n  This picture demonstrates so clearly what it is like with smog in the \nair, and it permits us to imagine what it looks like inside a child's \nlung. This picture shows what toxic skies look like. It is an ugly \nscene, but it is much uglier when it is inside the child's lungs or a \nchild's body or anybody who is sensitive to polluted air. That is the \npicture coming out of the smokestacks, and the picture turns into \nreality when it is in the lungs or the body of an individual.\n  Allowing companies to reduce pollution, they say, would cost too much \nfor polluters. Too bad. What is a life worth? What does it mean to \nsomeone who is sensitive to polluted air not to be able to get out or \nstop coughing or stop wheezing?\n  Allowing companies to continue polluting does not eliminate the \ncosts. It simply shifts the costs to our families, our children, and \nall of us who breathe that air.\n  The American Lung Association and five other health groups sent a \nletter opposing all of these amendments. They say:\n\n       The Clean Air Act protects public health and reduces health \n     care costs for all by preventing thousands of adverse health \n     outcomes, including: cancer, asthma attacks, heart attacks, \n     strokes, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and \n     premature deaths.\n\n  I am aware of the threat asthma can be. I had a sister who was a \nvictim of asthma. If our families traveled together, she would have a \nlittle respirator that could be plugged into the cigarette lighter hole \nand enable her to breathe more comfortably. One day she was at a school \nboard meeting in Rye, NY, where she was a member of the school board. \nShe felt an attack coming on. Her instinct was to try to run to her car \nso she could plug in the machine to the lighter hole. She collapsed in \nthe parking lot, and she died 3 days later. We saw it upfront and \npersonal. It was a terrible family tragedy. She had four children at \nthe time.\n  When we hear talk about how threatening it is to control pollution, \nwe say, no, the threat is to family health and to our well-being. That \nis what we are about in families with young people across this country \nand across the world.\n  It does not matter what the cost is. There is not a family in the \nworld that would not dispose of all of their assets to protect and \ncontinue the life of a child.\n  History shows that the cost of cleaner air is very low compared to \nits enormous benefits. Thanks to the Clean Air Act, fewer parents miss \nwork to take care of children suffering from asthma. More families \navoid the crushing health care costs associated with a heart attack or \nstroke. People live longer, more comfortably, and have more productive \nlives. Simply put, weakening the Clean Air Act puts the profits of \npolluters ahead of the health of our children.\n  To see what the United States would look like without the Clean Air \nAct, we only need to look at China. On a visit there, I was scolded by \nthe minister of environment that the United States was using too much \nof the world's oil, creating difficulties in the air. When I was in the \nminister's office, I invited him to join me at the window 23 stories up \nin the air. We looked outside and we could not see the sidewalk. That \nis how thick the polluted air was. The air in China is so polluted that \nmany people wear masks when they walk outside. We do not want to be \ndoing that in America.\n  This poison must not be the future. I do not want it for my \ngrandchildren, and I do not want it for anybody else's children or \ngrandchildren.\n  In our Senate, in our Congress, our goal must be to take care of our \nobligations to protect our families. And the strongest obligation \nanyone has, anybody we know who has children does not want to endanger \ntheir health. I ask all of my colleagues: Stand up. Vote down these \ndangerous efforts to destroy the Clean Air Act. It belongs as part of \nour environment. It protects our children, it protects the environment, \nand we must not let this opportunity be misunderstood and say: We have \nto vote no to give polluters a preference before our children.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 183\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak against the \nradical McConnell-Inhofe amendment and in opposition to the efforts to \noverturn the Supreme Court. We should not be gutting the Clean Air Act \nand public health and environmental protections that are important to \nevery American.\n  These anti-environmental, anti-public health, anti-economic riders, I \nbelieve, do not belong on a small business bill. When we boil it down, \nwhat is at stake is pretty straightforward. It is about the common good \nversus the special interests. The facts speak for themselves. According \nto some comprehensive reports, the Clean Air Act will save our economy \n$2 trillion through the year 2020. And even more importantly, the Clean \nAir Act will cumulatively save 4.2 million lives by 2020.\n  Those are striking numbers, and that is why it is so important that \nwe protect the Clean Air Act and turn down these radical amendments \nthat would effectively overturn it.\n  Congress has stopped other radical attempts to overturn laws that are \nabout protecting our environment and protecting the safety of American \npeople. I remember the debate on MTBE, in 2003, on the Senate floor. \nMTBE was a highly toxic fuel additive, and very small amounts of it \ncould severely contaminate water supplies. Yet MTBE manufacturers who \nwere on the hook for billions of dollars of cleanup wanted a free pass. \nThey wanted immunity. They came to the Senate hoping to get that. Yet a \nbipartisan group of Senators stood up to that proposal, and the \nproposal to let MTBE manufacturers off the hook was turned down.\n  There have been other attempts to overturn the Clean Water Act, the \nEndangered Species Act, the Superfund Cleanup Act. Sometimes they get \nonly as far as draft bills or a committee hearing. Sometimes we have \nvotes on them. But these issues all have one thing in common--it is \nabout the greater good versus special interests. Time and time again, \nCongress has wisely come down on the correct side of the issue and has \nrejected these proposals by special interests.\n  The environmental protections that we have continue in force today \nbecause we have consistently stood up to fight for them. Passing an \nanti-EPA amendment would hurt our economy. That certainly is the case \nwith the McConnell-Inhofe amendment. It would overturn hard-won gains \nfrom the 2007 Energy bill that put CAFE standards in place to improve \nfuel economy standards for American consumers. These standards were \npassed with bipartisan support and save consumers as much as $3,000 \nover the life of a car through higher fuel efficiency. The proposed \nMcConnell-Inhofe legislation seeks to overturn these advancements.\n  It is these fuel economy standards, which passed with bipartisan \nsupport in 2007, that are helping us to wean ourselves from dependence \non foreign oil--not more domestic drilling. We could drill in every \npristine, untouched corner of the United States--and sometimes it seems \nlike the backers of those interests would like us to do just that--but \nin response to these calls, I would suggest you look at a recent letter \nSenator Bingaman and I received from the Energy Information \nAdministration.\n\n[[Page S2172]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Department of Energy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Mar. 25, 2011.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy, Committee on Energy and \n         Natural Resources, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Cantwell: This is in response to your letter \n     of March 15, 2011, which seeks a better understanding of some \n     of the long term impacts of the Energy Independence and \n     Security Act of 2007 (EISA).\n       As noted in your letter, the long-term energy outlook which \n     the Energy Information Administration (EIA) released just \n     before EISA was signed into law (Annual Energy Outlook 2008 \n     Early Release) projected a significant increase in U.S. \n     dependence on imported petroleum through 2030. This finding \n     is reversed in EIA's latest Annual Energy Outlook (AEO2011 \n     Early Release), which projects a decline in U.S. dependence \n     on imported petroleum over a forecast horizon that extends \n     through 2035. Furthermore, over the 2008 to 2030 period, the \n     cumulative reduction in net petroleum imports between the two \n     sets of projections is about 26 billion barrels.\n       The policies enacted in EISA are responsible for much of \n     the change in projected U.S. oil use. In particular, EISA \n     mandated significant strengthening of both the corporate \n     average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for cars and light \n     trucks and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) that was first \n     enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. However, other \n     changes that have occurred since the AEO2008 Early Release \n     was issued, including the outlook for oil prices and economic \n     growth, have also influenced the more recent projections \n     presented in the AEO2011 Early Release.\n       Following enactment of EISA, EIA conducted sensitivity \n     analyses starting from the AEO2008 Reference case to estimate \n     the effect of its key provisions. From these calculations, it \n     is clear that EISA alone is responsible for a major reduction \n     in projected oil consumption, which in turn reduces oil \n     imports on an almost 1-for-1 basis. By 2030, the fuel economy \n     standards provisions in EISA were estimated to reduce light-\n     duty vehicle gasoline-equivalent fuel consumption by between \n     2.1 and 2.2 million barrels per day relative to a scenario \n     where vehicle efficiency did not improve above the floor set \n     by standards in effect at the time of enactment. Relative to \n     a baseline that included projected market-driven improvements \n     in fuel economy, the savings in fuel consumption due to the \n     fuel economy provisions were still estimated at 1.2 to 1.4 \n     million barrels per day. Furthermore, the RFS provisions of \n     EISA were estimated to further reduce petroleum consumption \n     by 0.3 to 0.6 million barrels per day in 2030.\n       The AEO2011 Early Release, which reflects current laws and \n     regulations, does not include a further increase in fuel \n     economy standards for model years 2017 through 2025 that is \n     now under consideration in the regulatory process. The \n     forthcoming release of the full AEO2011 will include \n     alternative scenarios of increased light-duty vehicle fuel \n     efficiency to illustrate how further actions by policymakers \n     in this area could affect projected U.S. oil use and imports \n     over the next 25 years.\n       Finally, while there are a variety of ways to place the \n     major change in projected net petroleum imports resulting \n     from EISA into perspective, comparisons to the level of U.S. \n     proven crude oil reserves can be clarified by explicitly \n     recognizing that reserves are only a subset of available \n     domestic resources. As discussed in my recent testimony \n     before the House Committee on Natural Resources, additions to \n     crude oil reserves replaced over 93 percent of cumulative \n     U.S. crude oil production of 19.6 billion barrels from 2000 \n     through 2009. For this reason, total U.S. crude oil reserves \n     declined only modestly over that decade, decreasing from 22.0 \n     billion barrels at the start of 2000 to 20.7 billion barrels \n     at the start of 2010.\n       I hope that this information is responsive to your inquiry. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further \n     questions or concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Richard G. Newell,\n\n                                 Administrator, Energy Information\n                                                   Administration.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. In 2007, the Energy Information Administration was \npredicting that our foreign dependency was going to continue to \nincrease in the coming decades. I should note that after the 2005 \nEnergy bill, I heard some of my colleagues on the other side say that \nthat EIA forecast was the great predictor and that it was going to help \nus reduce our dependence on foreign oil. But the truth is, the \nsubsequent EIA analysis made after we passed the 2007 Energy bill says \njust two policies in that landmark bill--the increase in CAFE standards \nand the renewable fuel standards--are responsible for a downward \nrevision of projected U.S. dependence on foreign oil.\n  So the things that have made us less dependent on foreign oil are the \nvery things people are trying to gut from important legislation that is \nalready on the books. It is not the case that additional drilling, \ndrilling, drilling and saying to the EPA: ``Ignore the Supreme Court on \nthe Clean Air Act,'' is going to help us. Reducing demand is going to \nreduce prices at the pump. Look at the example of the U.K., which \nproduces almost all of its own oil from the North Sea. They still got \nhammered in 2008 when oil prices peaked at $147 a barrel because there \nis a world market price for oil. So to refute the notion that we should \nskirt our environmental responsibilities and drill, drill, drill to \nprotect ourselves from high oil prices, we need to look no further than \nthe U.K. example.\n  I don't understand why the minority leader wants us to increase our \nNation's reliance on foreign oil. I think we should be getting off \nforeign oil and not allowing polluters to addict another generation to \nthat product. I think we should be getting off foreign oil, rather than \nhave future U.S. generations compete with the Chinese for every last \nremaining supply of ever more expensive oil.\n  I agree it would be better if Congress acted to address our need to \ndiversify our Nation's energy sources. I am anxious to work with my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to develop legislation that \nwould use the power of the free market to do that and protect consumers \nat the same time. I am certain there is a bipartisan solution we can \nall agree to. But we can do this and solve our carbon pollution problem \nby working together, not by burying our heads in the sand and saying we \ncan ignore the Supreme Court's edict to enforce the Clean Air Act.\n  There is a way to reduce carbon pollution and transition to a 21st \ncentury economy and we can and should work together to achieve these \ngoals. It does not have to be about picking winners and losers, and we \ncan protect consumers in the process. I want to work with my colleagues \non a framework that embodies these principles. But, until then, I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against these amendments that will undermine our \nClean Air Act; that will actually increase our dependence on foreign \noil, force consumers to buy more gasoline, and make our air dirtier.\n  We can do better and I hope we will.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Boxer, the chair \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, be the next Democratic \nspeaker and that she have up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \nremarks of Senator Boxer, who I understand wants to speak for 10 \nminutes, I be recognized for about 10 minutes. That will be about the \ntimeframe we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Hutchison are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wanted to speak on the McConnell \namendment that Senator Inhofe has worked so hard to bring up, and also \nLisa Murkowski from Alaska. We all know what is happening to gasoline \nprices in the United States right now. They have gone up now and the \naverage is about $3.60 a gallon. What we are looking at are more \nincreases in those gasoline prices if the EPA is allowed to take an \nauthority it does not have and regulate greenhouse gasses.\n\n[[Page S2173]]\n\n  Some of the other amendments offered on this subject are well \nintentioned, but they do fall short of actually making a difference. \nThe amendment before us repeals EPA's effort. It is very simple and \nvery clean. Small businesses are struggling to survive, struggling to \nkeep workers, and trying to make it in very small margins in this \neconomic time.\n  Families are facing higher energy costs. We are all suffering. I have \na pickup truck which I love to drive. I filled it up a couple of \nweekends ago. It was about $60. That is a pickup truck. That is a basic \nform of transportation for many Americans. Farmers depend on affordable \nenergy prices. They must put gasoline in their trucks, diesel in their \nharvesters, use energy-intensive fertilizer.\n  Higher costs for farmers means higher costs for food. You are talking \nabout now an inflation we cannot afford in this kind of economic \nenvironment. During all of this, the EPA now wants to impose a new gas \ntax on America in the form of greenhouse gas regulation.\n  Last Congress I issued a report that documented how the Kerry-\nLieberman climate legislation would impose a $3.6 trillion gas tax on \nthe American people. Using the data from EPA and the Energy Information \nAdministration, we calculated that climate legislation would impose a \n$2 trillion gasoline tax, a $1.3 trillion diesel fuel tax, and a $330 \nbillion jet fuel tax.\n  According to the EPA and the senior Obama administration officials, \nregulations would be even worse than legislation. That was one of the \nmain arguments they used in support of climate legislation, that the \nregulations would be even worse than cap-and-trade legislation.\n  But that is exactly what we are getting with the EPA now trying to \nregulate what we could not pass in the legislature, for good reason. \nThe Baucus amendment could shield small businesses and farmers from EPA \npermit requirements, but it codifies the requirements for energy and \nfuel producers, meaning everyone in America will still pay higher \nenergy prices.\n  The Stabenow and Rockefeller amendment only delays the higher energy \ncosts and job losses for 2 years. That is not good enough. I hope my \ncolleagues will see that this is our time to tell the EPA we will \ndetermine what we want them to regulate. That is the responsibility of \nthe Congress. We are to make the laws, they are to implement them. They \nare not to reinvent them in their own model of what they have the \nauthority to do, and we have not given them the authority to regulate \ngreenhouse gases. The refineries say this added amount of regulation is \ngoing to cost so much that they will have to raise their prices in \ntheir factories, and that assuredly will raise the price of oil and \ngasoline through its use in our country.\n  This is an amendment. There is only one amendment of all the \namendments on this subject that will do the job. It is simple and \nclear. It would eliminate the EPA's ability to make regulations in an \narea that Congress has not authorized it to do. That is what we need to \ndo. Congress needs to take the reins and halt the overregulation that \nis hurting our small businesses and hurting our economic recovery.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the McConnell-Inhofe-\nMurkowski amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, we are in the midst of another rapid \nincrease in the price of oil and gas at the pump faced by our \nconstituents. Rather than address this issue in a positive manner, we \nare once again debating an amendment whose authors believe that they \nhave the expertise to determine that the EPA was wrong to conclude that \ngreenhouse gases are pollutants, despite the preponderance of \nscientific evidence.\n  The McConnell amendment disregards the advice of leading scientists, \ndoctors, and public health experts by not only overturning EPA's \nscientific endangerment finding but also telling EPA that it must \ncontinue to ignore what America's science experts are telling us about \nthe dangerous impacts of carbon pollution.\n  The Supreme Court concluded in 2007 that the Clean Air Act's \ndefinition of air pollutant includes greenhouse gas emissions, \nrejecting the Bush administration's refusal to determine whether that \npollution endangers Americans' health and welfare. The Senate should \nsimilarly reject this amendment, which would overturn that science-\nbased decision.\n  There are many far-reaching consequences of this amendment, but I \nwant to focus my attention on how it will disrupt the broadly supported \nand partnership-driven fuel efficiency standards for new cars and light \ntrucks, thereby forfeiting many hundreds of millions of barrels of oil \nsavings, including savings for the American consumer, and potentially \nre-opening the debate to contentious litigation.\n  This would be a major step backwards in our efforts to decrease the \ncost of fueling at the pump. The price of gas weighs heavily on the \nbudgets of American families, currently $3.56 per gallon in Rhode \nIsland and an increase of 27 percent over the same time last year. The \ncheapest gallon of gas is the one that you do not need to buy, which is \nwhy I have long championed improved fuel efficiency.\n  Last year's vehicle efficiency and emissions standards will save \nconsumers more than $3,000 in fuel costs over the lifetime of new \nvehicles. Increasing the standard to 60 mpg by 2025 could result in \n$7,000 in savings. Our competitors in China and Europe already have \nhigher efficiency standards. It is time that we create manufacturing \njobs here in America by producing cars that save consumers money at the \npump. I have been heartened to see our auto industry begin to do just \nthat, but we need to go further.\n  The McConnell amendment would accomplish the opposite by creating \nbusiness uncertainty for our existing standards and stopping the \ndevelopment of future efforts to save more oil and money.\n  This amendment is part of the ongoing concern over how we will reduce \ncarbon pollution, and there will always be the need to balance the \nneeds for business development and environmental protection. But it \ndoes not have to be an either or position. A healthy environment is \nimportant for a strong economy, and the 40-year track record of the \nClean Air Act has shown us that the two can work well in concert.\n  We need to define our energy future, one that ends our dependence on \nforeign oil and confronts the challenges of climate change. This \namendment accomplishes neither and I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there are various proposals before us that \nwould impact efforts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to \naddress greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate \nchange.\n  While I have concerns regarding EPA's regulatory efforts in this \nregard, Senator McConnell's amendment not only restricts EPA's \nregulatory work, but it would explicitly overturn an important science \nbased EPA finding that greenhouse gas emissions may endanger the public \nhealth and welfare of current and future generations. Further, the \nMcConnell amendment would repeal the mandatory reporting of emission \nlevels of greenhouse gases, which began in 2009. The results of that \nreporting will help inform important policy decisions regarding how to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Senator Rockefeller's amendment would establish a 2-year delay on any \nEPA action pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions from stationary \nsources, with the hope that Congress will act to reach a legislative \nsolution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide. I could \nsupport that because I prefer comprehensive climate legislation with \ntargets and timetables that are technologically achievable instead of a \nregulatory regime administered by the EPA to address greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  However, I cannot support the Rockefeller amendment because of its \nimpact on the regulation of vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. The \namendment would explicitly allow regulation of vehicle greenhouse gas \nemissions by EPA to go forward under the Clean Air Act, which leaves \nintact the authority for the EPA to grant a waiver to the State of \nCalifornia to regulate vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. The stated \ngoal of the Obama administration, one I strongly support and have \nfought for, is to have a single national standard for vehicle fuel \neconomy and greenhouse gas emissions, as is currently the case for \nmodel years 2012-2016. That\n\n[[Page S2174]]\n\ngoal is defeated, however, if states can individually regulate these \nemissions, because the result is a patchwork of overlapping and \nconflicting regulations.\n  Senator Stabenow's amendment has many provisions I support. For \ninstance, unlike the McConnell amendment, it would not nullify the EPA \nfinding based on science that greenhouse gas emissions may endanger \npublic health and the environment. It would also allow EPA to move \nforward with its reporting requirements, which will help inform policy \nmakers as to how to best reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Stabenow \namendment would also allow the EPA to move forward with its planning to \nreduce greenhouse gases from stationary sources. Emissions of \ngreenhouse gas emissions from agricultural sources would also be \nexcluded from EPA regulation related to global climate change.\n  However, the Stabenow amendment would also leave intact EPA's \nauthority under the Clean Air Act to issue vehicle greenhouse gas \nemissions standards and authority for EPA to grant a waiver to the \nState of California. I support the EPA and the Department of \nTransportation together developing a single national standard. If there \nis going to be a single national standard for 2017-2025, then logically \nthere must also be preemption of state authority in this area. I cannot \nsupport an amendment that addresses EPA authority but leaves in place \nits authority to grant a waiver that is so problematic for our \nmanufacturing sector.\n  I particularly regret that I cannot support the Stabenow amendment \nbecause it also includes an extension of the so-called section 48C \nadvanced energy manufacturing tax credit, which I support. This tax \ncredit--enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act--\nprovides an important incentive for energy manufacturers to continue to \ninvest in facilities in the U.S. I very much support extension of this \ntax credit and will work with my colleagues to try to extend it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presdient, I urge rejection of all of the amendments \noffered today that would gut the Environmental Protection Agency's \nability to enforce our Clean Air Act.\n  It has been proven time and time again that we can have both a clean \nenvironment and grow our economy. In fact without a clean environment, \nit is more difficult for us to grow the economy. Without the Clean Air \nAct we would be spending trillions of dollars more on health care costs \nand lost work days. Over its 40 years the Clean Air Act has been one of \nthe world's most successful environmental and health protection laws \nreducing exposure to pollutants such as lead, ozone, sulfur dioxide, \nsmog-forming gases, and mercury and other heavy metals and toxics.\n  Thanks to the Clean Air Act millions of lives have been saved by \npreventing premature deaths, heart attacks, cancer, asthma, and other \nlife-threatening illnesses. But even after 40 years of action, \npollution in many areas of the country still violates basic health \nstandards, putting tens of millions of Americans' lives at risk.\n  In Vermont, while we don't have any coal-fired powerplants, we are \nstill the victims of their pollution as it travels by wind across our \nborders into the Green Mountain State. Throughout the Nation, hundreds \nof thousands of Americans suffer every year from illnesses linked to \nemissions from powerplants, refineries and other large sources of air \npollution and greenhouse gases.\n  Yet there are some powerful special interests and some Members of \nthis body who would like to strip the EPA of its authorities to enforce \nthe Clean Air Act because they reject the notion that greenhouse gases \nare air pollutants and harmful to public health, or they believe that \nwe just cannot afford clean air. Methane, nitrous oxide, carbon \ndioxide, hydrofluorocarbons and other compounds are the ingredients of \na pollutant cocktail forced on many millions of Americans.\n  The Supreme Court has determined that the Clean Air Act is \n``unambiguous'' and that greenhouse gases, such as those I just \nmentioned, are ``without a doubt'' air pollutants under the Clean Air \nAct. As such, EPA is required to regulate these emissions since they \nendanger public health. The Supreme Court has given the EPA little \nchoice, and the science is clear they must act.\n  The McConnell amendment would have politics, not science, decide \nwhich pollutants are hazardous and which pollutants should be \nregulated. If politics had been allowed to trump the compelling \nscientific evidence, we may have never phased lead out of gasoline, or \nreduced ozone-depleting chemicals, or tackled acid rain. Over the years \npowerful special interests have sought to block EPA's actions on all of \nthese issues, arguing that the science was weak and the costs \nunjustified. Once again they are crying wolf and trotting out the same \ndiscredited arguments to fight greenhouse gas regulations today.\n  In enforcing the Clean Air Act, EPA is doing the job that Congress \nmandated decades ago. These amendments that attack the Clean Air Act \nwould force the EPA to turn a blind eye toward polluters, the same \npolluters that are spending millions of dollars to lobby against the \nClean Air Act.\n  I urge every Senator to talk to the parents and grandparents of \nchildren in their home States who suffer from asthma. Take the time to \nhear about the trips they have had to take to the emergency room and \nabout the countless hospital stays because of the air they breathe, \nsomething so many of us take for granted. These attacks on the Clean \nAir Act would also lead to more heart attacks, more strokes, more \ncancer, and shorter lives.\n  I arrived in the Senate just 5 years after the Clean Air Act of 1970 \nwas introduced and unanimously passed by the Senate. I have supported \nefforts to reduce life-threatening pollutants, such as lead and \nmercury. And I will support efforts to reduce hazardous greenhouse \ngases, just as a majority of Americans do.\n  The truth is that the McConnell amendment and the other EPA \namendments we will vote on today would hurt public health, cost \nconsumers more, stifle the invention of new pollution prevention \ntechnologies which grow the U.S. economy and jobs, and further slow our \ntransition to renewable energy sources. Since passage of the Clean Air \nAct, the benefits have proved to be 42 times greater than the estimated \ncosts of cleaning our air. Our GDP has tripled since the Clean Air Act \nwas passed.\n  In Vermont we are fortunate to have two of the preeminent innovation \ncompanies in the world, IBM and GE. These corporations and others like \nthem rely on regulatory certainty when deciding what investments to \nmake in research, technology, and expansion into new markets. These \nattempts to strip EPA of its authority under the Clean Air Act to \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions would send the wrong market signals \nto our innovators.\n  Myths are myths and facts are facts, and the fact is that pollution \nstandards are by law both achievable and affordable.\n  They encourage energy efficiency, which reduces energy demand, \nreduces fuel consumption, drives down our dependency on fossil fuels \nand foreign oil, reduces operating costs, and lowers energy prices. In \nfact the most prevalent compliance response to EPA's carbon regulations \nwill be using current and newly developed technologies to increase a \nplant's energy efficiency.\n  The McConnell amendment would render meaningless the progress that we \nhave already made to invent new products that consume less fuel, \npollute less, and create American jobs--jobs that cannot be sent \noverseas. The McConnell amendment would penalize those pioneering \nfacilities that have already taken steps to clean up industry, and \nreward those who have seen these new standards coming for years, but \nhave chosen to do nothing to protect the public. Instead they now \npressure Congress to let them off the hook and to pass the long term \nhealth costs along to the public.\n  The evidence in favor of embracing a cleaner future is clear. We have \nan opportunity to encourage our innovative companies to be global \nleaders in new clean energy technologies that will create jobs here in \nAmerica. We must stop supporting the dirty, outdated and inefficient \ntechnologies of the past.\n  By eliminating EPA's ability to impose scientific, health-based \nlimits on carbon pollution from the Nation's largest polluters, the \nMcConnell amendment and the other amendments that attack the EPA would \nonly end up taking a hefty toll in Americans'\n\n[[Page S2175]]\n\nhealth and costing consumers more by increasing oil consumption and \nforcing them to pay higher fuel costs.\n  We need to support efforts for clean air and to reduce our dependence \non fossil fuels. Lives are at stake. In 2010, in just 1 year, the Clean \nAir Act prevented 160,000 cases of premature death. By 2020, that \nnumber is projected to rise to 230,000.\n  The air we breathe is the heritage of the American people, not the \nproperty of the big polluters.\n  The people of this great country deserve better, and they want clean \nair as well for their children and grandchildren. That is why I urge \ndefeat of these amendments to gut enforcement of the Clean Air Act. \nStand up for a future with clean energy and economic growth that \ndepends on a clean environment. Take a stand for the American \ninnovation that will create more American jobs and technology to \nprotect the public's health and the environment. And help more \nAmericans live longer lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am here because I want to urge a no vote \non all these amendments that essentially stop the Environmental \nProtection Agency from doing their work as it relates to air pollution.\n  I am here to do that because never before have we ever interfered in \nthe enforcement of the Clean Air Act. It has worked because we have \nseen tremendous advances in our clean air. Pollutants cause or \ncontribute to asthma, emphysema, heart disease, and other potentially \nlethal respiratory ailments.\n  We know from the work of the Bush administration and that of the \nObama administration that the endangerment finding that said greenhouse \ngases were dangerous for our health predicted that ground-level ozone \nwould increase if we did nothing, and we would have more cases of \nasthma and coughing, and people staying home from school, and staying \nhome from work.\n  The EPA's endangerment finding is key. Here is what they told us:\n\n       Severe heat waves are projected to intensify, which can \n     increase heat-related deaths and sickness.\n\n  Remember, this is relating to carbon pollution, greenhouse gases, \nexactly what my colleagues are trying to either slow down cleaning up \nor stop cleaning up, in an unprecedented assault on our nation's \nhealth--unprecedented assault on our nation's health.\n  We even had a Senator stand up here and say, EPA does not have the \nright to regulate carbon pollution, greenhouse gas emissions. I would \nurge that person, and everyone else saying it, to read the Clean Air \nAct. It is so clear. And, by the way, the Bush administration did not \nwant to enforce the Clean Air Act, and they went all the way to the \nSupreme Court, and the Supreme Court said no.\n  It is very clear in the Clean Air Act that, yes, Congress meant we \nshould control this type of dangerous pollution once an endangerment \nfinding is made. And that was made. What the McConnell amendment does--\nand my friend Senator Inhofe was actually the author of the full bill, \nthe same thing--is essentially say that the EPA is overridden. They \nrepeal the endangerment finding. That is like my coming here and \nsaying, I want to repeal science that says that smoking causes lung \ncancer. Okay? I want to play doctor. I want to play scientist. It is \nabsolutely a dangerous precedent because it involves our people. \nClimate change is expected to worsen regional smog pollution, which can \ncause decreased lung function, aggravated asthma, increased emergency \nroom visits, and premature deaths.\n  Why on Earth do my colleagues want to repeal an endangerment \nfinding--by the way, Senator Murkowski tried and it failed, and it is \ngoing to fail here today. But the fact is, why should we play doctor? I \nknow some of us have a great elevation of ourselves; a couple have \ndoctorate degrees, but most of us are not scientists and doctors. We \nact as if we are. I am too humble to repeal science. That is what they \ndo here.\n  Let's look at the health successes of the Clean Air Act. In 2010 \nalone, the act prevented 160,000 premature deaths, 1.7 million asthma \nattacks, 130,000 heart attacks, and 3.2 million lost days of school. I \nam telling you, the Clean Air Act has been a great success. The number \nof smog-related health advisories in Southern California has dropped \nfrom 166 days in 1976 to zero days in 2010.\n  Why on Earth would we want to mess with a law that has been working? \nIt has been working. I defy anyone to point out a law that has worked \nas well as this one. We went from 166 days in Los Angeles, where people \nwere told not to go outdoors, to zero days in 2010, because the EPA--by \nthe way, created by a Republican President, Richard Nixon--does its \njob.\n  Look at the bipartisan support for the Clean Air Act. First of all, \nit passed the Senate 73 to 0, the House 375 to 1. The conference report \nwas approved unanimously, and now, suddenly, I cannot find a Republican \nto say they fully support the Clean Air Act. What has happened to my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle? This was a bipartisan issue. It \ncertainly is with the people.\n  In 1990, we had a bipartisan vote signed by President George Herbert \nWalker Bush: Senate, 89 to 10; House, 401 to 25. That is why so many \npeople in this country still support the Clean Air Act. Let's look at \nthe results of that bipartisan poll we have. Bipartisan support.\n  It was created, the EPA, by Richard Nixon. Republican President \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush signed the reauthorization, and 60 percent \nof the people in this Nation--and this is a poll that was taken \nFebruary 14 of this year--say that the Environmental Protection Agency \nshould update Clean Air Act standards with stricter air pollution \nlimits. Listen. Stricter air pollution limits.\n  The polluters do not like it. They are crying all the way to the \nbank. They had the biggest profits they ever had, the oil companies. \nThey do not want the EPA enforcing the law. By the way, my colleagues \nname this amendment something like The Gas Reduction Price Act or \nsomething like that.\n  They say this is going to help us stop gas prices from rising. It has \nnothing to do with that. Every time we move forward with Clean Air Act \nauthorities, there are predictions from all the polluters about how \nhorrible it will be, and we never had such a period of prosperity since \nRichard Nixon signed the Clean Air Act.\n  Sixty-eight percent say: Congress, stay out of the Clean Air Act \nstandards. Leave them alone. Don't change them. The McConnell amendment \nand the others, all interfere.\n  Sixty-nine percent say EPA scientists, not Congress, should set \npollution standards. This McConnell amendment and the others all put \nCongress in the middle.\n  The people are smart. They don't want politicians deciding what to do \nabout their health. They don't come to us when they have asthma. They \ndon't come to us when they get cancer. They rely on physicians. They \nrely on scientists. But we are playing doctor today. We are going to \nrepeal or try to repeal the endangerment finding that went along with \nthe EPA deciding to move forward and enforce decreases in carbon \npollution.\n  On March 14 the Washington Post had a very interesting article, an \nop-ed piece signed by Christie Todd Whitman, EPA Administrator from \n2001 and 2003, and William Ruckelshaus, EPA Administrator from 1970 to \n1973, two Republican former heads of the EPA. They wrote:\n\n       Today the agency President Richard Nixon created in \n     response to the public outcry over visible air pollution and \n     flammable rivers is under siege. The Senate is poised to vote \n     on a bill that would, for the first time, disapprove of a \n     scientifically based finding, in this case that greenhouse \n     gases endanger public health and welfare.\n\n  This is signed by two Republican former heads of the Environmental \nProtection Agency. The McConnell amendment is radical in the extreme. \nWe have never before played doctor around here and repealed a \nscientific finding that said a certain type of pollution is a problem.\n  They also said:\n\n       It is easy to forget how far we have come in the past 40 \n     years. We should take heart from all the progress and not, as \n     some in Congress have suggested, seek to tear down the agency \n     that the president and Congress created to protect America's \n     health and environment.\n\n  If we are interested in bipartisanship, why don't we look at the \nfacts. The\n\n[[Page S2176]]\n\nfact is, the American public supports EPA and the Clean Air Act. The \nfact is, Richard Nixon created the EPA. The fact is, George Herbert \nWalker Bush signed the Clean Air Act amendments. The fact is, it is \nvery clear in the Clean Air Act that carbon pollution, any pollution \nrelated to climate change, is covered.\n  This is a reality check from someone who believes we should not go \ndown this dangerous path of playing doctor, playing scientist, \noverturning the Environmental Protection Agency, which enjoys almost 70 \npercent support among the people of this greatest of all nations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I agree in one respect with the Senator \nfrom California. Actually, we agree on a lot of points. We agree on \ninfrastructure and things that we know the country needs. But in the \narea of the Clean Air Act, she said: Show me one Republican who \nsupported it. I supported the Clean Air Act. It has been a tremendous \nsuccess.\n  Stop and look at the real pollution. I am not talking about \ngreenhouse gases. I am talking about the six real pollutants and what \nhas happened. It is amazing the success of the Clean Air Act. I agree \nwith that.\n  I remind everyone, though, that the Clean Air Act would not be \nregulating CO2 except the court said: If you want to do it, \nyou can. They did not mandate that it be done. That is worth \nconsidering.\n  Since I have the time until we will be voting on the first of three \ncover votes before they get to my amendment, I wish to correct my good \nfriend from California. She referred to it as the McConnell amendment. \nIt is the McConnell-Inhofe amendment. In fact, it came from my bill \nthat I introduced with Fred Upton sometime ago, a bill that is going to \nbe voted on in the House Representatives today. So it is appropriate \nthat we take it up now. This amendment has been postponed six or seven \ntimes. I applaud the majority leader for letting us have these votes. \nIt is important that we do this.\n  This is what I believe is important. People need to understand a \ncouple of things: First, this is all about, starting in the 1990s when \nthey had the Kyoto convention that we were supposed to ratify, \nPresident Clinton never did submit it to the Senate for ratification. \nNonetheless, it was one that regulated greenhouse gases. I remember at \nthat time the Wharton School did an analysis that asked: What if the \nUnited States were to ratify the Kyoto treaty and live by its \nrequirements? What would the costs be?\n  It came out somewhere in the neighborhood of between $300 and $400 \nbillion. We never ratified it because the President never submitted it \nfor ratification. Then in 2003, there came a number of votes. Almost \nevery year we had legislation introduced that would do essentially what \nthe Kyoto treaty would have done, which would have been cap and trade. \nWe had MIT and others look at it to see what in fact would be the cost \nif we were to do this.\n  I can remember when my good friend, the junior Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, and I talked on the Senate floor the last time \nwe defeated her bill--I think this might have been the Waxman-Markey \nbill, but it doesn't matter because they are all the same--I stipulated \nto the science. I said: All right. Let's assume the science is right. \nIt isn't, but let's assume it is so we don't have to talk about that. \nAssuming it is, let's talk about the economics. That is where we \ndeveloped what it would cost.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, I have a policy that when we talk about \nbillions and trillions of dollars I try to put it into context as to \nhow it will affect taxpayers in my State. I have a very simple thing I \ndo. I take the total number of families who file tax returns and then I \ndo the math. If I divide that, say, $350 billion a year, that means the \naverage taxpayer in my State would have to pay $3,100 a year in \nadditional taxes in order to pay for the cap-and-trade regime that \ncomes with any type of legislation. We talked about that. Continually, \nwe defeated each bill that came along.\n  This is the key. The Obama administration is very beholden to some of \nthe far leftwing people. He had a commitment to try to pass some kind \nof cap and trade. He said: If we can't do it legislatively, we will do \nit through regulation. So we had all these regulations that EPA started \ncoming down with.\n  I have to mention, of these regulations, one was very significant \nbecause I remember when she was before our Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I said to her--this is right before going to the big U.N. \nparty in Copenhagen about 18 months ago--I have a feeling, Madam \nDirector, that you are going to come up with an endangerment finding. \nWhen you do, it has to be based on science. What science will you base \nit on?\n  She said: Primarily on the IPCC.\n  To make sure everybody understands, the IPCC is the United Nations. \nThey are the ones who came up with this whole thing and said this is \nwhat the end of the world is going to be.\n  I said: If you are going to have an endangerment finding that \nCO2 is an endangerment to health, then it has to be based on \nscience. What science will it be based on?\n  The answer was, the United Nations. It is going to be based on the \nscience of the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. \nThat is the United Nations.\n  Coincidentally, right after that is when climategate came, and they \nfound that they had been cooking the science for about 10 years and \nthat the legitimate interests and input of real scientists were \nrejected. So the science just flat wasn't there.\n\n  That is why I said at the time that we had this bill up, I will \nstipulate to the science, even though the science is not there. I know \nit is not there, but what is there is the economics.\n  Here we were, faced with a situation where we were looking at the \npossibility of the Environmental Protection Agency regulating \nCO2. I contend that they can do it if they have an \nendangerment finding, but they don't have to do it. The economic \npunishment to America would be tremendous. However, it wouldn't do any \ngood.\n  Here is the big question: What if I am wrong? People have asked me: \nInhofe, what if you are wrong? You have been leading this fight for 9 \nyears. What if CO2 does endanger health and cause global \nwarming and all these scary stories we hear?\n  My response to that is, if that is the case, it is not going to make \nany difference because even the EPA director admits if we unilaterally \npass some type of regulation that stops the regulation of greenhouse \ngases, it is not going to affect the overall release of CO2 \nemissions.\n  The reason is simple. If we do it only in the United States, we would \nargue that is not where the problem is. The problem is in China, \nMexico, India, and Third World countries that don't have any emission \ncontrols at all. So I think everyone agrees if we pass something like \nthese regulations of the EPA unilaterally, it would not reduce \nemissions at all. Consequently, we would be incurring economic \npunishment to achieve nothing.\n  I would take it one step further. As we chase away our manufacturing \nbase, as they say would happen, we would be in a position where they \nwould go to countries where there is no emission controls. It would \nactually have the result of increasing emissions.\n  Even if Senator Boxer is right in everything she says, she is wrong \nin the respect that if we pass it, it will not lower emissions. That is \nthe fact.\n  We are running out of time, but I have the time right up to 4 \no'clock. I will go over four things that will happen, finalizing the \nvote that is going to be at 4.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me finish because I am going to need all the time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 minutes prior to \nthe vote on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, is the Senator talking \nabout doing it after 4 o'clock?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Before the vote, yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If he would include me to speak for 1 minute at that \ntime, I have no objection.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Senator Baucus will have an amendment up. I think it is \ninteresting. I refer to these three amendments as cover amendments. In \nother\n\n[[Page S2177]]\n\nwords, there are a lot of Democrats who don't want to vote to take away \nthe jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate \ngreenhouse gases, so they have offered other amendments. The Baucus \namendment is one that is going to exempt certain small people, some \nsmall farmers and all that. But that doesn't exempt them from having \ntheir electricity rates escalate.\n  The American Farm Bureau says: We don't want any of the cover votes. \nWe don't want the Baucus bill. We don't want Stabenow, and we don't \nwant Rockefeller. Stabenow would also have a delay in certain parts of \nthe regulation. The Rockefeller vote, which is going to be the third \nvote, is one that would have a 2-year delay. In other words, it says we \ncan go ahead and do the regulation, but we will kind of put it off for \n2 years.\n  The real vote and the one that is critical--and if there is anyone \nout there who doesn't want to go home and say: I am responsible for \npassing the largest tax increase in the history of America by defeating \nthe Inhofe-McConnell amendment, then go ahead and vote that way. That \nis going to be a serious problem--not for me but for the Senators who \nmight vote the wrong way.\n  The McConnell-Inhofe amendment will be the fourth vote. This is the \ncritical one. The rest are cover votes.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that in addition to my being able \nto speak for 2 minutes and Senator Inhofe 1 minute, that Senator Boxer \nalso be allowed to speak for 1 minute on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 236\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a very commonsense amendment. It \nbasically says: The general rule makes sense, but there should be a \ncouple exceptions. The general rule is that we should have regulations \non greenhouse gas emissions, but not for agriculture. I am talking \nabout agricultural producers, not processors, the regulations which \nwould still apply to processors.\n  We are talking about producers, agricultural producers. They should \nbe exempt. Currently, there are not regulations. EPA may or may not \npass regulations that affect agricultural producers. I think we should \nmake clear to agriculture they are exempt. They are not the big \ngreenhouse gas polluters.\n  Second, this amendment puts in place and codifies EPA's attempt to \ndeal with small business with its tailoring rule. It may or may not be \nupheld in the courts. Passage of this amendment would allow this to be \nupheld in the courts.\n  Essentially, there are 15,000 emitters of greenhouse gas emissions \nthat are the big ones. The other 6 million basically are the very small \nones. What about the big ones, the 15,000? Those are large plants run \nby big corporations. They essentially produce most of the greenhouse \ngas emissions. Ninety-six percent of these 15,000--the big ones--are \nalready subject to EPA criteria. They have to get permits. Moreover, \nthey emit 70 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions.\n  So I am just saying, for small businesses--there are a lot of them--\nit is very important they be exempt from EPA regulations. It is common \nsense. In general, it is OK, but it exempts agriculture and it exempts \nsmall business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Montana has \nconsumed his 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, a point of inquiry, not to be taken from \nthe time I have. The inquiry is, When we get into the four votes, are \nwe going to have additional time arguing for and against the \namendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, \nbetween the stacked votes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. OK. I would ask the Chair, these 2 minutes are having to \ndo with the Baucus amendment, the first one we will vote on; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe each have 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. INHOFE. On the Baucus amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. OK. I thank the Chair very much.\n  Let me go first. In deference to my good friend, Senator Boxer, I \nsaid I would go first and she can go last.\n  Let me mention, this is only on the Baucus amendment. Yes, the \nSenator is right in presenting his amendment that it does exempt \nfarmers and some small businesses from the higher costs and all that. \nBut here is the problem with that: All we have to do is read the \nstatement by the American Farm Bureau where they say: Look, all of our \nfarmers across America--even if this only affects the refiners and the \nmanufacturers, that increases the cost of fuel and the cost of fuel is \ngoing to go higher and we do not get anything for it. For that reason, \nthey oppose the Baucus amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, when Senator Baucus talked to me about \nhis amendment, it sounded quite reasonable to make sure we codify the \ntailoring rule of the EPA, which exempts broad swaths of American \nbusinesses from their work on enforcing carbon pollution reductions. \nBut as it came out--and I discussed this with him--it goes further. It \nharms the promotion of clean, renewable biomass, effectively stopping \nEPA's ability to use the Clean Air Act to encourage this kind of \nalternative energy.\n  It also undermines the Clean Air Act's New Source Review Program for \ncarbon pollution, which ensures that the biggest polluters use modern \npollution control technologies. It basically says the EPA cannot go and \nenforce it using the New Source Review unless there is another \npollutant involved.\n  So as the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I \nhave deep concerns. The Baucus amendment is opposed by leading public \nhealth organizations: the American Lung Association, the American \nPublic Health Association, the American Thoracic Society, the Asthma \nand Allergy Foundation of America, Physicians for Social \nResponsibility, and the Trust for America's Health, as well as clean \nenergy business, environment, and conservation organizations.\n  For that reason--although I fully understood the initial intent, and \nI thought it was laudable--this has transformed into an amendment that \nI do not support and the leading public health organizations do not \nsupport.

Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. For years, I have consistently and repeatedly said that \nwe need to have a balanced and comprehensive American energy policy.\n  We can't just impose regulations; we need smart incentives to create \nthe technology for a clean energy economy.\n  The Stabenow-Brown amendment is based on the framework developed on a \nbipartisan basis for the past 2 years to develop a truly comprehensive \npolicy that would allow us to phase in regulations.\n  This amendment would allow the EPA to do its work but would have the \nenforcement of that work be done in 2 years. We would build on the \nsuccessful advanced energy manufacturing tax credit, known as 48C, \nwhich has created jobs at 183 businesses in 43 States.\n  We have put the right incentives into place because we know when we \ndo that we help businesses create good-paying jobs, and we can reduce \ncarbon pollution at the same time.\n  Our amendment also follows what the EPA has indicated is its \nintention toward agriculture by giving our producers the certainty they \nneed.\n  This amendment is a commonsense approach to addressing the issue of \nclean energy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: Senator Inhofe \nand I will speak for 30 seconds each. Is that in compliance?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators have that right. The Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the Stabenow amendment suspends full \nimplementation of the Clean Air Act as it relates to carbon pollution \nfor 2 years, which is going to cost jobs and harm America's \ncompetitiveness. Worse than that, I think around here ``delay'' is \nsometimes a code word for ``never.''\n  A 2-year delay could become a long-term delay. It becomes more \nexpensive, and in the meantime our air gets dirtier.\n  I will close with this: 68 percent of the people believe Congress \nshould not stop EPA from enforcing Clean Air Act standards. Yet this \namendment, and all of the others, do just that.\n  Let's stand with the people, with the American Lung Association, with \nthe physicians who have taken a stand against all of these amendments, \nand allow EPA to do its job.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me join my friend from California \nand say that the Stabenow amendment is similar to the one we voted on \nbefore. It admits that the EPA will harm manufacturers, but it doesn't \ndo anything to protect anybody from the higher price of energy. The \nfarmers will tell you that, and everybody else will. With the 2-year \ndelay, EPA can drop its regulatory hammer on farmers and businesses. I \nurge your vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, my plan would put EPA on hold for 2 \nyears and no more, but not on hold from many of its other duties, for \nexample, CAFE standards.\n  Many of our colleagues do not realize--and certainly the ones who are \ngoing to support the McConnell amendment do not realize--that 31 \npercent of all greenhouse gas emissions in this country come from the \nbacks of trucks and cars. I do not stop them from going ahead and doing \nthat. But I want breathing space so we can take 2 years--yes, there is \na lot of frustration in my State about EPA and permits, and I \nunderstand that very well. But I want to take 2 years so we can think \nas a body and actually come up with an energy policy. I am ready for \nthat.\n  I am not the same person I was 2 or 3 years ago on this subject. But \nwe need that time. I ask my colleagues respectfully to support my \namendment. It stops at the end of 2 years, which continues the use of \nCAFE standards, allowing EPA to set those standards. I ask my \ncolleagues to vote against the McConnell amendment, which I think is \ntruly a stunning aberration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I will take 30 seconds and yield to my \nfriend Senator Inhofe.\n  For the reasons we already said about public health or the protection \nof our Clean Air Act, I urge my colleagues to defeat the Rockefeller \namendment.\n  Let me add one other point. The American renewable energy industry \nhas written to us and told us that the uncertainty of a 2-year delay is \nmore than 2 years. It causes American renewable energy companies to be \nat a disadvantage with foreign energy companies, costing Americans \njobs. Uncertainty adds to job loss in America.\n  For the sake of the public health of Americans, for the sake of our \neconomy, I urge my colleagues to reject the Rockefeller amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, the 2-year delay encourages bureaucrats \nto stall new permits. It does not accomplish anything. It delays new \nconstruction, and it delays new jobs.\n  One of the interesting points about all three of these amendments is \nthat everyone agrees EPA should not be regulating greenhouse gases. If \nyou are going to have a root canal, does it help to wait 2 years?\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \npending Landrieu second-degree amendment No. 244 and the Johanns \namendment No. 161.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 183\n\n  Under the previous order, there is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 183 authored by \nthe Senator from Kentucky.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I think we learned something just in the \nlast half hour, and that is that 90 percent of the Members of this \nbody, of the Senate, do not think the EPA is qualified to regulate \ngreenhouse gases. They voted against the Baucus amendment, the Stabenow \namendment, and the Rockefeller amendment. I have referred to those as \ncover amendments. You don't get much cover when they get less than 10 \npercent of the vote.\n  So now is the chance to really do something. If you really want to do \nsomething that is going to stop the overregulation we get that is so \noffensive to the majority of people, we can do it with the Inhofe-\nMcConnell amendment.\n  First of all, we know what the cost of this will be. The cost will be \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of $300 billion a year. It will be the \nlargest tax increase in the history of this country.\n  Secondly, what do you get? People have asked: Inhofe, what if you are \nwrong? What if these greenhouse gases are going to destroy this \ncountry?\n  If we are wrong, let's look at the response we received from the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa Jackson. \nWhen we asked her at a public meeting, if we were to pass these \nregulations or any of these cap-and-trade bills, would this have the \neffect of lowering the greenhouse gases, the answer was no because it \nwould only affect the United States of America.\n  This is your chance to vote against a major tax increase to the \nAmerican people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President and colleagues, the question is simple: \nCan we protect our environment and grow our economy? And the answer is \nyes.\n  Forty years ago, naysayers claimed the Clean Air Act, signed into law \nby then-President Richard Nixon, was too costly and would doom our \neconomy. They were wrong. We heard the same doom-and-gloom predictions \nin 1990 when President George Herbert Walker Bush led the effort to \nstrengthen the Clean Air Act. They were wrong again. Since 1970, the \nefforts of the Clean Air Act have outweighed the cost 30 to 1, and the \nGDP has grown by more than 200 percent. The Clean Air Act has saved \nhundreds of thousands of lives, trillions in health care costs, and \ngrown our economy. Now the naysayers warn that reducing carbon \npollution will doom our economy. Ronald Reagan might say: Well, there \nthey go again. But history and science say they are wrong.\n  If we don't take action, here is what it will mean: higher health \ncare costs in America, destroyed coastlines, and an ever-growing \ndependence on foreign oil. That is not a recipe for economic success; \nit is a recipe for failure.\n  Let's keep America on the right course--one that saves lives and \ngrows our economy. Please join me in voting against the McConnell \namendment.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a straightforward amendment that \neliminates individuals who have adjusted gross incomes of greater than \n$1 million per year from receiving unemployment benefits. Last year, we \nhad 2,383 people who received unemployment benefits and also had an \nincome tax return that had adjusted gross incomes above $1 million. We \nhad 40 that had adjusted gross incomes above $10 million per year. It \nis a very straightforward amendment. I hope we would support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my amendment addresses the concerns raised \nby the Coburn amendment, but it does so by using existing authorities \nestablished by the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. My amendment \naccomplishes the same objectives, but it maintains the proper deference \nto Congress on matters of appropriations.\n  The Coburn amendment simply duplicates that existing authority but \nremoves the checks and balances. I urge a yes vote on the Inouye \namendment and a no vote on the Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. COBURN. I was looking for Senator Warner in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to urge adoption of the Coburn \namendment. I believe the Coburn amendment actually adds teeth. We have \na study here of duplicative programs from GAO. We have got to make sure \nwe are, as we debate closing down the Federal Government, attacking \nreal programs.\n  We ought to be able to save $5 billion of administrative duplication \nwithin the 82 programs that were given in this guideline in the GAO \nreport. I would urge adoption of the Coburn amendment after the Inouye \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Inouye \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

We are now going to continue \nworking on this piece of legislation. People should talk to the manager \nof the bill if they have other amendments. We have quite a few we have \nto work through, but I think we have had a lot of success today.\n  We are still working on seeing if we can get a budget deal, \neverybody. I have a meeting at the White House at a quarter to 9 \ntonight with Speaker Boehner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the Coburn-\nWarner amendment. Refreshing everyone on the point I made just a couple \nmoments ago, the GAO created a study that gives us a guidepost of where \nwe can start eliminating some of the duplication and replication in \nFederal programs. This does not go to the heart of service delivery. It \ndoes go to anybody who has been a Governor or mayor in this body, who \nknows you can find, in moments of tough times, savings at the \nadministrative level. This is a guideline. If we cannot find $5 billion \nin administrative savings from this guidepost, then this study will go, \nalong with many others, to sit on a shelf.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Coburn-Warner \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, since 1974, there has been a law on our \nbooks that does exactly what this amendment proposes to do. It does so \nwithout taking away the checks and balances we have in the government. \nIt also does so in a proper way. It goes through the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  This is an appropriations matter. So, therefore, I hope all of us can \nvote no on the Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 64, \nthe nays are 36. Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the \nadoption of this amendment, the amendment is agreed to.\n\n\n                       Amendment Nos. 184 and 217\n\n  Under the previous order, amendments Nos. 217 and 184 offered by the \nSenator from Oklahoma are agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to briefly explain my vote \nin favor of amendment No. 273, offered by Senator Coburn. The amendment \nseeks to save at least $5 billion by consolidating duplicative and \noverlapping\n\n[[Page S2181]]\n\ngovernment programs. I wholeheartedly support efforts to save taxpayer \nmoney by eliminating waste, fraud, abuse and inefficiency within the \nFederal Government. A congressional responsibility that I take very \nseriously is our day to conduct oversight of Federal agencies.\n  I recognize that Senator Coburn's amendment is based on a Government \nAccountability Office report to Congress which identified programs and \ninitiatives that have duplicative goals or activities. The report \nincluded 34 areas where billions of dollars could be saved. It included \nseven areas within Defense Department programs. It proposes saving \nmillions by consolidating Federal data centers that today are spread \nacross 24 Federal agencies. It identifies duplication in 44 separate \nemployment and training programs, which could save millions of dollars. \nI also understand that the blender's credit for ethanol was singled out \nin the report.\n  In voting in favor of the amendment, I want to make clear that I do \nnot consider the ethanol blender's credit to be a duplicative program, \nnor do I believe it should simply be eliminated. I would also like to \nmake clear that the GAO report suggested a number of policy options \nthat Congress could consider when revising the tax incentive. My \ncolleagues should know that I, along with other Members of the Senate, \nare currently working to reform and restructure the tax incentives for \nethanol production and consumption. Many of the reforms we are \nexploring are the same options suggested by the GAO report.\n  It is my hope then, that the Senate will consider thoughtful, \nconstructive reforms to the ethanol tax incentive, rather than the \nproposal put forth by Senator Coburn with amendment No. 220 that would \nend the incentive immediately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this budget we have spent so much time \ntalking about is really about making tough choices, hard choices, \ndifficult choices. The American people understand this. They understand \ntough choices. They have to make them every day, especially now with \nthe economy being in the shape it is in. So should their \nrepresentatives in Congress make tough choices.\n  We are being honest with ourselves over here. We know we can't get \n100 percent of what we want. That is what this negotiation is all \nabout. That is why this is a negotiation. It is not a winner-take-all \nsituation.\n  Democrats have made tough choices because we want to get this \nagreement finished. We want it completed. We want to keep the country \nrunning and keep the momentum in the economy that is now creating jobs. \nWe want to avoid a shutdown and the terrible consequences that would \nfollow.\n  The only thing Republicans are trying to avoid is making the tough \nchoices we need to make. We have been more than reasonable. We have \nbeen more than fair. We meet them halfway, and they say no. We meet \nthem more than halfway, and they still say no. We meet them all the \nway, and they still say no. If Republicans were serious about keeping \nthe country running, all they would have to do is say yes.\n  Now we learn House Republicans are going to make another excuse, \ncreate another diversion, and avoid another tough choice. Instead of \nsolving the crisis the way we should, instead of saying yes, they say, \nin fact, what they are going to do is pass what they will call another \nshort-term stopgap measure. They will say it is short term, but what \nthat really means is it is a short cut--a short cut around doing our \njobs. Instead of solving problems, they are stalling. They are \nprocrastinating. That is not just bad policy, it is a fantasy.\n  We all heard the President of the United States say yesterday that he \nwon't accept anything short of a full solution. And why should he? We \nare 6 months into the fiscal year now. President Obama is right. We \ncan't keep funding our great country with one stopgap after another. \nThe United States of America, this great country of ours, shouldn't \nhave to live paycheck to paycheck. We are not going to give up. We are \ngoing to keep talking and keep trying to find middle ground. The \nSpeaker and I will go back to the White House tonight in 2 hours and 20 \nminutes to meet with him again to continue the conversation we have \nbeen having for weeks with this administration.\n  We know the Republicans are afraid of the tea party. That has been \nestablished. Now it looks as though they are also afraid of making the \ntough choices we have to make. But tough choices are what governing is \nall about. They are what leadership is all about. It is time for my \nfriends in the House of Representatives to stop campaigning and start \ngoverning.\n  And remember what one of the greatest Speakers of all time said. In \nfact, he was Speaker three times. He was from the State of Kentucky. \nHenry Clay. He was known as the ``great compromiser.'' He said that all \nlegislation is based on mutual consensus. That is what this is all \nabout. But remember, let's focus on the word ``mutual.'' It takes both \nof us.\n  Mr. President, it is time to lead.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2181-3", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2181-S2182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a moment or two talking \nabout how devastating it would be for our country and for the people of \nour country if, in fact, we have a government shutdown.\n  I represent Maryland, and there are a lot of Federal workers in \nMaryland. They are very concerned because it will affect them. A \ngovernment shutdown will affect everyone in this country. It will \naffect people who depend upon their government being there to serve \nthem.\n  If you are depending upon a timely IRS refund check and the \ngovernment is shut down and you need that money and are counting on \nit--it is your money--you may find out, if the government is shut down, \nthere is no one to talk to and that check will be delayed.\n  If you are a person who is entitled to Social Security disability \npayments and you have a case that is pending, there will not be people \nthere to resolve that case and you will have to wait. That could also \nvery well affect your ability to literally pay your bills.\n  If you are doing research at NIH--cutting-edge research--which \ndepends upon the continuity of the work in order to discover the \nanswers to many of the problems we face in health care, that will be \ndisrupted if we have a shutdown of the government.\n  The bottom line is, everyone loses if we have a shutdown of our \ngovernmental body. The taxpayers lose. Study after study shows that a \nshutdown of the government will actually cost the taxpayers more money. \nIt makes no sense at all. Yet there are some in the House who say: \nLook, bring on a shutdown. They are not negotiating in good faith. They \nare saying it is our way or the highway. Basically, they want to shut \ndown the government.\n  We need to negotiate in good faith. It is not going to be what the \nDemocrats or the Republicans want. That is how the system works. You \nhave to negotiate in good faith. I know our leaders are doing that. I \nurge all of us to understand the consequences of a shutdown and make \nsure we take steps to negotiate in good faith and have a budget \nagreement completed by Friday of this week.\n  I want my colleagues to understand why people in my State should be \nvery concerned about the budget that passed the House of \nRepresentatives--the Republican budget. It would hurt children\n\n[[Page S2182]]\n\non Head Start. In Maryland, 1,795 children who are on Head Start would \nlose their ability to go to that program. You know how important that \nis. For students in Maryland, they would find that their Pell grants \nwould be reduced by almost $700. Women would be hurt by the loss of \nessential preventive health services. Families would be at risk with \nthe lack of enforcement of our regulatory bills that protect us on \npublic health issues. The list goes on.\n  It has been estimated that 700,000 jobs would be lost if the House \nbudget became real. That would jeopardize our recovery. As you know, we \nare just starting to see job growth. We certainly don't want to take \ncounterproductive steps in that recovery.\n  As we pointed out many times, the budget the House sent over is \nconcentrating on 12 percent of Federal spending. We need to broaden \nthis discussion, and we all understand that. It starts with allowing \nthe political system to work and for us to get together and reach an \nagreement for the budget that is already 6 months--we are talking about \nthe last 6 month's budget.\n  In Maryland, if the House budget were to pass, Metro would lose $150 \nmillion. This is the Nation's transit system. People would find that if \nthe transit system can't operate, the roads will be more congested and \nit will take a lot longer to commute.\n  My point is this: The House budget--the Republican budget--is not \ngoing to become law. It is not what the Republicans want or what the \nDemocrats want. We have to come together, and we are doing that. But \nlet's not allow a minority in the House to tell us we are not going to \nlet the system work for the best interests of the American people.\n  I think, though, we should be very concerned about whether this is \npart of a plan with the Republicans, when we look at their budget for \nnext year, the 2012 budget, which was released this week. There are \ndisturbing signs as to what their intentions are. We saw it with the \nbudget for this year and now we see that continued for their budget for \nnext year. They literally want to turn the Medicare system into a \nvoucher program, where seniors have to rely on private insurance \ncompanies. We tried that before Medicare. In the early 1960s, the \nnumber of seniors who could not get health care insurance was \nstaggering. Why? Because private insurance companies are not interested \nin insuring people who make claims. The older you are, the more you \nwill make claims on our health care system. If seniors are at the mercy \nof private insurance companies, it will be much more expensive for \nthem, and they will not get adequate protection.\n  We should all be concerned about the budget that was brought out this \nweek. The Medicaid system that protects our most vulnerable, our \nseniors, who rely, in large part, on the Medicare system to deal with \nlong-term care and nursing care--the Republican budget would transfer \nthat to the States with a block grant, making it unlikely to see the \ncontinuation of the program that is critically important, not just to \npeople who are vulnerable, but if they have to rely on the use of \nemergency rooms to get care, it will be more expensive for all of us.\n  These short-term so-called budget savings will turn into long-term \ncosts for our country. The Republican budget continues to do these \ndomestic discretionary cuts--well beyond what we need as a nation to \ngrow--taking, again, our most vulnerable, those who depend on \ngovernment, making a college education more expensive and denying young \npeople the opportunities they need.\n  Guess what is missing in the Republican budget. There is no effort to \ndeal with the revenue problems of America. I say there is a better way \nto do this, and there are 64 Senators who have come together and said: \nLook, we have to deal with our national debt with a credible budget \nplan--a credible budget plan that starts with discretionary spending \ncuts, and we all agree to that. We have to reduce military spending and \ndeal with mandatory spending, but we have to also deal with the revenue \nside. Thirty-two Democrats and 32 Republican Senators said that.\n  The Republican budget in the House doesn't take us down that path. It \nis not a credible plan for dealing with the budget deficit that can \npass and be enacted and give confidence not only to the financial \nmarkets in America but around the world and tell the American people it \nputs their interests first.\n  I want my colleagues to understand we don't want to jeopardize the \nrecovery. We want to get our budget into balance, and we have to get \nthis year's budget behind us. We have to deal with that. President \nObama is right when he said in the State of the Union Address that we \nhave to beat our competition. We have to outeducate, outinnovate and \noutbuild them and we have to do it in a fiscally responsible way. We \ncan do that now if we work together and deal with the budget we are \ncurrently in, which ends September 30 of this year, in a fiscally \nresponsible way. Let's get this done and move on and work together for \nthe sake of our Nation.\n  I am convinced that if we work together, we can have a responsible \nplan and we certainly should not allow a minority in the House to block \na budget resolution for this year, causing the government shutdown. \nThat is the worst case for the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue to work together so we can keep the \ngovernment operating, reduce the deficit, and allow America to grow and \ncompete and meet the challenges of the future.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Cardin for his patience \nand Senator Snowe as we have worked up through the last hour or two on \ntheir two proposals. Both have to do with perfecting our contracting \nprograms. While not specific to the SBIR Program and STTR Program, they \nare very relevant to the work we do on the Small Business Committee.\n  I appreciate all the Members who allowed these two amendments to go \nforward. They are pending and hopefully tomorrow we can get some \nagreement on some additional votes. We have had a very busy day today \non the underlying bill, the SBIR bill. We voted on seven amendments. We \nhad heated discussions on issues that are not related to this bill but \nare very important to this body.\n  I thank the Senators for working in good faith as we try to move \nthrough the many amendments that have been filed, most of which are not \ngermane to the issue at hand but are important to be discussed on the \nfloor of the Senate and in Congress.\n  I thank particularly Senator Cardin. I notice he is on the floor. He \nmay want to say a word now about his amendment briefly. I commit to the \nSenator that we will discuss his amendment and Senator Snowe's \namendment as soon as we can tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Landrieu for her \nextraordinary work and patience. She gives us credit. We give her \ncredit for patience in the manner this legislation has been considered.\n  This bill is very important not just to the small business community \nbut to our economy. We are talking about providing the wherewithal for \ninnovation in America. Small businesses will produce the largest amount \nof innovation in this country and the largest job growth. This bill \ngives them some degree of predictability on getting the types of \nresources so they can innovate.\n  I do applaud the Senator. I am proud to be part of the committee. \nThis has been a very bipartisan bill. I thank her. I thank her for \naccommodating the amendment that she was helpful in getting passed \ninitially, along with Senator Snowe, that increases the size of surety \nbonds from $2 million to $5 million, which makes a difference for a \nsmall construction company getting government procurement. It is \ncritically important. It has worked much more successfully than we \nthought when we first put the increase into effect. We actually had a \nlot more contracts than we thought when we originally suggested this.\n  I am pleased to tell the chairman that it has no scores as far as \ncost. There is no taxpayer cost involved. This is a win-win situation \nto help small businesses get construction work, adding to our economy \nand job growth.\n  I look forward to talking about this amendment tomorrow. Hopefully, \nwe will be able to get a vote. I again thank the Senator for her \nattention.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to speak for 2 minutes in general \nwrapup. There may be other Senators coming to the floor. I am hopeful \nwe can lock in a time to vote on Cardin amendment No. 240 and the Snowe \namendment No. 253. There are other amendments, a few amendments that \nare pending. Many others have been filed. The Senators are working \ntogether to see what kind of accommodations we can make.\n  Again I remind everyone, while we are working hard behind the scenes \nin many rooms and meetings today to try to keep our government open and \noperating while reducing spending where we can in an effective and a \nsmart and constructive way, I remind our Senators how important this \nbill is because it will be reauthorizing a program that actually \ncreates jobs in America by the small businesses that are represented on \nall of our Main Streets in our States and our communities.\n  This is the Federal Government's largest program for research and \ndevelopment. We do not believe that only big business, only \ninternational corporations have the best technology, the best \napproaches, or the best methods. We actually believe there are small \nbusinesses, some quite tiny, just one scientist and an assistant who \ncan come up with cutting-edge technology, an engineer or an assistant, \nor a doctor and an assistant, who can come up with cutting-edge \ntechnologies that can cure a disease of the time or create a new \nmechanical system or technology system that helps not only our Federal \nagencies to cut spending, operate more efficiently, but can be \ncommercialized in a way that creates manufacturing jobs and service \njobs in America.\n  There are many ways to get to a balanced budget. We have heard a lot \nabout cutting spending. Yes, we need to do that. But we also need to \ncreate jobs which generate income to close that budget gap. If we can \nget a more robust economy underway, this program most certainly is one \nof the ones.\n  I am proud of the new economic data that has come out. We are not \nwhere we need to be. Unemployment is still too high, but it is coming \ndown. We are not creating enough jobs, but we are creating more and \nmore every month. In large measure, it is because of some of the work \nour Committee on Small Business has done, both in the stimulus package \nand in our last small business bill opening up lending, getting credit \nlines started in partnership with community banks. Part of it is smart \nprograms such as this. There are some government programs that do not \nwork. This is not one of them.\n  I thank our Members for being patient. We now have the Cardin-Snowe \namendments pending. We will hopefully lock in a time to vote on those \nand a few others we are considering as well.\n  Tomorrow, hopefully, we will start at an early hour and will continue \nto work on this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2183-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I continue to receive letters weighing in \non the issue of interchange fee reform. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record letters or statements from the following \norganizations: the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the Main Street Alliance, \nConsumer Federation of America, and the National Black Church \nInitiative.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    April 1, 2011.\n       Dear Senator: The Rainbow PUSH Coalition expresses its \n     views on the Durbin swipe fee reform amendment now being \n     debated in the Congress. Rainbow PUSH is a strong advocate of \n     the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation which provides \n     critical consumer protections and safeguards against \n     predatory lending.\n       The Durbin swipe fee reform amendment should be implemented \n     as scheduled. It will usher in needed reform to bring \n     competition, transparency and choice to the interchange \n     system, and provide incentives for the retail sector to pass \n     on interchange savings to lower the price of products for \n     consumers. Numerous consumer rights organizations, civil \n     rights groups, universities, unions, and other constituencies \n     have weighed in to support swipe fee reform.\n       We respect the concerns that some groups have raised about \n     the provision, but are unconvinced that a delay in its \n     implementation as proposed by Sen. Tester and the American \n     Banking Association (representing the financial services \n     industry) will be beneficial to consumers and students, and \n     small businesses. It appears that their interest is to \n     maintain a deregulated environment to continue the virtual \n     monopoly status of the credit card transaction process, and \n     to protect their massive profits derived from debit \n     interchange fees.\n       Deregulation, greed and lack of congressional oversight led \n     to the most severe economic collapse since the great \n     depression. But Wall Street got billions in public funds \n     because they were deemed too big to fail--they've been bailed \n     out and are once again recording record profits and issuing \n     millions\n\n[[Page S2184]]\n\n     in executive bonuses, while homeowners and working families \n     are still left out. The big banks are already charging \n     consumers higher interest rates and raising consumer fees to \n     record levels in virtually every dimension of banking and \n     credit card use. We stand ready to meet with all concerned to \n     ensure the implementation of a sustainable debit card system \n     going forward.\n       The Durbin credit card swipe fee amendment will afford the \n     protections and regulations that consumers need.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                               Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, Sr.,\n\n                                            President and Founder,\n     Rainbow PUSH Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 31, 2011.\n     Senator Dick Durbin,\n     Assistant Majority Leader, Hart Senate Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: We write to express the National Black \n     Church Initiative's continued support for the Durbin swipe \n     fee amendment which we supported and was included in the \n     Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. \n     The current interchange system is uncompetitive, non-\n     transparent and harmful to consumers. It is simply unjust to \n     require less affluent Americans who do not participate in or \n     benefit from the payment card or banking system to pay for \n     excessive debit interchange fees that are passed through to \n     the costs of goods and services. As a result, NBCI does not \n     support Congressional delay of implementation of the new law.\n       As you may know, The National Black Church Initiative \n     (NBCI) is a faith-based coalition of 34,000 churches \n     comprised of 15 denominations and 15.7 million African \n     Americans committed to eradicating racial disparities and \n     improving the lives of African Americans nationwide.\n       We oppose efforts to delay implementation of the Durbin \n     amendment through Congressional action. The new law gives the \n     Federal Reserve adequate authority it can use without delay \n     to make sure that the debit interchange reimbursement \n     financial institutions receive covers their legitimate, \n     incremental costs for providing debit card services. We know \n     that there are banks, like BB for example, who would like \n     to delay this process. Their continued profit off the backs \n     of low income African Americans will no longer be tolerated \n     and we will continue to advocate on behalf of laws that \n     support our agenda.\n       From a consumer point of view, the current interchange \n     system is not defensible. Feeble competition in the payment \n     card marketplace has led to unjustifiably high debit \n     interchange fees that the poorest Americans, generally cash \n     customers, are required to subsidize at the store and at the \n     pump.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views. Please \n     contact us directly to discuss these important issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Rev. Anthony Evans,\n     President, National Black Church Initiative.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 31, 2011.\n     To: U.S. Senators and Representatives.\n     Re Main Street Alliance support for implementing debit \n         interchange protections for small businesses in the \n         Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: The Main Street Alliance, a national \n     network of small business coalitions representing small \n     business owners across America, writes to express our strong \n     support for the provision of the Restoring American Financial \n     Stability Act of 2010 that set out to ensure that debit card \n     interchange fees are reasonable and proportional. This \n     provision is an important step toward putting small \n     businesses back on stable footing by limiting burdensome fees \n     on small businesses when we process debit transactions.\n       Small businesses have faced ever-rising fees on debit card \n     transactions over the years. For some businesses, these \n     interchange fees have grown to the point that they represent \n     some of the highest operating costs, rivaling the costs of \n     labor and utilities. There is no such thing as fair \n     competition in this market: the card companies have a \n     duopoly. Limiting fees to twelve cents per transaction, as \n     proposed in new rules, will free small businesses from \n     disproportionate and burdensome costs, allowing economic \n     growth.\n       The new rules are a step forward, a step toward parity and \n     a reasonable balance. We ask that these rules not be delayed \n     further. Implementing them as planned this summer will \n     provide a shot in the arm for small businesses and our local \n     economies. Small businesses are better off with these \n     protections; we urge you not to allow the lobbying tactics of \n     the big banks deter the enactment of rules that protect small \n     business.\n       The country is counting on small businesses to serve as an \n     engine of economic recovery and create the jobs we need to \n     get people back to work across America. The debit interchange \n     provisions enacted in the financial overhaul last year and \n     codified in the new rules support these aims. We urge you to \n     fight efforts to delay or derail the implementation of these \n     rules.\n         Mike Craighill, Soup and Such, Billings, MT; Garry Owen \n           Ault, All Makes Vacuum, Boise, ID; Nancie Koerber, \n           Champions Real Time Training, Central Point, OR; David \n           Borris, Hel's Kitchen Catering, Northbrook, IL; Carson \n           Lynch, Gorham Grind, Gorham, ME; Tammy Rostov, Rostov's \n           Coffee & Tea, Richmond, VA.\n         Kelly Conklin, Foley-Waite Associates, Bloomfield, NJ; \n           Melanie Collins, Melanie's Home Childcare, Falmouth, \n           ME; Rashonda Young, Alpha Express, Inc., Waterloo, IA; \n           Jose Gozalez, Tu Casa Real Estate, Salem, OR; Rosario \n           Reyes, Las Americas Business Center, Lynnwood, WA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Consumer Federation of America,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n     Position of the Consumer Federation of America on Debit Card \n               ``Interchange'' Fee Legislation and Rules\n\n\n   no position on debit interchange law or on legislation to delay it\n\n       CFA did not take a position on the ``Durbin Amendment'' to \n     the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \n     and has also not supported or opposed legislation introduced \n     in Congress to delay the interchange law.\n\n\n     federal reserve should alter proposed rule implementing debit \n                            interchange law\n\n       CFA filed comments with the Federal Reserve in February \n     (http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/debit-cards-FRB-interchange-\nrule-comments-2-22-11.pdf) that came to the following \n     conclusions:\n       The current interchange system is uncompetitive, non-\n     transparent and harmful to consumers. Feeble competition in \n     the payment card marketplace has led to unjustifiably high \n     debit interchange fees that the poorest Americans are \n     required to subsidize. It is simply unjust to require less \n     affluent Americans who do not participate in or benefit from \n     the payment card system to pay excessive fees that are passed \n     through to the cost of goods and services.\n       The Federal Reserve should ensure that financial \n     institutions are reimbursed for legitimate, incremental debit \n     card costs as it finalizes rules that implement the new \n     interchange requirements. In particular, the Federal Reserve \n     should increase proposed interchange price standards as \n     allowed under law to include several specific expenses \n     incurred by financial institutions when processing debit card \n     transactions. If such compensation does not occur, these \n     institutions could increase debit card and other related \n     banking charges on their least desirable and most financially \n     vulnerable consumers: low-to- moderate income account \n     holders.\n       Once it is implemented, the Federal Reserve should pay \n     close attention to how it affects the financial viability of \n     small depository institutions, especially credit unions, \n     which often provide safe, lower-cost financial services to \n     millions of Americans.\n       The Federal Reserve should launch a broad, balanced study \n     upon implementation of the effects of the rule on consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2184-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2184-S2186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATION TEXAS A LADY AGGIES\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, something happened last night, and I \nfeel compelled to say on the floor of the Senate that I am very proud \nof the Texas Aggies women who won the NCAA national basketball \nchampionship.\n  It is so important, I want to say a couple of words about that, \nbecause this is the first national championship that the Lady Aggies \nhave ever won. It was a great game last night. I certainly congratulate \nthe Notre Dame Fighting Irish as well. But the Texas Aggies played with \nspirit. They came from behind at the half, and 76 to 70, they defeated \nNotre Dame.\n  I congratulate the Texas Aggie ladies, but I also want to say that \nTexas A's coach, Gary Blair, became the oldest coach to ever win a \nnational women's championship. He has turned the Lady Aggies basketball \nteam into this national championship team.\n  I mention Danielle Adams. Her All American performance last night was \nincredible. It is a great day. I am a Texas Longhorn, and most days I \nam for all of our Texas teams, and I love to say ``Gig `Em Aggies.'' \nThere is one day that I cannot say that. That is Thanksgiving Day. But \n364 days a year, I am all for the Aggies when they are playing. And \nwhen they played like they did last night in any sport, all America \nshould recognize it.\n  With that, I wish to say that my colleague Senator Cornyn and I are \ngoing to ask unanimous consent to offer a resolution congratulating the \nLady Aggies of Texas A on winning the 2011 National Collegiate \nAthletic Association women's basketball championship.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, congratulations to the Texas A Women's \nBasketball team for their NCAA Women's Division I Basketball \nChampionship victory against Notre Dame. The game was an exciting and \nhard fought victory, and a fitting end to a championship season.\n\n[[Page S2185]]\n\n  Thanks to the Aggies's hard work, determination and tireless work \nethic, they have finished out the 2010-2011 season with a strong 33-5 \nrecord, second place finish in the Big 12 Conference and a National \nChampionship title.\n  I salute head coach Gary Blair for coaching the Aggies to their first \nNCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship after 38 years of \nhelping young women compete and reach their full potential. Associate \nhead coaches Vic Schaefer and Kelly Bond, and assistant coach Johnnie \nHarris also worked to lead the team to this fine achievement. And the \nLady Aggies's success would be incomplete without great athletes such \nas MVP and All-American, Danielle Adams and her teammates: Kelsey \nAssarian, Maryann Baker, Kristi Bellock, Kelsey Bone, Sydney Carter, \nSkylar Collins, Sydney Colson, Adaora Elonu, Karla Gilbert, Kristen \nGrant, Adrienne Pratcher, Catherine Snow, Tyra White, and Cierra \nWindham.\n  Today, it is my honor to join with the entire Texas A University \nfamily and the State of Texas to honor the Aggies.

The experience that \neach of these athletes has gained in this endeavor is invaluable, and \nit will surely lead to future success in life.\n  The following article written by Dawn Lee Wakefield for the \nExaminer.com describes Coach Blair's and the Aggies's persistent and \npositive approach to the game and this exciting championship series:\n\n      [From the Texas A University Arts Examiner, Apr. 6, 2011]\n\n   Texas A Women's Basketball, NCAA Champions Win It for the Aggie \n                                 Family\n\n                        (By Dawn Lee Wakefield)\n\n       Bryan-College Station.--Texas A University sports fans \n     around the world celebrated another important first tonight, \n     their very first NCAA Women's Basketball Championship. For \n     almost as long as TAMU Women have been competing in NCAA \n     athletic competition, the road has been long, and the ability \n     to gain respect for the team has been tough. A real \n     battleground in fact. Even as recently as four months ago, \n     you couldn't get a crowd into Reed Arena to see the Lady \n     Aggies play basketball. But that all changed tonight, in 40 \n     short minutes of play, in the heart of Indianapolis, Indiana, \n     seen around the world on ESPN.\n       On-campus support for TAMU Athletic teams, by the Aggie \n     student body is legendary, for that trademarked 12th Man \n     Spirit. Even more in the forefront of all sports is the 12th \n     Man Foundation (formerly the Aggie Club), whose mission it is \n     to garner funds and endowments by which to support Texas A \n     Athletics. And yet, it was not all that long ago that a few \n     hundred stalwart fans would arrive at Reed Arena (there was \n     no charge to park as in men's games, because they really \n     didn't expect much of a crowd), that Coach Blair himself \n     would walk up and down the steps of Reed Arena, carrying bags \n     of candy, tossing them to fans and thanking them for coming.\n       Never one to be subtle, Coach Blair would work the crowd by \n     saying, ``bring a friend next time, bring two friends; let's \n     fill this place!'' After each game, the Lady Aggies didn't \n     head to the locker rooms to rest after a hard-fought game \n     right away. Instead, they would come up into the stands and \n     thank people for coming. Week after week, game by game, it \n     simply mystified the Aggie faithful in attendance as to \n     ``what are they thinking'' about why the TAMU Athletic Ticket \n     office wasn't being pushed for ticket sales. Every game the \n     Lady Aggies gained style, grace, accuracy, and stature and \n     yet, the only crowds of Aggies lined up to camp out for \n     ticket-pulls for student tickets were for the men's games.\n       They didn't know what they were missing, the ones who \n     weren't there. They were missing the faithful Aggie Yell \n     Leaders leading the crowd, the Hullaballoo band doing a \n     rendition of ``Sweet Caroline'' that would make Neil Diamond \n     proud, and the crowd responding, ``Aggies Ball!'' every time \n     PA announcer Mark Edwards would identify ball possession for \n     the team. Mike Wright and Tap Bentz, with their radio play-\n     by-play, kept those in touch who couldn't get there in \n     person, and local TV KBTX did their best to show highlights. \n     And yet, the second deck of Reed was filled only once, when \n     Baylor came calling. With a solid loss at the hands of the \n     Greiner-Mulkey-driven offense, those who'd come to see the \n     game left, and some didn't come back. That didn't faze the \n     Lady Aggies or the coaching staff.\n       As part of Coach Blair's and Coach Schaefer's mandate, the \n     Lady Aggies participate in a multitude of community charity \n     events. One night last October, the starting players and \n     waiting-in-line players crowded into a Double Dave's to \n     participate in a pepperoni-roll making contest against the \n     men's team, and then stayed to visit with the crowd, thank \n     them for coming out to support them, by contributing to \n     United Way, and once again, they went home to study. They're \n     some of the hardest-working kids in town, and yet the words \n     ``national champions'' were never spoken, or expected by \n     those who loved them `anyway'.\n       It is surreal to some to think that, the newly crowned \n     national champions, Texas Aggie Women's Basketball, has for \n     years remained the best kept secret on campus. Until tonight.\n       Throughout the NCAA championship series, the Lady Aggie \n     basketball team overcame naysayers, doubters, and brutal \n     physical competition in the most exciting display of Aggie \n     spirit shown in years. They did it by creating a sense of \n     family, with whomever embraced their love of basketball, the \n     coaching staff, and Texas A University. Never was the \n     spirit of Aggieland greater than after each game, seeing \n     President Loftin (easily recognizable in his signature bow \n     tie) in the middle of a long line of Aggies, ``sawing \n     varsity's horns off'' as they sang the Texas Aggie fight song \n     after each victory. Local business sponsors paid countless \n     thousands of dollars to create ``jewelry cam'', ``kiss cam'', \n     ``know your Aggie players--what's on their iPod'', ``the \n     berney cam'' and flying blimps to make each game an event, an \n     exciting event, and share the love of family Aggie basketball \n     style.\n       The prelude to the national championship was nothing short \n     of high-octane spectacular. Almost 500 Aggie fans waited in \n     the basement of Reed Arena in the Aggie practice room 3 weeks \n     ago, to find out what the NCAA draw would be, and where they \n     were to begin their journey to the Sweet Sixteen. When the \n     announcement came on ESPN, ``Shreveport'', the cheers were \n     deafening as Aggie fans knew they were within driving \n     distance to watch the first, and hopefully second, round of \n     play as the bracket opened, and the race was on, the only \n     goal at the time, to make the Sweet 16, out of the Superb 64.\n       Just being in the NCAA championship was enough, almost, for \n     most Aggie fans. It was an unprecedented thrill to think that \n     this year's team had the perfect combination of talent, \n     strategy, coaching staff, and the hearts and minds of players \n     who refused to let go of one goal, and one goal only: \n     Victory. Getting that W. The girls studied in buses, on \n     planes, at 2 a.m. when the rest of Aggieland was fast asleep. \n     The Lady Aggies knew how important it was to stay true to the \n     title ``student-athletes''.\n       On March 20th in Shreveport, the CenturyTel Center still \n     had plenty of room in the stands for Aggie fans, but the \n     faithful alumni, friends, and fans of the Lady Aggies made \n     the pilgrimage with joy and great expectation to watch them \n     defeat McNeese State by the score of 87 to 47. The crowd \n     reaction was joyful, and yet people were just thrilled to be \n     there, not thinking much about the next game to come against \n     Rutgers. When the Lady Aggies made short work of Rutgers with \n     a score of 70 to 48, the Aggie family was again surprised, if \n     not thrilled, to be going to the Sweet 16, at last.\n       Advancing to the NCAA 3rd round on March 27th, again, Aggie \n     fans picked up numbers, if not their speed, as they gassed up \n     their cars and planes for the short hop to Dallas, to the \n     American Airlines center to watch their team face Georgia's \n     Lady Bulldogs. Georgia was at first an `unknown quantity with \n     potential and power,' but the Lady Aggies came to play, \n     making short work of their solid opponent, 79 to 38, in a \n     game that looked much like a 3-point shooting clinic. The \n     work of the Big D, defense, proved to be a powerful force \n     meeting an immovable object.\n       Not only was Tuesday, March 29th the occasion of the 4th \n     round of the NCAA finals, that Elite 8 night, it marked the \n     4th matchup between Texas A and the highly advertised \n     Baylor Bears. Three times, the Aggies had met them; three \n     times they had fallen, as hard as Kim Mulkey's snakeskin \n     jacket hit the ground in disgust one night when she didn't \n     like the referee calls.\n       Although 11,000+ fans crowded into Dallas' American \n     Airlines Center to watch ``The 4th time's (hopefully) a \n     Charm'' matchup, the gold and green far outweighed the maroon \n     and white in the seats. And yet, the Aggies gathered, the \n     faithful, were loud, proud, and the happiest people in the \n     state of Texas with a victory that was hard fought, in a \n     night where the Lady Aggies refused, again, to give in to \n     negative expectations. Instead, they focused mentally on the \n     ``+'' sign that Coach Blair draws on the back of his left \n     hand, self-created to remind him to stay positive throughout \n     the game.\n       ``They're kids, 18-22, and this is just a game'' as he \n     announced as a reminder to all that sports were about \n     sportsmen and sportswomen, in the spirit of competition. \n     Lessons well taught. Lessons well learned. Every after-game \n     interview, you'd hear one word above the rest. ``TEAM''. No \n     stars, even among the player of the game. It was ``my team, \n     our team, this team''. The class possessed by the Lady Aggies \n     spoke for itself, loud and clear.\n       The chant went up, ``Final Four, Final Four'' after the \n     Lady Aggies stunned Baylor, 58 to 46. The Aggie faithful \n     didn't want to leave the American Airlines center as they \n     stood and swayed to the Aggie war hymn, and watched each \n     member of the team, the yell leaders, Lady Aggie Dance Team, \n     Hullaballoo band, staff, and the sports announcers each cut \n     down a piece of the winning game net. Coach Blair thanked \n     everyone for coming and encouraged people who could to make \n     that trip to Indianapolis to root on their team in the Final \n     Four.\n       Outside the arena in the hallways of the American Airlines \n     center, Aggie faithful\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\n     made new friends among those who'd lingered to absorb the joy \n     of the Elite Eight to Final Four pathway. With tears in their \n     eyes and joy shining from their countenance, three women \n     introduced themselves to the BCS fans, saying ``that's our \n     Coach, that's our Coach'' about Blair. Turns out they'd been \n     his players at South Oak Cliff High School. And, true to \n     form, Coach Blair had mentioned each and every team he'd been \n     a part of in his thank-you speech following the game. A man \n     who's never forgotten who brung him to the dance, was now \n     ``going to the dance'' in Indianapolis.\n       Though the distance was longer, those who could afford the \n     charter planes, the buses, or the time and gas to drive made \n     their plans to attend the Final Four in Indianapolis. The \n     Final Four was in store, and all eyes were only on the prize \n     of eliminating the Stanford Cardinal. No other goal was \n     announced. Stanford was considered in the same light as the \n     Aggies. A number 2 seed. Overlooked. Relegated to the \n     category of ``nice, but not a contender''.\n       How wrong the rankings can be in predicting who is the \n     champion of the day. The oft-used expression, ``any given \n     day'' was never more true than when the Lady Aggies went back \n     to work, and walked out of Conseco Field House with a 63 to \n     62 win, thanks to Sydney Colson's pass to Tyra White for the \n     layup, and 39 minutes and 45 seconds of defense, defense, \n     defense, and the hot shooting arms of every player who made \n     their play a key' play. Fans were stunned. It seemed too good \n     to be true.\n       The Championship game was in sight, and the Championship \n     title was at stake. Could it be, that same team, who 16 short \n     weeks ago couldn't find a crowd had emerged as a national \n     powerhouse, a force to be reckoned with, was now the darling \n     of ESPN up-close interviews, sound bytes by Blair, and the \n     contemplation of Vic Schaefer's `drawing board' where he'd \n     drive that defense to excellence each and every game of the \n     way. Blair and Schaefer, together with Associate Head Coach \n     Kelly Bond and Assistant Head Coach, Johnnie Harris, are not \n     to be overlooked. Team. Family. United. Aggies. Spirit \n     personified filled each player with a sense of family such \n     that even the motto printed on the tickets at the beginning \n     of the season read, ``This is Home''.\n       So, tonight, as Texas A set out to prove their worth \n     outside the walls of their hometown, they were taking on a \n     first-class team with a second-tier rating in Notre Dame. It \n     was the Fighting Texas Aggies vs. the Fighting Irish. How \n     appropriate. For 40 minutes of regulation play, all these \n     players did was fight, not against each other as much as \n     against misperceptions, being overlooked, disregarded, and \n     essentially underappreciated as the true champions each team \n     came to be realized before the game started.\n       Aggie fans throughout the Brazos Valley jammed the \n     restaurants, bars, and homes of their friends, anywhere there \n     was a TV powered `on', it was tuned to ESPN from 6 p.m. \n     central until at least midnight, as the Women's Basketball \n     team pulled out all the stops on offense and defense.\n       With a ``never-say-die'' spirit, the can-do Aggies, led by \n     America's favorite new coach, Gary Blair, and King of \n     Defense, Vic Schaefer, let loose and held forth as the Aggies \n     pulled out a 76-70 victory that still seems unreal, unless \n     you saw it yourself. Never. Say. Die. The Lady Aggies, per \n     Coach Blair's pre-game speech, stayed on the bus, to come out \n     winners. Said Blair, ``if you don't plan on winning tonight, \n     then get off the bus. There's only one thing that counts. \n     Winning''. Taking his words to heed, each team member \n     committed to that outcome, and emerged the first national \n     champions in Texas A Women's basketball. History was made.\n       Throughout the NCAA series the team: MVP Danielle Adams, \n     Tyra White, Sydney Carter, Sydney Colson, Adora Elonu, \n     Maryann Baker, Adrienne Pratcher, Kelsey Assarian, Karla \n     Gilbert, Kristi Bellock--battered, bruised, in visible pain, \n     tossed and slammed onto the floors of field houses, arenas, \n     and stadiums, play after play, time after time, just got back \n     up and showed America what it meant to be a proud `Fightin' \n     Texas Aggie'.\n       ``Some may boast of prowess bold, of the school they think \n     so grand, but there's a spirit that's ne'er been told. It's \n     the Spirit of Aggieland. We are the Aggies, the Aggies are \n     We, true to each other as Aggies can be. We've got to fight \n     boys (old traditions die hard), we've got to fight, we've got \n     to fight for maroon and white. After they've boosted all the \n     rest, they will come and join the best, for we are the \n     Aggies, the Aggies are we. We're from Texas AMC''. The words \n     to the school song never sounded sweeter as they did to those \n     who witnessed history in the making, in a fieldhouse in \n     Indianapolis.\n       Wednesday, April 6th at 2 p.m., history will be made once \n     again. The Lady Aggies will be at Reed Arena to be greeted by \n     their Texas Aggie family, the Aggie Nation, and at last their \n     time has come. Word to the wise: get there early if you're \n     going. For the first time in the history of Women's \n     basketball, there's going to be a parking problem to welcome \n     home the champions.\n       The Lady Aggies have brought honor, dignity, and joy to \n     those who call TAMU their team. Sunday night, TV audiences \n     were treated to a one-shot of a little fellow holding up a \n     cardboard sign saying, ``Coach Blair is my hero''. That went \n     viral across Facebook and Twitter. Turns out, it was the \n     coach's grandson, Logan. His sign tonight, shown to the \n     nation, said, ``after we win Coach Blair is taking me to \n     Disneyland''. That only seems fair, as Coach Blair took \n     Aggies everywhere to the top of the college sports world \n     tonight. And it was the ride of a lifetime, and sheer joy \n     every minute of every game of every season. Gig em, Aggies, \n     for tonight you are indeed the NCAA Champions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2186-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2186-S2187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NONPROLIFERATION BUDGET\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the proposed cuts \nto nuclear nonproliferation programs in the continuing resolution, \nwhich I believe seriously endangers our Nation's security. When the \nSenate was presented with H.R. 1, the House's fiscal year 2011 \nappropriations bill, we all knew that sacrifices were needed. We knew \nthat we needed to examine programs and determine which were broken, \nwhich were redundant, and which needed to be eliminated. Likewise, we \nalso had a responsibility to determine which programs worked and \nprovided positive returns on investments for our security and economic \nstability.\n  I would assert that the National Nuclear Security Administration's, \nNNSA, nonproliferation programs fall into this category. For the past \ndecade, one threat has dominated our national security agenda: the \nthreat of a nuclear weapon in the hands of a terrorist.\n  Yet when H.R. 1 passed in February, the House proposed a 24-percent \ncut to the President's request for NNSA nonproliferation programs. \nThese cuts would endanger programs that have removed a total of 120 \nbombs' worth of highly enriched uranium, HEU, and nuclear material from \nsix countries since April 2009. This past November, enough HEU to make \n775 nuclear weapons was removed from Kazakhstan. I would consider these \noutcomes an underreported, yet remarkable success. I question why such \nhighly effective programs, vital to our national security interests, \nwere targeted in the first place.\n  I would contend that should a terrorist set off a nuclear or \nradiological explosion, the physical, psychological and economic \nconsequences would far exceed the money saved by these shortsighted \ncuts.\n  The Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United \nStates stated that ``the surest way to prevent nuclear terrorism is to \ndeny acquisitions of nuclear weapons or fissile material,'' and that \nthe United States should ``accelerate'' not decelerate the process of \nsecuring nuclear material. In the Commission's opinion this should be \n``the top priority'' for the United States, especially in light of al-\nQaida's expressed desire to obtain nuclear material or weapons.\n  H.R. 1 cuts more than $600 million from the Global Threat Reduction \nInitiative, which seeks to secure nuclear material before it ends up in \nterrorist hands. These program cuts are not only irresponsible, they \nare negligent.\n  Nonproliferation programs are a vital part of our Nation's security \nand should be treated as such. This view is shared by former Presidents \nand national security experts and has been included in our National \nSecurity Strategy that was developed by various agencies, including the \nDepartments of Defense, State and Energy, as well as the National \nSecurity Council. In a July 14, 2010 letter to the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, former Secretary of \nState George Shultz and former Chair of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee Sam Nunn wrote that they ``believe the threat of nuclear \nterrorism remains urgent, fueled by the spread of nuclear weapons, \nmaterials and technology around the world.'' They further concluded \nthat it ``is absolutely essential'' for the United States and Russia to \nlead these efforts.\n  I urge my colleagues today for their support in ensuring that we do \nall we can to limit the ability of terrorists to get their hands on \nfissile material. We all recognize and have referred to this threat. \nAnd now we have an opportunity to do something about it. Nuclear \nproliferation is a top concern and we as a nation can effectively lead \nthe world in nuclear security and decrease the threat posed by nuclear \nterrorism.\n\n[[Page S2187]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2187-1", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       FREDDIE AND ERNEST TAVARES\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I congratulate Hawaiian music \nlegends Frederick ``Freddie'' and Ernest Tavares for receiving the \nLifetime Achievement Award from the Hawaii Academy of Recording Arts in \nrecognition of their contributions to the music industry.\n  Born and raised on the island of Maui, Freddie and Ernest Tavares \nexhibited musical talent at an early age. Both men enjoyed long careers \nin music and played important roles in popularizing Hawaiian music \nacross the United States.\n  As a musician, Ernest did it all. He was a singer-songwriter, \narranger, and inventor. His innovations led to the creation of the \nmodern pedal steel guitar, which he played with the Harry Owens Royal \nHawaiian Orchestra, Paul Page's South Sea Serenade, and T. Texas Tyler \n& His Western Dance Band. He also played the electric bass, ukulele, \nflute, clarinet, saxophone, piano, and Hawaiian & Tahitian drums.\n  Freddie Tavares, Ernest's younger brother, shared this love of music \nand innovation. Collaborating with guitar legend Leo Fender, Freddie \nplayed an important role in designing the Fender Stratocaster, a guitar \nthat is the standard for many rock musicians. His work and dedication \nearned him induction into the Steel Guitar Hall of Fame and the Fender \nHall of Fame. Freddie also performed with many notable artists, such as \nBing Crosby, Elvis Presley, Dean Martin, the Andrews Sisters, and Henry \nMancini.\n  Throughout their musical careers, Freddie and Ernest Tavares \nperformed in many record albums and movie soundtracks. Both brothers \nalso collaborated in numerous performances and shows. Their many \ntalents and innovations had a great impact on the music industry and \nmade Hawaii proud.\n  Long before being elected to Congress, I taught music and band in \nHawaii's schools, and I am honored to recognize Freddie and Ernest for \ntheir numerous and invaluable accomplishments in the music business. \nAlthough both brothers are no longer with us, I extend my aloha and \nsincere thanks to the Tavares family for keeping the legacy of Freddie \nand Ernest Tavares alive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2187-2", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2187-3", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/04/06/senate-section/article/S2187-4", "month": "04", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 10:09 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 4.

A bill to authorize the Architect of the Capitol to establish \nbattery recharging stations for privately owned vehicles in parking \nareas under the jurisdiction of the Senate at no net cost to the \nFederal Government; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today a bipartisan group of Senators has \nintroduced legislation that would allow the Senate to continue its \nleadership of our country toward a clean-energy future. Senators \nSchumer, Alexander, Kerry, Murkowski, Bingaman, and I have introduced a \nbill that would authorize the Architect of the Capitol to establish \nbattery recharging stations for privately owned vehicles in parking \nareas under the jurisdiction of the Senate at no net cost to the \nFederal Government.\n  Among the most successful job-creation efforts we have undertaken \nsince the financial crisis devastated our economy is our attempt to \nhelp American manufacturers create the batteries and other components \nthat will power the next generation of electric-powered vehicles. In my \nState of Michigan and in other places around the country, the grant \nprogram we enacted as part of the Recovery Act has sparked a boom of \nmanufacturing job creation. Given a choice between watching our global \ncompetitors create those jobs and creating them in the United States, \nwe have chosen the wiser course.\n  This has been part of a larger, and largely successful, effort to \nsupport the electric revolution in transportation. President Obama's \ngoal of 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 is one part of \nthat effort. He announced last week that by 2015, the government will \nbuy only alternative-energy vehicles for its fleets as part of a \nstrategy to cut U.S. oil imports by 1/3. Such a strategy would help our \ncountry economically, protect our environment and enhance our national \nsecurity.\n  The legislation we introduce today is another, though smaller, part \nof that effort. It would ensure that the Senate leads by example as we \ntransition to a clean-energy future. It would establish--at no net cost \nto the taxpayer--charging stations to power plug-in hybrid electric \nvehicles. While these vehicles are an important part of our future, \nthey will bring changes in how we think about cars and driving. Instead \nof looking for gas stations, drivers will need charging stations where \nthey can replenish the batteries that power their vehicles.\n  The President and others have proposed plans to help encourage the \ncreation of that infrastructure in communities around the country. So \nshould the Senate. This bill would ensure that Senate employees have \navailable the infrastructure to support next-generation vehicles. It \nwould be an important statement of leadership from the Senate.

A bill to revise and extend provisions under the Garrett Lee \nSmith Memorial Act; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Murkowski, Durbin, \nand Tom Udall in the introduction of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act \nReauthorization.\n  This legislation continues the important work of my former colleague \nSenator Gordon Smith, who authored the original law, which was named \nfor his 22-year old son, Garrett, who was a student at Utah Valley \nUniversity when he took his own life. I want to once again recognize \nGordon Smith for his work to champion suicide prevention and mental \nhealth initiatives.\n  Currently, this law supports 35 States, 16 Tribes and Tribal \norganizations, and 38 colleges and universities in their efforts to \nprevent youth suicide. Indeed, with the help of these important \nprograms, we have made real progress since the 2004 passage of this law \nin identifying at-risk youth and young adults, providing proven mental \nhealth and substance use disorder treatments, and educating the public \nabout youth suicide prevention efforts.\n  Unfortunately, suicide remains the third leading cause of death for \nadolescents and young adults age 10 to 24, and results in 4,400 lives \nlost each year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, approximately 150,000 individuals in this age group \nannually receive medical care for self-inflicted injuries at Emergency \nDepartments across the U.S.\n  Suicide is particularly prevalent among college-age students as it is \nthe second leading cause of death, resulting in approximately 1,100 \ndeaths each year. The 2010 National Survey of Counseling Center \nDirectors at colleges and universities found that 10.8 percent of \nstudents seek counseling each year, an increase of nearly 1 percent \nfrom 2009. At the same time, the average ratio of counselors to \nstudents has remained constant at one to 1,786.\n  Many young people who commit suicide have a treatable mental illness, \nbut they don't get the help they need. The legislation we introduced \ntoday provides critical resources for prevention and outreach programs \nto reach at risk youth before it is too late.\n  It would increase the authorized grant level to States, tribes, and \ncollege campuses for the implementation of proven programs and \ninitiatives designed to address mental health and wellness and reduce \nyouth suicide.\n  Additionally, I am particularly pleased that the bill would enable \ncollege counseling centers to have greater flexibility in their use of \nFederal resources. Counseling centers will continue to be able to apply \nfor funds to operate suicide prevention hotlines and organize \neducational and awareness efforts about youth suicide prevention; \nhowever, with this bill they will also be able to use funds for the \nprovision of counseling services to students and the hiring of \nappropriately trained personnel. These two components are integral to \nidentifying and treating students who may be at risk with the goal of \npreventing suicide and attempted suicide on campuses.\n  Our bipartisan legislation is supported by 43 coalition members of \nthe Mental Health Liaison Group and the American Council on Education.\n  Mr. President, I unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a \nletter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 740\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Tom Udall,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: The undersigned organizations in the Mental \n     Health Liaison Group are pleased to write in support of the \n     legislation you will soon introduce, the Garrett Lee Smith \n     Memorial Act Reauthorization of 2011. This legislation renews \n     the commitment to critically important youth and college \n     suicide prevention programs administered by the Substance \n     Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, as well as \n     strengthens those programs, ensuring they are best designed \n     to meet the needs of those they are intended to serve.\n       The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act (GLSMA) currently \n     supports grants in 35 States and 16 Tribes or Tribal \n     organizations as part of the State/Tribal Youth Suicide \n     Prevention and Early Intervention Program as well as funds \n     programs at 38 institutions of higher education through the \n     Campus Suicide Prevention program. While much has been \n     achieved thanks to the successful grants supported by the \n     GLSMA, there remains much to do. In 2007, suicide was the \n     third leading cause of death for young people ages 15-24 \n     years and the second leading cause of death among college \n     students. According to the Center for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, ``a nationwide survey of youth in\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\n     grades 9-12 in public and private schools in the United \n     States (U.S.) found that 15% of students reported seriously \n     considering suicide, 11% reported creating a plan, and 7% \n     reporting trying to take their own life in the 12 months \n     preceding the survey.'' The 2010 American College Health \n     Association's National College Health Assessment II noted \n     that 45.6% of students surveyed reported feeling that things \n     were hopeless and 30.7% reported feeling so depressed it was \n     difficult to function during the past 12 months.\n       Since its creation in 2004, the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial \n     Act has provided resources to communities and college \n     campuses all across the country, and supported needed \n     technical assistance to develop and disseminate effective \n     strategies and best practices related to youth suicide \n     prevention.\n       Our organizations support all three elements of the GLSMA, \n     which provide a comprehensive approach to addressing the \n     national problem of youth suicide. Specifically, the State \n     and Tribal program fosters the creation of public-private \n     collaborations and the development of critically needed \n     prevention and early intervention strategies. Next, the \n     Campus Suicide Prevention Program enhances services, outreach \n     and education for students with mental health or substance \n     use disorders and calls for the development of best practice \n     for the delivery of such services. Finally, the Suicide \n     Prevention Resource Center provides information and training \n     to States, Tribes, and tribal organizations, institutions of \n     higher education, and public organizations or private non-\n     profit groups in an effort to prevent suicide among all ages, \n     particularly among high risk groups, such as youth.\n       We are especially pleased that you have included modest but \n     needed growth in the authorization levels for these programs. \n     This measured increase acknowledges the important efforts \n     that have come from the development of these programs as well \n     as the significant work that remains to build suicide \n     prevention capacity across the country.\n       Our organizations are grateful to you and your colleagues \n     for your strong bipartisan approach regarding this program. \n     We thank Senators Murkowski, Durbin and Tom Udall for joining \n     with you in support of this effort and demonstrating \n     extraordinary leadership on youth suicide prevention.\n       We are most grateful to you and your staff for your \n     tireless work on this legislation over the past years. Your \n     unwavering leadership and commitment to youth suicide \n     prevention undoubtedly has important implications for the \n     current and future health and wellbeing of our nation's \n     youth. We welcome the opportunity to work with you and your \n     staff to ensure that the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act is \n     promptly reauthorized.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, \n     American Art Therapy Association, American Association for \n     Geriatric Psychiatry, American Association for Marriage and \n     Family Therapy, American Association for Psychoanalysis in \n     Clinical Social Work, American Association of Pastoral \n     Counselors, American Association on Health and Disability*, \n     American Counseling Association, American Dance Therapy \n     Association, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention/SPAN \n     USA, American Group Psychotherapy Association, American \n     Orthopsychiatric Association, American Psychiatric \n     Association, American Psychoanalytic Association, American \n     Psychological Association.\n       American Psychotherapy Association, Association for \n     Ambulatory Behavioral Healthcare, Association for the \n     Advancement of Psychology, American Psychiatric Nurses \n     Association, Anxiety Disorders Association of America, \n     Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, Center for Clinical \n     Social Work, Clinical Social Work Association, Depression and \n     Bipolar Support Alliance, Eating Disorders Coalition for \n     Research, Policy & Action, Mental Health America, NAADAC, the \n     Association for Addiction Professionals, National Association \n     of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability \n     Directors, National Association of State Mental Health \n     Program Directors, National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n       National Association for Children's Behavioral Health, \n     National Association for Rural Mental Health, National \n     Association of Mental Health Planning & Advisory Councils, \n     National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems, National \n     Association of School Psychologists, National Association of \n     Social Workers, National Coalition for Mental Health \n     Recovery, National Council for Community Behavioral \n     Healthcare, National Council on Problem Gambling, School \n     Social Work Association of America, Therapeutic Communities \n     of America, Tourette Syndrome Association, U.S. Psychiatric \n     Rehabilitation Association, Witness Justice.\n\n     * not a MHLG member\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, three years ago, a mentally disturbed \ngunman walked into a campus lecture hall at Northern Illinois \nUniversity and shot 22 students, killing 5 of them. Northern Illinois \nUniversity is not the first college to experience this kind of tragedy. \nWe all remember the horrific events at Virginia Tech in 2007 where 32 \nlives were taken by a gunman.\n  In the aftermath of these shootings, we asked what could have been \ndone to prevent it. And years later, we are still trying to make sense \nof it. Some believe nothing can be done to stop a disturbed person from \ncommitting acts of violence. But I believe we can and should do more.\n  For a long time, we have overlooked the mental health needs of \nstudents on college campuses. We know now that many mental illnesses \nstart to manifest in this period when young people leave the security \nof home and regular medical care. The responsibility for the students' \nwell-being often shifts from parents to students, and the students \naren't always completely prepared. It is easier for a young person's \nproblems to go unnoticed when he or she is away at college than when \nthey are at home, in the company of parents, old friends, and high \nschool teachers. College also provides a new opportunity for young \npeople to experiment with drugs or alcohol.\n  The consequences of not detecting or addressing mental health needs \namong students are real. Suicide remains the third leading cause of \ndeath for adolescents and young adults between ages 10-24. Suicide \ntakes the lives of more young adults than AIDS, cancer, heart disease, \npneumonia, birth defects, and influenza combined. Forty-five percent of \ncollege students report having felt so depressed that it was difficult \nto function. Ten percent have contemplated suicide. There are over \n1,000 suicides on college campus each year. These heartbreaking and \ntraumatic incidents demonstrate the tragic consequences of mental \ninstability and help us recognize we need to do more to support \nstudents during what can be very tough years.\n  Fortunately, many students can succeed in college if they have \nappropriate counseling services and access to needed medications. These \nservices make a real impact. Students who seek help are six times less \nlikely to kill themselves. Colleges are welcoming students today who 10 \nor 20 years ago would not have been able to attend school due to mental \nillness, but who can today because of advances in treatment.\n  But while the needs for mental health services on campus are rising, \ncolleges are facing financial pressures and having trouble meeting this \ndemand. As I have travelled around my State, I have learned just how \nthin colleges and universities are stretched when it comes to providing \ncounseling and other support services to students.\n  Take Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. SIUC has 8 full-time \ncounselors for 20,000 students. That is 1 counselor for every 2,500 \nstudents. The recommended ratio is 1 counselor for every 1,500 \nstudents. And there is another problem. Like many rural communities, \nCarbondale only has one community mental health agency. That agency is \noverwhelmed by the mental health needs of the community and refuses to \nserve students from SIUC. The campus counseling center is the only \nmental health option for students. The eight hard-working counselors at \nSIUC do their best under impossible conditions. They triage students \nwho come in seeking help so that the ones who might be a threat to \nthemselves or others are seen first. The waitlist of students seeking \nservices has reached 45 students.\n  The story is the same across the country. Colleges are trying to fill \nin the gaps, but because of the shortage of counselors, students' needs \nare overlooked. A recent survey of college counseling centers indicates \nthat the average ratio of professional-staff-to-students is 1 to 1,900. \nAlthough interest in mental health services is high, the recession has \nput pressure on administrators to cut budgets wherever they can. At \ntimes, counseling centers are in the crosshairs. Ten percent of survey \nrespondents said their budgets were cut during the 2007-8 academic \nyear, half said their budgets stayed the same, and nearly a quarter \nreported that their funds increased by 3 percent or less.\n  With so many students looking for help and so few counselors to see \nthem, counseling centers have to cut back on outreach. Without \noutreach, the chances of finding students who need help but don't ask \nfor it goes down. This is a serious problem. We know that some students \nexhibit warning signs of a tortured mental state and four out of five \nyoung adults show warning signs before attempting suicide. But faculty \nand students don't always know how or where to express their concerns. \nOutreach efforts by\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\ncampus counseling centers can help educate the community about warning \nsigns to look for as well as how to intervene. Of the students who \ncommitted suicide across the country in 2007, only 22 percent had \nreceived counseling on campus. That means that of the 1,000 college \nstudents who took their own lives, 800 may never have looked for help. \nHow many of those young lives could have been saved if our college \ncounseling centers had the resources they needed to identify those \nstudents and help them? Our students deserve better.\n  We need to help schools meet the needs of their students, and that is \nwhy I am an original cosponsor of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act \nReauthorization. This bill includes an important provision of the \nMental Health on Campus Improvement Act, which I introduced last \nCongress that would increase funding for colleges and universities to \nimprove their mental health services. Colleges could use the funding to \nhire personnel, increase outreach, and educate the campus community \nabout mental health. The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act Reauthorization \nwould provide States, tribes/tribal organizations, and universities \nwith much needed resources to prevent suicide.\n  Reflecting on the loss of his own son, the well-known minister Rev. \nWilliam Sloan Coffin once said, ``When parents die, they take with them \na portion of the past. But when children die, they take away the future \nas well.'' I hope the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act will help prevent \nthe unnecessary loss of more young lives and bright futures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Pryor, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Tester, Mr. Begich, \n        and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 743. A bill to amend chapter 23 of title 5, United States Code, to \nclarify the disclosures of information protected from prohibited \npersonnel practices, require a statement in nondisclosure policies, \nforms, and agreements that such policies, forms, and agreements conform \nwith certain disclosure protections, provide certain authority for the \nSpecial Counsel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce the \nwhistleblower Protection Enhancement Act. I am pleased that Senators \nCollins, Grassley, Lieberman, Levin, Carper, Leahy, Harkin, Pryor, \nLandrieu, McCaskill, Tester, Begich, and Cardin have joined as \ncosponsors of this bill.\n  The need for stronger whistleblower protections is clear. As we \nslowly recover from the deepest recession since the Great Depression, \nand grapple with unsustainable budget deficits, we cannot wait to act \non measures to make sure the government uses taxpayer money efficiently \nand effectively.\n  This legislation will help us hold those who manage the public's \ndollars accountable by strengthening protections for Federal employees \nwho shed light on government waste, fraud, and abuse. Studies have \nshown that employee whistleblowers are responsible for uncovering more \nfraud than auditors, internal compliance officers, and law enforcement \nofficials combined. As an example of the type of disclosures we need to \nencourage, in one of the few cases in which a whistleblower prevailed, \nan Internal Revenue Service manager disclosed alleged fraud and \npreferential treatment of certain wealthy and influential taxpayers. \nThe Merit Systems Protection Board denied his claim, but five years \nafter the whistleblower retaliation occurred, the Court of Appeals \nreversed. Ensuring that dedicated civil servants can come forward and \nreport wrongdoing without facing retaliation is an important step for \nsaving taxpayer dollars, reducing the deficit, and improving our \ncountry's long-term economic health.\n  Our bill also will contribute to public health and safety, civil \nrights and civil liberties, national security, and other critical \ninterests. Federal employees may be the only people in the position to \nobserve a problem with a drug safety trial, a cover up of violations \nduring a food inspection, overreach in Federal law enforcement, or \nsafety concerns at a nuclear plant. But few employees will have the \ncourage to disclose Federal Government wrongdoing, which can affect \nevery aspect of government operations, without meaningful whistleblower \nprotections.\n  The Whistleblower Protection Act, WPA, was intended to shield Federal \nwhistleblowers from retaliation, but the Court of Appeals or the \nFederal Circuit and the Merit Systems Protection Board repeatedly have \nissued decisions that misconstrue the WPA and scale back its \nprotections. Federal whistleblowers have prevailed on the merits of \ntheir claims before the Federal Circuit which has sole jurisdiction \nover Federal employee whistleblower appeals, only three times in \nhundreds of cases since 1994. correction is urgently needed.\n  Our bill would eliminate a number of restrictions that the Federal \nCircuit has read into the law regarding when disclosures are covered by \nthe WPA. Because of the Federal Circuit's restrictive reading of the \nWPA, it would establish a pilot program to allow multi-circuit review \nfor 5 years, and would require a Government Accountability Office \nreview of that change 40 months after enactment. This bill would also \nbar agencies from revoking an employee's security clearance in \nretaliation for whistleblowing.\n  Additionally, this bill expands coverage to new groups of \nwhistleblowers. This bill would expand the coverage of the \nWhistleblower Protection Act to include employees of the Transportation \nSecurity Administration. Intelligence Community employees for the first \ntime would be protected as well, with an administrative process modeled \non the protections for Federal Bureau of Investigations employees. \nMoreover, it would make clear that whistleblowers who disclose \ncensorship of scientific information that could lead to gross \ngovernment waste or mismanagement, danger to public health or safety, \nor a violation of law are protected.\n  I have been a long-time proponent of strengthening oversight by \nprotecting Federal whistleblowers. Last Congress, my Whistleblower \nProtection Enhancement Act, S. 372, passed both the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives by unanimous consent in December 2010. In the \n110th Congress, my bill, the Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures \nAct, S. 274, passed the Senate by unanimous consent in December 2007, \nand a similar bill, H.R. 985, also passed in the House of \nRepresentatives in March 2008. Unfortunately, both times, we were not \nable to reconcile the two bills and enact whistleblower protections \nbefore the Congress adjourned. I intend to finish the job this \nCongress. Whistleblowers simply cannot wait any longer.\n  Congress has a duty to provide strong protections for Federal \nwhistleblowers. Only when Federal employees are confident that they \nwill not face retaliation will they feel comfortable coming forward to \ndisclose information that can be used to improve government operations, \nour national security, and the health of our citizens.

A bill to authorize certain Department of State personnel, \nwho are responsible for examining and processing United States passport \napplications, to access relevant information in Federal, State, and \nother records and databases, for the purpose of verifying the identity \nof a passport applicant and detecting passport fraud, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this weekend I know that Marylanders will \nbe taking advantage of Passport Day this Saturday, April 9. During \nthese weekend hours at our passport acceptance facilities in Maryland, \nmy constituents will have the ability to renew their passports or apply \nfor a new passport, as we get ready for the summer travel season.\n  When Marylanders apply for and ultimately receive their passports, I \nwant them to continue to have confidence that the U.S. passport is the \ngold standard for identification. It certifies\n\n[[Page S2202]]\n\nan individual's identity and U.S. citizenship, and allows the passport \nholder to travel in and out of the United States and to foreign \ncountries. It allows the passport holder to obtain further \nidentification documents, and to set up bank accounts.\n  The U.S. Government simply cannot allow U.S. passports to be issued \nin this country on the basis of fraudulent documents. There is too much \nat stake. Unfortunately, hearings that I have chaired in the last \nCongress have convinced me that we have serious vulnerabilities in our \npassport issuance process that need to be closed quickly.\n  Nearly two years ago, on May 5, 2009, I chaired a Judiciary Terrorism \nSubcommittee hearing entitled ``The Passport Issuance Process: Closing \nthe Door to Fraud.'' During the hearing last year, we learned about a \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, undercover investigation that \nhad been requested by Senators Kyl and Feinstein to test the \neffectiveness of the passport issuance process, and to determine \nwhether malicious individuals such as terrorists, spies, or other \ncriminals could use counterfeit documents to obtain a genuine U.S. \npassport. What we learned from GAO was that ``terrorists or criminals \ncould steal an American citizen's identity, use basic counterfeiting \nskills to create fraudulent documents for that identity, and obtain a \ngenuine U.S. passport.'' But that 2009 GAO report was not the first \ntime that problems with the passport issuance process were identified. \nIn 2005 and 2007, GAO also brought these issues to light.\n  Vulnerabilities in the passport issuance process are very serious \nbecause it can have a profound impact on the national security of the \nUnited States.\n  A new GAO undercover investigation that I requested, along with \nSenators Kyl, Feinstein, Lieberman and Collins, also revealed that \nwhile some improvements have been made by the State Department, the \npassport issuance process is still susceptible to fraud. A Judiciary \nTerrorism Subcommittee hearing that I chaired in July of 2010 revealed \nthat the State Department issued five additional passports on the basis \nof fraudulent identity documents that had been submitted by undercover \nGAO agents.\n  As a result, today I am reintroducing the Passport Identity \nVerification Act, or PIVA. This legislation is co-sponsored by Senators \nFeinstein, Lieberman, and Kerry. It is a common-sense solution that \nwill give the State Department the legal authorities that it needs to \naccess relevant information contained in federal, state, and other \ndatabases that can be used to verify the identity of every passport \napplicant, and to detect passport fraud, without extending the time \nthat the State Department takes to approve passports. The legislation \nalso requires the State Department to promulgate regulations to limit \naccess to this information, and to ensure that personnel involved in \nthe passport issuance process only access this information for \nauthorized purposes. These are very important privacy and security \nprotections in this legislation.\n  The legislation also requires the Secretary of State to conduct a \nformal study examining whether biometric information and technology can \nbe used to enhance the ability to verify the identity of a passport \napplicant and to detect passport fraud.\n  I understand that the American people can become concerned when their \ntravel plans, whether for leisure or business, are linked to their \nability to obtain a passport in a timely fashion. My legislation would \nnot lengthen the average amount of time it takes U.S. citizens to \nobtain passports. We have got to get this right, and it is not simply a \nquestion of process, techniques, and training. We need to make sure \nthat the agencies that are responsible for processing passport \napplication documents are concerned about national security as well as \ncustomer service, and we need to make sure they have the legal \nauthorities, the resources, and the technology they need to verify the \nidentity of a passport applicant and to detect passport fraud.\n  We already have much of the technology and the information to prevent \nsuch issuance of genuine U.S. passports based on fraudulent documents \nor information. The Passport Identity Verification Act will \ndramatically improve the State Department's ability to detect passport \nfraud, and strengthen the integrity of every American's passport.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Franken, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Merkley, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 749.

FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n       (a) Undermining of Democracy by Campaign Contributions From \n     Private Sources.--The Senate finds and declares that the \n     current system of privately financed campaigns for election \n     to the United States Senate has the capacity, and is often \n     perceived by the public, to undermine democracy in the United \n     States by--\n       (1) creating a culture that fosters actual or perceived \n     conflicts of interest by encouraging Senators to accept large \n     campaign contributions from private interests that are \n     directly affected by Federal legislation;\n       (2) diminishing or appearing to diminish Senators' \n     accountability to constituents by compelling legislators to \n     be accountable to the major contributors who finance their \n     election campaigns;\n       (3) undermining the meaning of the right to vote by \n     allowing monied interests to have a disproportionate and \n     unfair influence within the political process;\n       (4) imposing large, unwarranted costs on taxpayers through \n     legislative and regulatory distortions caused by unequal \n     access to lawmakers for campaign contributors;\n       (5) making it difficult for some qualified candidates to \n     mount competitive Senate election campaigns;\n       (6) disadvantaging challengers and discouraging competitive \n     elections; and\n       (7) burdening incumbents with a preoccupation with \n     fundraising and thus decreasing the time available to carry \n     out their public responsibilities.\n       (b) Enhancement of Democracy by Providing Allocations From \n     the Fair Elections Fund.--The Senate finds and declares that \n     providing the option of the replacement of large private \n     campaign contributions with allocations from the Fair \n     Elections Fund for all primary, runoff, and general elections \n     to the Senate would enhance American democracy by--\n       (1) reducing the actual or perceived conflicts of interest \n     created by fully private financing of the election campaigns \n     of public officials and restoring public confidence in the \n     integrity and fairness of the electoral and legislative \n     processes through a program which allows participating \n     candidates to adhere to substantially lower contribution \n     limits for contributors with an assurance that there will be \n     sufficient funds for such candidates to run viable electoral \n     campaigns;\n       (2) increasing the public's confidence in the \n     accountability of Senators to the constituents who elect \n     them, which derives from the program's qualifying criteria to \n     participate in the voluntary program and the conclusions that \n     constituents may draw regarding candidates who qualify and \n     participate in the program;\n       (3) helping to reduce the ability to make large campaign \n     contributions as a determinant of a citizen's influence \n     within the political process by facilitating the expression \n     of support by voters at every level of wealth, encouraging \n     political participation, and incentivizing participation on \n     the part of Senators through the matching of small dollar \n     contributions;\n       (4) potentially saving taxpayers billions of dollars that \n     may be (or that are perceived to be) currently allocated \n     based upon legislative and regulatory agendas skewed by the \n     influence of campaign contributions;\n       (5) creating genuine opportunities for all Americans to run \n     for the Senate and encouraging more competitive elections;\n       (6) encouraging participation in the electoral process by \n     citizens of every level of wealth; and\n       (7) freeing Senators from the incessant preoccupation with \n     raising money, and allowing them more time to carry out their \n     public responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 102.

A bill to establish a comprehensive interagency response to \nreduce lung cancer mortality in a timely manner; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to call for a new effort to \ncombat an often deadly form of cancer--by re-introducing the Lung \nCancer Mortality Reduction Act. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncosponsors, Senator Isakson and Senator Kerry on this very important \nbill.\n  This bill will renew and improve Federal government's efforts to \ncombat lung cancer. It will: set a goal to reduce lung cancer mortality \nby 50 percent by 2020; establish a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction \nProgram, with comprehensive interagency coordination, to develop and \nimplement a plan to meet this goal; improve disparity programs to \nensure that the burdens of lung cancer on minority populations are \naddressed; create a computed tomography screening demonstration project \nbased on recent science; and establish a Lung Cancer Advisory Board, \nwhich will provide an annual report to Congress on the progress of the \nMortality Reduction Program.\n  We have made great strides against many types of cancer in the last \nseveral decades. However, these gains are uneven.\n  When the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971, lung cancer had a 5-\nyear survival rate of only 12 percent. After decades of research \nefforts and scientific advances, this survival rate remains only 15 \npercent.\n  In contrast, the 5 year survival rates of breast, prostate, and colon \ncancer have risen to 89, 99 and 65 percent respectively.\n  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and \nwomen, accounting for 28 percent of all cancer deaths.\n  Lung cancer causes more deaths annually than: colon cancer, breast \ncancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer combined.\n  A National Cancer Institute study in 2009 indicated that the value of \nlife lost to lung cancer will exceed $433 billion annually by 2020.\n  A four percent annual decline in mortality would reduce this amount \nby more than half.\n  A lung cancer diagnosis can be devastating. The average life \nexpectancy following a lung cancer diagnosis is only 9 months.\n  This is because far too many patients are not diagnosed with lung \ncancer until it has progressed to the later stages. Lung cancer can be \nhard to diagnose, and symptoms may at first appear to be other \nillnesses, such as bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, \nor asthma.\n  As a result, only 16 percent of lung cancer patients are diagnosed \nwhen their cancer is still localized, and is the most treatable.\n  When I introduced this legislation in 2009, lung cancer lacked early \ndetection technology, to find the cancer when it was most treatable. \nNow, however, preliminary results show a screening method with a \ndemonstrated reduction in mortality for lung cancer.\n  In 2010, the National Cancer Institute released initial results from \nthe National Lung Screening Trial, a large-scale study of screening \nmethods to detect lung cancers at earlier stages.\n  The National Lung Screening Trial found a 20 percent reduction in \nlung cancer mortality among participants screened with the computed \ntomography screening versus a traditional X-ray.\n  This is the first time that researchers have seen evidence of a \nsignificant reduction in lung cancer mortality with a screening test.\n  This is why this legislation also includes the creation of a computed \ntomography screening demonstration project, to assess public health \nneeds of screening for lung cancer, and develop the most effective, \nsafe, equitable, and efficient process to maximize the benefit of \nscreening.\n  Efforts to fight lung cancer lag behind other cancers, in part, due \nto stigma from smoking. Make no mistake, tobacco use causes the \nmajority of lung cancer cases.\n  Tobacco cessation is a critical component of reducing lung cancer \nmortality. Less smoking means less lung cancer. Period.\n  But tobacco use does not fully explain lung cancer. Approximately 20 \npercent of lung cancer patients never smoked.\n  Two-thirds of individuals diagnosed with lung cancer who have never \nsmoked are women.\n  60 percent of lung cancer patients are former smokers who quit, often \ndecades ago.\n  These patients may have been exposed to second hand smoke, or they \nmay have been exposed to radon, asbestos, chromium, or other chemicals. \nThere could be other causes and associations that have not yet been \ndiscovered, genetic predispositions or other environmental exposures.\n  The President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report of 2010 \nidentified radon as the second leading cause of lung cancer after \nsmoking and listed 15 other environmental contaminants strongly \nassociated with lung cancer.\n  I believe that we have the expertise and technology to make serious \nprogress against this deadly cancer, and to reach the goal of halving \nlung cancer mortality by 2020.\n  We need this legislation to ensure that our government's resources \nare focused on this mission in the most efficient way possible.\n  Agency efforts must be coordinated, and all sectors of the federal \ngovernment that may have some ideas to lend should be participating. \nThat is what the Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program will \naccomplish.\n  In this bill the Secretary of Health and Human Services is tasked to \nwork\n\n[[Page S2209]]\n\nin consultation with Secretaries and Directors from the Department of \nDefense, Veterans Affairs, the National Institutes of Health, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, and Food and Drug \nAdministration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, and the National \nCenter on Minority Health and Health Disparities.\n  This means that each agency with an expertise on lungs, imaging, and \ncancer will be included in this long overdue process.\n  We can do better for Americans diagnosed with lung cancer. I ask my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 752\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lung Cancer Mortality \n     Reduction Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for \n     both men and women, accounting for 28 percent of all cancer \n     deaths.\n       (2) The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2010, \n     there were 222,520 new diagnosis of lung cancer and 157,300 \n     deaths attributed to the disease.\n       (3) According to projections published in the Journal of \n     Clinical Oncology in 2009, between 2010 and 2030, the \n     incidence of lung cancer will increase by 46 percent for \n     women and by 58 percent for men. The increase in the \n     incidence of lung cancer among minority communities during \n     that time period will range from 74 percent to 191 percent.\n       (4) Lung cancer causes more deaths annually than the next 4 \n     leading causes of cancer deaths, colon cancer, breast cancer, \n     prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer, combined.\n       (5) The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 15 \n     percent, while the 5-year survival rate for breast cancer is \n     89 percent, for prostate cancer 99 percent, and for colon \n     cancer 65 percent. Yet in research dollars per death, lung \n     cancer is the least funded of the major cancers.\n       (6) In 2001, the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the \n     National Cancer Institute stated that funding for lung cancer \n     research was ``far below the levels characterized for other \n     common malignancies and far out of proportion to its massive \n     health impact'' and it gave the ``highest priority'' to the \n     creation of an integrated multidisciplinary, multi-\n     institutional research program. No comprehensive plan has \n     been developed.\n       (7) While smoking is the leading risk factor for lung \n     cancer, the President's National Cancer Advisory Board Report \n     of 2010 identified radon as the second leading cause of lung \n     cancer and listed 15 other environmental contaminants \n     strongly association with lung cancer, and there is \n     accumulating evidence that hormonal and genetic factors may \n     influence the onset.\n       (8) Lung cancer is the most stigmatized of all the cancers \n     and the only cancer blamed on patients, whether they smoked \n     or not.\n       (9) Nearly 20 percent of lung cancer patients have never \n     smoked. Sixty percent of individuals diagnosed with lung \n     cancer are former smokers who quit, often decades ago.\n       (10) Lung cancer in men and women who never smoked is the \n     sixth leading cause of cancer death. Of individuals diagnosed \n     with lung cancer who have never smoked, \\2/3\\ of are women.\n       (11) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in \n     the overall population and in every major ethnic grouping, \n     including white, African American, Hispanic, Asian and \n     Pacific Islander, American Indian, and Alaskan Native, with \n     an even disproportionately higher impact on African American \n     males that has not been addressed.\n       (12) Military personnel, veterans, and munitions workers \n     exposed to carcinogens such as Agent Orange, crystalline \n     forms of silica, arsenic, uranium, beryllium, and battlefield \n     fuel emissions have increased risk for lung cancer.\n       (13) Only 16 percent of lung cancer is being diagnosed at \n     an early stage and there were no targets for the early \n     detection or treatment of lung cancer included in the \n     Department of Health and Human Services's ``Healthy People \n     2010'' or ``Healthy People 2020''.\n       (14) An actuarial analysis carried out by Milliman Inc. and \n     published in Population Health Management Journal in 2009 \n     indicated that early detection of lung cancer could save more \n     than 70,000 lives a year in the United States.\n       (15) A National Cancer Institute study in 2009 indicated \n     that while the value of life lost to lung cancer will exceed \n     $433,000,000,000 a year by 2020, a 4 percent annual decline \n     in lung cancer mortality would reduce that amount by more \n     than half.\n       (16) In 2010, the National Cancer Institute released \n     initial results from the National Lung Screening Trial, a \n     large-scale randomized national trial that compared the \n     effect of low-dose helical computed tomography (``CT'') and a \n     standard chest x-ray on lung cancer mortality. The study \n     found 20 percent fewer lung cancer deaths among study \n     participants screened with the CT scan.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING INVESTMENT IN LUNG \n                   CANCER RESEARCH.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) lung cancer mortality reduction should be made a \n     national public health priority; and\n       (2) a comprehensive mortality reduction program coordinated \n     by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is justified \n     and necessary to adequately address all aspects of lung \n     cancer and reduce lung cancer mortality among current \n     smokers, former smokers, and non-smokers.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on my pay-for-war \nresolution, which I am submitting today. This resolution would change \nthe way we pay for war spending, and it would change the way we \ndeliberate about going to war.\n  This is not a symbolic resolution. It would return us to the \ntraditional American way of paying for wars, where the Congress and the \nNation confront head-on the financial cost, commitment, and sacrifice \nof going to war. This is something I believe in strongly. It is an \nissue I have been working on for months. This did not start with Libya, \nthough Libya certainly gives it a new urgency.\n  A number of my friends on both sides of the aisle have expressed \nconcerns about the potential costs of the war in Libya, but this \nresolution is broader than Libya. It is about how we are going to pay \nfor any wars in the future. The resolution seeks to reestablish a \nfiscally responsible way of paying for our wars.\n  It is fiscally responsible because it would require that war spending \nbe paid for or offset, as we say in the Senate. It is also morally and \npolitically responsible because it would reestablish the connection \nbetween the citizenry of the United States and the cost of going to \nwar--a burden that is now shared solely by the men and women of the \nmilitary and their families, while the rest is passed on to future \ngenerations in the form of debt.\n  Over the last 10 years, our wars have been paid for by borrowing, \nmostly from China and other countries willing to finance our debt, and \nby giant emergency spending bills. That is unusual in American history \nand, frankly, my resolution is aimed at making sure it stays unusual. \nIraq and Afghanistan have cost us well over $1 trillion. In fact, the \nCongressional Research Service's most recent estimate is that, \nincluding this fiscal year, Congress will have approved $1 \\1/4\\ \ntrillion for Iraq and Afghanistan--$806 billion for Iraq and $444 \nbillion for Afghanistan.\n  That is a staggering sum of money, and it has been financed through \ndebt, through borrowing from other countries, and emergency \nsupplemental spending bills which go on our debt. What is more, the \nIraq war was accompanied by a massive tax cut. That failed fiscal \nexperiment created the impression that going to war requires no \nfinancial sacrifice. We know that is not true.\n  The question is, Who will bear the financial sacrifice, the \ngeneration that has decided to go to war or its children and \ngrandchildren? The Iraq and Afghanistan wars drove up our deficit. They \ndidn't single-handedly create our deficit problem, but they made it \nmuch worse. If we are going to fix our deficit problem, rejecting how \nwe finance those wars must be part of the solution.\n  We have to ensure that the manner of funding--by borrowing--the Iraq \nand Afghanistan wars remains an anomaly in American history. That is \nexactly what my resolution seeks to do. It will ensure that future wars \ndon't make our deficit and debt problem worse. It will ensure that \nCongress and the American people face the financial sacrifice of going \nto war, and it will force us to decide whether a war is worth that \nsacrifice.\n  A huge gap has grown between the majority of the American people and \nthe small proportion who serve in the military. So much sacrifice has \nbeen asked of them and their families, yet so little of the rest of us. \nMy resolution will reconnect those who serve and our larger society.\n  The Obama administration is taking an important step in seeking to \nreduce reliance on emergency spending bills and, instead, budget for \nwar through the regular budget process. They have included an overseas \ncontingency operations account over and above the budget for the day-\nto-day operations of the Defense Department. That account is where we \nnow find our war funding. But the improvements the Obama administration \nhas made are not enough. The momentous decision to go to war deserves a \nway of paying for those wars that matches the seriousness of that \ndecision.\n  Overseas contingency operations should be paid for. Thus, my \nresolution simply says that if there is a new overseas contingency \noperation requiring new funding beyond the Defense base budget, that \nfunding must be offset. It does not specify how that offset is to be \nfound, leaving it up to Congress to decide. Different people have \ndifferent ideas. Some may propose spending cuts, others may propose \nrevenue increases or a combination of the two. But the bottom line is, \nCongress must find a way to pay for the cost of new wars we decide to \nundertake.\n  More specifically, this pay-for-war resolution creates a point of \norder so any Senator can object to a legislative proposal that allows \nfor spending on new overseas contingency operations that is not deficit \nneutral. But it has some flexibilities. First, it allows the cost for \nwar in a given year to be offset over 10 years. Because of how the \nbudgeting process works now, spending cuts must be found in the same \nyear of funding as the war spending. But if there is any offset on the \nrevenue side, it can be spread out over 10 years.\n  My resolution also allows the offset requirement to be overridden by \na vote of 60 Senators. So if three-fifths of us deem it important \nenough to spend on an overseas contingency operation without paying for \nit ourselves, that can happen. I believe this fully addresses any \nconcern people might have about unduly tying the hands of the President \nor of the Congress, for that matter. If there were a genuine emergency \nthat required immediate military response in the short term, and that \ncould not be covered by the base defense budget, my resolution would \nnot tie our hands. Any true emergency would certainly motivate enough \nof us to vote to waive the point of order.\n\n  Similarly, if at a particular time our economic circumstances make it \nespecially ill-advised to offset the spending on a war, we would be \nable to waive or override the offset requirement with 60 votes here in \nthe Senate.\n  Let me talk briefly about how this resolution handles Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Unfortunately, we are where we are on Iraq and \nAfghanistan. This resolution is not meant to drive policy on those \nwars. It is forward looking. Earlier I mentioned the Obama \nadministration's praiseworthy effort to reduce reliance on emergency \nsupplemental spending bills. My resolution would strengthen that effort \nby exempting the spending on those wars from this offset requirement \nbut only up to the amount of the President's regular budget request. \nAnything above that cap would be subject to the offset requirement. For \nexample, for fiscal year 2012 the President requested $118 billion for \nIraq and Afghanistan. Any costs over and above that request would need \nto be offset. That number should go down as we draw down from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. This idea is derived, by the way, from a recommendation of \nthe President's fiscal commission.\n  The idea that we should pay for our wars is not a Democratic idea. It \nis not\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\na Republican idea. It is not left or right, it is not antiwar, it is \nnot pro-war--it is common sense. That is why my resolution has garnered \nexpressions of support from a diverse range of organizations and \ndefense and budget experts. It is supported by the Center for American \nProgress Action Fund, by the Bipartisan Policy Center, and by the \nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Noted fiscal hawk David \nWalker, the former Comptroller General of the United States, has \nexpressed his support. So has Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a \nResponsible Federal Budget.\n  A number of experts have stated the rationale for the bill very \npowerfully. Here is what Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution \nsaid:\n\n       Senator Franken's proposal is serious and smart. It seeks \n     to remedy a major problem of the last decade--fighting wars \n     while not asking the broader nation for sacrifice and \n     commitment and meanwhile racking up Federal debt in a way \n     that endangers the economic progress of future generations.\n\n  Here is what William Niskanen and Ben Friedman of the Cato Institute \nsaid:\n\n       Democracies cannot accurately evaluate policies with hidden \n     costs. Deficit financing sends war bills to future taxpayers. \n     That limits the extent to which voters and their \n     Representatives weigh the wars' costs against other \n     priorities. The effect is to make war feel cheaper than it \n     is.\n\n  Here is what Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy \nResearch said:\n\n       The vast majority of people in the country have no direct \n     connection to the people serving in the military. If we think \n     that a situation requires the men and women in our military \n     to risk their own lives, then the rest of us should at least \n     be willing to pay for the costs of this adventure with our \n     tax dollars.\n\n  My resolution makes budgetary sense and it makes moral and political \nsense. That is why I am confident my resolution will garner the support \nof my colleagues and of the American people. I think Americans \nunderstand that the way we have gone about paying for the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan--by borrowing and putting the financial burden on later \ngenerations instead of taking it on ourselves--is not good budgeting \nand, frankly, it is not good decisionmaking about war. Right now we are \nhiding the costs of war by shifting their financial burden to future \ngenerations and we are refusing to consider the real sacrifices that \nwar requires of a nation--not just the members of the military. That \nhas to change.

Con. Res. 11\n\n       Whereas on February 23, 2011, President Barack Obama \n     ordered the Department of Justice to drop its defense of a \n     central part of the 1996 law that bars the Federal Government \n     from recognizing same-sex unions, the Defense of Marriage Act \n     (adding section 7 of title 1, United States Code), and both \n     President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder concluded \n     the law is unconstitutional;\n       Whereas President Obama himself has said that marriage is \n     something sanctified between a man and a woman;\n       Whereas, passed by significant majorities in both chambers \n     of Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, \n     the Defense of Marriage Act has never been overturned in any \n     Federal lawsuit challenging that Act's constitutionality by a \n     Federal court, yet the Department of Justice has decided not \n     to defend that Act in Federal court;\n       Whereas, on the contrary, the Department of Justice is \n     vigorously defending in numerous Federal courts across the \n     country President Obama's signature health care reform law, \n     the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law \n     111-148), and the related Health Care and Education \n     Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-152), after the \n     bills involved barely passed both chambers of Congress on \n     party line votes, and whose critical individual mandate \n     provision has been declared unconstitutional by separate \n     Federal district courts in the cases of Florida v. United \n     States Department of Health and Human Services, Case No.: \n     3:10-cv-91-RV/EMT (N.D. Fla., Jan. 31, 2011), and Virginia ex \n     rel. Cuccinelli v. Sebelius, 728 F.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 134) supporting the designation of \n     April as Parkinson's Awareness Month.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, Dr. James Parkinson first identified \nthe symptoms of this debilitating disease in 1817, and now an estimated \n1.5 million Americans are currently living with Parkinson's. Despite \nmajor advances in modern technology and the establishment of the \nParkinson's Disease Research Agenda more than 10 years ago, we \nregrettably still do not know the cause, and we are still looking for a \ncure.\n  Parkinson's disease is a degenerative brain disorder with major \nsymptoms such as tremors, trouble walking, and speech difficulties. The \nnumber of people being diagnosed with Parkinson's continues to rise. \nThe newest treatments are coming from cutting edge medical innovations, \nlike deep brain stimulation. However, we can and must do more to keep \npushing the boundaries to find better therapies and hopefully, very \nsoon, a cure. This requires a continued national commitment to \nbiomedical research.\n  The National Institutes of Health is the largest contributor to \nParkinson's research, along with the Department of Veteran Affairs and \nthe Department of Defense. Texas has committed to leading the way in \nParkinson's disease research and has received more than $2.7 million in \nFederal funds. These dollars are being put to use at some of our top \nuniversity and medical research facilities across the State, including: \nthe University of Texas, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Tech \nUniversity Health Science Center, and the Audie L. Murphy VA Medical \nCenter in San Antonio.\n  Today, I am proud to recognize April as Parkinson's Awareness Month, \nand I hope that this will not only raise awareness of this devastating \ndisease, but will also renew focus and vigor to the fight to treat and \nultimately eliminate Parkinson's disease.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid on the table \nwith no intervening action or debate, and any statements be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 134) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.
