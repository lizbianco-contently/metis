Madam President, yesterday I sat down with the President to \ntalk about how to avoid a default crisis that would be a black mark on \nthis country's reputation for generations to come. If we fail to avert \nthis crisis, it would be the first time in our great Nation's history \nthat we have defaulted on our financial obligations and would send \nshock waves through the global economy. But I am not the only one \nsaying that. The most respected voices in the business and financial \ncommunity are saying the same thing: Default would be awful. Business \nleaders, economists, bank executives, credit rating agencies, and even \na Republican adviser to Presidents Reagan and George Bush--the same \nadviser to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush--have used \nsome very serious words to describe the kind of crisis defaulting on \nour debt would cause. The word many have used is it would be a \n``catastrophe.'' The legendary Warren Buffett said a few days ago that \nallowing the United States to default on its debt would be Congress's \n``most asinine act'' ever. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said a \nfailure to avert default would have ``catastrophic economic \nconsequences that would last for decades.''\n  Failure to avert this crisis would have dire consequences and would \nresult in the most serious financial crisis this country has ever \nfaced. Millions of Americans could lose their jobs, Federal prisons \nwould have to be changed dramatically with their personnel, border \nsecurity would have to change, and our court systems would likely no\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\nlonger be able to have trials. Security checks could stop, and so could \npaychecks to our troops. That is how desperate it would be.\n  What could be so important that my Republican colleagues are willing \nto put our economy at such dire risk? What could be worth walking away \nfrom the negotiating table, as they have done? Tax breaks for wealthy \noil companies and corporate jets? Republicans have gone to the mat for \nBig Oil, fighting again and again to preserve wasteful, taxpayer-funded \ngiveaways to companies that made tens of billions of dollars in profits \nin the first quarter of this year alone. Republicans walked away from \nthe negotiating table to save tax breaks for corporate jets. So which \nbig industries and special interests will they fight for next? Oil \ncompanies? To ship jobs overseas? Companies that ship jobs overseas? \nCorporate jets?\n  If they were truly serious about reducing the deficit, they would \nadmit this kind of waste must end. Yet some top Republicans say \neliminating these subsidies shouldn't even be part of the discussion as \nwe find a way to reduce the deficit and avoid a catastrophic default. \nSeveral rank-and-file Republicans have said handouts to oil and gas \ncompanies and other wasteful tax breaks should be on the table as we \nnegotiate. These are Republicans. And 34 Republicans endorsed the view \nthat any taxpayer giveaways should be part of the solution when they \nvoted to eliminate subsidies for ethanol. It seems Republicans can't \neven agree among themselves whether subsidies and giveaways are \nsacrosanct.\n  One thing they can agree on, it seems: They are willing to balance \nthe budget on the backs of seniors instead. They are willing to end \nMedicare as we know it. They are willing to slash Medicaid, \njeopardizing coverage for 80 percent of American seniors in nursing \nhomes. Medicaid is for the poorest of the poor, but about 70 percent of \nMedicaid money goes to people who are in rest homes, nursing homes. \nRepublican priorities, then, are very clear. They are dead wrong, \nthough.\n\n  Democrats know we need to make difficult spending cuts to reduce our \ndeficit, but to dig ourselves out of this financial hole, we must also \ncreate jobs to spur our economy, and we must break the cycle of \nwasteful giveaways, not break our promise to seniors.\n  The junior Senator from South Carolina, a Republican, threatened that \nany Republican who votes to avert a default crisis will be ``gone''--\nthose are his words--voted out in a wave of tea party anger. This kind \nof inflammatory language is irresponsible. There is simply too much at \nstake.\n  Also, this same Senator did not mention that 235 Republicans in the \nHouse and 40 in the Senate, including my friend from South Carolina \nwhom I have just talked about, have already voted to increase our debt \nthis year. Their ideological budget--it came from the House--that they \nwanted to support here and did vote for it, would have increased the \ndebt by more than 60 percent over the next 10 years. The so-called Ryan \nbudget would increase the debt by more than 60 percent over the next 10 \nyears. That is about $9 trillion in a decade.\n  What did Republicans get for their so-called $9 trillion? What would \nwe get? A plan that ends Medicare; a plan that would slash Medicaid, \njeopardizing coverage, as I indicated, for 80 percent of American \nseniors in nursing homes; a plan that protects tax breaks for \nbillionaires and oil companies while putting millions of seniors at \nrisk. That is the choice. The psychologist Alfred Adler once said, ``It \nis easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.'' \nRepublicans shouted loudly and repeatedly about reducing debt. Then \nthey gave us 9 trillion reasons not to trust this rhetoric.\n  The time for empty rhetoric is over. Now it is time for my Republican \ncolleagues to put the good of our economy ahead of their own politics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4136-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection.\n\n\n                          Budget Negotiations\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, the last thing we need when we are \ntrying to get back on track is a default crisis that would grind our \neconomy to a halt and bury us under even more debt. Yet the latest \nround of Republican politicians threatening to default on our debt has \nmade their priorities clear: They would rather stop paying our men and \nwomen fighting overseas, force deep cuts to Social Security and \nMedicare, and throw even more Americans out of work than tell big oil \ncompanies and corporate jet owners to pay their fair share.\n  Clearly our Republican colleagues are serious about politics, not \ndeficits. You cannot be serious about deficits and at the same time \nrecklessly jeopardize our economic standing in the world in order to \nprotect tax breaks for the wealthiest few. Yet that is what leaders \nsuch as Mitch McConnell seem to be saying. Yesterday my Republican \ncolleague drew a line in the sand on cutting wasteful spending in the \nTax Code, calling elimination of special interest giveaways politically \nimpossible. Politically impossible? Really? Just two weeks ago 34 \nSenate Republicans joined Democrats in passing the repeal of subsidies \nto ethanol companies. Politically impossible? The landmark budget \nagreements of the 1990s brought us into balance and ushered in \nsurpluses that took a balanced approach and created prosperity and job \ncreation such as we have not seen in this decade.\n  Politically impossible? Right now in America middle-class families \nare living paycheck to paycheck while Senator McConnell and his \ncolleagues are going to the mat to protect billions in tax breaks to \noil companies. They say two things--Senator McConnell says two things: \nHe says he is not raising taxes. He wants the average American to think \nit is your taxes. No one wants\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\nto raise taxes on people below $250 million--many of us, people below \n$1 million. But when oil companies get big giveaways, when corporate \njets get huge deductions, a greater deduction than Delta gets when it \nbuys a plane for commercial use, that should be on the table. We should \nask Senator McConnell and the press should ask Senator McConnell: When \nyou say no taxes, do you mean some of our largest corporations should \npay no taxes? When you say no taxes, should no taxes be on the table? \nAre you saying we should not close corporate loopholes? Are you saying \npeople who are making $1 billion should not sacrifice and all the \nsacrifice should be the middle class? Because that is what Senator \nMcConnell is saying.\n  Again, we do not wish to tax and will not tax average middle-class \npeople. That is the President's pledge and that is our pledge. The \nquestion is: When you tell an average teacher or cop or firefighter you \nhave to sacrifice, are you going to tell the millionaire they have to \nsacrifice too? Not because we dislike them, but because it should be \nshared across the board, and Senator McConnell has said: No, the \nmillionaires should not sacrifice. Because the only way they are going \nto sacrifice is closing loopholes in the Tax Code. They don't need \nloans to help their kids get to college.\n  One other thing: Senator McConnell says we should take anything about \ncorporate loopholes, about taxing wealthy people off the table. His \n``my way or the highway'' approach is what is standing in the way of \ngetting an agreement. The person standing in the way right now is \nSenator McConnell. You have not heard such strident language from the \nother leaders. He says: Take everything we want and nothing you want or \nwe will not get an agreement. That is what he is saying.\n  The bottom line is very simple. Senator McConnell, cutting Medicare \nbenefits will not make us stronger; Firing teachers will not make us \nstronger; rolling back investments in innovation and research and high-\ntech jobs of the future will not make us stronger, but ending wasteful \ntax subsidies that do nothing but contribute to the deficit for oil \ncompanies and corporate jet owners will make us stronger. Meet us part \nof the way here. Don't say my way or no way because that is too risky, \nand that is telling the world we will not fulfill our obligations the \nway every family in America has to fulfill theirs.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise with great concern regarding a \nprogram just revealed in the Sunday New York Times--outstanding work by \nRobert Pear--``U.S. Plans Stealth Survey on Access to Doctors.'' I am \nasking my colleagues to join me in sending a letter to Secretary \nSebelius, sharing our concerns with the legality, standards, and \nrepercussions of this program.\n  I have deep concerns regarding the Department's recent plans for this \nso-called stealth survey, its legality, the notification to Congress, \nthe lack of standards for any misconduct or bad reporting by the staff \nhired to carry out this work in looking clandestinely at American \ndoctors and their practice of medicine. The cost and proposed \nclandestine method of collecting information about physicians' offices \nis questionable. Therefore, I will be requesting details on how this \nsurvey will be conducted and how investigators will be punished for \nmisconduct or extortion they may carry out in their duties and how \npatient and physician confidentiality will be maintained.\n  In our letter, we are outlining 12 key questions.\n  No. 1. Since there are already a number of surveys answering this \nquestion, does this expenditure of taxpayer money add anything? We are \nasking for the Department to provide detailed records of their \nliterature review on the current research that has already been \npublished on the subject before launching this taxpayer-funded expense. \nWe are also asking for the total cost of this program to be revealed.\n  No. 2. We are asking for records on how the National Opinion Research \nCenter of Chicago, IL, won a Federal competitive bid to carry out this \nwork.\n  No. 3. In concluding the results of this survey, how will the NORC \ndecide what qualifies as an acceptable response or best practices from \nphysicians they have targeted?\n  No. 4. How will patient and doctor confidentiality be maintained? If \nresearchers report bad information or use this survey for extortion, \nbribery or other acts, how will they be disciplined?\n  No. 5. Once concluded, who has access to this information--the \nDepartment, the White House, the Congress, the press?\n  No. 6. By what criteria will individual physicians be targeted for \nparticipation? Will age, average incomes, surrounding office locations \nor political affiliation be excluded from factors considered when \ntargeting physicians?\n  No. 7. Will Federal employees carry out this work or will it be \nconducted by a contracted call center for data collection? Also, who is \nqualified to conduct this survey and how will they be chosen?\n  No. 8. If the staff improperly releases patient or physician data, \nhow will they be disciplined?\n  No. 9. I would like their description of the fiscal year 2011 \nAppropriations Committee program or account under which this was \nfunded.\n  No. 10. I am also requesting a description of the statutory \nauthorization used to carry out this work and the congressional \nnotifications informing the committees of jurisdiction of their intent \nto obligate funds for this purpose.\n  No. 11. I am also asking for specific sections identified in the \nPresident's budget under which the funding for this work was requested.\n  No. 12. If a physician wishes to correct data collected by the NORC, \nwhat legal redress does he or she have?\n  There have been a number of very reliable studies which confirm that \nmany patients on Medicaid and Medicare cannot find a doctor to see \nthem. Previous studies also confirm that we do not have enough doctors, \nparticularly primary care doctors. We all know government programs \noften provide poor service and suffer from funding failures or \ncorruption.\n  In this time of serious fiscal constraint, I urge us to focus our \nlimited Federal resources on ways we can actually address these \nproblems rather than launch another taxpayer-funded spending program to \nclandestinely review the work of our physicians.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business for up to 7 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              The Deficit\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I just wish to bring to my colleagues' \nattention a very well-written but disturbing op-ed in today's Wall \nStreet Journal by one of our country's foremost economists, a person \nwhose calculations and prognostications we should not lightly lay \naside, Larry Lindsey.\n  In this piece, entitled ``The Deficit Is Worse Than We Think,'' he \nposits three reasons why we need to get serious about deficit \nreduction. I will just mention the three reasons, put this op-ed in the \nRecord, and make a comment or two about it.\n  First, he says, if interest rates in this country go back to their \nhistoric levels, we would have annual interest expenses on our debt \nroughly $420 billion higher in 2014 and $700 billion higher in\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\n2020, and the 10-year rise in interest rates would be about $4.9 \ntrillion higher than under the current cost of borrowing. That would \nobviously wipe out any savings, and then some, that we are trying to \nachieve in our deficit reduction discussions.\n  The second problem is, the official forecasts for growth are probably \nfar too rosy considering the current circumstances. If we were to grow \nat a rate that he believes is much more realistic than those projected \nby the President's budget, we will miss the President's budget number \nby a cumulative 5.2 percentage points and incur an additional debt of \n$4 trillion, which is the equivalent to all the 10-year savings in the \nbudget that passed the House of Representatives.\n  Third, the cost estimates for what we call ObamaCare are going to be \nwell off the mark, unfortunately, on the low end, that the \nprognostications by people who have surveyed the businesses that will \neither keep their insurance or turn that cost over to the government \nwill result in an extra bill for the taxpayers of roughly $74 billion \nin 2014, rising to $85 billion in 2019 because of the subsidies that \nthe government will have to pay into that.\n  His conclusion is:\n\n       Only serious long-term spending reduction in the \n     entitlement area can begin to address the nation's deficit \n     and debt problems.\n\n  Because that is where the bulk of the money we spend goes. I think he \nis absolutely correct. But if he is correct about these projections, \nthen we are not even close to achieving the savings we need to have in \norder to avoid a cataclysmic future for our country.\n  Also, as noted today in an article from the Arizona Republic, the \ngrowth rate for the first quarter of this year was 1.9 percent. The \nAssociated Press is forecasting that for the next quarter it will be \n2.3 percent. That is way lower than any of us would like. It is too \nanemic to even keep up with our population in terms of job growth. This \narticle notes:\n\n       The economy has to grow 3 percent a year just to hold the \n     unemployment rate steady and keep up with population growth. \n     And it has to average about 5 percent growth for a year to \n     lower the unemployment rate by a full percentage point. It is \n     9.1 percent today.\n\n  So we can see we are growing at less than half the rate needed to \nbegin to make a dent in unemployment. This bodes very badly for our \nfuture.\n  Finally, in a National Review Online piece today by Andrew Stiles, \nthere is this reference to a Harvard economist, Alberto Alesina. I will \nquote from this article.\n\n       Alberto Alesina, a Harvard economist who has analyzed the \n     ways in which various countries responded to large fiscal \n     crises, concludes that spending cuts are ``much more \n     effective'' than tax increases in stabilizing the debt \n     without harming the economy. ``In fact, in several episodes, \n     spending cuts adopted to reduce deficits have been associated \n     with economic expansions rather than recessions,'' Alesina \n     writes. These findings were echoed in a report from Goldman \n     Sachs analysts Ben Broadbent and Kevin Day, which examined \n     ``every major fiscal correction in the OECD since 1975.''\n\n  The point of all these things is the projections about economic \ngrowth, about increases in interest rates and expenditures by the \nFederal Government all point to the need for us to reduce our expenses \nat the Federal Government level and that spending cuts are a much more \neffective way to stabilize the debt and not hurt the economy than tax \nincreases.\n  I say all this because, as everyone by now knows, the negotiations \nthat were being conducted under the auspices of Vice President Biden \nhave broken down over the issue of whether tax cuts have to be a part \nof the resolution of the issue. The point is--the point we have been \nmaking is--tax increases in times such as these, when we are trying to \ncome out of a recession and we need economic growth, would be the wrong \nmedicine for this ailing economy, that the better way to do it is by \nspending reductions. It is obvious from Larry Lindsey's piece that the \nspending reductions we have been talking about, far from being \nDraconian, are actually not nearly enough in order to achieve the \nresult we have to have to avoid the kind of interest rate increases and \nincreased costs at the Federal Government level that he predicts.\n  I hope my colleagues will think again as to the sort of ideological \ncommitment they have to raising taxes. In the context of today's issue, \nthat should not be part of our discussion. That will only hurt the \neconomy, inhibit job creation and economic growth, and delay the day \nwhen we begin to recover from this economic downturn. Instead, we need \nto focus on the kind of spending reductions that were embodied in the \nbudget that the House of Representatives passed and that those of us on \nthis side of the aisle have been trying to put forward as a condition \nfor increasing the debt ceiling.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the Wall Street Journal op-ed by Lawrence Lindsey.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 27, 2011]\n\n The Deficit Is Worse Than We Think--Normal Interest Rates Would Raise \nDebt-Service Costs by $4.9 Trillion Over 10 Years, Dwarfing the Savings \n              From Any Currently Contemplated Budget Deal\n\n                        (By Lawrence B. Lindsey)\n\n       Washington is struggling to make a deal that will couple an \n     increase in the debt ceiling with a long-term reduction in \n     spending. There is no reason for the players to make their \n     task seem even more Herculean than it already is. But we \n     should be prepared for upward revisions in official deficit \n     projections in the years ahead--even if a deal is struck. \n     There are at least three major reasons for concern.\n       First, a normalization of interest rates would upend any \n     budgetary deal if and when one should occur. At present, the \n     average cost of Treasury borrowing is 2.5%. The average over \n     the last two decades was 5.7%. Should we ramp up to the \n     higher number, annual interest expenses would be roughly $420 \n     billion higher in 2014 and $700 billion higher in 2020.\n       The 10-year rise in interest expense would be $4.9 trillion \n     higher under ``normalized'' rates than under the current cost \n     of borrowing. Compare that to the $2 trillion estimate of \n     what the current talks about long-term deficit reduction may \n     produce, and it becomes obvious that the gains from the \n     current deficit-reduction efforts could be wiped out by \n     normalization in the bond market.\n       To some extent this is a controllable risk. The Federal \n     Reserve could act aggressively by purchasing even more bonds, \n     or targeting rates further out on the yield curve, to slow \n     any rise in the cost of Treasury borrowing. Of course, this \n     carries its own set of risks, not the least among them an \n     adverse reaction by our lenders. Suffice it to say, though, \n     that given all that is at stake, Fed interest-rate policy \n     will increasingly have to factor in the effects of any rate \n     hike on the fiscal position of the Treasury.\n       The second reason for concern is that official growth \n     forecasts are much higher than what the academic consensus \n     believes we should expect after a financial crisis. That \n     consensus holds that economies tend to return to trend growth \n     of about 2.5%, without ever recapturing what was lost in the \n     downturn.\n       But the president's budget of February 2011 projects \n     economic growth of 4% in 2012, 4.5% in 2013, and 4.2% in \n     2014. That budget also estimates that the 10-year budget cost \n     of missing the growth estimate by just one point for one year \n     is $750 billion. So, if we just grow at trend those three \n     years, we will miss the president's forecast by a cumulative \n     5.2 percentage points and--using the numbers provided in his \n     budget--incur additional debt of $4 trillion. That is the \n     equivalent of all of the 10-year savings in Congressman Paul \n     Ryan's budget, passed by the House in April, or in the \n     Bowles-Simpson budget plan.\n       Third, it is increasingly clear that the long-run cost \n     estimates of ObamaCare were well short of the mark because of \n     the incentive that employers will have under that plan to end \n     private coverage and put employees on the public system. \n     Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has \n     already issued 1,400 waivers from the act's regulations for \n     employers as large as McDonald's to stop them from dumping \n     their employees' coverage.\n       But a recent McKinsey survey, for example, found that 30% \n     of employers with plans will likely take advantage of the \n     system, with half of the more knowledgeable ones planning to \n     do so. If this survey proves correct, the extra bill for \n     taxpayers would be roughly $74 billion in 2014 rising to $85 \n     billion in 2019, thanks to the subsidies provided to \n     individuals and families purchasing coverage in the \n     government's insurance exchanges.\n       Underestimating the long-term budget situation is an old \n     game in Washington. But never have the numbers been this \n     large.\n       There is no way to raise taxes enough to cover these \n     problems. The tax-the-rich proposals of the Obama \n     administration raise about $700 billion, less than a fifth of \n     the budgetary consequences of the excess economic growth \n     projected in their forecast. The whole $700 billion collected \n     over 10 years would not even cover the difference in interest \n     costs in any one year at the end of the decade between \n     current rates and the average cost of Treasury borrowing over \n     the last 20 years.\n       Only serious long-term spending reduction in the \n     entitlement area can begin to address the nation's deficit \n     and debt problems. It should no longer be credible for our \n     elected\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\n     officials to hide the need for entitlement reforms behind \n     rosy economic and budgetary assumptions. And while we should \n     all hope for a deal that cuts spending and raises the debt \n     ceiling to avoid a possible default, bondholders should be \n     under no illusions.\n       Under current government policies and economic projections, \n     they should be far more concerned about a return of their \n     principal in 10 years than about any short-term delay in a \n     coupon payment in August.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I assume that we are now on the Cole \nnomination?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are on the nomination.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, earlier this year the Senate expressed \nits opposition to proceeding to Mr. Cole's nomination when it failed to \ninvoke cloture. I was a strong advocate against the Senate invoking \ncloture on Mr. Cole's nomination because the Justice Department had \nfailed to respond to a legitimate oversight request that both Senator \nChambliss and I made relating to two separate topics.\n  The Justice Department was withholding vital documents related to my \ninquiry of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearm's Operation Fast \nand Furious and to an inquiry by Senator Chambliss in his capacity as \nvice chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  As ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have been seeking and \nstill seek documents, information, and access to witness interviews to \ndetermine who approved Operation Fast and Furious. This was an \noperation that you have heard me talk about often where ATF agents were \nordered to knowingly allow straw buyers to obtain weapons on behalf of \ncriminals and traffickers intent on smuggling those weapons into \nMexico.\n  The courageous agents who blew the whistle and testified about their \nefforts to warn supervisors about the dangers referred to this practice \nas ``walking guns.'' Of the more than 1,800 weapons allowed to \n``walk,'' hundreds have been recovered in connection with crimes in the \nUnited States and Mexico, including two such weapons in connection with \nthe murder of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry.\n  After seeking information from the Justice Department, I was \nrepeatedly told that the ATF did not knowingly allow these sales. \nWorking with Congressman Issa, who is chairman of the House Government \nOversight Committee, we released information that showed that the \ninitial denials were false. This risky policy was, in fact, implemented \nat ATF and the Justice Department.\n  Despite the seriousness of the whistleblowers' allegations and my \nrepeated inquiries, the Justice Department continued to deny me access \nto the documents. As a result, I urged my colleagues to oppose cloture \non James Cole to be Deputy Attorney General. Well, that cloture \nopposition worked. We have since reached an agreement with the Justice \nDepartment and Senator Leahy that will guarantee my access to vital \ndocument information and witnesses regarding this ATF operation.\n  I also understand that Senator Chambliss has reached an agreement on \nobtaining the information he has sought on behalf of the Intelligence \nCommittee. Accordingly, I now lift my opposition to the Senate holding \na vote on Mr. Cole's nomination. However, I want to explain that I am \ngoing to vote against his nomination for many reasons.\n  I oppose the nomination of James Cole to be Deputy Attorney General \nat the Department of Justice because I have serious concerns regarding \nMr. Cole's qualifications. In addition, I am troubled by President \nObama's recess appointment of Mr. Cole to this position. I have been \nconsistent in my opposition to recess appointments over the years on \ncommittees where I have been chairman or ranking member. Whenever the \nPresident bypasses the Senate; in other words, bypasses our \nconfirmation of a person, by making a recess appointment, such nominees \nwill not receive my support where I have been lead on my side \nresponsible for reviewing such nominees.\n  We have a process in place for nominations, and if the President is \nnot willing to work with Senators to clear nominations, the nominee \nshould not get a second bite at the apple. The Deputy Attorney General \nis second in command at the Justice Department and is responsible for \noverseeing the day-to-day operations of the Department.\n  Managing this vast bureaucracy is a difficult task that requires a \nserious commitment to protecting our national security, enforcing our \ncriminal laws, and safeguarding taxpayer dollars. We need a qualified \nleader who has the smarts, the capability, and the willingness to \nmanage Department programs and root out inefficiencies and abuse in \nthose programs.\n  After reviewing all of his responses and his hearing testimony, I \nconcluded that I could not support Mr. Cole's nomination to be Deputy \nAttorney General. In particular, I am seriously concerned about Mr. \nCole's views on national security and on terrorism. Back in 2002, Mr. \nCole was author of an opinion piece in the Legal Times. In that piece \nhe stated:\n\n       For all the rhetoric about war, the September 11 attacks \n     were criminal acts of terrorism against a civilian \n     population, much like terrorist acts of Timothy McVeigh in \n     blowing up the federal building in Oklahoma City, or of Omar \n     Abdel-Rahman in the first effort to blow up the World Trade \n     Center. The criminals responsible for those horrible acts \n     were successfully tried and convicted under our criminal \n     justice system without the need for procedures that altered \n     traditional due process rights.\n\n  But I want to quote further.\n\n       The acts of September 11th were horrible, but so are . . . \n     other things.\n\n  The other things he referred to were the drug trade, organized crime, \nrape, child abuse and murder. Mr. Cole's opinion piece argued that \nnotwithstanding the involvement of foreign organizations such as al-\nQaida, we have never treated criminal acts influenced by foreign \nnationals or governments as a basis for ``ignoring the core \nconstitutional protections engrained in our criminal justice system.''\n  Mr. Cole concluded his opinion piece by arguing that in addition to \nstopping future terrorist attacks, the Attorney General is a criminal \nprosecutor and that he has a special duty to apply constitutional \nprotections ingrained in our criminal justice system to even including \nterrorists captured on foreign battlefields.\n  Mr. Cole wrote this opinion piece 2 days short of the first \nanniversary of the September 11 attacks. Given the close proximity in \ntime to the September 11 attacks, we must accept this opinion piece as \nMr. Cole's true beliefs about the application of the civilian criminal \njustice system to terrorism cases, including those who masterminded the \n9/11 attacks.\n  From the opinion piece and his responses to our inquiry, it appears \nthat if given a choice of prosecuting high-ranking terrorists in \ncivilian courts or military commissions, Mr. Cole would likely favor \ncivilian courts based upon his longstanding belief in the role that the \nAttorney General plays in protecting the principles of the criminal \njustice system.\n  Absent a clear statement from Mr. Cole about what factors would \nwarrant selecting a civilian or a military forum, it is hard to look at \nhis entire record of past opinion, his testimony and responses to our \nquestions, and reach any different conclusion.\n  In fact, my concerns about the individuals at the Justice Department \nsupporting prosecution of terrorists in civilian criminal court have \nbeen validated by recent events surrounding the arrest of two Iraqi \nnationals at Bowling Green, KY. These Iraqi nationals have admitted \ntargeting American troops in Iraq, plotting to equip foreign fighters \nin Iraq with weapons such as grenades and missile launchers. They made \ntheir way to our country and somehow got past the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  After they were identified, the Justice Department is seeking to try \nthem in civilian court even though their activities regarded terrorist \nactivities and took a very military approach.\n  Attorney General Holder has been steadfast in supporting their \nprosecution in civilian court. It appears to me\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\nthat no one in the Justice Department, including Mr. Cole, has objected \nto prosecuting these individuals in civilian court. This is despite the \nclear nexus to the battlefield in Iraq. So it now appears the Justice \nDepartment, where Mr. Cole currently serves as a recess-appointed \nDeputy Attorney General, rewards terrorists who are smart enough to \nevade Homeland Security's determination on whether they can come to \nthis country, and at the same time make their way from the battlefield \nwith the same rights and privileges as American citizens. All of this \noccurred on Mr. Cole's watch as Deputy Attorney General.\n\n  Military tribunals have many advantages to civilian criminal courts \nand are better equipped to deal with dangerous terrorists and \nclassified evidence while preserving due process. I am troubled that \nMr. Cole does not appear to share this belief. Because of his responses \nand testimony, I have serious concerns about his support for civilian \ntrials for terrorists captured on a foreign battlefield. This is of \nparticular concern, given that the Deputy Attorney General oversees the \nNational Security Division at the Justice Department.\n  Now for a second reason. I have concerns about Mr. Cole's abilities \nrelative to oversight of government programs. We asked about oversight \nof the Department of Justice's grant programs. When he was asked, Mr. \nCole failed to commit to a top-to-bottom review of the programs, nor \nhas he undertaken such a review since he was recess appointed. Given \nthe enormous Federal deficits and enough examples of the tremendous \ninefficiencies, duplications, and waste in these programs, one would \nassume the Deputy Attorney General would be looking for cost savings in \nthe Department. I am disappointed Mr. Cole has failed to recognize that \nthere is a need for a comprehensive review of Justice's grant \nprograms--not only for the sake of saving taxpayer dollars at a time \nwhen we face skyrocketing fiscal deficits but also to ensure that grant \nobjectives are being met in the most efficient and effective manner \npossible.\n  A third reason. I have concerns about Mr. Cole's abilities based on \nhis performance as an independent consultant tasked with overseeing the \ninsurance firm AIG. By way of background, the Justice Department \nprovided copies of the reports Mr. Cole issued when he was overseeing \nAIG, but they were labeled ``Committee Confidential.'' As a result of \ntheir being labeled ``Committee Confidential,'' I cannot discuss with \nspecificity the contents of those documents publicly. Nevertheless, \nwhen taken into context with the public responses provided by Mr. Cole \nto my questions, a troubling picture develops about Mr. Cole's \nperformance in his role as independent consultant. The responses and \nreports do not dispel the serious questions raised about Mr. Cole's \nindependence or his completeness. Further, they reveal what appears to \nbe a level of deference to AIG management one would not expect to see \nfrom someone tasked with the responsibility of being an ``independent'' \nmonitor.\n  In order to clarify a number of questions on this matter, Senator \nCoburn and I sent a followup letter seeking additional answers from Mr. \nCole. Mr. Cole's reply clarified that the Department of Justice, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and the New York Attorney General's \nOffice were aware of his practice of seeking input from AIG and making \nmodifications to the reports. He indicated that the changes AIG made \nwere often factual changes, such as AIG employee names, dates of \nmaterials, and events. He also indicated that some of the changes \nrequested by AIG were included in a section of the report entitled \n``AIG Response.'' However, he added that ``on a few occasions'' AIG \nwould ``suggest a stylistic change of phrasing in the analytical \nsection of the report.'' He stated that while he included the edits \nmade by AIG, he ``did not believe that a detailed presentation of this \nfactual review process was necessary to an understanding of each \nparty's position.''\n  As a result, the reports did not necessarily show which edits AIG \nmade that were incorporated. Instead, he said those changes were \navailable in working papers that were ``available to the SEC, the DOJ, \nand the New York Attorney General's Office.'' Unfortunately, he added, \n``the agencies--which were aware of this practice--did not request such \ndocuments.''\n  While I appreciate Mr. Cole's responses to these clarifying \nquestions, they raise concerns about how independent his monitoring \nwas, what changes were ultimately requested by AIG, what changes were \nincluded, and how much the SEC and the Department of Justice knew about \nedits AIG was making to the ``independent'' reports.\n  In addition, I have serious concerns about Mr. Cole's decision to \nsuspend compliance review at AIG's financial products division \nfollowing the government bailout of AIG. In his testimony, Mr. Cole \nacknowledged that subsequent to the government bailout of AIG, he \nscaled back his efforts until the future of AIG as a corporation was \ndetermined. After Mr. Cole suspended his monitoring, AIG restructured \nits compliance office and terminated a number of staff overseeing the \ncompany's compliance with SEC regulations. Mr. Cole said after it was \ndetermined that AIG's financial products division would not be \ndissolved, the compliance and monitoring were ``revived and are being \nreviewed and implemented where applicable.''\n  Under Mr. Cole's watch, AIG not only got $182 billion of taxpayer \ndollars for a bailout, but was able to talk the independent \nconsultant--Mr. Cole--out of monitoring what the company was doing.\n  I am concerned about Mr. Cole's ability to perform the duties \nrequired of a Deputy Attorney General. In that role, he would be in a \nposition to potentially influence future compliance monitors appointed \nunder settlements with the Justice Department, the Securities and \nExchange Commission, and other corporations that have violated the law. \nIndependent monitors need to be truly independent and, of course, \ncompletely transparent. They are selected and appointed to ensure the \ninterests of the American people are protected.\n  For these reasons, I cannot support the nomination of Mr. Cole to be \nDeputy Attorney General, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I am very pleased that soon we will be \nvoting on Jim Cole to be the Deputy Attorney General of the United \nStates. This is a person who puts principle over politics, a person who \nis very important in our war against terror and who will use all lawful \ntools to keep our Nation safe. So I am proud to take a few moments to \nurge my colleagues to vote for his confirmation. I think that is in our \nnational security interests, and I know he will be and already is an \nincredible asset to this country in keeping us safe and doing so in the \nbest traditions of the U.S. Attorney General's Office.\n  I would like to talk for a moment on a personal basis because I got \nto know Jim Cole when I was serving in the House of Representatives. I \nwas on the Ethics Committee. The Ethics Committee is not a committee, \nas you know, on which a Member asks to serve; it is something we must \ndo.\n  We had a very sensitive investigation in the House of Representatives \nconcerning the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, and the six of us \nwho served on the Ethics Committee needed to come to a fair, \nnonpartisan conclusion to this very challenging investigation. To say \nwe thought this would be impossible was an understatement of where we \nfirst thought we would be in regard to the investigation. But then we \nreached out and agreed to bring in an independent counsel to help us in \nour deliberations. That person was Jim Cole.\n  Jim Cole worked with all of us to look at the facts and do what was \nin the best interests of the House of Representatives, the best \ninterests of our country, and to leave our politics aside so that we \ncould come out with a result that was fair and would restore confidence \nin the legislative process. In fact, we did that. We were able to reach \na totally unanimous judgment, one that was agreed to on the floor of \nthe House of Representatives and I think spoke volumes about our \nability to get our work done in the best interests of our Nation.\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\n  I thought Jim Cole did a fabulous job, a great job in helping us. \nThat was also the view of Porter Goss, who was the Republican leader on \nthe Ethics Committee and chairman of the committee at the time. He said \nhe felt Jim Cole brought professionalism at the highest level to our \ninvestigation and allowed us to come forward with a fair nonpartisan \nconclusion. That is the exact person we need in the Department of \nJustice. It is the person we need to be Deputy Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  The Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General are our Nation's \nlawyers. They don't represent one party; they represent our country. We \nneed leadership in the Department of Justice who will work in a \nnonpartisan way, a way that will bring nonpartisan leadership to the \nDepartment of Justice. Jim Cole is that type of person. He has the \nexperience, he has the character, and he has the commitment to fill \nthis very important position in our Nation, with 13 years in the \nDepartment of Justice and experience in public interest law. His career \nhas been devoted to the public interest in community service.\n  I was listening to my colleague and friend Senator Grassley talk \nabout his concerns about some of the private law practice of Jim Cole. \nHere is a person who has devoted his life basically to community and \nhis career in public interest law. He has been a prosecutor. He has \nbeen a person who has dealt with white-collar criminals. And, yes, he \nis an effective attorney. As those of us who are lawyers know, we will \nrepresent our clients aggressively, but we don't lose sight of our \nsystem. That has been Jim Cole throughout his career. He will bring the \nexpertise he has had in his previous experience to represent our Nation \nwell. These are tough times. We are dealing with threats around the \nworld where we need an Attorney General and a Deputy Attorney General \nwho will use all lawful tools in order to protect our country.\n  It is interesting that Jim Cole enjoys endorsement from both sides of \nthe aisle. When we look at high-ranking Department of Justice former \nofficials, both Democrats and Republicans have endorsed Jim Cole's \nconfirmation to be the Deputy Attorney General.\n  Let me quote from one Republican source that I think is typical of \nthe endorsements we have received encouraging the confirmation of Jim \nCole. We received a letter from Fred Fielding. I think most of you know \nFred Fielding. He was White House Counsel for former President George \nW. Bush. I think most of us had close dealings with and respected him \ngreatly in the service to the Bush administration. This is what Fred \nFielding said about Jim Cole:\n\n       Mr. Cole combines all the qualities you would want in a \n     citizen public servant. He understands both sides of the \n     street and is smart and tenacious, and is a person of \n     unquestioned honor and integrity.\n\n  Well, I agree with Fred Fielding. This is the type of person we need \nto be Deputy Attorney General of the United States.\n  I am pleased we are going to have this vote later on today. I \nencourage my colleagues to vote for his confirmation. It is important \nthat we have individuals in these key positions who enjoy the full \nconfirmation from the Senate, and I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this nominee.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Lisa O. Monaco to be the Assistant Attorney General for \nNational Security that is before the Senate.\n  The Assistant Attorney General for National Security is a fairly new \nposition but a very important one, especially in a time of rapidly \nevolving threats to our nation and increasingly challenging legal \nquestions about how to prepare for and combat those threats.\n  As the Assistant Attorney General for National Security, Ms. Monaco \nwould represent the government in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct, FISA, proceedings and sign off on applications to allow the \ngovernment to move quickly to track down terrorists and spies operating \nagainst the United States. She will be the principal official in the \nDepartment of Justice for engaging with the intelligence community as \nagencies determine the authorities and limitations under the law.\n  Ms. Monaco's confirmation is long overdue. She was approved \nunanimously by both the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees \nlast month after the May 1 strike against Osama bin Laden.\n  Importantly for the Assistant Attorney General for National Security \nposition, that operation netted a large cache of al-Qaida documents, \ncommunications, and videos that will, no doubt, lead to new \ncounterterrorism leads.\n  On May 8 National Security Adviser Tom Donilon was on ``Meet the \nPress,'' and he said, ``This is the largest cache of intelligence \nderived from the scene of any single terrorist. It's about the size, \nthe CIA tells us, of a small college library.''\n  In the past 2 months, intelligence and law enforcement professionals \nhave been scouring that information for new threats, leads, and \ninsights into al-Qaida and global terrorism. As the intelligence gained \nis turned into counterterrorism actions, Lisa Monaco will oversee those \nactivities.\n  The bottom line is that at this time of heightened potential threat \nof terrorism, the Attorney General, the intelligence community, and the \nentire administration need to have their team in place.\n  Ms. Monaco was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 9 \nand by the Senate Intelligence Committee on May 24, in both cases by \nunanimous vote. Both committees held nomination hearings for Ms. Monaco \nand for both committees, she completed prehearing and post-hearing \nquestions. I know Ms. Monaco also had a chance to meet with members of \nboth committees and it is clear she is impressive and well-qualified.\n  There is no doubt that Ms. Monaco has the experience to be an \neffective Assistant Attorney General for National Security. Let me \ndescribe her background in more detail.\n  Since February 2010, Lisa Monaco has served as the Principal \nAssociate Deputy Attorney General or acted in that capacity, and she \nserved as Associate Deputy Attorney General from January 2009 through \nFebruary 2010.\n  She also has considerable experience with the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, having served as chief of staff to Director Robert \nMueller, September 2007-January 2009.\n  Ms. Monaco spent 6 years as an assistant U.S. attorney for the \nDistrict of Columbia when she received the Attorney General's Award for \nExceptional Service, the Department of Justice's highest award. She \nalso received Department of Justice Awards for Special Achievement on \nthree occasions, in 2002, 2003, and 2005.\n  She received her law degree from the University of Chicago Law \nSchool, 1997, and her B.A. from Harvard University, 1990.\n  Ms. Monaco's nomination has received support from a range of former \nsenior officials of the FBI and Department of Justice, including former \nAttorney General Michael B. Mukasey and former Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for National Security Kenneth L. Wainstein.\n  So we see that Ms. Monaco's background and qualifications are \nimpeccable. I strongly urge the Senate to approve her nomination to be \nthe Assistant Attorney General and wish her success in this position.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. After extensive and unnecessary delays, the Senate will \nfinally vote today on three important nominations to fill high-level \nposts at the Department of Justice. Two of these positions have \nnational security responsibilities. I have been here since the Ford \nadministration, and I cannot recall a time when the Justice Department \nand the country were deprived of such critical appointees. Whether we \nhad a Republican or Democratic President, we always quickly filled \nthese kinds of national security positions. So it is hard to understand \nwhy we have not been able to vote on nominees for positions with \nsignificant national security responsibilities such as the Deputy \nAttorney General and the Assistant Attorney General for the National\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\nSecurity Division--especially when we are 2\\1/2\\ months away from the \n10th anniversary of September 11.\n  The nominations of Jim Cole to be Deputy Attorney General, Lisa \nMonaco to be Assistant Attorney General for National Security, and \nVirginia Seitz to be Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \nCounsel have been blocked for months by Republican obstruction over \nmatters not related to the qualifications of the nominees and in abject \ndisregard of the needs of the Justice Department and the country. So I \nam glad that today we are finally going to vote and, I trust, confirm \nthese superbly qualified nominees.\n  The unprecedented filibuster of the nomination of the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral has been especially egregious. The Deputy Attorney General is \nthe No. 2 position at the Justice Department, and it is a position with \nkey national security responsibilities. Despite significant bipartisan \nsupport and unquestionable qualifications, Jim Cole's nomination has \nbeen blocked for nearly a year. He was reported favorably by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in July of last year--11 months ago--but the \nRepublicans prevented a vote. He was renominated and reported favorably \na second time in the middle of March, but Republicans stalled and \nfilibustered consideration of the nomination last month. During my time \nin the Senate, I have seen the nominations of many Deputy Attorneys \nGeneral. Every time they have been voted on favorably by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee--whether under Republican or Democratic control--\ntheir nomination has been voted on within a matter of days on the \nSenate floor. This is the first time in the Nation's history that a \nPresident's nominee to serve as Deputy Attorney General was \nfilibustered, and it was wrong.\n\n  Jim Cole's nomination should not have been controversial. It is a \nnomination supported by former Republican Senator Jack Danforth, who \nwas nominated by President Bush to be our Ambassador to the United \nNations. Senator Danforth worked with Jim Cole for more than 15 years. \nWhen he introduced him at his confirmation hearing, Senator Danforth \ndescribed Mr. Cole as someone without an ideological or political \nagenda. He also wrote to the committee:\n\n       Jim is a ``lawyer's lawyer.'' He is exceedingly \n     knowledgeable, especially on matters relating to legal and \n     business ethics, public integrity and compliance with \n     government regulations. He is highly regarded . . . as a \n     skillful litigator. As his resume demonstrates, he has long \n     and deep experience in the Department of Justice.\n\n  I agree. Jim Cole served as a career prosecutor at the Justice \nDepartment for a dozen years and has a well-deserved reputation for \nfairness, integrity and toughness. He has demonstrated that he \nunderstands the issues of crime and national security that are at the \ncenter of the Deputy Attorney General's job. Nothing suggests that he \nis anything other than a steadfast defender of American safety.\n  We have received numerous letters of support for Mr. Cole's \nnomination, including letters from many former Republican public \nofficials. I put several of those letters in the Record last month. The \nSenate should have heeded those recommendations as well as the advice \nof former Deputy Attorneys General of the United States who served in \nboth Republican and Democratic administrations. They wrote to us last \nDecember to urge the Senate to consider Mr. Cole's nomination without \ndelay--last December--pointing out that the Deputy Attorney General is \n``the chief operating officer of the Department of Justice, supervising \nits day-to-day operations'' and that ``the Deputy is also a key member \nof the president's national security team, a function that has grown in \nimportance and complexity in the years since the terror attacks of \nSeptember 11.'' They were right. The Senate was wrong to filibuster \nthis nomination. The Senate has the opportunity today to finally \nconfirm this good man and public servant. I trust this institution will \ntake that opportunity.\n  Incredibly, the nomination of the Deputy Attorney General was \nsubjected to a partisan filibuster for over three more months while the \ncountry faces concerns about terrorism in the aftermath of the \nPresident's successful operation against al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. \nIt is hard for me to understand how, at a time when experts are \nconcerned that al-Qaida will seek reprisals, some in the Senate have \ndelayed action to ensure that President Obama has his full national \nsecurity team in place. No matter who is President, we should want that \nPresident to have their national security team in place for the good of \nall Americans.\n  In the aftermath of 9/11, Senate Democrats expedited law enforcement \nand national security nominations, confirming an additional 58 \nofficials to posts at the Justice Department before the end of 2001. \nThe Senate should have done the same with the nomination of Jim Cole. \nSenate Republicans should have treated Mr. Cole's nomination with the \nsame urgency and seriousness with which Senate Democrats treated all \nfour of the Deputy Attorneys General who served under President Bush. \nAll four were confirmed by the Senate by voice vote an average of 21 \ndays after they were reported by the Judiciary Committee. No Deputy \nAttorney General nomination had ever been subjected to a filibuster \nbefore. That is what Senator Republicans did this year. It was wrong.\n  In addition, Senate Republicans have blocked votes on the nomination \nof Lisa Monaco to head the National Security Division at the Justice \nDepartment, another key national security position. Her nomination has \nbeen blocked even though it was considered at hearings and reported \nunanimously, not only by the Judiciary Committee but also by the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence. She was reported unanimously by all \nDemocrats and all Republicans in two key committees. Senator Grassley, \nSenator Chambliss and all the Republican members of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nvoted for her. To have an almost 2-month delay has been incredible--she \nshould have been confirmed right after her nomination was reported by \nthe Intelligence and Judiciary Committees.\n  Lisa Monaco's nomination has long been supported by former Justice \nDepartment officials, including former Attorney General Mukasey, who \nserved during President George W. Bush's administration. He wrote:\n\n       Based on my meetings and conversations with Ms. Monaco, I \n     believe that she has both sound judgment and a keen \n     understanding of national security law. Which is to say, she \n     understands both the stakes and the rules.\n\n  The Monaco nomination to head the National Security Division at the \nJustice Department should have been confirmed before the Memorial Day \nrecess. I have little doubt that she will be confirmed overwhelmingly. \nBut the almost two-month delay is not excused by voting for her \nconfirmation now. The National Security Division has been without her \nleadership. The national security team has been without another key \nmember.\n  Virginia Seitz is another superbly qualified nominee with bipartisan \nsupport who should have been confirmed before the Memorial Day recess, \nbut whose nomination has been blocked from consideration by Senate \nRepublicans. A Rhodes Scholar and former Supreme Court clerk, Ms. Seitz \nhas received support for her nomination from some of the most \npreeminent lawyers in the country, including many who have served in \nRepublican administrations. This nomination was also reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee. All Republican members and all \nDemocratic members voted for her. Then Senate Republicans turned around \nand blocked her confirmation.\n  I have seen the crocodile tears of some over the last few days as \nthey lament the lack of an Office of Legal Counsel opinion on how the \nWar Powers Act applied to the NATO-led operation in Libya. It is Senate \nRepublicans who are responsible for having delayed and blocked the \nOffice of Legal Counsel from having its Assistant Attorney General in \nplace. Today, after 7 weeks of obstruction, the Senate will finally \nconsider the nomination of Virginia Seitz.\n  The treatment of these nominees is now carrying over to other \nnominations and important legislative initiatives, as well. Just last \nweek we witnessed for the first time since the infamous partisan vote \non the nomination of Ronnie White of Missouri, the spectacle of \nRepublican Senators who had voted in favor of a nomination in committee \nswitching to vote against the\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\nnomination when considered by the Senate. We have seen Republican \nSenators, who in consultation with the White House and Judiciary \nCommittee approved a judicial nominee, flipping to oppose the nominee.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has considered two national security \nbills during the last 2 weeks. Both times Republican Senators professed \nto support the legislation as they voted against it. The most critical \nand time sensitive is the bill before the Senate to authorize a limited \nextension of the term of service of FBI Director Robert Mueller, as the \nPresident has requested. The President made his request more than 6 \nweeks ago in light of ``the ongoing threats facing the United States, \nas well as the leadership transitions at other agencies.'' He asked us \n``to join together in extending [Director Mueller's] leadership for the \nsake of our nation's safety and security.''\n  Rather than join together as Senate Democrats did with the President \nfollowing 9/11, 7 of the 8 Republican members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee opposed the bill. We have to consider and pass that bill \nwithout delay. Both the House and Senate have to pass it before the \nAugust recess. With the tenth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, \nattacks approaching, and in the face of continuing threats in the wake \nof the President's recent, successful operation against Osama bin \nLaden, we need the continuity and stability of having FBI Director \nMueller in place. Without enactment of this legislation, he will not \nbe. He will be forced from that critical post on August 3.\n  I urge all Senators, Democrats, Republicans and Independents, to join \ntogether for the good of the country to take quick action to pass the \nFBI extension, S. 1103. We cannot afford a repeat of the unnecessary \ndelays that have held up these nominations finally considered today.\n  I thank today's nominees for their dedication and look forward to \nworking with them as they faithfully execute their important \nresponsibilities at the Justice Department. I also thank their families \nfor their patience and for the support they give these outstanding \npublic servants. In my 37 years in the Senate I have never seen a time \nwhen so many good nominees are held up, even though eventually so many \nthen go through unanimously. I wish Senators would stop and think for a \nmoment: This is awfully hard on their spouses and their children. It is \nawfully hard among their friends who wonder, Is there something we \ndon't know about? Why were they held up so long?\n  We can all take our political positions--and should. We all vote--and \nshould. But let's not take it out on the good Americans who want to \nserve their country, oftentimes at great sacrifice. Remember, we also \ntake it out on their families.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded and to speak as in morning business.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I will not \nobject. But insofar as many had planned to be here for the 12 o'clock \nscheduled votes, could the Senator from Florida tell me how long he \nwishes to take?\n  Mr. RUBIO. Five minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will not object, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 libya\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, over the last 2 weeks, we have seen a \ndeepening divide between the White House and Congress over Libya. It is \na clash that was completely avoidable but also counterproductive.\n  First, for the life of me, I do not understand why this \nadministration did not bring this issue to the Congress from the \noutset. In the early days of the Libyan rebellion, the President should \nhave come to the Congress, informed us that an armed rebellion had \narisen against Libya's anti-American, criminal dictator; that the \nrebels were asking for our assistance in establishing a no-fly zone \nover Libyan air space so they could take care of the dictator \nthemselves; and that with our support, he intended to work with our \nallies to establish such a no-fly zone.\n  If this President had done this, I believe he would have found \nsupport here and Qadhafi would have been gone a long time ago.\n  But instead, this administration waited. While it did, Qadhafi \nreestablished momentum and began to carry out a new level of atrocities \nunprecedented even by his murderous standards. And then, only with the \nQadhafi mercenaries on the outskirts of Benghazi threatening to \nmassacre thousands of innocent civilians, did the United States finally \nagree to participate.\n  But even that was botched. First, we ceded most of the operation over \nto our NATO allies. God bless them for trying, but they do not have the \nmilitary capability to finish the job.\n  Second, the President never consulted Congress, again ignoring a co-\nequal branch of government unnecessarily.\n  And then, when finally he was pressed under the War Powers Act, he \nclaims the United States is not involved in hostilities in Libya.\n  Why we have reached this point is something history will have to \nexplain. Suffice it to say, it didn't have to be this way. And the \nreason why it is is 100 percent the result of the President's failure \nto lead.\n  Now, all that being said, we need to decide what to do next. This is \nnot about hawks versus doves or interventionists versus isolationists \nor any of the other labels being thrown around here.\n  And this cannot be about how upset any of us are at the President for \nbotching the handling of this matter.\n  What we do next should be decided based on what is in the best \ninterest of our country.\n  And here is the reality: Whether you agree with it or not, the United \nStates is now engaged in a fight, and it is a fight that only has two \npossible endings.\n  It can end with the fall of a brutal, criminal, anti-American \ndictator or it could end in that dictator's victory over our allies and \nus.\n  I would suggest, given these two choices, the best choice for America \nis the first one, the fall of the anti-American dictator.\n  Going forward, how do we do this? First, we should officially \nrecognize the Transitional National Council.\n  Second, we should provide additional resources to support the \ncouncil, including access to Libyan funds frozen here in the United \nStates. And by the way, we should also make sure the frozen funds are \nalso used to reimburse us, the United States, for the cost of this \noperation.\n  Third, we should intensify strike operations to target the Qadhafi \nregime and get rid of this guy once and for all, and as soon as \npossible.\n  Then, fourth, we should go home and allow the Libyan people to build \na new nation and a new future for themselves.\n  I understand that, rightfully so, many here in the Congress and \nacross America are weary of more war and more overseas engagement \nduring a time of severe budget constraints at home.\n  But the fact remains, whether you agree with it or not, we are \nalready involved. We are already involved in Libya. We have already \nspent a considerable amount of money there. Are we going to let all \nthat go to waste? Are we prepared to walk away and get stuck with a \nlose-lose proposition? We spent all this money on Libya, and Qadhafi is \nstill around?\n  It is in our national interest to get this over with already.\n  This afternoon, the Foreign Relations Committee will meet to consider \na resolution on this matter. I am concerned that rather than push the \nPresident to do what is necessary to bring this conflict to a \nsuccessful conclusion, some are pushing to restrict our campaign.\n  No matter how you may feel about the original decision, we must now \ndeal with the situation as it now stands. And the bottom line here is \nthat if we withdraw from our air war over Libya, it will lengthen the \nconflict, increase the cost to American taxpayers, and raise doubts \nabout United States leadership among friends and foes alike.\n  Here is what withdrawal will mean in real terms:\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\n  The coalition would quickly unravel. Qadhafi would emerge victorious, \neven more dangerous and determined to seek his revenge through \nterrorism against the countries in NATO and the Arab League that tried \nand failed to overthrow him.\n  We would see a bloodbath inside Libya. This killer, Qadhafi, will \nunleash unspeakable horrors against the Libyan people. And the ripple \neffects will be felt across the Middle East. For example, the \nprodemocracy movements in places like Iran and Syria would conclude \nthat they too might be abandoned and the dictators they oppose would be \nemboldened.\n  Our disengagement would irreparably harm the NATO alliance.\n  I fully understand the frustration at the way the President has \nhandled this situation, but the answer to any problem is not to make it \nworse.\n  Some may think what we do here this afternoon on the resolution is \nlargely symbolic, simply intended to send a message to the White House.\n  Yes, it will send a message to the President, but it will also send a \nmessage to Qadhafi and those around him.\n  And here is the message that I fear we may send: That the coalition \nis breaking and the Qadhafi regime might yet win. I know that is not \nanyone's intention, but that is the very real risk we run.\n  There is a better, more pragmatic way forward.\n  Let's pass a resolution backing these activities.\n  For those frustrated with the President's failure to adequately make \nthe case for our involvement, our job in Congress is to push the \nadministration to do a better job explaining our effort in Libya.\n  Here is the good news: The tide in Libya appears to be turning \nagainst Qadhafi. The opposition in Benghazi has succeeded in expanding \nthe territory under its control, breaking the siege laid by regime \nforces on Misrata, the country's third largest city.\n  At the same time, the Qadhafi regime has been shaken by further \ndefections and collapsing international support.\n  Libya is at a critical juncture. And for the United States, there is \nonly one acceptable outcome--the removal of the Qadhafi regime and, \nwith it, the opportunity for the Libyan people to build a free and \ndemocratic society.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield back all remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of James Michael Cole, of the District of \nColumbia, to be Deputy Attorney General?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Under the previous order, the motions to \nreconsider are considered made and laid upon the table, and the \nPresident shall be immediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, today, the Senate considered the \nnomination of James Cole to be deputy Attorney General of the United \nStates. I voted against his nomination and want to explain my vote.\n  Mr. Cole has been a vocal critic of the use of military commissions \nto try terrorists. Based upon my review of his record, it is apparent \nthat he is an ardent supporter of the use of article III courts to try \nterrorists. He has advocated a criminal law approach to prosecuting \nterrorists. By way of example Mr. Cole has stated:\n\n       For all the rhetoric about war, the September 11 attacks \n     were criminal acts of terrorism against a civilian \n     population.\n\n  Testifying before the Judiciary Committee, he refused to say whether \nhe favored a civilian or military trial for Osama bin Laden, should he \nbe captured alive.\n\n       I believe that such decisions should be made on a case-by-\n     case basis, based on all the relevant factors and \n     circumstances available at the time of the suspect's capture.\n\n  Additionally, under Mr. Cole's watch, the Justice Department has \nannounced that it would try two Iraqi nationals who were arrested in \nKentucky on charges related to attacking and killing U.S. troops in \nIraq, in civilian courts.\n  While Mr. Cole has the academic and legal background necessary to \nfill this position, his actions as Deputy Attorney General and history \nsupporting civilian trials for terrorists clearly establishes that he \nwill pursue an agenda that seeks to ensure that terrorists are tried in \narticle III courts. These issues are of paramount concern and I cannot \nsupport a nominee who subscribes to these views. Accordingly, I had no \nchoice but to oppose this nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4144-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I will be happy to be interrupted by the \nmanagers of the bill if they decide to come.\n\n\n                              imf bailout\n\n  Madam President, there have been several recent warnings of large and \ngrowing risks in global markets from the European debt crisis.\n  If Greece defaults, which investors see as likely, and European \nofficials are unable to agree on how to restructure Greece's debt, lack \nof confidence in sovereign debt could spread.\n  Investors could run away from liabilities issued by other highly \nindebted Eurozone countries or even the debt of the United States.\n  Unfortunately, the President continues his disengagement in our debt \nproblems.\n  The administration continues to advocate more runaway deficit \nspending, continuing down the path toward European-style big \ngovernment.\n  Our debt-financed unsustainable debt is pushing us toward our own \nfiscal crisis. Yet the President has failed to lead us to a sound \nfiscal solution.\n  My concern about the European debt crisis is about the possible \nexposure of the U.S. to a European-led contagion that could lead to \ncatastrophe in the global market for U.S. Treasury securities.\n  The U.S. financial system has exposures to liabilities of the public \nsectors, the banks, and the private sectors of Greece, Portugal, \nIreland, and Spain, four highly indebted Eurozone countries.\n  The extent of the exposure is unclear but is potentially greater than \nhalf a trillion dollars. Given the interconnectedness in global \nfinancial markets, ultimate risk exposure is difficult to disentangle.\n  Most importantly, I am concerned about what all of this means for \nAmerican taxpayers. Americans have made it crystal clear, they do not \nwant more bailouts.\n  Let me remind everyone of President Obama's pledge when he signed the \nDodd-Frank banking act into law last year, an act which, by the way, is \nturning out to be a job-killer and is itself a threat to our financial \nmarkets. The President clearly stated, ``[t]here will be no more tax-\nfunded bailouts--period.''\n  Unfortunately, that promise has proven hollow. Recall that a \nDemocrat-led Congress, urged on by President Obama, upped the U.S. ante \nwith the International Monetary Fund in 2009. Additional funding of up \nto $108 billion was provided to the IMF which can now be used to bail \nout profligate European governments. Make no mistake, bailouts are \ncontinuing and there are threats of even more on the horizon.\n  Let me be clear now, before any crisis hits. There can be no further \nbailouts, of banks or foreign countries or private companies or unions \nor states that are funded by innocent American taxpayers.\n  The people of Utah, whom I represent, and the vast majority of \nAmericans want to hold the President to his promise. They are done with \ntaxpayer-funded bailouts.\n  The administration and the agencies responsible for oversight of our \nfinancial system need to bring some sunshine to this situation, and \nmake clear to the American people just what the bailout risk is from \nthe Eurozone or anywhere else.\n  I am proud to cosponsor with Senator DeMint and several of my \ncolleagues an amendment that will roll back the funding provided to the \nIMF in 2009. To make the President's pledge of no more tax-funded \nbailouts meaningful, and to do what the American people are clearly \ndemanding of Congress, it is imperative to protect taxpayers from \nbailouts of profligate European countries through the IMF.\n  American taxpayers deserve assurance now that they will not be again \nforced to assume risks and losses that they did not create. Taxpayers \ndeserve to know that they will be protected from future bailouts.\n  That is precisely what the amendment that I am cosponsoring will do. \nIt is a simple amendment and its message is clear.\n  No more taxpayer bailouts.\n  If the President is unwilling to fulfill his pledge on his own, there \nare those of us in Congress who are happy to hold him to his word.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for taxpayers and vote for this \ncritical amendment.\n  So far I have been speaking about this administration's abuse of \npower with regard to the IMF. I would like to switch gears for a few \nminutes and talk about another series of abuses that are no less \noutrageous. I am speaking about the Obama administration's labor \nagenda.\n  Over the last month or so, many in this Chamber have expressed \nconcern about the National Labor Relations Board's complaint against \nBoeing. That complaint has been almost universally criticized, if not \noutright condemned, from all corners of the country. Just last week, \nthe Washington Post, not exactly known for having an anti-union bias, \nhad some harsh words for the board's case against Boeing. I ask \nunanimous consent to have the Post's editorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 19, 2011]\n\n                         Flight Risk for Boeing\n\n       The opening of a manufacturing plant with nearly 1,000 jobs \n     should be cause for celebration. But Boeing Co.'s $1 billion \n     facility in South Carolina has met a different, less welcome \n     response.\n       The National Labor Relations Board, spurred by the \n     International Association of Machinists and Aerospace \n     Workers, hit Boeing with a complaint of unfair labor \n     practices. The board charges that Boeing illegally shipped \n     jobs to South Carolina from the company's Washington state \n     facility in retaliation for past strikes by unionized workers \n     in Puget Sound. Both facilities will have a hand in building \n     the company's new and mammoth 787 Dreamliner.\n       The NLRB pegged its case to ``coercive'' threats by Boeing \n     executives who told the media that disruptions caused by the \n     strikes played a role in deciding to build in South Carolina. \n     They also spoke of the need to ``geographically diversify'' \n     to avoid shutdowns caused by natural or man-made disasters \n     and to control costs, which would be easier to do in a \n     ``right-to-work'' state through lower labor costs.\n       As punishment, the NLRB is seeking to compel Boeing to move \n     the Dreamliner jobs in South Carolina to Washington state--\n     which the company says would essentially force it to shut the \n     plant. Boeing calls the proposed punishment ``indisputably \n     the most consequential--and destructive--remedy ever sought \n     by an officer of the NLRB.''\n       The law forbids employers from discriminating or \n     retaliating against employees for lawful union activity. To \n     prevail, an aggrieved party typically must show that the \n     retaliation resulted in demotions, dismissals, wage \n     reductions or other punitive measures. In Boeing's case, \n     these reprisals are absent; the company also claims its \n     collective bargaining agreement gives it the explicit and \n     exclusive right to locate work where it wishes.\n       The allegation that the company ``transferred'' jobs out of \n     state is unconvincing because the jobs in South Carolina are \n     new. The company has not cut jobs in Washington, nor has it \n     demoted or slashed the wages of union workers. Boeing has \n     added about 3,000--albeit temporary--jobs in Washington since \n     it announced its South Carolina plans and says it is likely \n     to add more to keep up with demand for its commercial \n     airliners.\n       Employers who engage in unfair labor practices should be \n     penalized. But the NLRB's move goes too far and would \n     undermine a company's ability to consider all legitimate \n     factors--including potential work disruptions--when making \n     plans. It also substitutes the government's judgment for that \n     of the company. This is neither good law nor good business.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Also last week, the NLRB released a notice of proposed \nrulemaking, aiming to drastically reduce the time between the filing of \na union election petition and the vote to\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\ncertify the union. The motivation behind this proposal is simple, the \nless notice the employers have regarding a union election, the less \ntime they will have to make their case to the workforce.\n  Unions and their democratic allies have sought these kinds of so-\ncalled reforms for decades. I want to be clear. For all of their talk \nabout representing the little guy, and standing for the people, these \nreforms are an affront to the spirit of democracy. They show disrespect \nfor employees by attempting to deny them critical information that \ncould inform their choices in these elections. Their genesis is not in \na concern for the common man but in the unholy alliance between union \napparatchiks who want to grow their power and union dues, and the latte \nleft that depend on those dues to elect representatives who have little \nin common with the workers whose paychecks get docked to elect them.\n  Unfortunately, now that President Obama has packed the NLRB with \nformer union lawyers, they look poised to get these rules. Let us be \nclear. This is a win for union bosses. But it is a big loss for the \nworkers they purport to represent.\n  I will have much more to say about the NLRB in the coming days. But, \ntoday, I want to focus on another runaway Obama agency that is setting \naside established rules and procedures in order to pay back the \nPresident's union supporters.\n  The National Mediation Board, which has jurisdiction over labor \nrelations in the railroad and airline industries, has, like the NLRB, \naggressively pursued a unionization-at-all-costs agenda. While the \nNMB's activities have not received the same attention as those of the \nNLRB, their actions are every bit as egregious.\n  Last summer, the NMB, at the behest of big labor, changed the voting \nprocedures for all union elections under its jurisdiction. For 75 \nyears, an airline or railroad union had to win the support of a \nmajority of the entire workforce in order to be certified as the \nrepresentative. Under that system, workers who did not vote in an \nelection were counted as no votes.\n  The logic of this rule was sound. Unions do not seek to represent \njust the workers that vote in an election. A union claims to represent \nthe entire workforce. The established rule ensured that the results of \nan election accurately reflected the will of a true majority of a given \nworkforce.\n  Unfortunately, logic and common sense often stand in the way of the \nbig labor agenda.\n  So in 2010 the NMB unilaterally changed the rule to lower the bar. \nNow these elections are decided by a majority of those voting in an \nelection, regardless of how many workers actually voted. In other \nwords, under the new rule a union could be certified even if a majority \nof the workers did not support it.\n  Given the timing of this decision, one can only conclude that the \npro-union appointees on the NMB were specifically targeting Delta \nAirlines for unionization after its merger with Northwest Airlines. I \nthink it would be naive to assume otherwise.\n  But here is the remarkable thing.\n  The stage was set for a union cakewalk. Shortly after the NMB fixed \nthe rules to secure a pro-union outcome, there was an election among \nDelta's flight attendants to determine if they wanted to be represented \nby the Association of Flight Attendants or AFA.\n\n  All the rails were greased for the union.\n  And the union still lost.\n  The result was a triumph of employees over the union bosses.\n  The employees had three options.\n  One, voting yes to certify AFA representation; two, voting no to \nreject certification or, three, writing in an alternative choice for \nrepresentation.\n  The NMB did its best to fix this for the union. They counted the \nwrite-in votes, votes clearly supporting an option other than the AFA, \nas votes in favor of the union.\n  But when the dust settled, with 94 percent of Delta's flight \nattendants voting in the election, the union still lost. Of course, the \nunions cried foul and have challenged those results. The NMB, which has \nshown little desire thus far to vindicate the rights of non-union \nworkers, let alone those of employers, is currently investigating the \nAFA's claims that Delta interfered in the vote.\n  I think we can guess how this investigation will turn out.\n  This recent election was not the only setback the unions have \nreceived at the hands of Delta employees. Last fall, three other Delta \nworkforces, the ticket agents, the bagging agents, and the reservation \nagents, all held separate union elections, all of which ended with \nsimilar results. The NMB is also investigating claims of interference \nin those elections, even though no substantive evidence has been \npresented.\n  With these latter three elections, the union suitor was the \nInternational Association of Machinists, the same union whose interests \nthe NLRB is serving with its absurd complaint against Boeing. If the \nObama administration's commitment to serving IAM is consistent between \nagencies, and there is absolutely no reason to assume otherwise, I \nthink we can predict just how those investigations will turn out.\n  There is no time limit on the NMB's investigations. Delta has no way \nof knowing whether it is in the clear or whether it needs to prepare \nfor more elections. More importantly, Delta's workers, who have \nrepeatedly rejected unionization, will likely see no end to the \nbothersome pressure that comes with a union election campaigns.\n  I think it is safe to say that, with the Obama NMB in charge, the \nnumber of union elections among Delta employees will be limited only by \nthe time it takes for the unions to finally win one.\n  The NMB is behaving like the bureaucratic equivalent of the scorer's \ntable at the 1972 men's basketball gold medal game.\n  They are going to give the unions as many chances as they need to win \nthis fight.\n  Labor law and policy plays an important role in our economy. In many \nrespects, it determines which businesses will succeed and which will \nfail. It plays a significant role in decisions as to whether companies \nshould invest in the U.S. or somewhere else.\n  Sadly, it has become customary to expect pendulum swings in labor law \neach time the White House changes hands and appoints new government \nofficials to lead the Federal executive branch and independent \nagencies. While this should not be the case, I do not think we've ever \nseen the pendulum swing as far as it has under the Obama \nadministration.\n  Unions represent less than 8 percent of the private sector workforce. \nYet with President Obama in office, the union influence has been \nvirtually immeasurable. This should not be surprising. During the 2008 \ncampaign, President Obama addressed a gathering of the SEIU, probably \nthe most politically powerful union in the country. During his speech, \nthe President told the crowd if he were elected, ``we are going to \npaint the Nation purple with SEIU.''\n  Apparently, Madam President, this is the one campaign promise \nPresident Obama intends to keep.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           A Broken Wasington\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Madam President, I have been here for \nalmost 6 months now, but I have been carefully watching Washington for \nthe last 32 years while I have been running my manufacturing business \nin Oshkosh, WI--watching how increasingly broken Washington has become \nover the years. Nothing I have seen in the last 6 months has changed \nthat evaluation.\n  Washington is broken and America is going broke. Our economy is in a \ncoma and people are suffering. America hungers for leadership, and it \nis not getting any--not from President Obama and not from the Senate. \nWe can't afford to have a broken political process--not now, not while \nAmerica is hurtling toward a financial crisis.\n  Under Democratic leadership, it has been over 2 years since the \nSenate passed a budget, and there is currently no markup going on in \nthe Budget Committee to produce one. America is going bankrupt. Yet the \nSenate refuses to pass a budget.\n  The President's budget that he presented several months ago to great \nfanfare--remember that--4\\1/4\\ inches thick,\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\n2,400 pages long, and who knows how many thousands of man hours that \ndocument took to produce--was going to be the solution to our fiscal \nproblems. But it was so unserious it would have added over $12 trillion \nto our Nation's debt. It was so unserious that when it was voted on in \nthe Senate, it lost by a vote of 0 to 97. It was so unserious that not \na single member of the President's own party voted for it.\n  Instead of rolling up his shirt sleeves and personally tackling the \nNo. 1 problem facing this Nation right from the beginning, President \nObama delegated his role in sporadic negotiations to Vice President \nBiden. Now that those talks have broken down, the President is finally \ngetting personally involved in this process.\n  But what kind of process is this? A few people talking behind closed \ndoors, far from the view of the American public, is that the process \nthat is going to decide the fate of America's financial situation, of \nour financial future? Is this how the U.S. Government is supposed to \nwork? I don't think so. Of course not.\n  Unfortunately, this has become business as usual in Washington. As a \nmanufacturer, I know if the process is bad the product will be bad. \nBusiness as usual in Washington is a bad process. Business as usual is \nbankrupting America. It must stop. America is simply too precious to \nsubject our financial future to Washington's business as usual.\n  I am pretty new here. I don't pretend to understand everything that \nmakes the Senate work, or maybe more accurately what doesn't allow the \nSenate to work. But I do know the Senate runs on something called \nunanimous consent. So unless we receive some assurance from the \nDemocratic leadership that we will actually start addressing our budget \nout in the open, in the bright light of day, I will begin to object. I \nwill begin to withhold my consent.\n  The Senate needs to pass a budget. It shouldn't be that difficult. \nFamilies do it every day. A husband earns $40,000; a wife earns \n$40,000. The total family income is $80,000. That is their budget. That \nis what they can afford to spend. American families figure out how to \nlive within their means. The Federal Government should be no different. \nA budget is a number. We should first pick one number and then a set of \nnumbers that will not let America go bankrupt.\n  Let me start the process by throwing out a number--$2.6 trillion. \nThat is $800 billion more than we spent just 10 years ago. The $2.6 \ntrillion is the amount President Obama, in his budget, said the Federal \nGovernment would receive in revenue next year. If we only spent that \namount of money we would be living within our means. What a concept.\n  If we want to spend more than $2.6 trillion, Members of Congress, \nmembers of this administration, should go before congressional \ncommittees and openly justify what they want to spend, how much they \nwant to borrow, and how much debt they are willing to pile on the backs \nof our children, our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren. They \nshould explain just how much of our children's future they are willing \nto mortgage.\n  The American people deserve to be told the truth. Unless that \nhappens, I will begin to withhold my consent. Unless there is some \nassurance the Senate will take up its budget responsibilities in an \nopen process, I will begin to object.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  The assistant bill clerk continued with the call of the roll, and the \nfollowing Senators entered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n                             [Quorum No. 2]\n\n     Alexander\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Reid\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will support the nomination \nof GEN David Petraeus to be Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency. Over the many years that he has served our country, he has \nproven himself time and again as a man of integrity, who will act in \nthe best interests of the nation and--in this new position--the men and \nwomen of the CIA.\n  As one of the finest military leaders of our time, General Petraeus \nhas been instrumental in the fight against Islamic extremism, playing \nkey roles as Commanding General in Iraq and Afghanistan and as the \nCommander of U.S. Central Command. He has developed great expertise and \ndeep knowledge of the threats we still face in South Asia and the \nMiddle East. He will now take that expertise and knowledge to the CIA, \nwhere he will use different tools to face those and many other national \nsecurity challenges around the world.\n  Despite my support for the general, I would be remiss if I did not \nadd that I am concerned about a statement he made in answer to a \nquestion I asked during his Senate Intelligence Committee nomination \nhearing on June 23, 2011. General Petraeus has been on the record time \nand again explaining that torture does not fit with American values, \nthat it creates new enemies, and perhaps most importantly, that it \nisn't effective. Yet he did not give a simple answer at the hearing \nwhen I asked him whether he sees torture any differently in a CIA \ncontext than in a military context.\n  Instead, he suggested that there might be a ``special case'' in which \nenhanced interrogation techniques might be an acceptable last resort \noption, for example, in the ``nuclear football'' scenario, where the \ngovernment has in custody an individual who has placed a nuclear device \nunder the Empire State Building, and only he has the codes to turn it \noff.\n  I understand the general's point that such a scenario--in which there \nis specific knowledge of imminent devastation--would be the exception, \nnot the rule, and that it is a hypothetical one that might never occur \nin reality. He is certainly not the first to raise the ticking timebomb \nquestion in this context, nor is he the first to suggest that \npolicymakers consider addressing this question in statute.\n  Perhaps it is time for Congress to weigh in definitively on the CIA's \ninterrogation techniques. Today, only President Obama's executive \norder--not a law--prohibits the CIA's use of coercive interrogation, so \nit's possible that a new administration might decide to move this \npolicy in a different direction. As I told General Petraeus at last \nweek's hearing, I look forward to a debate and discussion with him \nabout this important issue.\n  And as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I look forward \nto working with CIA Director Petraeus on our country's many \nintelligence and national security challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4148-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4148-S4149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTENTION TO OBJECT--S.1145\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S4148, June 28, 2011, the Record reads: NOTICE OF INTENT\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: INTENTION TO \nOBJECT-S. 1145\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to alert my colleagues that \nI intend to object to any unanimous consent agreement for the \nconsideration of S. 1145, the Civilian Extraterritorial Jurisdiction \nAct, CEJA. While I joined in supporting a vote to report S. 1145 out of \nthe Judiciary Committee, my vote does not signal my support for the \nlegislation in its current form. Unless changes are made to address my \nconcerns with the legislation, I will continue to object.\n  I oppose S. 1145 in its current form because it does not include a \nsufficient carve-out for intelligence, law enforcement, or protective \nassignments by U.S. Government employees abroad. The current version of \nS. 1145 does include a carve-out for intelligence activities, but the \ncurrent version of the intelligence carve-out is problematic. There is \nrepetition in the language and extraneous language is unnecessary. \nFurther, under the current carve-out an intelligence agent may not be \nprotected from prosecution, even though he was authorized to undertake \nan operation. The current provision in the bill would require that a \nsupervisor's directive be authorized and also be ``consistent with \napplicable U.S. law.'' This extra requirement opens up a world of \nquestions. How should an agent in the field know his supervisor's \ninstruction was ``consistent with applicable U.S. law''? Will this \nprovision now require agents to obtain a legal opinion before they take \naction? This is not the message we should be sending to the agents in \nthe field.\n  Instead, I proposed a carve-out in the Judiciary Committee that would \nexclude government employees performing intelligence, law enforcement, \nand protective assignments abroad. This version was based upon existing \nU.S. law that some members of the Judiciary Committee previously \nsupported. If the carve-out I proposed is good enough for employees \noperating inside the United States, it should be good enough for those \noperating abroad. Why would we give agents operating in the U.S. more \nprotections than those operating in foreign lands?\n  Further, the current carve-out in S. 1145 is not the preferred \nlanguage that the intelligence community proposed at the beginning of \nnegotiations. If past is any prologue, this appears to be yet another \ninstance where the intelligence community is settling for language it \ncan ``live with'' as opposed to the optimal language it should be \nseeking. This same problem occurred in negotiations during \nconsideration of legislation extending the three expiring provisions of \nthe USA PATRIOT Act. Ultimately, extraneous language that would have \nrestricted the ability of law enforcement and the intelligence \ncommunity was removed from the extension of the PATRIOT Act authorities \nand a similar outcome should occur on CEJA.\n  I also oppose S. 1145 in its current form because the legislation \ndoes not\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\ncurrently include the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, UVVA, in the list \nof covered offenses that would apply to crime victims abroad. The UVVA \napplies to violent Federal crimes in the United States, and to \nemployees and contractors of the Department of Defense abroad under the \nMilitary Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act. There is no reason that \nextending the long arm of Federal criminal law expanded under CEJA \nshould exclude the UVVA.\n  No one would dispute the importance of holding government employees \nand contractors accountable abroad. I support the idea of this \nlegislation because we should never have government employees or \ncontractors committing serious crimes like rape or murder abroad with \nimpunity. However, we need to think long and hard about the \nconsequences of our actions if we legislate criminal extraterritorial \njurisdiction too broadly absent a sufficient carve-out for authorized \nintelligence, law enforcement, and protective activities.\n  Until these concerns are addressed and further changes are included \nin the bill, I support holding this legislation on the Senate floor. No \none should take my support for reporting this bill out of committee to \nmean anything more than an expression of my willingness to work with \nthe sponsors on this topic to address these concerns going forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4149-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   KYRGYZSTAN'S DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is a critical moment for Kyrgyzstan's \ndemocratic transition.\n  On June 27, 2010, the people of Kyrgyzstan took to the polls to adopt \na new constitution for their country. The vote sent a powerful message \nto the region and to the world: that democracy is an idea whose appeal \ntranscends ethnic divides.\n  Kyrgyzstan's President, Roza Otunbayeva, deserves enormous credit for \norchestrating the transition to democratic rule after the deadly \ninterethnic clashes of last summer.\n  Since that tumultuous period, President Otunbayeva has overseen the \nfirst free and truly democratic parliamentary elections in central \nAsia. She has made it a priority to strengthen the rule of law, and she \nhas moved to create a government that is increasingly responsive to the \nneeds of all its citizens, regardless of ethnicity.\n  Kyrgyzstan today stands at a crossroads. Its people have expressed \nthe desire to live in an open, free, and just society. Over the past \nyear, we have witnessed some progress toward that goal, with credible \nparliamentary elections in October, the formation of a government in \nDecember, and a more vibrant media and political debate.\n  But let's be clear: Kyrgyzstan's democratic experiment faces \nconsiderable challenges.\n  Three, in particular, threaten the aspirations that powered last \nyear's historic vote.\n  First, Kyrgyzstan's coalition government is beset by infighting. The \ntask of rebuilding the country after the turmoil of the past year is \ndaunting. But the challenges should also inspire a sense of common \npurpose. Upcoming Presidential elections in the fall present an \nopportune moment for Kyrgyzstan's leadership to articulate a political \ncompact that unites the diverse elements of its society.\n  Second, the country's fractious political environment has impeded \nefforts to combat organized crime and corruption. Rampant crime has \nheightened the sense of insecurity among citizens, created an \nunfavorable climate for business, and slowed economic growth. To the \ngovernment's credit, over 90 members of organized criminal groups are \nnow behind bars. But much work remains to be done to reform \nKyrgyzstan's judicial system and strengthen controls over its borders.\n  The United States can play a constructive role by providing financial \nsupport and technical expertise. We must also speak out forcefully for \nevenhandedness in the prosecution of cases related to last year's \nviolence. Guaranteeing justice and equality before the law would go a \nlong way toward alleviating interethnic tensions.\n  Finally, Kyrgyzstan must deal with the underlying causes of last \nyear's violence. Reconciliation initiatives have been slow to get off \nthe ground. And tensions between ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbek communities \ncontinue to fester.\n  Mr. President, Kyrgyzstan is a multi-ethnic state. Its diversity is a \nsource of strength. But too often, opportunistic actors have exploited \nethnicity to settle scores, acquire resources, and reclaim land in the \nfertile plains of the Ferghana valley.\n  Last June, Senator Lugar and I authored a resolution on Kyrgyzstan \ncalling for a full and fair investigation into the violence. The \nrecently released report of the Kyrgyzstan Inquiry Commission is a \nwelcome contribution to this debate, and I hope that all parties will \ngive serious consideration to its findings.\n  The United States has committed over $28 million for projects that \nwill support reconciliation in Kyrgyzstan. A portion of these funds \nwill engage civil society to increase links between Kyrgyz and Uzbek \ncommunities. U.S. assistance will also support implementation of the \nrecommendations contained in the inquiry commission's report. Going \nforward, we must continually look for ways to bring Kyrgyz and Uzbeks \ntogether through economic and community-based initiatives.\n  I harbor no illusions about the road ahead. Indeed, no experiment--\ndemocratic or otherwise--has been without its fair share of setbacks. \nBut I remain confident that the people of Kyrgyzstan will seize this \nmoment and advance the cause of democracy for the benefit of their \ncountry, the region, and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4149-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4149-S4150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING SAN FRANCISCO FIREFIGHTERS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nthe memory of Lieutenant Vincent ``Vince'' Perez, and Firefighter and \nParamedic Anthony ``Tony'' Valerio. Both of these heroes were long time \nveterans of the San Francisco Fire Department who were tragically \nkilled in the line of duty fighting a fire on June 2, 2011.\n  During their many years of service to the city of San Francisco, both \nVincent and Anthony earned the respect and admiration of those with \nwhom they worked by consistently going above and beyond the call of \nduty. Both men led by example, and were considered shining stars among \nSan Francisco's courageous and dedicated firefighters.\n  Vincent was a San Francisco native, growing up in San Francisco's \nMission District and Bernal Heights neighborhoods. He attended St. \nCharles Elementary School, and graduated from Archbishop Riordan High \nSchool in 1981. After high school, Vincent attended City College of San \nFrancisco, and then served his country in the U.S. Marine Corps and \nlater as a deputy sheriff in Alameda County.\n  In 1990, Vincent joined the San Francisco Fire Department, ultimately \nrising to the position of lieutenant, where he supervised the crew of \nEngine Company 26, located in San Francisco's Diamond Heights \nneighborhood.\n  Vincent is survived by his mother Irene; siblings Lucio, Maryleen, \nand Alexander; many other family members and loved ones; and was \npreceded in death by his father Vincent and brother David.\n  Anthony was born in Fort Monmouth, NJ, and later moved to the San \nFrancisco Bay Area. In 1975, he graduated from El Camino High School in \nSouth San Francisco and then went on to earn an associate's degree from \nSan Francisco State University.\n  He embarked on his career in public service in 1980, starting as an \nEMT at Acme Western in the city of Oakland and later as a paramedic for \n13 years with the San Francisco Department of Public Health. In 1997, \nAnthony began serving the City as both a firefighter and paramedic who \nwas assigned to numerous fire stations in the city, including his last \nassignment with Engine Company 26.\n  Anthony is survived by his parents Lorraine and Frank; siblings \nJacqueline, Donna, Marina, Laura, Mark, and Kevin; and many other \nfamily members and loved ones.\n  Lieutenant Vincent Perez and Firefighter and Paramedic Anthony \nValerio dedicated their lives to their family, community, and Nation, \nand they will long be remembered for their courage and dedication. \nTheir service and bravery inspired others and both\n\n[[Page S4150]]\n\nwill be deeply missed by all who knew them.

Mr. President, it is a delight to call the Senate's \nattention to the record of 75 years of quality productions achieved by \nthe Weston Playhouse Theatre Company as they celebrate this major \nmilestone with their community and friends. Among its many accolades--\nincluding the Moss Hart Award for Best Production in New England for \n``Floyd Collins''--Weston's Playhouse has earned a national reputation \nas a professional theatre. As Vermont's oldest theater, and one of the \n15 oldest theatre companies across the United States, the Weston \nPlayhouse has entertained families and visitors from New England and \nbeyond since its founding in 1935. Its first professional season in \n1937 included the opening of Noel Coward's ``Hay Fever,'' featuring \nyoung actor Lloyd Bridges. Since then the Weston Playhouse has grown to \ninclude musicals and late-night entertainment, cradled in Weston's \nsmall village of 640 people.\n  Consistent with Vermonters' willful determination and hard work, \nWeston's Playhouse Theatre Company endured a 1962 fire that destroyed \nthe original playhouse building. Despite this hardship, the community \npulled their resources together and continued to provide Vermonters and \nNew England with quality theatre and musical experiences. Today the \ncompany serves 25,000 Vermonters and Vermont visitors each year with \nits devoted staff, talented artists, and dedicated board. The Weston \nPlayhouse Theatre Company has routinely met their goals of making live \ntheatre accessible and meaningful to a broad population of Vermonters. \nResource support through the National Endowment for the Arts has \nallowed the playhouse to expand its offerings of cultural experiences \nto thousands of elementary, middle and high school aged children every \nyear. Their outreach programs have promoted educational productions and \nhave toured often throughout Vermont and New England while continuing \nto produce prestigious regional and world premieres.\n  Marcelle and I have always enjoyed attending theatre productions in \nVermont, and we have wonderful memories of the time we have spent with \nthe Weston Playhouse Theatre Company, as well as of the wonderful \npeople we have met at the theatre. It is important to our State that we \ncontinue to host diverse actors and actresses on Vermont's stages, \nenriching the lives of Vermonters across the State. Anyone who has \ncontemplated a painting in a museum, examined an original manuscript or \ncomposition, or disappeared into a performance as the lights dimmed--\nand has gained a greater understanding of both the artist and the \nsubject as a result--knows the power and importance of these works in \nour lives. I am proud to join in honoring the Weston Playhouse Theatre \nCompany for 75 wonderful years of achievements that have enriched our \nheritage and the quality of life in the marvelous Green Mountain State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4150-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      REMEMBERING BEN GRUSSENDORF\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I wish to memorialize a great \nAlaskan, Mr. Ben Grussendorf. A public servant, master teacher, \ncommunity activist, legislator, outdoorsman, and all-around gentleman, \nBen Grussendorf died June 17, 2011. He is survived by his wife of 48 \nyears, Karen, son Tim, daughter Karla, and four grandchildren.\n  Born February 23, 1942, in Grand Rapids, MN, Ben attended the \nUniversity of Minnesota, where he earned a B.A. in political science \nand an M.A. in political science education.\n  In 1967, eager to fish, hunt, and hike, Ben and Karen moved to Sitka, \nAK, to teach. Ben taught government and social sciences at Sitka High \nSchool and Sitka Community College, but his attraction to politics and \ngovernment soon drew him to help shape a strong future for his adopted \ncommunity. Ben was elected to the Charter Commission, and became its \nchair, leading the effort to write unification documents which continue \nto govern the city and borough of Sitka. He was subsequently elected \nfor two terms to serve as mayor of this unified government. In 1980, \nSitka voters sent him to the State House of Representatives where he \nserved 10 terms, a full 20 years.\n  In the legislature, Ben earned a reputation as a diplomat. He was a \nman who focused on problems and solutions rather than party and \npolitics. The respect he showed by listening to differing viewpoints \nopened the door for people of all backgrounds and political persuasions \nto create a climate of compromise. Ben knew true leadership was born, \nnot in brazen ideas or self-promotion, but in the ability to win allies \nand build coalitions. Because of his ability to nurture friendships on \nboth sides of the aisle, he was elected as Speaker of the House for an \nunprecedented three terms.\n  As speaker, Ben brokered compromises which put the public first. Fair \nto everyone, his calm composure and down-home sense of humor defused \ntension and brought people together; his vision and diplomacy kept them \nfocused on the greater good.\n  Throughout his tenure in the House, Ben was renowned for his \npatience, discretion, and expertise. He knew the nooks and crannies \nboth of the legislative process and the issues. Colleagues relied on \nhim for inside knowledge of Alaskan politics to affect change and make \na difference. They remember him as an important teacher and mentor, one \nwho led by example.\n  When Ben announced his retirement from the Legislature in 2000, he \ncited his original Alaska draw--time to hunt, fish, and walk his dogs. \nBecause of his passion for wildlife and capitalizing on his legislative \nexpertise, Governor Tony Knowles convinced him to accept appointment to \nthe Alaska Board of Game in 2001. There, he put his listening and \ndiplomatic skills to further use, tackling important challenges such as \ncaribou herd management and subsistence policy. His effectiveness and \ndiplomacy earned him successive reappointments by Governors Murkowski, \nPalin, and Parnell.\n  Whether hunting, fishing, hiking, gardening, or just observing, Ben \nwas an outdoorsman at heart. He was also a writer who kept a journal, \nwrote short stories and drafted manuscripts about subjects he well \nunderstood--politics and nature.\n  Ben Grussendorf's devotion to Sitka and to Alaska, whether as a \nteacher, a legislator, a member of the Board of Game, or a member of \ncommunity service organizations, was inspirational. He made a \ndifference with every commitment, and his years of working on issues \nimportant to people throughout the State will be part of his legacy as \nan Alaska statesman. He will be deeply missed by his family and his \nmany friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4150-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4150-S4151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DEVILS POSTPILE NATIONAL MONUMENT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating the centennial of Devils Postpile National Monument in the \nEastern Sierra of California.\n  When Devils Postpile was first surveyed in the early 20th century, it \nbecame apparent to geologists that its distinctive formation and \nfeatures of the surrounding landscape provided a special window into \nthe volcanic and glacial processes that shaped the Sierra Nevada as a \nwhole.\n  The cliff of columnar basalt that constitutes the Devils Postpile, so \nnamed because it looks like tall posts piled together, is one of the \nwonders of the geological world. The columns can reach heights towering \nmore than 60 feet. Those on the west front are high, straight and \nclean-cut; those at its southern end stand out for their curvature.\n  Shortly after the initial survey, U.S. Forest Service Engineer Walter \nHuber learned of a plan to blast portions of the Devils Postpile to \ncreate a dam that would flood the middle fork of the San Joaquin River \nand provide power to nearby mining operations. Mr. Huber considered the \nidea as a ``wanton destruction of scenery'' and began the effort to \nestablish a monument to protect Devils Postpile along with the nearby \nRainbow Falls, a spectacular\n\n[[Page S4151]]\n\n101-foot waterfall named for the rainbow that often forms in its mist.\n  Support for monument designation was substantial, including a letter \nof support from the Sierra Club signed by the renowned preservationist \nJohn Muir. On July 6, 1911, using the authority under the Antiquities \nAct of 1906, President William Howard Taft signed the proclamation \ncreating Devils Postpile National Monument.\n  With the growth of the interstate highway system in the 1950s, a \nproposal for an eight-lane trans-Sierra highway connecting Fresno to \nMammoth Lakes came forward that would have resulted in destruction to \nthe landscape and the character of the monument. The effort to stop the \nhighway was long and at times difficult. But, with strong opposition \nfrom a group of committed local residents, businessowners and packers, \nthe proposal to build the trans-Sierra highway was abandoned in 1972.\n  The expansion of existing wilderness areas and the designation of the \nAnsel Adams Wilderness in 1984 brought further protection of Devils \nPostpile and the surrounding peaks and valley that constitute the \nbreathtaking landscape of the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin Valley. I \nam pleased that in 2009 President Obama signed legislation I authored \nproviding additional wilderness protection to public lands in the \nimmediate area.\n  Today, Devils Postpile National Monument represents the special \nqualities highlighted in the Presidential Proclamation that led to its \ncreation a century ago as a place of ``scientific interest'' and \n``public enjoyment.'' Every year, tens of thousands of visitors from \nall over the world travel to the Eastern Sierra to marvel at its \nnatural beauty and rich history.\n  The story of the Devils Postpile National Monument's first 100 years \nis a testament to the value of preservation, scientific research, and \nrecreation. I applaud the partnership between the National Park Service \nand the U.S. Forest Service which has resulted in high quality visitor \nservices and the preservation of the beauty of the Middle Fork of the \nSan Joaquin River.\n  As the friends and staff of the Devils Postpile National Monument \ngather to celebrate this auspicious occasion, I congratulate them on \ntheir centennial anniversary and wish everyone a memorable \nexperience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4151-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO JUSTICE JUDITH MEIERHENRY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I recognize \nthe service of Judith K. Meierhenry to the Unified Judicial System of \nSouth Dakota. In June of this year, Justice Meierhenry will retire \nafter nearly 9 years as associate justice on the South Dakota Supreme \nCourt.\n  Justice Judith Meierhenry was educated at the University of South \nDakota where she received her bachelor's, master's, and juris doctorate \ndegrees. Upon completion of her education, Justice Meierhenry practiced \nlaw in Vermillion in 1977 and 1978. She began her service to the State \nof South Dakota in 1979 when Governor Janklow appointed her to the \nState Economic Opportunity Office. This was just the beginning of her \ncommitment to South Dakota; she was appointed as Secretary of Labor \nbeginning in 1980 and Secretary of Education and Cultural Affairs in \n1983.\n  In 1985, Justice Meierhenry left the public sector and worked as a \nsenior manager and assistant general counsel for Citibank in Sioux \nFalls, SD. Justice Meierhenry was appointed by Governor Mickelson in \n1988 as a Second Circuit Court judge serving Lincoln and Minnehaha \nCounties. She became presiding judge of the Second Judicial Circuit in \n1997.\n  Governor Janklow appointed Justice Meierhenry to the South Dakota \nSupreme Court in 2002. This historic appointment made her the first \nwoman to serve on South Dakota's highest court. Though no female had \npreceded her in this post, Justice Meierhenry succeeded in this \ndemanding position and now leaves her position having set a standard of \nexcellence for her successors, regardless of gender, to follow. Through \nher service, female judges and attorneys in South Dakota's legal system \nnow have available to them an exemplary female role model and owe a \ndebt of gratitude to Justice Meierhenry. The citizens of the State of \nSouth Dakota are better for the public service of Judith Meierhenry.\n  According to Chief Justice David Gilbertson, during her time on the \nSouth Dakota Supreme Court:\n\n       Justice Judith Meierhenry has contributed to the legal \n     scholarship of that body in resolving the disputes that come \n     before it. Whether it be a traffic ticket or a death penalty \n     conviction, Justice Meierhenry has approached each case with \n     the application of the highest of legal scholarship. The \n     South Dakota Supreme Court, the legal profession of South \n     Dakota and all of the citizens of South Dakota are all better \n     off for the public service of Justice Judith Meierhenry.\n\n  South Dakota Second Judicial Circuit court judge Patricia Riepel also \nnotes that Justice Meierhenry ``was always well-prepared and decisive, \nshe required decorum in her courtroom as well as civility and \ncordiality to all of the participants, and she has worked tirelessly \nfor the advancement of women within the legal profession, and \nespecially within the judiciary.''\n  I wish Justice Meierhenry a happy and healthy retirement. In her own \nwords, ``life and time are our only real possessions,'' and it is time \nthat she reclaim those possessions for herself and her family. I thank \nJustice Meierhenry for her commitment to the rule of law and her long \nand distinguished career serving the State of South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4151-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL ANTHONY WRIGHT\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is with great privilege that I \ncongratulate COL Anthony Wright, Seattle district engineer for the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers, on his well-deserved retirement after 30 years \nwith the Army Corps. Colonel Wright has been stationed with the Seattle \nDistrict for 3 years and my staff and I have had the pleasure of \nworking extensively with him during that time.\n  Western Washington State has suffered several severe storms in the \nlast few years, resulting in devastating floods, major losses of \ninfrastructure, and millions of dollars of damage to homes and \nbusinesses. Under Colonel Wright's leadership, the Army Corps responded \nquickly and efficiently to minimize the threats of rising floodwaters, \nand for this we are very grateful. His professionalism and expertise \nhelped our region through disasters and undoubtedly lessened the \ndestruction and prevented the loss of life.\n  An example of Colonel Wright's leadership ability was his response to \na storm that caused serious damage to the Howard Hanson Dam in King \nCounty, raising the flood threat for hundreds of thousands of residents \nin the Green River Valley, which is home to one of the largest \nmanufacturing and distribution bases on the West Coast. Colonel Wright \nand the Army Corps reacted quickly and decisively to counter this \nvulnerability, working with local governments and the public to ensure \nthat the region was prepared until the dam could be repaired.\n  On behalf of all Washingtonians, I thank Colonel Wright for his \ndedication to the safety and well-being of the people of western \nWashington. His knowledge, experience, and tireless effort will be \nsorely missed. I congratulate Colonel Wright and wish he and his family \nthe best of luck in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4151-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4151-S4152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       A TRIBUTE TO BOBBY ALLISON\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \nrecognize racing legend Robert ``Bobby'' Arthur Allison upon his \ninduction into the second class of the NASCAR Hall of Fame. Bobby is a \nfounding member of the ``Alabama Gang'' and one of the greatest drivers \nof NASCAR's modern era.\n  NASCAR is the most popular and competitive racing organization in the \nUnited States, and its premier league, the Sprint Cup Series, draws \nthousands of fans to each of its 36 races. Last year, NASCAR opened the \nNASCAR Hall of Fame to honor the sport's greatest contributors, \ninducting Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt, Junior Johnson, Bill France, \nSr., and Bill France, Jr. In the second class of inductees, Bobby, \nalong with racing greats Ned Jarrett, David Pearson, and Lee Petty, and \nteam owner Bud Moore, joined these elite racers in receiving one of the \nsport's highest honors.\n  Bobby Allison entered his first race while he was still a high school \nstudent in southern Florida, needing written permission from his mother \nto compete. Seizing the opportunity to race\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\ncompetitively, he and his brother, Donnie, left Florida along with \nfellow racer Red Farmer, and settled in Hueytown, AL. These three young \nmen became known as the ``Alabama Gang,'' a racing fraternity that \nwould later include Bobby's son Davey Allison and NASCAR star Neil \nBonnett.\n  After his relocation to Alabama, Bobby garnered tremendous success on \nthe track, winning NASCAR Modified Special Division titles in 1962 and \n1963. He followed this success with consecutive NASCAR Modified \nDivision championships in 1964 and 1965. Bobby competed in his first \nSprint Cup Series race at the 1961 Daytona 500, and achieved his first \nSprint Cup win 5 years later, at Oxford Plains Speedway in Maine in \n1966. In his 25-year Sprint Cup career, Bobby won 83 additional races, \nincluding three Daytona 500 triumphs and four victories at Talladega \nSuperspeedway. He is tied with Darrell Waltrip for the third most wins \nin Sprint Cup history. Mr. Allison is also a five-time Sprint Cup \nSeries runner-up, winning the Cup once in 1983, when it was still known \nas the Winston Cup. His final win was a thrilling father-son \nperformance at the 1988 Daytona 500, where he and his son Davey \nfinished first and second place, respectively.\n  Despite his great successes, Bobby's life has included tragedy. His \nracing career was cut short by injuries sustained during a severe crash \nat Pocono Raceway months after his final win at Daytona. In 1992, his \nyoungest son Clifford was killed while practicing for a race at \nMichigan International Speedway. A few months later, his older son \nDavey Allison was killed in a helicopter crash at Talladega.\n  Through both success and sorrow, Bobby has displayed remarkable \nperseverance and resilience. He is known and respected all around the \nworld and many of my fellow Senators have been generous in their praise \nin this indomitable racer. Senator John McCain, a friend and admirer, \nsaid, ``I couldn't be prouder of Bobby. He is an inspiration for all of \nus.'' Senator Jon Kyl, a NASCAR enthusiast, noted that the Phoenix \nInternational Raceway named a grandstand for Bobby and declared, ``The \nHall of Fame did well to recognize Bobby in its second class. He is a \nNASCAR legend.''\n  Bobby and his wife Judy still reside in Hueytown, AL, and his two \ndaughters, Bonnie Allison-Farr, and Carrie Allison, live with their \nfamilies nearby. Selected as one of ``The 50 Greatest NASCAR Drivers of \nAll Time,'' Bobby remains one of NASCAR's most respected competitors. A \ntruly great Alabamian, Bobby has never forgotten his roots, and he will \nalways be remembered not just as a racer, but as a beloved citizen of \nour State. It truly is a privilege to honor Bobby Allison not only for \nhis tremendous success in racing's most competitive league, but also \nfor his contributions to both NASCAR and the State of Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4152-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING KATHRYN TUCKER WINDHAM\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nhonor a woman whose sparkling personality and literary voice truly \ncaptured the essence of Alabama. Kathryn Tucker Windham, a beloved \nstoryteller, popular author, renowned photographer, and proud citizen \nof Alabama, passed away on June 12, 2011, at the age of 93. She lived a \nrich, full life, true to the highest ideals of our State. I knew her \nwell and followed her career. In my opinion, her qualities of \ncharacter, professional accomplishments, and simple decency place her \nat the top of all who have been products of our State.\n  Ms. Windham authored over two dozen books in her lifetime, giving an \nendearing and insightful voice to Southern culture and folklore. Her \nbooks related everything from ghost stories and memories to delicious \nrecipes, and she developed a devoted audience in Alabama and around the \nUnited States. Ms. Windham also became a celebrated radio personality, \nappearing on Alabama Public Radio for over 20 years and commentating on \nNPR's ``All Things Considered'' from 1985-1987. She treated listeners \nnationwide to evocative tales of the South, with such titles as ``Grits \nIs a Singular Delicacy'' and ``Honeysuckle Blossoms Smell Wonderful,'' \nall with a Southern accent that remained true to the highest level of \nculture and grammar. In addition, she was a positive force for good, \nconstant in her efforts to promote racial reconciliation in her \nhometown of Selma and in her State.\n  Ms. Windham spent her childhood in Thomasville, AL, not too far \nacross the river from where I grew up, and later attended Huntingdon \nCollege, my alma mater. After graduation, she began work as a police \nreporter for a Montgomery paper, an impressive and unusual job for a \nfemale reporter at that time. Ms. Windham developed a distinguished \njournalistic career, working for the Birmingham News and winning \nseveral Associated Press awards for her work with the Selma Times \nJournal, where she made her home for many years. Some of her best known \nbooks are Alabama: One Big Front Porch and Thirteen Alabama Ghosts and \nJeffery.\n  Ms. Windham was also a noted photographer, and her images provide a \nstirring portrait of the people and places of her home State. Her \nphotography was included in the Huntsville Museum of Art's 1989 \ntraveling exhibit, ``Alabama Landscape Photographs,'' and in a later \nshow, ``Encounters 24. Kathryn Tucker Windham.''\n  Among many honors and awards, Ms. Windham was inducted into the \nAlabama Academy of Honor. This organization celebrates Alabama's best \nand brightest, and Ms. Windham's membership reflects her status as one \nof the State's beloved cultural figures and influential personalities. \nMs. Windham was indeed a great Alabamian, and her work showcases the \nbest of Alabama's values in a way that should make every Alabamian \nproud.\n  I recently watched a video of her in her small rocking chair, telling \nstories. They were told superbly, with perfect timing, and I burst out \nlaughing. She was much like my great aunts, her contemporaries, who \nlived not far away. The stories of this generation provided humor, \nhistory, family affection, and education to listeners. It is a time \npretty much gone. Someone once said that the purest examples of a \nperiod's ideals are curiously often found in its last days. It may be \nMs. Windham was the last and best practitioner of those humorous and \nrevealing stories that are indeed works of art.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to Ms. Windham's family--her son, Ben, \nretired as editor of the Tuscaloosa News, her daughter Dilcy, and other \nfamily and friends as they mourn the loss of their beloved mother, \nrelative, and friend. As her Senator and as her friend, I am grateful \nfor the extraordinary life that Kathryn Tucker Windham led, and I am \nhonored to serve as her Senator so as to be able to pay tribute to her \nlife as the State and the Nation mark her passing. She will be dearly \nmissed, but her legacy will live on in the stories, artwork, and \nmemories she left behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4152-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4152-S4153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nhonor an exceptional group of law enforcement officers.\n  I recently met with Sheriff James Kelly of Catahoula Parish, LA, who \ninformed me that a member of his department was conferred the 2011 \nNational Missing Children's Special Recognition award by the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children.\n  Deputy Toney Edwards, of the Catahoula Parish Sheriff's Office in \nHarrisonburg, LA, was honored along with three others involved for \ntheir outstanding work resolving the tragic case of the 12-year-old \nLexis Kaye Roberts. On October 8, 2010, two hunters found the partial \nremains of Lexis Roberts in Catahoula Parish, LA. Deputy Edwards, along \nwith a team dedicated to the case, was able to identify her remains. \nThe investigation into her disappearance and death focused on a man who \nwas last known to be in the company of the girl and her mother, who was \nalso missing. Information about the man was distributed to truck stops \nthroughout the country and 2 days later he was arrested in Mississippi. \nThe man has been indicted on Federal charges of kidnapping resulting in \nthe death of the young girl.\n  Others honored for their working the case were Special Agent Benjamin \nWalsh, Supervisory Senior Resident Agent Robert King, and Senior \nSpecial Agent Janice Mertz of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in \nAlexandria, VA.\n\n[[Page S4153]]\n\n  In 1984, John Walsh cofounded the private, nonprofit National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC. This center serves as a \nfocal point in providing assistance to parents, children, law \nenforcement, schools, and communities in recovering missing children \nand raising public awareness about ways to help prevent child \nabduction, molestation, and sexual exploitation. NCMEC has worked on \nmore than 73,000 cases of missing and exploited children, helped \nrecover more than 48,000 children, and raised its recovery rate from 60 \npercent in the 1980s to 91 percent today.\n  I truly enjoyed talking to Sheriff James Kelley about the work being \ndone by both NCMEC and his own police force in Louisiana. While I have \nworked closely with and seen the success of the many excellent Alabama \nlaw enforcement officers, I am glad to hear of the fine work of these \nofficers.\n  On behalf of my colleagues in the Senate, it is an honor to recognize \nthem for their exemplary service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4153-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO ZOE COPE\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, if Joe Stell had only \none career, he would still be worthy of our admiration.\n  If he had been only a hard-working and talented New Mexico educator \nwho was loved by his students, he would deserve our respect. If he had \nonly been a New Mexico State legislator who was admired by his \ncolleagues and his constituents, he would deserve our thanks. And if he \nhad been only a land and water steward, revered by the many ranchers he \nmentored on land management practices, he would deserve our admiration. \nOr had he been only a tireless advocate for restoring New Mexico \ngrasslands and advancing partnerships to restore the land, he would \ndeserve our gratitude.\n  But Joe Stell was all of these things: A no-nonsense public servant \nwho asked tough questions, restored the landscape of New Mexico and \nchanged the way government agencies and ranching communities work \ntogether to improve the land.\n  Former Representative Stell retired from the New Mexico Legislature \nafter serving 20 years and being recognized as the preeminent \nlegislative expert on water issues in New Mexico. Then-Governor \nRichardson referred to him as ``Mr. Water.'' In his ``retirement,'' he \nnow runs a cattle ranch in Carlsbad, NM. It is on this ranch and the \nsurrounding areas of southeastern New Mexico that he took part in \nRestore New Mexico, reseeding grasslands, bringing back its riparian \nareas and wildlife species and their habitats as part of the Healthy \nLands Initiative.\n  Joe Stell has spent his life dedicated to public service, education, \nand land and water stewardship. He is proactive and constant in his \nefforts to improve rangelands; to communicate and coordinate between \nagencies and individuals and to leave the land in better shape than \nwhen he first came to it. For this lifetime of work, Joe Stell has been \nthe recipient of various prestigious awards and honors, and today back \nin New Mexico he will be awarded the Bureau of Land Management's \nRangeland Stewardship Award.\n  On behalf of the people of New Mexico, I would like to extend my \nsincere appreciation for Joe Stell's statesmanship and dedication to \nour State. Joe Stell's conservation work will always remind us that a \ncommitment to the land and environment is powerful. For his more than \n60 years of dedicated work in the public interest, I wish to honor Joe \nStell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4154-6", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING BETTY ROBERTS\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize someone \nwhose name became synonymous with courage and equality, someone who in \nmy State is every bit a pioneer as those who blazed the trails that \nopened the West.\n  Betty Roberts passed away recently at age 88, and while Oregon has \nlost one of its true giants, we have not lost the memory of what she \ngave to our State. Every time you turned around, Betty Roberts was \npioneering. In the 1970s, she was the only woman serving in the Oregon \nState Senate. By 1977, she was the first woman to serve on the Oregon \nCourt of Appeals and 5 years later she was the first woman on the \nOregon Supreme Court.\n  I first met Betty in 1975 when she was one of the first elected \nofficials in Oregon to give her full support to what was then a little \nknown and burgeoning organization fighting for the rights of the \nelderly, the Gray Panthers. Over the nearly four decades of our \nfriendship, I came to know and respect her as a tireless advocate for \ndoing what was right based on facts and the truth.\n  Her road to prominence in Oregon's legal, legislative and political \ncircles was not an easy one. As the Oregonian pointed out in its \neditorial, ``Betty Roberts often heard the word `no' during the first \nhalf of her life. No to finishing college, teaching or running for \npublic office, and no to following her ambitions.''\n  Anyone who knew Betty recognized that she did not take no for an \nanswer. She went from being a teacher to earning a master's degree and \na doctorate, all while raising a family. She went from being elected to \na local school board to being elected to the Oregon House of \nRepresentatives and from there to the Oregon State Senate.\n  As a member of the legislature, she supported such pioneering Oregon \nlaws as the bottle bill and land-use planning. What she will be most \nremembered for, however, is her unwavering commitment to equality for \nwomen and minorities. She knew firsthand the barriers women faced. She \novercame them and dedicated her life to tearing down those barriers and \ngiving other women the same opportunities she made for herself.\n  In her memoir titled ``With Grit and by Grace,'' Betty wrote that she \nhad ``a reasonable desire to live the life I wanted.''\n  We know now that Betty lived the life that she desired and my State \nand this Nation is better for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4154-7", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4154-8", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4154-S4155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting \nnominations which\n\n[[Page S4155]]\n\nwere referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4155-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 2:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2279.

A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of New Mexico requesting Congress allow for payments \n     from both the survivor benefit plan and the dependency and \n     indemnity compensation; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial No. 1\n\n       Whereas, the legislature recognizes the pain and suffering \n     of military widows and widowers whose spouses have died on \n     the battlefield or through other service to the United States \n     of America; and\n       Whereas, this nation has an obligation to care for its \n     military widows and widowers; and\n       Whereas, military widows and widowers are unfairly deprived \n     of monetary benefits from the survivor benefit plan, which \n     their military spouses purchased and earned, when they \n     receive dependency and indemnity compensation payments from \n     the federal department of veterans affairs; and\n       Whereas, survivor benefit plan payments are reduced by the \n     amount of the payments received from the dependency and \n     indemnity compensation; and\n       Whereas, that reduction does not apply to veterans or \n     military retirees employed as federal government civil \n     servants enrolled in the civil service survivor benefit plan; \n     and\n       Whereas, often the dependency and indemnity compensation \n     payment completely offsets the survivor benefit plan payment; \n     and\n       Whereas, many military widows and widowers are elderly and \n     live on a fixed income and are in need of payments from both \n     the survivor benefit plan and the dependency and indemnity \n     compensation; and\n       Whereas, a federal court of appeals decision will require \n     the department of defense to eliminate the dependency and \n     indemnity compensation offset for widows and widowers who \n     remarry at or after the age of fifty-seven; and\n       Whereas, President Abraham Lincoln committed this nation \n     ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his \n     widow and his orphan'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of New Mexico, \n     That the United States congress be requested to allow for \n     payments from both the survivor benefit plan and the \n     dependency and indemnity compensation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be transmitted to \n     the president of the United States, the speaker of the United \n     States house of representatives, the president of the United \n     States Senate and the New Mexico congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-49. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of New Mexico requesting Congress expedite the passage \n     of legislation and appropriations to enact the necessary \n     funding for the reclamation of abandoned uranium mines and \n     the remediation of uranium mill tailings; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                             House Memorial\n\n       Whereas, the Grants mineral belt, situated between Gallup \n     and the Pueblo of Laguna in New Mexico, contains one of the \n     world's richest uranium deposits; and\n       Whereas, dating back to the 1940s, states such as New \n     Mexico mined uranium for the benefit of the atomic energy \n     commission and the federal government's nuclear weapons \n     program; and\n       Whereas, beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, private \n     companies began extensive exploration, mining and milling \n     activities related to the uranium deposits located in the \n     Grants mineral belt on private, state, federal and tribal \n     lands; and\n       Whereas, these activities continued through the 1990s, \n     resulting in the mining and milling of more than one hundred \n     seventy-five thousand tons of uranium ore from lands located \n     in New Mexico; and\n       Whereas, unremediated contamination resulting from past \n     uranium exploration, mining and milling activities \n     constitutes a continuing threat to the health and well-being \n     of residents of northwestern New Mexico; and\n       Whereas, state and federal studies have repeatedly shown \n     that surface water, ground water and soils were and remain \n     contaminated by past uranium mining and milling activities; \n     and\n       Whereas, the federal government and others have direct \n     responsibility to provide funding, both for the initial \n     surveying of these mines and for potential subsequent \n     reclamation and remediation where warranted; and\n       Whereas, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of \n     1977 is a federal law that mandates a reclamation fee on each \n     ton of coal produced in the country, and Title IV of that act \n     provides for abandoned mine reclamation; and\n       Whereas, in 2006, the United States congress passed \n     amendments to Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and \n     Reclamation Act of 1977, providing that the funds collected \n     from the reclamation fees will now go directly to the states \n     rather than be appropriated by congress, and those amendments \n     limit uncertified states, such as New Mexico, from using the \n     funds available through the Surface Mining Control and \n     Reclamation Act of 1977 for non-coal mine reclamation; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 785, introduced in the United States House of \n     Representatives, would address the need for uncertified \n     states to use Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of \n     1977 funding for non-coal mine reclamation; and\n       Whereas, under the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control \n     Act of 1978, which established two programs, the United \n     States department of energy is charged with completing \n     surface reclamation at inactive uranium mill tailings piles; \n     and\n       Whereas, various federal agencies were made aware of the \n     tremendous need for the uranium legacy cleanup in the Grants \n     mineral belt by the uranium mining and tailings task force \n     established by the New Mexico legislative council in 2009, \n     and the agencies have since made the uranium legacy cleanup \n     in the Grants mineral belt a high priority; and\n       Whereas, as a result of the activities of the uranium \n     mining and tailings task force, the United States \n     environmental protection agency, specifically region six, \n     took the lead to coordinate various federal, state and tribal \n     agencies to be responsible for the uranium legacy cleanup and \n     for publishing a multi-agency, five-year plan to address the \n     uranium legacy cleanup;

A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \npermit leave to care for a same-sex spouse, domestic partner, parent-\nin-law, adult child, sibling, grandchild, or grandparent who has a \nserious health condition; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family and \nMedical Leave Inclusion Act. This bill, which I also introduced in the \n111th Congress, would extend the important protections of the Family \nand Medical Leave Act to same-sex couples in America.\n  I am pleased to introduce this bill with a coalition of Senators who \nare committed to ensuring justice and equality for all Americans. I \nwould like to thank Senators Akaka, Blumenthal, Coons, Gillibrand, \nKerry, Lautenberg, Leahy, Merkley, Sanders, and Whitehouse for standing \nwith me in support of the Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act.\n  In 1993, Congress passed the Family and Medical Leave Act to, among \nother things, protect American workers facing either a personal health \ncrisis, or that of a close family member.\n  People in the workforce who suffer a serious illness or significant \ninjury should be able to take time to heal, recover, follow their \ndoctors' orders, and return to their jobs strong, healthy, and ready to \nbe productive again. Thanks to the FMLA, they can take that time \nknowing that their jobs will be there when they recover.\n  As we all know well, most employees are not only concerned about \ntheir own health and wellbeing. They are concerned about the health and \nwellbeing of those that they love. The FMLA gave workers with a child, \nparent, or spouse that was sick or injured, an opportunity to provide \nthe needed care and support, knowing that their jobs would be there \nwhen they returned.\n  When it was passed, the FMLA was an important and historic expansion \nof our nation's laws. Unfortunately, as families have evolved and \nexpanded, we've learned that the FMLA does not provide the same level \nof protection to all American families. Under current law, it is \nimpossible for many employees to be with their partners during times of \nmedical need.\n  As I stated when I introduced this bill last year, Congress followed \nthe lead of many large and small businesses when it enacted the FMLA. \nAlmost 20 years ago, many of these businesses had already recognized \nand addressed the need for employees to take time off to care for \nthemselves or a loved one that was battling a serious health condition. \nThese companies had put in place systems that gave their employees time \nto heal themselves or their family members, and ensured that those \nemployees would return to work as soon as they could.\n  The FMLA took the model these companies provided and brought the \nmajority of the American workforce under the same protections.\n  We once again have an opportunity to learn from the best practices of \nAmerican businesses who have adjusted their personnel policies and \nbenefit packages to better meet the needs of American families, as we \nfind them today. These businesses have assessed the composition of \ntheir workforces and realized that, in order to meet the evolving needs \nof their employees and enhance productivity, they needed to go one step \nfurther than the protections provided by the FMLA.\n  The Human Rights Campaign, leading civil rights organization that \nstrongly supports the Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act, reports \nthat 502 major American corporations, 10 states, and the District of \nColumbia now extend FMLA benefits to include leave on behalf of a same-\nsex partner. Moreover, as of March of this year, 58 percent of Fortune \n500 companies provided health benefits to same-sex partners, a 13 fold \nincrease since 1995.\n  When the FMLA was signed into law, it was narrowly tailored to cover \nindividuals caring for a very close family member. The law sought to \ncover that inner circle of people, where the family member assuming the \ncaretaker role would be one of very few, if not the only person, who \ncould do so. That idea has not changed.\n  What has changed are the people who might be in that inner circle. \nThe nuclear American family has grown, sometimes by design, and \nsometimes by necessity. More and more, that inner circle of close \nfamily might include a grandparent or grandchild, siblings, or same-sex \ndomestic partners in loving and committed relationships.\n  As the law stands right now, too many of these people are excluded \nfrom the protections of the FMLA.\n  In these tough economic times, when unemployment is high and those \nwith jobs are doing everything they can to keep them, we all know the \nvalue of job security. Hardworking Americans should not have to make \nthe impossible choice between keeping their jobs and providing care and \nsupport for loved ones in their time of need. Almost 20 years ago, the \nFMLA ensured that millions of Americans did not have to make that \nchoice. Now, the time has come to ensure that the security afforded by \nthe FMLA is available to a broader range of American workers.\n  There are many who would understandably question what this kind of \nchange in the law would cost the business community. As I have stated \nin the past, the FMLA is already a very good law; it is already in \nplace and it is working. It provides unpaid leave when the need arises, \nand it only applies to businesses that have enough employees on hand to \nhandle the absence of a single worker without too great a burden.\n  Ninety percent of the leave time that has been taken under the FMLA \nhas been so that employees can care for themselves or for a child in \ntheir care, and those situations are already covered under the law as \nit stands. What the Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act would do is \nprovide a little more flexibility, and recognize that there are a few \nmore people in that inner circle of family who we might call upon, or \nwho might call upon us.\n  We can all agree that family is the first and best safety net in \ntimes of personal crisis. Families need to be given the realistic \nability to provide that assistance. What the Family and Medical Leave \nInclusion Act does is give those family members the ability to help \ntheir loved ones in ways that only they can, without fear of losing \ntheir jobs in the process.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act enhances the FMLA. The \nFamily and Medical Leave Inclusion Act, like the FMLA when it was \npassed almost 20 years ago, is long overdue. Our bill contains \nreasonable changes that reflect what many businesses have already done \nand accurately capture the modem American family.\n  The Family Medical Leave Inclusion Act is supported by over 80 \norganizations from the business, civil rights, LGBT, and labor \ncommunities, including: the National Association of Working Women; \nAFSCME; American Pediatrics Association; ACLU; Families USA; Gay and \nLesbian Advocates and Defenders, GLAD; Human Rights Campaign; People \nfor the American Way;\n\n[[Page S4159]]\n\nSEIU; and The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\n  The Family and Medical Leave Inclusion Act is the right thing to do, \nand I hope we can join together and pass it on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1283\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to \nrequire the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to \nconsider reconstruction and improvement of flood protection systems \nwhen establishing flood insurance rates; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Flood \nProtection Fairness Act of 2011.\n  This legislation will make three common sense changes to the National \nFlood Insurance Program, NFIP, to ensure that the program incentivizes \nlocal participation in the funding of flood protection infrastructure.\n  The bill allows levees paid for with local tax dollars to qualify for \nthe same discounted flood insurance rates as communities that rely on \nFederal tax dollars to build their levees.\n  The bill allows Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to \ncalculate the value of a levee system in current dollars instead of \nusing the uninflated cost of levee improvements completed years ago. \nThis encourages local governments to fix problems as they arise.\n  The bill allows areas protected by coastal levees to qualify for the \nsame flood insurance rate zones as areas protected by riverine levees, \nprovided they meet equivalent flood protection standards.\n  The effect of these provisions is simple: local governments will be \nincentivized to help pay for the flood protection systems in their back \nyards.\n  In this time of shrinking budgets we simply can't afford to ask the \nfederal taxpayer to foot the entire bill for flood protection. Federal \ninvestments must be leveraged by local and private contributions. \nCurrent policy discourages this; so it's time to change the policy.\n  In some areas of the country, homeowners are told that because their \nlocal government built the levee protecting their home, not the Federal \nGovernment, that they owe an additional $700 dollars on their flood \ninsurance bill.\n  These homeowners are not being charged more because they are at \ngreater risk. They are being charged more because the wrong money paid \nto build their levee. That is not sound policy.\n  Yet, this is the case in Sacramento, California.\n  A flood insurance rate map change in Sacramento has classified the \narea as an AE. This means that many residents living in the area will \nbe forced to pay a rate of $2,187 per year for $250,000 worth of \ninsurance.\n  However, if the levees protecting these homes were owned by the \nFederal Government instead of the local reclamation districts and the \nState or if the Corps of Engineers' approved report was authorized by \nCongress, the area would be eligible for an A99 zone designation by the \nmiddle of 2012. This would mean that the same $250,000 of flood \ninsurance coverage would pay a rate of $1,472 per year.\n  That is a $715 dollar difference. That is a lot of money regardless \nof your economic situation.\n  I want to make clear that this bill is not just some gimmick to \nundermine the National Flood Insurance Program.\n  I firmly believe in the strong and rigorous regulations that limit \ndevelopment in flood plains. Development in an unprotected flood plain \nis dangerous, and I do not support legislation that encourages new \nconstruction in hazardous areas.\n  But the regulations that prohibit local investments from being \ncounted, and prevent coastal communities from having full access to the \nNFIP are antiquated.\n  To understand the scope of the problem, it is important to have a \nlittle bit of context. FEMA is currently undertaking an extensive Map \nModernization effort and examining levees around the country for \nsafety. As FEMA does this, the Agency is learning that many levees do \nnot provide an acceptable level of flood protection. This means that \nthe people living behind these levees are in real danger of flooding, \nand until recently, were unaware of it.\n  Fortunately, the Map Modernization effort is bringing all of this \ninformation to homeowners and consumers. With this information they are \nable to protect themselves with flood insurance from the National Flood \nInsurance Program.\n  But as I have said, there is actually a disincentive for local \ngovernments to pitch in and help build flood control systems; if the \nlocals build the levee, the National Flood Insurance Program won't give \nhomeowners the same discounts they would receive if the levee were \nbuilt by the Federal Government.\n  The program does this by limiting which communities can qualify for \nreduced rate flood insurance zones.\n  FEMA created the reduced rate AR and A99 zones to reflect a reduced \nflood risk as the result of an existing or partially completed levee \nsystem. But this designation only applies to communities protected by \nfederally funded levees.\n  Even in Sacramento where residents have approved two property \nassessment increases to help pay for levee repairs, the homeowners are \nstill hit with higher insurance rates because the improvements are not \nbeing paid for by the Federal Government.\n  The original idea behind this requirement was that information on \nnon-federal levees was unreliable, and we did not know how safe they \nreally were.\n  That was 30 years ago. Now we have better information, and better \nscience, and FEMA has sufficient data to make sound judgments on levee \nsafety. The rule is antiquated, and it needs to be modernized.\n  Not surprisingly, other agencies also recognized the need for a \nchange. In California, the Sacramento and West Sacramento Flood Control \nAgencies, as well as the California Department of Water Resources are \nseeking this change.\n  At the Federal level, FEMA has worked with my office and the office \nof Representative Doris Matsui to develop these common sense \nmodifications.\n  I commend each of the agencies that worked on this project and I hope \nto see these changes enacted quickly.\n  There are already positive signs in the House of Representatives. \nJust a few weeks ago, Financial Services Chairman Spencer Bachus \nincluded text of this legislation in a version of the National Flood \nInsurance Reauthorization bill. I want to commend Mr. Bachus for \nagreeing to make this important change, and thank Ms. Matsui for her \neffective advocacy on this issue.\n  On the whole, the National Flood Insurance Program and the Map \nModernization effort each have taken our nation in the right direction. \nAs a result of their successes, Americans are safer, and have the means \nand ability to insure their homes even in risky areas. These are not \ntrivial accomplishments.\n  But a little fine tuning is in order.\n  Communities looking to improve flood protection in their area should \nnot be penalized for paying for it themselves.\n  Residents should be charged the same insurance rates if they face the \nsame risk--regardless of who owns the levee that protects their home.\n  The Flood Protection Fairness Act will make these two important \nprinciples clear. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbill and look forward to working with you to ensure its speedy passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1284\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 185) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 185\n\n       Whereas the policy of the United States since 2002 has been \n     to support a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli \n     conflict;\n       Whereas a true and lasting peace between the people of \n     Israel and the Palestinians can only be achieved through \n     direct negotiations between the parties;\n       Whereas Palestine Liberation Organization Chair Yassir \n     Arafat wrote to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on \n     September 9, 1993, that ``all outstanding issues relating to \n     permanent status will be resolved through negotiations'';\n       Whereas the reconciliation agreement signed by Fatah and \n     Hamas on May 4, 2011, was reached without Hamas being \n     required to renounce violence, accept Israel's right to \n     exist, and accept prior agreements made by the Palestinians \n     (the ``Quartet conditions'');\n       Whereas Hamas, an organization responsible for the death of \n     more than 500 innocent civilians, including two dozen United \n     States citizens, has been designated by the United States \n     Government as a foreign terrorist organization and a \n     specially designated terrorist organization;\n       Whereas Hamas kidnapped and has held captive Israeli \n     sergeant Gilad Shalit in violation of international norms \n     since June 25, 2006;\n       Whereas Hamas continues to forcefully reject the \n     possibility of negotiations or peace with Israel;\n       Whereas, by contrast, Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin \n     Netanyahu has accepted a two-state solution to the Israeli-\n     Palestinian conflict;\n       Whereas, on April 22, 2009, Secretary of State Hillary \n     Clinton stated, ``We will not deal with nor in any way fund a \n     Palestinian government that includes Hamas unless and until \n     Hamas has renounced violence, recognized Israel and agreed to \n     follow the previous obligations of the Palestinian \n     Authority.'';\n       Whereas the United States, under two different Presidents, \n     has vetoed 11 United Nations Security Council resolutions in \n     the last 15 years related to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict \n     and its outstanding issues;\n       Whereas United States Permanent Representative to the \n     United Nations Susan Rice stated on February 18, 2011, that \n     it was ``unwise'' for the United Nations to attempt to \n     resolve key issues between the Israelis and Palestinians;\n       Whereas Palestinian leaders are pursuing a coordinated \n     strategy to seek recognition of a Palestinian state within \n     the United Nations, in other international forums, and from \n     foreign governments;\n       Whereas, on March 11, 1999, the Senate adopted Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 5 (106th Congress), and on March 16, \n     1999, the House of Representatives adopted House Concurrent \n     Resolution 24 (106th Congress), both of which resolved that \n     ``any attempt to establish Palestinian statehood outside the \n     negotiating process will invoke the strongest congressional \n     opposition'';\n       Whereas current United States law precludes assistance to a \n     Palestinian Authority that shares power with Hamas unless \n     that Authority publicly accepts the right of Israel to exist \n     and adheres to all prior agreements and understandings with \n     the Governments of the United States and Israel;\n       Whereas the United States Government provides more than \n     $550,000,000 annually and more than $3,500,000,000 \n     cumulatively in direct bilateral assistance to the \n     Palestinians, who are among the world's largest recipients of \n     foreign aid per capita;\n       Whereas aid to the Palestinians is predicated on a good \n     faith commitment from the Palestinians to the peace process;\n       Whereas abandonment by Palestinian leaders of the Quartet \n     conditions and inclusion of Hamas in a government could \n     jeopardize the positive steps the Palestinian Authority has \n     taken in building institutions and improving security in the \n     West Bank in recent years; and\n       Whereas efforts to form a unity government without \n     accepting the Quartet conditions, to bypass negotiations and \n     unilaterally declare a Palestinian state, or to appeal to the \n     United Nations or other international forums or to foreign \n     governments for recognition of a Palestinian state would \n     violate the underlying principles of the Oslo Accords, the \n     Road Map, and other relevant Middle East peace process \n     efforts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) reaffirms its strong support for a negotiated solution \n     to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resulting in two states, \n     a democratic, Jewish state of Israel and a viable, democratic \n     Palestinian state, living side-by-side in peace, security, \n     and mutual recognition;\n       (2) states its firm belief that any Palestinian unity \n     government must publicly and formally forswear terrorism, \n     accept Israel's right to exist, and reaffirm previous \n     agreements made with the Government of Israel;\n       (3) reiterates its strong opposition to any attempt to \n     establish or seek recognition of a Palestinian state outside \n     of an agreement negotiated between leaders in Israel and the \n     Palestinians;\n       (4) urges Palestinian leaders--\n       (A) to ensure that any Palestinian government will seek \n     peace with Israel;\n       (B) to cease all efforts at circumventing the negotiation \n     process, including through a unilateral declaration of \n     statehood or quests for recognition of a Palestinian state \n     from other nations or the United Nations;\n       (C) to resume direct negotiations with the Government of \n     Israel immediately and without preconditions; and\n       (D) to take appropriate measures to counter incitement to \n     violence and fulfill all prior Palestinian commitments, \n     including dismantling the terrorist infrastructure embodied \n     in Hamas;\n       (5) supports the opposition of the President to a \n     unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state and the veto by \n     the United States on February 18, 2011, of the most recent \n     United Nations Security Council resolution regarding a key \n     issue of the Israeli-Palestinian process;\n       (6) calls upon the President to announce that the United \n     States will veto any resolution on Palestinian statehood that \n     comes before the United Nations Security Council which is not \n     a result of agreements reached between the Government of \n     Israel and the Palestinians;\n       (7) calls upon the President to lead a diplomatic effort to \n     oppose a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state and to \n     oppose recognition of a Palestinian state by other nations, \n     within the United Nations, and in other international forums \n     prior to achievement of a final agreement between the \n     Government of Israel and the Palestinians;\n       (8) will consider restrictions on aid to the Palestinian \n     Authority should it persist in efforts to circumvent direct \n     negotiations by turning to the United Nations or other \n     international bodies;\n       (9) supports the position taken by Secretary of State \n     Hillary Clinton on April 22, 2009, that the United States \n     ``will not deal with or in any way fund a Palestinian \n     government that includes Hamas unless and until Hamas has \n     renounced violence, recognized Israel and agreed to follow \n     the previous obligations of the Palestinian Authority'';\n       (10) urges the President to consider suspending assistance \n     to the Palestinian Authority pending a review of the unity \n     agreement between Fatah and Hamas; and\n       (11) reaffirms the requirement under United States law \n     precluding assistance to a Palestinian Authority that shares \n     power with Hamas unless that Authority and all its ministers \n     publicly accept the right of Israel to exist and all prior \n     agreements and understandings with the Governments of the \n     United States and Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4163-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JUNE 29, 2011\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I realize a number of people \nin this Chamber are asking why I am doing this. First of all, I think \nit is important for everybody to realize that--and I certainly mean no \noffense to anybody in this Chamber--I did not run for the Senate \nbecause I wanted to be a Senator. I ran for the Senate because I \nrealized we are bankrupting this Nation.\n  I think the evidence is quite clear, if we take a look at the budget \ndeficit for just the last 3 years: $1.4 trillion, $1.3 trillion, and \nfor this year estimates as high as $1.65 trillion. We have incurred \nover $4 trillion worth of debt in just the last 3 years, and our \nNation's debt stands at $14.3 trillion. We have reached our debt limit. \nOur debt is almost the size of our entire economy.\n  I have been watching Washington for 32 years from Oshkosh, WI, and I \nrealized that Washington was pretty broken. I have been here now for 6 \nmonths, and I haven't seen anything here that convinces me otherwise.\n  The Senate has not passed a budget for over 2 years. Of the six \npieces of legislation we have passed--only six pieces of legislation we \nhave passed from this Chamber have actually become law, and of those \nsix three dealt with last year's business. They were pieces of \nlegislation dealing with this year's budget that should have been \npassed last summer.\n  The bottom line is the Senate is fiddling while America is going \nbankrupt.\n  As I mentioned, the debt ceiling has now been reached. What are we \ndoing about it? The answer is virtually nothing. We are scheduled to go \non recess next week. We should not be doing that. We should be staying \nin session. We should be debating. We should be developing a budget. \nBottom line, all we are doing is waiting for the results of a \nnegotiation between a limited number of people, conducted behind closed \ndoors, far away from the view of any American citizen.\n  Is this the process we are going to rely on to prevent the bankruptcy \nof America? Is this on what we are placing the future of America? I \nhope not.\n  The Senate needs to get back to work. We need to pass a budget. It \nshould not be that hard. American families do it every day. They figure \nout what their income is and they figure out how to learn to live \nwithin their means. The U.S. Government needs to figure out how to live \nwithin its means as well.\n  Let me kind of start the process by naming a figure. I would start \nwith $2.6 trillion. That is the amount of money President Obama, in his \nbudget, says we will receive in revenue to the Federal Government next \nyear--$2.6 trillion. It is $800 billion more than we spent just 10 \nyears ago.\n  It would pay for 100 percent of the interest payment, which is $256 \nbillion. It would pay for all of Social Security, which is $760 \nbillion. That totals $1 trillion. There would be $1.6 trillion to pay \nfor all other essentials: defense, security, health and safety \nspending.\n  If that is not enough--and, again, that would be living within our \nmeans--then what I believe is required is every Member of Congress, \nmembers of the administration should come down into congressional \ncommittees, and they need to, in the open, justify how much they want \nto spend, how much they are willing to borrow, and how much debt they \nare willing to pile on the backs of our children, our grandchildren, \nand our great-grandchildren because that is what we are doing to this \ncountry.\n  So tonight I will leave the floor. But unless the Senate gets serious \nabout addressing the No. 1 problem facing this Nation--our debt and \ndeficit--I will definitely be back. I will exercise my full rights. I \nwill do everything in my power to prevent the bankrupting of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/28/senate-section/article/S4164-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
