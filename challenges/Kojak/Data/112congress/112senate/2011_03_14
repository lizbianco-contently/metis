Mr. President, my thoughts and those of the entire Nation, \nand certainly every Member of the Senate, are with the people of Japan. \nThe earthquake that shook that nation has made the entire world \ntremble, and the tsunami that swept over its shores has engulfed us all \nwith grief.\n  We are heartbroken at the images we have seen and the stories we have \nheard. We share the agony of the families who have lost loved ones and \nthe anguish of those still searching for the missing.\n  The earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent catastrophes have created a \nhumanitarian crisis of the first order, and the United States will do \neverything we can to ease Japan's pain and help it heal. As the \ndevastation and rescue efforts continue, we know Japan and the world \nwill meet this tragedy with tenacity and will respond to the immense \nloss with immeasurable hope.\n  This dreadful disaster is not stronger than the people of Japan's \nresolve to recover and rebuild, and it is no match for America's \ndetermination to help a friend in need.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult to think of the Senate's business at \nsuch a time as this, but we must. It is difficult to think of the \nSenate's business after hundreds of thousands of lives have been \nforever changed in an instant. Every matter seems immaterial in \ncomparison, and our use of the adjective ``emergency'' when discussing \nbudget concerns seems so misplaced.\n  But we must also focus on the business of our great country, and that \nis what the Senate will do this week. I hope both parties and both \nHouses will find the courage to come together before the weekend on a \nplan to fund the country.\n  I remind my Republican colleagues that this Friday's deadline is one \nthey set; we didn't. We asked for 4 weeks to work, and they demanded 2 \nweeks. They asked for March 18. March 18 awaits us at the other end of \nthis week, so it is time to get serious.\n\n[[Page S1574]]\n\n  Last week's budget votes proved what we have been saying throughout \nthis negotiation: We must meet in the middle. The distance between \nDemocrats and Republicans is not measured in money only. I regret to \nreport that so far we remain far more divided on the willingness to \ncompromise.\n  Democrats have made it crystal clear that we are determined to pass a \nbudget. We recognize the reality that one party alone will not reach a \nresolution without the other party's cooperation and consent. We have \naccepted and acknowledged that we need to share the sacrifice. \nDemocrats are willing to find reasonable ways to do that, and we have \noffered necessary cuts that will strengthen our future rather than \nweaken it. But we are still waiting for the Republicans to do the same. \nThey are pretending that last week's votes didn't happen. They are \ncovering their eyes and ears to the reality that their proposal--a \nshortsighted bill the tea party and the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives continue to support--was roundly rejected in the \nSenate.\n  We are still waiting for them to bring something--anything--new to \nthe table. They have not done that yet. Listen to the Republican \nspeeches and sound bites and you will hear no reasonable cuts, no \nserious offer, no willingness to compromise, and no sense of shared \nresponsibility. You will hear no new ideas.\n  We can't afford another week of these games. We cannot negotiate \nthrough the media, and we cannot negotiate if one side is unwilling to \ngive any ground.\n  We cannot keep funding the country a couple weeks at a time. How many \ntimes have we heard our Republican friends decry uncertainty, claiming \nit hurts job creation and worries the markets. How quickly they have \nforgotten their own advice.\n  Mr. President, it is time to lead. On this point, Democrats have been \nvery clear. I hope the solution is at hand. But if no budget passes--if \nwe cannot keep the country running--it will be clear which side will \nbear that burden.\n  This week, we will also start debating another jobs bill. We did the \nFAA bill, the patent bill, and we are told by the experts that is \nalmost 600,000 jobs. The bill we are going to take up now will help \nsmall businesses do what American businesses do best: imagine, \ninnovate, and invent.\n  Our bill that we will soon discuss will support a research and \ndevelopment program that has helped tens of thousands of small \nbusinesses create jobs and shape the future since President Reagan \nstarted the program three decades ago.\n  These investments work. They have helped get new ideas off the \nground--everything from the electric toothbrush to a satellite antenna \nthat helped our first responders in Haiti, to technologies that keep \nour food safe and our military's tanks from overheating in the desert.\n  One company in Carson City, NV, has used this small business \ninnovation program's support to create technology that helps \nfirefighters reach people on the highest floors of burning buildings. \nAnother Nevada company from Henderson has developed an advanced \nrechargeable battery that our troops are using in the field. There are \nsuccess stories such as this in every State because of this legislation \nthat was enacted initially almost 30 years ago.\n  Small businesses are the laboratories of visionaries who create jobs \nand cultivate ideas. We, in turn, must help these businesses grow and \nsucceed. That is what this bill will do.\n  Finally, let me say something briefly about gas prices. This budget \ndebate has shown a stark contrast between our Nation's serious \nchallenges and the lack of bipartisan agreement on serious solutions. \nThe same is true when it comes to energy.\n  Drivers across the country are watching gas prices go up and up. They \nare worried about how expensive it is to drive to work in the morning \nor to pick up their kids from school or just to get to the grocery \nstore and back. It is a serious challenge. But I am disappointed that \nthe Republicans refuse to join us in offering a serious solution.\n  We know why gas prices are going up. First, the Middle East nations \nfrom which we import the vast majority of oil are in turmoil. That \nhurts production and exports. Second, OPEC and greedy investors control \na widely speculative market. Third, big oil cannot quench its thirst \nfor record profits, and it will pursue them at any cost to the \nconsumer.\n  The Republican reflex is a replay of the same script we have seen \ntime and time again. The Republican reflex is to demand more drilling, \nas if that will instantly ease the price at the pump. It is an easy \nargument to make. It will nicely line the pockets of their friends in \nbig oil. It sounds simple, but as a solution to high gas prices, it is \nplain fiction.\n  Here is a little-known fact: The United States produced more oil in \n2009 than in any year since 2003. So for all of the rightwing's finger-\npointing at President Obama, it is worth noting that we have drilled \nmore oil since President Obama has been in office.\n  In fact, when President Bush was in the White House, field production \nof crude oil dropped every single year. In his last year in office, \nprices and oil company profits rose to record highs. So let's retire \nthe tired talking point that President Obama is sitting on the \nsolution.\n  In fact, it is those same big oil companies that are quite literally \nsitting on that oil that Republicans demand. Big oil is sitting on more \nthan 60 million acres of Federal land and water that they have leased \nand have a right to drill on. That means nearly 20 percent of our \nNation's oil refining capacity sits idle. They have shown more interest \nin making profits than in making oil.\n  Let's pretend for a minute they did do the drilling. Even if big oil \ndrilled on all of its offshore leases, it would have no impact on the \nprice of gasoline during the whole next decade. By 2030, it might lower \nthose prices by 3 cents a gallon. That is not my calculation; that \ncomes from the Energy Information Agency.\n  Let's not forget the big picture: The U.S. consumes nearly 25 percent \nof the world's oil, but we have less than 3 percent of the world's oil \nreserves, and they are rapidly declining. We are addicted to oil and \nare at the mercy of big oil and OPEC for its price.\n  Instead of shortsighted straw men, let's use the alternatives we have \nat home, such as solar, wind, and geothermal energy, which are abundant \nin places such as Nevada. Let's encourage these investments, not cut \nthem as the Republicans' budget plan proposes. Their budget plan would \ndrastically affect the ability to do more with renewable energy.\n  These renewable energy sources are cleaner for the environment, wiser \nfor our national security, and more stable for our economy. Best of \nall, they are made in the U.S.A. and will create jobs in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/14/senate-section/article/S1574-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I come to the floor to urge my colleagues to consider \nvoting yes on cloture this afternoon at\n\n[[Page S1575]]\n\n5:30, to proceed to a debate on two very important Federal programs \nthat come under the jurisdiction of the Small Business Committee. I \nknow the Presiding Officer has been a leader in his State on this \ngeneral subject matter. Our committee has worked very hard in the \nSenate, and in the House I might add, to get these programs ready for \nreauthorization. They are the Federal Government's largest research and \ndevelopment programs for small business.\n  As you know, I have said many times on the floor, as chair of the \nSmall Business Committee I want and hope the Federal Government itself \nwould be a better partner with small businesses in America to encourage \ninnovation, to encourage appropriate risk-taking. We can do that in a \nvariety of different ways.\n  Of course, we have authority over banking systems and capital systems \nand financial systems. We sometimes do that with just big business in \nmind. We need to think about giving the 27 million small businesses in \nAmerica opportunities for capital through the banking system and \nthrough nonbank lenders. Our committee has been very busy trying to do \nour part helping our country out of this recession by continuing to \nfocus on capital access for small business.\n  We also keep a close eye on regulations that might be dampening small \nbusinesses from growing and accelerating. Whether those financial \nregulations come out of the financial sector or health or EPA, et \ncetera, we try to keep an eye, in the Small Business Administration \nitself--in fact, an independent agency inside it, the SBA's Office of \nAdvocacy--to look at rules and regulations. Our committee is going to \ntake a hard look at any rule or regulation coming out of any Federal \nagencies that miss the mark or that fail to recognize the impact some \nof those regulations may have on small business. If it is too onerous, \nwe are going to comment and push back.\n  Another way our Federal Government can be a better partner to small \nbusiness is to make sure they have access to some of the Federal \nGovernment's research and development and technology funds. From the \nDepartment of Defense, to the Department of Health and Human Services \nto the Department of Commerce, and others, the Federal Government \nspends literally billions of dollars in research and development. That \nis good. It is only a small portion of our budget.\n  Some people argue the research and development dollars are too low \nbecause the Federal Government, by investing in research and \ndevelopment wisely, generates and promotes patents, inventions, \ndiscoveries, expansion of business, large and small. In fact, America \ndoes this probably better than any country in the world and we are \nproud of it. The Federal Government has a role to play.\n  This particular program I will focus on today--the Small Business \nInnovation Research program--was started by Senator Rudman over 25--\nactually almost 30 years ago now. Senator Rudman was a Senator from New \nHampshire. As a Senator from a small State such as New Hampshire, he \nwas, of course, very familiar with the great universities and the great \nsmall businesses there. He was actually shocked, and I think dismayed \nand saddened, to find out that small businesses in his own State had, \neven if they were inventing some of the best products, and had some of \nthe best technology, couldn't get their foot in the front door to an \nagency such as the NIH. They didn't want to talk to a small business. \nThey wanted to talk to the universities. They wanted to talk to the big \ncompanies. I think Senator Rudman got a little frustrated. He said: I \nthink we need to have not a ceiling but a floor for amount of research \nagencies do with the small businesses in all of our communities, on \nMain Streets all over America, and say: What do you have to offer, and \nwe will give you an opportunity.\n  This works two ways. It is good for small businesses to have access \nto some of these research and development dollars. It is also important \nfor the taxpayer to get the best bang for their buck they are paying in \ntaxes, and they want the best technology--not just the easiest to \naccess, they want the best technology.\n  Having invested in this program now over almost 30 years, we have \nevidence to suggest the taxpayer has, in fact, gotten the best bang for \nits buck. In fact, these companies I am going to show you will prove, \nbeyond a doubt, what I am saying.\n  This company, Qualcomm, is a very famous company now, but 25 years \nago or so, no one had ever heard of it. Qualcomm is a company based in \nSan Diego, CA. It is publicly owned now, but its founder--Dr. Irwin \nJacobs--testified before our Small Business Committee a couple of weeks \nago on this program, urging us to do this reauthorization, which is \ngoing to take the bulk of the debate on the floor this week--this \nparticular program. He said: Absolutely, positively, Qualcomm would not \nhave been able to launch as a small business that started in his den \nwith about 35 of his friends and associates--not 35 in the beginning, \neven a smaller number than that--who had come up with the initial \ntechnology that made wireless communication possible. They did that, in \npart, with a couple of SBIR grants, about $1.5 million in total. \nWithout that patient capital invested in a very timely way in this \nparticular company, they would probably not have been able to make it \nto become what that eventually did become, which is a company that \ncontributes approximately $5.5 billion to San Diego's economy every \nyear and pays in taxes over $1 billion every year to the local, State, \nand Federal Government. That is half the cost of this program. So one \nsuccess story out of this program generates enough tax dollars to pay \nfor almost half every year.\n  This program doesn't cost the Federal Government anything because we \nare already investing in research and development. What this program \ndoes is say you are going allocate 2.5 percent of your research dollars \nfor competition among small businesses--to invest in small businesses \njust like Qualcomm once was--in the hopes that they will develop into \nlarge businesses--or, even more important, that they will develop \nsomething that improves the quality of life for Americans and for \npeople of the world.\n  Most certainly, now that everyone is walking around with wireless \ntechnology, using it for any number of things--staying in touch with \nspouses, kids, from tracking threats to general business use--we know \nthis technology has become a part of everyone's life. Qualcomm is only \none example of the return on investment with the SBIR program.\n  Another involved the pilot alert system for the B-52 bomber. That \ntechnology again came out of the SBIR Program. Reauthorizing this \nprogram is something we know is important to do to create jobs, to \nbegin to create the kind of jobs that will lead us out of this \nrecession. Innovation equals jobs, technology equals jobs.\n  There is another success story I would like to share. This is \nactually from Louisiana. There are actually success stories from every \nState in the Union. Mezzo Technologies was created with the help of LSU \nand SBIR. Dr. Kevin Kelly started with two employees. Now his payroll \nexceeds $1.2 million.\n  We ran into problems when we invaded Iraq and Afghanistan trying to \nrun our tanks in places that were extremely hot. The radiators we had \ndesigned were not sufficient. We were running into serious equipment \nchallenges.\n  It was this small business, with the help of LSU, that began to \ndevelop new kinds of technologies that now can be used for our \nmilitary, in this case in the Bradley tank. But it also has potential \nfor significant commercial application, potentially in the race car \nindustry. That is an example of how technology needed for a specific \nproblem the Federal Government is having, responded to by small \nbusiness--not a big company, a small company--new technologies can \ncreate the radiators of the future.\n  Small businesses are the key to putting Americans back to work. They \nare the innovators. In fact, small businesses account for 13 times more \npatents than large businesses. Small businesses employ almost 40 \npercent of American scientists and engineers. Studies show SBIR-backed \nfirms have been responsible for roughly 25 percent of the Nation's most \ncrucial innovations over the past decade.\n\n[[Page S1576]]\n\n  Unfortunately, and this is why I am on the floor today, this \nimportant program that does so much to give taxpayers the full measure \nand worth of their tax dollar, that gives small businesses the \nopportunity to grow, to create jobs right here in America--not in \nChina, not in France or in Spain but right here in America--these \nprograms have been sputtering. This particular program has been \nsputtering on short-term extensions. Every 3 months we reauthorize it--\nor every 6 months. We need to move forward and provide a longer term \nextension. The bill we are going to be debating this week provides an \n8-year authorization, which gives some certainty. It gives some \nstability to the 11 Federal agencies that use SBIR to help meet its \nresearch and development needs, to help the 300 labs in the United \nStates of America that do primarily research and development for the \nFederal Government. It sends out a clear signal to innovators: The \nFederal Government has challenges, the Federal Government has problems, \nand now we are putting some money behind these challenges and problems \nand we want you to be part of the solution.\n  We believe in this program. I wish to thank particularly Senator Tom \nCoburn for negotiating this 8-year extension, a little bit longer than \na normal 5 but less than what some of us wanted initially, permanency \nand then the 14-year authorization--because we think long-term \nstability is so important for these programs.\n  The agencies have to do some more work--our Federal agencies do--to \nstep up their administration of this program, to get even better at \nputting out the needs of their agencies, identifying small businesses, \nso we want to give them the confidence this program is actually going \nto last for more than a few months, 2 years or 3 years or even 4. So \nthis 8-year authorization is important.\n  I am proud, under my leadership, and also previously under the \nleadership of Senator Snowe and Senator Kerry, we have worked very hard \ntogether to get this bill into its current form. In the very last hours \nof the last Congress, we were actually able to negotiate a landmark \ncompromise with the Biotechnology Industry Organization--formally known \nas the BIO--and the Small Business Technology Coalition. They had been \nbasically at odds over some aspects of this reauthorization. Because we \nworked very hard and in good faith, both sides came together, we have \nnow achieved a compromise which has the support of the National Small \nBusiness Administration, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the NFIB, the \nNational Venture Capital Association, local technology groups, many \nuniversities throughout the country, including my alma mater, Louisiana \nState University, Louisiana Tech, the University of Akron, in Ohio--\njust to name a few.\n  I wish to make sure people understand, not only from examples, what \nthis program will fund; in terms of Qualcomm, which was an earlier \nexample, wireless technology, or whether it is a radiator used in \nmilitary equipment, both in our tanks and sometimes used in other \nplatforms, but also this technology can be used potentially in the \nracing car industry.\n  No other SBIR and STTR reauthorization bill has had this much support \nof this many organizations, and this compromise is represented in the \nbill we have laid down or we will be passing forward today.\n  The agencies have been particularly cooperative, particularly \nDepartment of Defense, USDA, and the Department of Energy. Along with \nHealth and Human Services, they have the lion's share of these research \nbudgets. DOD, it is not an insignificant amount, it is over $1 billion. \nThe Department of Defense will invest in small businesses to get the \nbest technologies available, such as the radiator technology they need \nfor our tanks.\n  HHS has $615 million. It is a very small part of their total research \nbudget but an important part, so when they put out the challenge to \nsmall businesses in America to come up with the next newest vaccine or \nthe next medical technology or information technology that saves \ntaxpayer money and helps provide better quality of life for all \nAmericans, that word will go out from HHS.\n  DOE has $150 million available to invest in small business; NASA $125 \nmillion, just to name a few.\n  So not only will the taxpayers benefit, but small businesses and the \npeople they hire as well. Many of these advanced technologies, \ndeveloped by businesses that could have started in your garage or your \nden, such as Qualcomm, could not have existed without those programs. \nThey are the brainchild of a scientist who took his idea to the next \nlevel, and had this program to get that first $150,000, and then that \nfirst $1 million.\n  I am urging all of my colleagues to support moving to this bill this \nafternoon. It passed out of the Small Business Committee last week \nnearly unanimously, and has continued to gain large bipartisan support \npublicly and privately. The CBO estimates a very modest cost of $150 \nmillion over 5 years. We have made changes that have decreased the \nestimate from last year's cost of $229 million.\n  We believe this $150 million is a fantastic investment for the \nFederal Government to place research dollars in the hands of some of \nthe best, most dynamic, most innovative entrepreneurs on the face of \nthe Earth today. We want to give them an opportunity, particularly in \ntight credit and capital markets, to access these funds at the Federal \nlevel to produce the kind of goods and services and, most importantly, \njobs for the future.\n  I see my time has expired. Again, I look forward to coming down with \nmy members of the Small Business Committee to talk more about this bill \nas the week unfolds. I urge my colleagues today at 5:30 to vote yes for \ncloture on this important bill so we can pass it out of the Senate \ntoday, get it over to the House as quickly as we can, and to the \nPresident's desk for signature.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are going to have a vote a little bit \nlater this afternoon to proceed to a bill which I do not happen to \nthink is a very good bill, but I am going to vote to proceed to it, \nbecause the majority leader has made clear we will have the opportunity \nto offer amendments. I know some of my colleagues specifically wish to \noffer amendments to get to the heart of the subject that should be most \non our minds today, which is reducing wasteful Washington spending, to \nget our fiscal house in order. In order to provide that opportunity, we \nshould, in my view, proceed to that legislation so we can offer those \namendments. We should be laser-like focused on the deficit, the debt, \nthe spending of the Congress, and what we can do to get a handle on \nthat spending, so that we do not mortgage our children's future.\n  It starts, of course, with a budget. A few weeks ago, the President \nsubmitted his budget to Congress, but it seems to me the message that \nbudget sends is one of more spending, bigger government, and one that \ntrumps America's well-founded concerns about this huge debt we are \npiling up and how it jeopardizes our Nation's future.\n  Under this budget, the debt held by the public will double by the end \nof this President's term in 2012 and then triple by 2019, to an \nastonishing $7.3 billion. Think about that for a moment. In all of our \nhistory, from 1789, from George Washington through George W. Bush, we \naccumulated roughly $5 billion of debt. This President's budget, in his \nfirst term, will double that. So in the term of President Obama, we \nwill accumulate as much debt as every President of the United States \ncombined before that. That is too much. It will triple in the next 5 \nyears. That is what we are talking about with regard to this budget. \nThe debt is actually going to be larger than our entire economy. Think \nof the attendant consequences.\n\n[[Page S1577]]\n\n  It not only undermines confidence in our economy, but it crushes \nprivate sector investment and, therefore, job creation. This budget \npunts on everything serious we need to do to bring down the debt. It \naccelerates our path to national bankruptcy, it ignores all the major \ncomponents of the President's debt commission's deficit financing or \nreduction plan. It punts on serious spending cuts and punts on \nentitlement reforms.\n  In fact, the Washington Post editorialized the day after the budget \nwas submitted, calling the President the ``Punter in Chief.'' It is a \nfailure of leadership, and it indicates to me that the President is not \ntaking the debt problem seriously.\n  As Erskine Bowles, who was the Democratic chairman of the President's \nfiscal commission, said, ``The White House budget request goes nowhere \nnear where they will need to have to go to resolve our fiscal \nnightmare.''\n  We cannot spend, borrow, and tax our way to prosperity. \nUnfortunately, that is what the budget request proposes to do. Let me \nreview a few key facts and some of the numbers in the budget. Under the \ncategory of ``it spends too much,'' the size of the Federal Government \nwould nearly double since the day President Obama took office. Let me \nsay that again. Under the President's budget, the size of the Federal \nGovernment will nearly double since the day he took office.\n  You cannot claim with a straight face that represents anything close \nto fiscal discipline. Over the next 10 years, the President proposes \n$8.7 trillion in new spending in this budget, with $46 trillion in \ntotal spending. Spending in the 2012 fiscal year is projected to be a \nrecord $3.8 trillion or 25.3 percent of the gross domestic product, \nwhich is the highest spending ratio to GDP since World War II.\n  I will note that while the President has touted the 5-year $400 \nbillion in spending freezes in his budgets, those freezes merely lock \nin spending levels reached after the massive spending binge that \noccurred on his watch. In my view, the status quo is not good enough. \nIt is like closing the door to the barn after the horse is already \ngone. The President says his spending would cut $1.1 trillion over the \ncoming decade. Yes, that is true, but that is from what he planned to \nspend. So if he made an extraordinarily irresponsible request for \nspending and then cuts it by $1 trillion, it is not something to be \ncheering about. The figure is smaller than the projected $1.5 trillion \ndeficit for the year 2011 alone. We need to do and we can do much \nbetter.\n  Under the category ``it borrows too much,'' the budget adds $13 \ntrillion in new debt by the end of the decade. Gross debt by the end of \nthe decade will reach $26.3 trillion or 107 percent of gross domestic \nproduct. That figure eclipses the size of the entire economy.\n  Gross debt is projected to remain above 100 percent of GDP for every \nfollowing year. The effects of high debt on an economy are well known. \nThey include fewer jobs, less investing, and a lower standard of \nliving, and that is not acceptable.\n  Under the category of ``taxes too much,'' in total the President's \nbudget includes $1.6 trillion in new taxes on families, small \nbusinesses, and job creators. Much of that is new taxes on energy, \nincluding on the gasoline we buy, and new taxes on ObamaCare, the \nhealth care reform. In fact, the President's health care bill is \nmentioned more than 250 times in the IRS's fiscal year 2012 budget \nrequest. The IRS has said it will have to hire thousands of new workers \nto implement the new taxes in the health care law. Let's remember, we \nare not in our current predicament because we are an undertaxed nation. \nIt is because of wasteful Washington spending.\n  I am deeply disappointed the administration has not put together a \nmore responsible and serious budget proposal. I had hoped the White \nHouse had received the message that Americans sent in the last election \nabout spending and debt and the size of our government. It is time for \nus to make tough choices. We need to focus on progrowth policies, which \nincludes much lower levels of spending and borrowing, and leaving more \nmoney in the private sector where it can be put to good use, including \njob creation.\n  Republicans want to work with the President to seriously cut \ngovernment spending and bring down the debt. House Republicans took the \nfirst step by putting together a proposal that will cut spending to \n2008 levels. That is the level prior to the Obama era spending binge, a \nbinge which included, among other things, the failed stimulus plan and \nother massive spending bills.\n  That is the kind of meaningful action we need. I ask the President: \nLead. Work with our leaders on both sides of the aisle to do a better \njob of promoting prosperity through much more sensible fiscal policies.\n  As I said, my colleagues will have amendments they will be bringing \nto the floor this week in an effort to point him in the right \ndirection.\n  Another thing that is of concern to Americans and that we ought to be \ndoing something about here at the Federal Government level is the \nproblem of energy production and the implications of that through \nthings such as higher gas prices.\n  Notably, the Energy Department recently estimated that the average \nAmerican household can expect to spend $700 more at the gas pump this \nyear than it did in 2010. Since President Obama came into office our \ngasoline prices have doubled.\n  In a tight oil market, new domestic supply can have a very positive \nimpact on gasoline prices, and developing that supply would create many \nwell-paying American jobs. So, today, I want to talk about national \npolicies in support of affordable, new domestic energy. This is an \nopportunity for government to set the stage for job creation in the \nprivate sector, rather than continue its attempts to create jobs on its \nown through costly legislation.\n  Although we import 63 percent of our oil, America has abundant \nsupplies of both oil and natural gas here at home. In a Washington Post \nop-ed published in 2008, columnist Robert Samuelson wrote at ``it may \nsurprise Americans to discover that the United States is the third \nlargest oil producer, behind Saudi Arabia and Russia. We could be \nproducing more, but Congress has put large areas of potential supply \noff limits. They include the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and parts of \nAlaska and the Gulf of Mexico.''\n  So, why have not these energy development projects moved forward?\n  Let me provide some background. Before leaving office, President \nGeorge W. Bush lifted an executive moratorium that had previously \nbarred oil and natural gas development in the deep waters of the Gulf \nof Mexico, and Congress subsequently rescinded a statutory moratorium \nthat year. These actions were intended to open an estimated 5.8 million \nacres in the central gulf to oil leasing and make as much as 16 billion \nbarrels of oil available.\n  However, after the Deepwater Horizon oilspill in the gulf in 2010, \nthe Obama administration imposed a new moratorium that all but halted \ndeep-water exploration and development in the area.\n  A number of investigations were conducted to determine the cause of \nthe Deepwater Horizon accident and protect against similar incidents in \nthe future, and that was appropriate. But it was neither necessary nor \nwise to halt all off-shore energy exploration and development in \nresponse to the spill. The country needs a reliable supply of oil to \nfuel our cars, homes, and power plants, not to mention satisfy the \nnumerous manufacturing processes that rely on oil. Locking away the \nvast supply of oil in the deep waters of the gulf merely increased our \nNation's vulnerability to oil shocks emanating from abroad, and put \nconsumers at risk of higher gas prices.\n  Despite Federal court orders, it was not until the end of February \n2011 that the Interior Department finally issued the first permit to \nallow the resumption of energy exploration and development. \nUnfortunately, the permit was for just a single project. Essentially, \nthe moratorium has become a ``permit-torium,'' or an extreme slow down \nof drilling permits allocated by the administration. This slow down has \nincluded delays, suspensions, revocations, and cancellations of lease \npermits. These moratoriums have caused six deepwater rigs to depart the \ngulf for other countries, taking valuable jobs, revenue, and income \nwith them.\n  Others may soon leave as well. Former President Bill Clinton \nunderstands the damaging impact these de\n\n[[Page S1578]]\n\nfacto moratoriums have on the economy. Last Friday, he called the \ncontinued delays ``ridiculous.''\n  Just as we should reopen the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico to \nprudent exploration and development, so too should we lift the \nmoratorium preventing job-creating development of resource-rich areas \nsuch as Alaska's Outer Continental Shelf, as well as oil shale in \nvarious Western States.\n  Senator Murkowski of Alaska has pointed out that her State has \nestimated oil reserves in excess of 65 years' worth of Persian Gulf oil \nimports. Yet they are virtually off limits.\n  As Alaska's Governor, Sean Parnell, wrote in a recent Wall Street \nJournal op-ed:\n\n       If Americans wonder what our economic Achilles' heel is, \n     they need look no further than the federal regulatory system \n     that delays permits for domestic exploration and production.\n\n  The Federal Government estimates that Alaska's Outer Continental \nShelf holds 27 billion barrels of oil and 132 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas. We could be drilling now in the Arctic Ocean off the coast \nof Alaska if the Environmental Protection Agency would speed things up \nand issue an air permit. Developing these resources would not only \ngenerate vast new supplies but translate to a lot of good jobs. In \nfact, a new study by Northern Economics and the University of Alaska \nAnchorage's Institute of Social and Economic Research shows that \ndevelopment of oil and gas in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas of Alaska's \nOuter Continental Shelf would create 54,700 new jobs that would be \nsustained for 50 years. An estimated $63 billion would be paid to \nemployees in Alaska, and another $82 billion would be paid to employees \nin the rest of the United States.\n  As the report notes:\n\n       Domestic energy production is important for the security \n     and prosperity of the United States. The money spent on \n     domestic energy cycles through the U.S. economy, thereby \n     increasing domestic activity and jobs.\n\n  Another resource-rich area in Alaska is ANWR. Despite being one of \nthe largest resources of oil and gas in the United States, Alaska's \nANWR is off limits for energy development. Tapping oil and gas supplies \nin ANWR would require opening just 2,000 acres of the 19 million-acre \nArctic Plain to such development.\n  Remember, ANWR was specifically set aside by Congress for oil and gas \nexploration and development. It was specifically created for that \npurpose. This 2,000 acres would be the equivalent of the airport in \nPhoenix, called Phoenix Sky Harbor, inside an area the size of South \nCarolina--hardly noticeable.\n  Using directional drilling with a small environmental footprint, at \nleast 1 million barrels of oil a day could be obtained from just this \none area for the next 20 years. The U.S. Geological Survey has \nestimated that the area could have up to 16 billion barrels of \nrecoverable oil, an amount that is equivalent to 30 years of Saudi oil \nimports.\n  Analysis from Arctic Power shows that opening ANWR to oil and gas \nproduction would create approximately 730,000 jobs.\n  Those opposed to developing these resources often make the argument \nthat it will take 10 years to open ANWR. But if President Clinton had \nnot vetoed legislation authorizing Arctic development in 1995, oil \nwould likely be flowing from the area today, easing prices and helping \nto insulate our economy from the whims of OPEC. Continued delay will \nonly put our Nation further at risk.\n  A few final points about abundant onshore oil resources--permits for \nwhich have also been blocked by the administration. In 2009, the \nadministration canceled 77 oil and gas leases in Utah and in 2010 \ncanceled another 61 in Montana. It has been estimated that the United \nStates has approximately 800 billion barrels of technically recoverable \nshale oil, which is roughly three times more than the proven reserves \nof Saudi Arabia. Again, it is all off limits.\n  Finally, a note about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. In recent \ndays, some of my colleagues have called for tapping into the SPR to \nbring down gas prices. But this Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a \nnational security tool to guard against an economically threatening \ndisruption in oil supplies. It was never intended to be used to lower \ngas prices. Our problem today is not a matter of supply. We have plenty \nof supply.\n  Since its creation in 1995, a Presidentially directed release from \nSPR has occurred only twice--in 1995, at the beginning of Operation \nDesert Storm, and in 2005, after the devastation Hurricane Katrina \ncaused in the Gulf of Mexico. The current SPR inventory is 720 million \nbarrels, which equates to about 34 days of oil at current daily U.S. \nconsumption. Tapping the Reserve is nothing more than a short-term \npolitical solution to a problem largely of the administration's own \nmaking--its continued refusal to allow access to our Nation's plentiful \nresources.\n  The benefits of increasing domestic energy production are \nunquestionable, especially at a time when gas prices are soaring and \ngood jobs are needed by many Americans. I urge the administration to \nmove swiftly in favor of issuing more production permits and urge my \ncolleagues to support policies in favor of increased domestic energy \nproduction. There is no reason for further delay.\n  One of the most eloquent spokesman for this same point is on the \nfloor, the Senator from Louisiana.\n  I am happy to yield the floor to her.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to follow the remarks of the \nSenator from Arizona and associate myself with part of his remarks that \nhave to do with the energy policy of our country.\n  I am disappointed in the administration's reluctance to get the Gulf \nof Mexico back to work. We did have a terrible tragedy in April, almost \na year ago, April 20, the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe. For 40 years \nor longer, 40,000 wells have been drilled safely in the gulf, in \nshallow water and in deep, since 1940, deep water coming into play in \nabout 1985. Up until the Deepwater Horizon accident, this industry had \nacted responsibly in large measure with cutting-edge technologies. Yes, \nwe have to continue to investigate what happened, but shutting down so \nmuch of our domestic drilling with the unrest in other parts of the \nworld is not the right policy.\n  I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator on energy as well \nas tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This is not a crisis \nof supply; it is a crisis of pricing. SPR should only be tapped when \nthere is a supply issue. We can get back to drilling more at home and \nbe efficient in other places.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/14/senate-section/article/S1578-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1578-S1579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JAPAN EARTHQUAKE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. What I really wish to talk about is to give my \nheartfelt condolences to the people of Japan. We have watched all \nweekend, my family and I, in horror, watching the scene unfold with the \nterrible catastrophe that struck Japan on Friday afternoon, following \nthe earthquake, 9.0 on the Richter scale, followed by a terrible \ntsunami, a wave of water in some places 30 feet high that devastated \ncoastal communities. Some of the pictures are reminiscent of what \nhappened to us on the gulf coast about 5\\1/2\\ years ago when a 30-foot \nwave came ashore right into Gulfport and Biloxi and the catastrophe of \nmanmade proportion, in our case, when the Federal levy system broke and \n1,800 people lost their lives. But this situation in Japan is the worst \ncrisis, according to their Prime Minister, since the Second World War.\n  It is going to take all of our best efforts, governments around the \nworld, individuals, corporations, and businesses, to be generous. I \nhope the people of Louisiana and our cities and communities will be \ngenerous because we were so benefited by the warm generosity of the \npeople of Japan and many volunteers who came from all over the country \nand the world.\n  I hope, as this week of search and rescue comes to a close, there \nwill be time for debris cleanup and rebuilding and mental health \ncounseling--all of the things that go into helping an area of the \ncountry survive and grow back. I know the people of Japan were as \nprepared as any country could be for a situation such as this, but the \nevents of that day have overwhelmed one of the best and most organized \ngovernments in the world.\n  I am heartbroken to hear that thousands of people are yet unaccounted \nfor. Our hearts go out to them. I hope our Nation will be generous in \nthis time, not only from a charitable and\n\n[[Page S1579]]\n\nmoral standpoint, but Japan is one of the strongest economies in the \nworld.\n  From the State I represent, Louisiana, we are their second largest \ntrading partner as a State. The people of Louisiana and all of our \nStates have a vested interest in Japan getting back on its feet, \ngetting better and stronger. We are still in the process of rebuilding \nNew Orleans and the Lower Ninth Ward. New Orleans East, Gulfport, and \nWaveland are still struggling to come back--an important economic \ncenter for the country. But most certainly this coastal and industrial \ncommunity around Sendai and other coastal communities are very \nimportant, not just to Japan but to the world.\n  I hope, with this 9.0 earthquake that hit, I hope people know this is \n1,000 times worse than an 8 point on the Richter scale. It is not \nslightly worse; it is 1,000 times worse. This is a huge earthquake and \nshift in the Earth's plates--and then the subsequent tsunami.\n  On behalf of the people of Louisiana, we send special condolences and \nbest wishes to the people of Japan as they recover and bury their dead, \nheal their injured, and begin to rebuild their cities and communities \nstronger than they were before. I hope we will all be as generous as we \ncan.\n  One final point. This is a wake-up call to our country. As chairman \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, this is a \nwake-up call because we have not funded adequately our disaster \nresponse fund, the DRF. We are actually about $1.6 billion below where \nwe should be. This is not a wise policy given what happened over the \nweekend. Catastrophes can strike without warning at any time. If we \nleave just the amount of money that is in the DRF and something like \nKatrina or this event were to happen, that money would be used up in 3 \ndays. We have not replenished that fund.\n  I have called on the President to send a supplemental emergency bill. \nWe can't pay for current disasters out of future preparedness money. \nThat is what the continuing resolution in the House basically does. I \nstrongly object to taking money we have set aside in the event that \ncatastrophes happen to pay for past disasters. That is another reason I \nvoted against the House concurrent resolution.\n  Now with the visual of this horrific tragedy unfolding in Japan, with \nthe tsunami, the destruction of the cities, the two nuclear powerplants \nunder extraordinary pressure, it does no good to take money out of \npaying for current disasters, paying for the past damage.\n  I have sent a letter to the President asking him to send up an \nemergency bill. It would be wise for us to pay for past emergencies \noff-budget and then to use our homeland security bill to budget as \neffectively and as appropriately as we can for disasters that may \noccur.\n  I am proud to say that the Democratic leadership has doubled the \namount of money we are setting aside in case these things happen. It \nused to be only $800 million a year. Now we are budgeting close to 1.8 \nor 1.9, thinking that in the event that something happens, we want to \nbe prepared.\n  In 48 States, disasters have been declared in the last 2 years, not \njust along the gulf coast. We have had flooding up in the Northeast. We \nhave had flooding in the Midwest. We could potentially have--we had \nsome flooding this weekend. I am not sure how widespread it was, but in \nNew Jersey, there were scenes throughout the weekend about rivers \noverflowing as the spring approaches.\n\n  So let us, as we mourn for Japan and are in solidarity with them \nthrough this crisis, use this as a reminder to get our business \nstraight, to get our budget straight and not mess around with our \ndisaster relief fund. Let's pay for past disasters we owe the \ncommunities--we have pledged to help them rebuild--and set aside the \nappropriate money in the regular budget to take care of things that \nmight happen this year as we advance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

At this moment, opponents of \nColonel Qadhafi and his supporters are fighting for their very \nsurvival.\n  The demands of the Libyan people began much like those of their \nneighbors in North Africa and the Middle East--for the protection of \ntheir universal rights, for greater political freedom and \nrepresentative government, for justice and opportunity. But the \nresponse of Qadhafi and those still loyal to him stands in stark \ncontrast to the inspiring events of what some are calling the Arab \nspring. Qadhafi has unleashed a merciless campaign of violence against \nthe Libyan people, including civilian noncombatants, using every tool \nat his disposal, from artillery barrages, to airstrikes, to the \nemployment of foreign mercenaries. As President Bill Clinton correctly \nstated last week, ``It is not a fair fight.''\n  It is not a fair fight, and now the hour is growing dark. Over the \npast week, the momentum has increasingly shifted away from the \nopposition and toward Qadhafi--showing once again what a lot of us \nunderstand about warfare: that a smaller well-trained, well-equipped \nforce can usually prevail over a larger less-trained and less-equipped \nforce.\n  One by one, towns that had been liberated by the opposition are now \nfalling to Qadhafi's forces. We are only now beginning to learn the \nsavage cost of those losses, especially on the civilian population--the \nwomen, children, and elderly who could neither fight nor flee Qadhafi's \nrampage and, of course, those brave Libyan rebels, or the many \nsuspected of aiding their cause, who face certain death or perhaps a \nfate worse than death. We are horrified by what we have learned \nalready, but what we have yet to learn and what we could still witness \nif Qadhafi's forces are allowed to finish this unfair fight will shock \nand offend the conscience of the entire world.\n  Last week, in a hearing in the Committee on Armed Services, the \nDirector of National Intelligence said that absent outside assistance \nto the opposition, ``I think over the long term that the [Qadhafi] \nregime will prevail.'' And yet it is the policy of the United States, \nas stated by the President, that ``Qaddafi must step down from power \nand leave.'' That is the right policy, but it is increasingly at odds \nnow with the facts on the ground.\n  So we face a stark choice: either the President and the United States \ntake\n\n[[Page S1580]]\n\ngreater action to achieve the objectives he has laid out or we allow \nevents to play out as they are, meaning that Qadhafi reclaims control \nof their country.\n  The resolution Senator Lieberman and I are submitting calls on the \nPresident to take a number of steps immediately to reverse this \nimpending disaster.\n  First, the President should recognize Libya's Transitional National \nCouncil, which is based in Benghazi but representative of communities \nacross the country as the sole legitimate governing authority of \nLibya--just as the government of France has done. President Sarkozy and \nthe French have recognized the sole legitimate government in Libya as \nthe provisional government which is based in Benghazi.\n  Some continue to say we do not know who the opposition is and, thus, \nwe cannot assist them. That is ridiculous. They have been organized for \nweeks. Their senior leaders consist of longstanding critics of Qadhafi \nas well as officials who recently broke with his regime. They even have \na Web site. And they are asking--they are pleading; they are pleading--\nfor international support.\n  Qadhafi has forfeited the right to power through his vicious actions. \nWe must recognize the opposition government.\n  Second, the President should take immediate steps to implement a no-\nfly zone in Libya with international support. Not only has the Libyan \nopposition government called for this, the Gulf Cooperation Council has \ncalled for a no-fly zone. The head of the Organization of the Islamic \nConference has called for a no-fly zone. On Saturday, the Arab League \ncalled for a no-fly zone. The French and British Governments have \nvoiced their support and have drafted a U.N. Security Council \nresolution to implement a no-fly zone. It is long past time for the \nPresident of the United States to answer these calls for international \nleadership. The United States of America must lead.\n  A no-fly zone was never going to be the decisive action that tipped \nthe balance against Qadhafi, even when Senator Lieberman and I called \nfor it nearly 3 weeks ago, but it remains the case that a no-fly zone \nwould take one of Qadhafi's most lethal tools off the table and thereby \nboost the confidence of Libya's opposition. It is Libyans themselves \nwho want to do the fighting against Qadhafi, but they want it to be a \nfair fight, and so should we.\n  Finally, the President should develop and implement a comprehensive \nstrategy to accomplish the stated U.S. objective of Qadhafi leaving \npower. Beyond a no-fly zone and beyond those actions such as sanctions \nand humanitarian assistance that we are already taking, there are many \nactions we could consider, from sharing intelligence on Qadhafi's \nforces with the opposition, to providing them with support for command \nand control, to technical assistance, and even forms of security \nassistance if they request it--we could jam Qadhafi's communications \nand his television--and if we can provide it in a responsible way.\n  Our window of opportunity to support the Libyan people is closing \nquickly, and this country has a choice to make. Are we going to take \naction to support the people of Libya in their fight for freedom or are \nwe going to stand by doing more than nothing but less than enough to \nachieve our stated goal of Qadhafi leaving power?\n  We all say we support the universal rights of the Arabs and Muslims \nin countries across the Middle East and North Africa who are inspiring \nus all in their quest for greater freedom, opportunity, and justice. \nBut Libya is the real test. It is the test of whether we will provide \nour support not just when it is easy but when it is difficult, when it \nrequires more of us than just speeches and expressions of solidarity. \nIf Qadhafi is allowed to prevail in Libya and crush his opponents, it \nwill send a signal throughout the region that force is the way to \nrespond to peaceful demands for a better life, and it will cause all of \nour expressions of support for the universal rights of all people to \nring far more hollow.\n  Before I yield to my friend from Connecticut, I would like to point \nout that now we have former President Clinton, we have the Arab League, \nwe have the French, the British, other nations throughout the world, \nand organizations in the region and without that are saying--crying \nout--that we need to help these people. And when President Obama says \nthe noose is tightening around Colonel Muammar al-Qadhafi, in fact, it \nis tightening around the Libyan rebels. And the way he is doing it and \nwhat he is doing to his own people are crimes against humanity.\n  It is time we stood up. It is time we read from the New York Times \nthis morning an article by Anne-Marie Slaughter entitled ``Fiddling \nWhile Libya Burns.'' It is time we read again, from Saturday, the Wall \nStreet Journal's lead editorial entitled ``The Obama Doctrine, Libya is \nwhat a world without U.S. leadership looks like.''\n\n       ``This is the Obama conception of the U.S. role in the \n     world--to work through multilateral organizations and \n     bilateral relationships to make sure that the steps we are \n     taking are amplified.''\n\n  That was by National Security Council spokesman Ben Rhodes, as quoted \nin the Washington Post.\n\n       ``They bombed us with tanks, airplanes, missiles coming \n     from every direction. . . . We need international support, at \n     least a no-fly zone. Why is the world not supporting us?''\n\n  That is from Libyan rebel Mahmoud Abdel Hamid, on March 10, as quoted \nin the Wall Street Journal.\n  These people are crying out for help. They are fighting for freedom. \nThey are fighting an unequal situation on the battlefield. The least we \ncan do--the very least we can do--is recognize them in their struggle \nfor freedom and give them some assistance; otherwise, as the \nPresident's National Security Adviser stated on Friday: Qadhafi will \nprevail. That will send a signal throughout the world that we will have \nTiananmen Squares in this world, not Tahrir Squares.\n  I yield to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nArizona. It is my honor to join with him in submitting this resolution. \nI hope in time that we will gather the support of Members on both sides \nof the political aisle and that we will make a statement, an urgent \nstatement, that the Members of the U.S. Senate are ready, across party \nlines, to take a stand because we understand we are at a turning point \nin history and we cannot stand back and hope it goes in the right \ndirection. In fact, today, as we watch events unfolding in Libya, I \nthink we have reason to believe it is going in exactly the wrong \ndirection.\n  Let me read the first two paragraphs of this resolution Senator \nMcCain and I are submitting because I think it sets what is happening \nin Libya in a context and also explains why we think America has a \nnational interest in how the conflict in Libya ends.\n  The first paragraph of the resolution we are submitting reads:\n\n       Whereas peaceful demonstrations, inspired by similar \n     peaceful demonstrations in Tunisia, Egypt, and elsewhere in \n     the Middle East, began in Libya with calls for greater \n     political reform, opportunity, justice and the rule of law \n     and quickly spread to cities around the country.\n\n  The second paragraph:\n\n       Whereas Muammar Qaddafi, his sons, and forces loyal to them \n     have responded to the peaceful demonstrations by authorizing \n     and initiating violence against civilian non-combatants in \n     Libya, including the use of airpower, foreign mercenaries, \n     helicopters, mortar and artillery fire, naval assets, snipers \n     and soldiers.\n\n  I read those two paragraphs because they set exactly in context what \nis happening in Libya. The fact is that Libya is occurring in the \ncontext of these extraordinary, peaceful, democratic uprisings in \nTunisia and Egypt that have been described--and I think correctly--as \nthe Arab spring.\n  For too long, we accepted an argument that there were only two \nchoices for the United States and most of the rest of the world in the \nArab world. There was a choice between secular dictatorships that were \ncordial to us on one side and on the other side radical Islamist \nregimes that despised us and were threatening to us. We made our peace \nwith those secular dictatorships, but it was inherently uncomfortable \nand inconsistent with our basic democratic values going back to the \nDeclaration of Independence.\n\n  Beginning in Tunisia and spreading to Egypt and then to Libya and \nother\n\n[[Page S1581]]\n\ncountries, the Arab people themselves rose up and said: No, there is a \nthird way. And the third way is democracy. We want political freedom. \nWe want economic opportunity. We want into the modern world. We don't \nwant extremism of any kind.\n  Those revolutions, those uprisings resulted in the end of the rule of \ntwo longstanding rulers, Ben Ali in Tunisia and Mubarak in Egypt, and \nthey happened peacefully for a lot of reasons. Part of it was that \nthose two leaders did not order their militaries to turn on their own \npeople, and the militaries, perhaps, in those two cases would not have \ndone it in any case. So that is the Arab spring.\n  But now, in Libya, because Qadhafi has taken exactly the opposite \nposition and turned his guns and his military power on his own people \nas they peacefully demonstrate for change, for universal human rights, \nthere is a danger that what is happening in Libya is essentially a wall \nbeing put up which says: This peaceful democratic revolution in the \nArab world ends here. To put it another way, the Arab spring may be \ngoing the way of the Prague spring of 1968 when the people of then-\nCzechoslovakia rose up and Soviet tanks and armaments suppressed their \nrevolution. We simply cannot let that happen.\n  Senator McCain and I were in Tunisia and Egypt a couple of weeks ago, \nand one of the messages we got, particularly from the young people who \nhave been at the head of this remarkable uprising in these two \ncountries, was: Don't stand by. Please, America, don't stand by and let \nQadhafi bludgeon his own people who are asking for the same rights and \nopportunity and freedoms we have been asking for. If you do, it will \nend the movement of freedom and opportunity across the Arab world. In \nsome sense, the Tunisians and Egyptians said to us: It may set back our \nown cause, even though we have been successful thus far. That is why it \nhas been so frustrating, really infuriating, to watch as Qadhafi has \nmoved with increasing brutality and force against his own people, \npushing his opponents back, threatening to totally suppress their \nuprising.\n  I have been struck as I have watched that the world community--most \nof it--is spending so much time discussing and debating, and as the \nworld discusses and debates what to do in Libya, Libya descends back \ninto Qadhafi's darkness. We simply cannot let that happen.\n  The Libyan people are not asking us to come in and fight for them. \nThe Libyan people don't want our troops on the ground. That is not what \nthis resolution would authorize. The Libyan people want us to come to \ntheir aid in the sense of enabling them to fight Qadhafi's forces and \nQadhafi to carry on as freedom fighters. They want recognition as the \nestablished and legal authority, sovereignty for their country. They \nwould like some military assistance. They would like weapons. They \nwould like the kind of intelligence and electronic assistance we can \ngive, and they would like us in some way--a no-fly zone or using our \ncapacity to fire missiles from offshore--to protect them from what has \nturned the tide in their struggle for freedom against Qadhafi and \nLibya, which is the brutal use of Libyan air power against the Libyan \npeople. If we don't do this, I fear this Arab spring will turn to \nwinter--a winter of darkness and suppression--again, too quickly, and \nthe world will regret it.\n  People have said to Senator McCain and me: What is the American \nnational interest in getting involved in Libya? Let me just give a few \nreasons I think we do have an interest.\n  First, we have a clear national interest--a humanitarian interest--in \nnot standing idly by and watching tens of thousands of people \nslaughtered by their own government. As I have said, if we stand by and \ndo nothing, if this happens, it will be devastating to America's image \nin the Arab world and to our moral leadership throughout the world. \nSome people have argued: Why would we want to get involved in yet a \nthird Arab or Muslim country, thinking of Iraq and Afghanistan before \nthat. But this is more like 1990 and 1991 and the first gulf war when \nthe Arab world itself was calling out to us: Please help us get Saddam \nout of Kuwait. The Arab world, as Senator McCain said, is pleading with \nus: Help stop Qadhafi from slaughtering his own people, the blood of \nour brothers and sisters in Libya.\n  Second, we have a clear national interest in preventing Libya from \nbecoming a failed state that al-Qaida and other Islamist groups will \nexploit, and that is precisely what will happen if this becomes a \nbloody and protracted civil war and then descends into chaos.\n  Third, if Qadhafi is able to defeat this uprising, it will send a \nmessage, as Senator McCain has said, to every dictator in the world \nthat the way to stop peaceful democratic protest is through brutal \nviolence.\n  Fourth, I don't mean this quote literally, but remember the old \nphrase from earlier times in history: If you go after the king, make \nsure you eliminate him. Don't leave him wounded. If Qadhafi survives \nthis, he is going to cause no end of trouble for the United States and \nanyone else in the world who stood with the freedom fighters. So let's \nnot think we can stand idly by and that we will not pay ourselves the \nconsequences of Qadhafi surviving.\n  Finally, there is a relationship between what is happening in Libya \ntoday and the instability it has caused throughout that region of the \nworld and the skyrocketing price of gasoline at the pump that does \nconcern the American people every day. In fact, with all that has been \ndiscussed, I think the best we can do to stabilize the price of \ngasoline in America is to stabilize Libya and to enable the Libyan \nopposition to Qadhafi to fight the fair fight they want to fight.\n  So that is the intention of this resolution. It is, as the French \nwould say, a ``cris de coeur.'' It is a cry from our hearts because I \nfear we have let so much time go by that it may be impossible to enable \nthe freedom fighters in Libya to wage a fair fight.\n  I hope their cause is not lost because it is our cause, and the least \nwe can do is help them fight for that cause against the man who has \nsuppressed that cause under his rule.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Connecticut if we \ncouldn't review a few of the facts as they are now. Despite the fact \nthat the President made a statement that I am still bewildered by--I \nbelieve it was Saturday or Friday when the President said the noose is \ntightening around Colonel Muammar Qadhafi.\n  I think the facts on the ground indicate that with superior \nfirepower, the ability to strike from the air, even if those strikes \nare not particularly effective--although, apparently, they are becoming \nmore effective--and well-trained and well-equipped small forces, \nColonel Qadhafi has been able to reverse the tide on the battlefield \nrather dramatically. All of the news reports are that the military \nsituation on the ground has shifted dramatically in favor of Qadhafi's \nforces.\n  General Clapper, our Director of National Intelligence, said on \nThursday that Qadhafi is likely to win in the long term. Then, on the \nother side of the coin, the President of the United States has said \nQadhafi must go.\n  So I guess my first question to my colleague is--as the Wall Street \nJournal says, if Qadhafi survives, after Mr. Obama has told him to go, \nthe blow to U.S. prestige and world order would be enormous. Dictators \nwill learn that the way to keep America from acting is to keep its \ndiplomats and citizens around while mowing down your opponents as the \nworld debates contingency. By the time the babblers make a decision, it \nwill be too late. This is a dangerous message to send at any time but \nespecially with the Middle East in the throes of revolution.\n  American prestige is now on the line. The battlefield situation is \nthat the tide is obviously against the prodemocracy forces. Wouldn't \nthe message be sent to any dictator in any region of the world that \nrather than accept a situation such as happened in Egypt and Tunisia, \nsend in the tanks, send in the military, slaughter people without \nconsequence? Is that the lesson we would be sending, I ask my friend \nfrom Connecticut?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nArizona. I fear that is exactly the message we would be sending if the \nUnited States and our allies stand back and let Qadhafi, through the \nforce of his arms, suppress political dissent from his own people.\n\n[[Page S1582]]\n\n  One of the inspiring qualities to the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt \nwas that they were peaceful. Incidentally, they were not anti-American. \nThey were pro-Tunisia, pro-Egypt. The people of Tunisia and Egypt were \npleading for a better life. So the model there and one of the most \npowerful examples of peaceful protests, which is part of American \nhistory, was established. It changed those two governments, Tunisia and \nEgypt.\n  Now we have another model being set; that is, when your people rise \nup and peacefully protest, you don't respond, you don't negotiate, you \ndon't listen to them, you don't react. You turn your firepower on them. \nYou kill them wantonly, and you keep doing that until that dissent \nends. One, in a world that is increasingly dangerous, that is a \nterrible message to send.\n  Two, in a world in which--well, let's just go back a little bit to \nwhat were false choices in the Arab world. But in the uprisings in \nTunisia and in Egypt, there has been expressed the strongest possible \nrepudiation of al-Qaida on the one hand, and Iran on the other--that is \nthe Government of Iran--both of which have followed an Islamist \nextremist ideology and used violence to achieve their ends.\n  So we have the Tunisia-Egypt model of peaceful protest, democracy, \neconomic opportunity, and now we have the other model of Qadhafi, which \nis violence, which will beget more violence and will cost us dearly.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, as we say in our resolution, \nPresident Obama has made clear that he believes Qadhafi must go. If, \nafter that clear statement of American policy by our Commander in \nChief, Qadhafi does not go, and it is seen not just in the Arab world \nbut throughout the wider world that the United States was not able to \nmobilize action in the world community to make sure Qadhafi went, but \nin fact he stayed, it inevitably has an effect on the credibility of \nAmerican leadership in the world.\n  None of us want that to happen, including President Obama. So it is \nnot too late. The actions we have taken, significant as they are--\nsanctions on Qadhafi and some people close to him, the threat or the \nplan to refer others close to him to the International Court of \nJustice--all are important. But, unfortunately, what is more important \nnow is what is happening on the ground in Libya. On the ground in \nLibya, the power of the forces of Qadhafi are winning in a fight that \nis not fair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend that I think that is a \nstrong and eloquent statement. I admit to the fact that the terrible \ntragedy that has transpired in Japan is one that has riveted the \nattention of our Nation and the world. Our hearts go out to the \nJapanese people and their government in this terrible time of trial. \nThere is no way we can diminish the tragedy they are experiencing. But \nit is a natural disaster that was the catalyst for that terrible \nsituation.\n  Meanwhile, in Libya, we have a human catalyst named Muammar Qadhafi. \nI admit and I will confess to having such a dull life that I watch a \nlot of cable television. I see expert after expert come before the \ncameras and give us reasons the United States should do nothing.\n  I commend to my colleagues for reading an article in today's New York \nTimes by Anne-Marie Slaughter, formerly in policy planning at the State \nDepartment, as I understand it, in this administration or in another. \nIt does respond to what we will hear continuously. The article is \nentitled ``Fiddling While Libya Burns.''\n  At the beginning, she points out that the Organization of the Islamic \nConference, the Gulf Cooperation Council, and now the Arab League have \nall called for imposing a no-fly zone. She runs through the objections \nraised by various individuals and ``experts.'' One part is entitled \n``It's Not In Our Interest.'' One is entitled ``It Will Be \nCounterproductive.'' Another is ``It Won't Work.'' Another is ``If It \nDoes Work, We Don't Know What We Will Get.'' The last is ``Let's Arm \nThe Rebels Instead.''\n  It addresses most of the main arguments. The only one I think should \nbe added to this list is the likelihood that things are happening in \nLibya today, as we speak, that will remind us that several times in the \nlast century--and even in this one--we said never again. We said never \nagain after Srebenica, after Rwanda, after the Holocaust, and on \nseveral other occasions when nations stood by while slaughter was \ntaking place.\n  Is there anyone who believes that Qadhafi has not practiced in the \npast, is practicing now, and will practice in the future unspeakable \ncruelties which will be inflicted upon his people who dare to stand up \nto him? So I say to my friend: Here we are.\n  We know what happened in Tripoli and what happened with air attacks \nthat are taking place on defenseless individuals. We watch these brave \nyoung people go out there with the Kalashnikovs and other things and \nfight against the tanks and air power. As former President Clinton said \nso eloquently: It is not a fair fight. It is not a fair fight.\n  I guess there will be other consultations with our allies that we \nwill undertake. I am glad to see that the Secretary of State is meeting \nwith the leadership of the provisional government. I hope she will, as \na result of that meeting, ask for the U.S. recognition of that \norganization as the legitimate government of the country of Libya. I \nhope all these things will happen. But, meanwhile, events are unfolding \non the ground every second and minute, and the longer we wait to act, \nmore Libyans will die. This is a preventable situation.\n  The events in Japan, we can argue, were not preventable. It was an \nact of God. What is happening in Libya is an act of a brutal tyrant and \nsadist who is willing to butcher his own people. We are doing \neverything we can, and we will do everything we can to help the people \nof Japan. We ought to be doing what we can to keep the people of Libya \nfrom a fate that, in some cases, to some individuals, may be worse than \ndeath.\n  I hope the majority leader will allow a vote on this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution as soon as possible. I understand there will be those \nwho may like to see slightly different language. We would be glad to \nchange the language somewhat, but we will not change the message. The \nmessage is that the United States of America--the Senate of the United \nStates is standing on the side of people who are standing up for \nfreedom and democracy, a universal value that we treasure. We will not \nstint in our obligations. Those who say the most powerful Nation in the \nworld is incapable of helping these people by installing a no-fly zone, \nI think that is not substantiated by the facts.\n  GEN Raymond Odierno said the other day that we could install a no-fly \nzone in just a few days. We could have naval power offshore that could \nenforce it in a variety of ways, from the sea as well as from the air. \nAlso, it is very clear to me that if Libyan pilots are told if they fly \nthey are going to die, a lot of them would not fly.\n  I don't want to focus so much attention on the no-fly zone as I do on \nwhat is happening to the people of Libya as we speak and the \nrepercussions that could take place throughout the globe. I hope we can \nvote on this sooner rather than later. I ask my friend from \nConnecticut--I believe we are nearly out of time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I just want to conclude by saying this: \nIn our history in this country we have, again, been quite fortunate, \nand it may be that--as a friend of mine said to me, it is hard for \npeople to imagine themselves in a position where they would need to be \nrescued from danger, from death. Senator McCain cited some of the \nepisodes, dark times in recent history, where people needed that help \nfrom outside--the Holocaust, Srebenica, the Balkans, Rwanda. We acted. \nThis is of that same type.\n  But when we think about Japan, there is this parallel to the United \nStates. There have been natural disasters in this country--earthquakes, \nhurricanes. Katrina is an example. When the people of the gulf coast \nregion pleaded with us, the central government, the National \nGovernment, the Federal Government, for help, we gave it to them. I \nwill never forget what the Coast Guard did in rescuing lives on the \ngulf coast after Katrina. In some ways I think we have to perhaps see \nit as a manmade disaster, as a natural disaster. It is a basic rescue. \nIn this case they are not asking us to fight their fight. They are \nasking us to leave them the weapons, the cover, so that they can fight \ntheir fight. That is the\n\n[[Page S1583]]\n\nintention of this resolution--bottom line--to recognize the opposition \nto Qadhafi in Benghazi as the government and legitimate suffering \ngovernment of Libya, and then work with our allies in the world \ncommunity, including not only our NATO allies but in the Arab League \nand the Gulf Council to protect the Libyan people from Qadhafi's air \nforce.\n  I join with Senator McCain in saying that I hope Senators Reid and \nMcConnell can agree on a way to bring forth this resolution quickly. \nEvery moment that passes without us helping the Libyan opposition to \nmake it a fair fight is a moment in which darkness descends over Libya.\n  Again, Senator McCain said we are willing to discuss changes to the \nresolution because we would like this to be a resolution that has the \nbroadest possible bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Wall \nStreet Journal editorial entitled ``The Obama Doctrine,'' the New York \nTimes article, ``Fiddling While Libya Burns,'' and, from the Daily \nBeast, an interview with the Libyan resistance leader, entitled ``Rebel \nLeader: Give Us A Chance,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 13, 2011]\n\n                       Fiddling While Libya Burns\n\n                       (By Anne-Marie Slaughter)\n\n       President Obama says the noose is tightening around Col. \n     Muammar el-Qaddafi. In fact, it is tightening around the \n     Libyan rebels, as Colonel Qaddafi makes the most of the \n     world's dithering and steadily retakes rebel-held towns. The \n     United States and Europe are temporizing on a no-flight zone \n     while the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Gulf \n     Cooperation Council and now the Arab League have all called \n     on the United Nations Security Council to authorize one. \n     Opponents of a no-flight zone have put forth five main \n     arguments, none of which, on close examination, hold up.\n\n\n                        it's not in our interest\n\n       Gen. Wesley K. Clark argues that ``Libya doesn't sell much \n     oil to the United States'' and that while Americans ``want to \n     support democratic movements in the region,'' we are already \n     doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan. Framing this issue in \n     terms of oil is exactly what Arab populations and indeed much \n     of the world expect, which is why they are so cynical about \n     our professions of support for democracy and human rights. \n     Now we have a chance to support a real new beginning in the \n     Muslim world--a new beginning of accountable governments that \n     can provide services and opportunities for their citizens in \n     ways that could dramatically decrease support for terrorist \n     groups and violent extremism. It's hard to imagine something \n     more in our strategic interest.\n\n\n                      IT WILL BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE\n\n       Many thoughtful commentators, including Al Jazeera's \n     director general, Wadah Khanfar, argue that what is most \n     important about the Arab spring is that it is coming from \n     Arabs themselves. From this perspective, Western military \n     intervention will play right into Colonel Qaddafi's hands, \n     allowing him to broadcast pictures of Western bombs falling \n     on Arab civilians. But these arguments, while important, must \n     be weighed against the appeals of Libyan opposition fighters \n     for international help, and now, astonishingly, against \n     support for a no-flight zone by some of the same governments \n     that have kept their populations quiescent by holding up the \n     specter of foreign intervention. Assuming that a no-flight \n     zone can be imposed by an international coalition that \n     includes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a \n     new narrative of Western support for Arab democrats.\n\n\n                             IT WON'T WORK\n\n       The United States ambassador to NATO, Ivo H. Daalder, \n     argues that stopping Colonel Qaddafi's air force will not be \n     decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and \n     helicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to \n     retaking key towns. But the potential effect of a no-flight \n     zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi's own \n     calculations about his future. Richard Downie of the Center \n     for Strategic and International Studies argues that although \n     Colonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been \n     a canny survivor and political manipulator for 40 years. He \n     is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is \n     timing his military campaign accordingly; he is also capable \n     of using his air force just enough to gain strategic \n     advantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the \n     international community lines up against him and is willing \n     to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, \n     he might well renew his offer of a negotiated departure.\n\n\n            IF IT DOES WORK, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WILL GET\n\n       Revolutions are almost always followed by internal \n     divisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a \n     rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice is between \n     uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, \n     regimes across the region will conclude that force is the way \n     to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the \n     opposition, young protesters across the Middle East will \n     conclude that when we were asked to support their cause with \n     more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the \n     words of Mr. Obama's June 2009 speech in Cairo, with its \n     lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and \n     cringe.\n\n\n                      LET'S ARM THE REBELS INSTEAD\n\n       Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we \n     could better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence \n     and arms to the opposition. That would, of course, be much \n     easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mr. Obama as a neat \n     compromise between the desire to help the protesters and the \n     desire not to overrule his defense secretary's reluctance to \n     participate in a no-flight zone. However, we would be \n     providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to ragged \n     groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the \n     weapons they have. They need action that will change the \n     situation on the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his \n     calculations. Moreover, by the time arms and intelligence \n     could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi \n     will have retaken or at least besieged Benghazi, the \n     opposition stronghold.\n       The United States should immediately ask the Security \n     Council to authorize a no-flight zone and make clear to \n     Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood \n     of the Libyan opposition will be on their hands. We should \n     push them at least to abstain, and bring the issue to a vote \n     as soon as possible. If we get a resolution, we should work \n     with the Arab League to assemble an international coalition \n     to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails \n     to act, then we should recognize the opposition Libyan \n     National Council as the legitimate government, as France has \n     done, and work with the Arab League to give the council any \n     assistance it requests.\n       Any use of force must be carefully and fully debated, but \n     that debate has now been had. It's been raging for a week, \n     during which almost every Arab country has come on board \n     calling for a no-flight zone and Colonel Qaddafi continues to \n     gain ground. It is time to act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 12, 2011]\n\n                           The Obama Doctrine\n\n       Libya is what a world without U.S. leadership looks like.\n       ``This is the Obama conception of the U.S. role in the \n     world--to work through multilateral organizations and \n     bilateral relationships to make sure that the steps we are \n     taking are amplified.''\n       --White House National Security Council spokesman Ben \n     Rhodes, March 10, 2011, as quoted in the Washington Post\n       ``They bombed us with tanks, airplanes, missiles coming \n     from every direction. . . . We need international support, at \n     least a no-fly zone. Why is the world not supporting us?''\n       --Libyan rebel Mahmoud Abdel Hamid, March 10, 2011, as \n     quoted in The Wall Street Journal\n       * * *\n       Whatever else one might say about President Obama's Libya \n     policy, it has succeeded brilliantly in achieving its oft-\n     stated goal of not leading the world. No one can any longer \n     doubt the U.S. determination not to act before the Italians \n     do, or until the Saudis approve, or without a U.N. \n     resolution. This White House is forthright for followership.\n       That message also couldn't be clearer to Moammar Gadhafi \n     and his sons, who are busy bombing and killing their way to \n     victory against the Libyan opposition. As the U.S. defers to \n     the world, the world can't decide what to do, and the vacuum \n     is filled by a dictator and his hard men who have concluded \n     that no one will stop them. ``Hear it now. I have only two \n     words for our brothers and sisters in the east: We're \n     coming,'' said Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam, on Thursday.\n       Three weeks into the Libyan uprising, here are some of the \n     live action highlights from what Mr. Obama likes to call \n     ``the international community'':\n       The United Nations Security Council has imposed an arms \n     embargo, but with enough ambiguity that no one knows whether \n     it applies only to Gadhafi or also to the opposition. Even \n     the U.S. State Department and White House don't agree.\n       The U.N. has referred events to the International Criminal \n     Court for a war crimes investigation. Mr. Obama said \n     yesterday this sent a message to Gadhafi that ``the world is \n     watching,'' as if Gadhafi didn't know. But it also sends a \n     message that leaving Libya without bloodshed is not an \n     option, because he and his sons will still be pursued for war \n     crimes. Had Reagan pursued this strategy in the Philippines, \n     Marcos might never have gone into exile.\n       France has recognized the opposition National Council in \n     Benghazi, though the U.S. is only now sending envoys to meet \n     with the opposition for the first time. Dozens of Western \n     reporters can get rebel leaders on the phone, an opposition \n     delegation has visited French President Nicolas Sarkozy in \n     Paris, but the U.S. is still trying to figure out who these \n     people are. The American envoys better hurry because the \n     rebels may soon be dead.\n       The French want a no-fly zone, but the Italians and Germans \n     object. NATO is having\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\n     ``a series of conversations about a wide range of options,'' \n     as President Obama put it yesterday, but NATO Secretary-\n     General Anders Fogh Rasmussen emerged from a meeting of \n     defense ministers in Brussels on Thursday saying that ``We \n     considered . . . initial options regarding a possible no-fly \n     zone in case NATO were to receive a clear U.N. mandate'' (our \n     emphasis). The latter isn't likely because both China and \n     Russia object, but no doubt NATO will keep conversing about \n     the ``range of options'' next week.\n       Even as opposition leaders were asking for help, U.S. \n     Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the \n     world on Thursday that Gadhafi is likely to win in the long-\n     term. The Administration scrambled to say this was merely a \n     factual judgment about the balance of military power, but the \n     message couldn't be clearer to any of Gadhafi's generals who \n     might consider defecting: Do so at your peril because you \n     will join the losing side.\n       We could go on, but you get the idea. When the U.S. fails \n     to lead, the world reverts to its default mode as a \n     diplomatic Tower of Babel. Everyone discusses ``options'' and \n     ``contingencies'' but no one has the will to act, while the \n     predators march.\n       This was true in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s until the \n     U.S. shamed Europe and NATO into using force with or without \n     a U.N. resolution. And it has been true in every case in \n     which the world finally resisted tyrants or terrorists, from \n     the Gulf War to Afghanistan to Iraq. When the U.S. chooses to \n     act like everyone else, the result is Rwanda, Darfur and now \n     Libya.\n       * * *\n       One difference in Libya is that the damage from a Gadhafi \n     victory would not merely be humanitarian, though that would \n     be awful enough. The only way Gadhafi can subdue Benghazi and \n     the east now is with a door-to-door purge and systematic \n     murder. The flow of refugees heading for Southern Europe \n     would also not be small.\n       If Gadhafi survives after Mr. Obama has told him to go, the \n     blow to U.S. prestige and world order would be enormous. \n     Dictators will learn that the way to keep America from acting \n     is to keep its diplomats and citizens around, while mowing \n     down your opponents as the world debates contingencies. By \n     the time the Babelers make a decision, it will be too late. \n     This is a dangerous message to send at any time, but \n     especially with a Middle East in the throes of revolution.\n       There is still time for Mr. Obama to salvage his Libya \n     policy, though the costs of doing so are rising every day. \n     Libya today is what a world without U.S. leadership looks \n     like.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the DailyBeast.com, Mar. 14, 2011]\n\n                     Rebel Leader: Give Us a Chance\n\n       With the Libyan resistance in retreat, opposition leader \n     Mustafa Abdul Jalil tells The Daily Beast's Fadel Lamen that \n     his side needs a no-fly zone and a naval blockade to create a \n     fair fight.\n       Muammar Gaddafi gave an official face to his diffused \n     opposition on Thursday by placing a $400,000 bounty on the \n     head of Mustafa Abdul Jalil, Gaddafi's former justice \n     minister who has now emerged as leader of Libyan National \n     Transitional Council. And ever since, the dictator's forces \n     have seemingly been trying to collect, overtaking city after \n     city in the past few days, putting the rebels in full \n     retreat.\n       The resistance's only hope seems to be some kind of \n     intervention--most critically a no-fly zone, which the Arab \n     League endorsed Saturday. That issue is expected to be taken \n     up at the United Nations imminently, and Hillary Clinton is \n     also flying east this week to meet with Jalil and other rebel \n     leaders.\n       With that as a backdrop, The Daily Beast secured an \n     exclusive interview with Jalil this weekend. He thanked the \n     Arab League for their vote, terming it ``a first and \n     important step and a basis for an international decision.'' \n     Regarding Gaddafi's issuance of the $400,000 bounty against \n     him (in doing so, the dictator labeled him an agent of the \n     Italians, the British, and Libya's deposed royal family), \n     Jalil refused to return the favor, saying only that ``he has \n     no place in Libya anymore, if he leaves now we will not \n     pursue him . . . the council and the Libyan people have no \n     choice but to fight Gaddafi till the end.''\n       Jalil also touched base on the battlefield map, the makeup \n     of the opposition, and the role of al Qaeda:\n       We have heard conflicting messages about international \n     intervention, and whether the Libyan rebels want outside help \n     or not. What is it that you want from the rest of the world?\n       We want a no-fly zone, and a naval blockade. Gaddafi has \n     been using his air force and navy to destroy the country and \n     all the cities. All we want is to have the international \n     community level the playing field. We don't want boots on the \n     ground. We can fight to liberate our own country with our own \n     blood and that will be our honor.\n       We need the international community to recognize our \n     council as the sole representative of the Libyan people. No \n     Libyan so far disputed the legitimacy of the council except \n     Gaddafi and whatever is left of this regime.\n       We need humanitarian help, like food and medicine. The lack \n     of international decisiveness is sending Gaddafi and his gang \n     the wrong message, it emboldened him and makes him feel free \n     to commit more war crimes against the Libyan people.\n       We expect tough and hard days as the world saw what Gaddafi \n     did in Zawiya and how he bombed the oil installations in Ras \n     Lanouf. Gaddafi will use anything to stay in power and the \n     Libyan people made the decision that he must go and genocide \n     will be committed if the world community doesn't get its act \n     together and help us.\n       Gaddafi's forces are clearly on the offensive, with the \n     rebels in retreat. How do you evaluate the military situation \n     right now?\n       What we see is not a war between two armies, but \n     revolutionaries trying to free their country. They started \n     peacefully but were attacked with violence and bullets, \n     antiaircraft machine-guns, and rockets and of course \n     mercenaries. They are defending themselves and trying to free \n     the rest of the country that is held hostage under Gaddafi.\n       The balance of power in the battlefield is not equal, but \n     the sheer will of the Libyan people to rid the country of \n     Gaddafi's regime, which like a cancer, requires sacrifice and \n     blood like any other major surgery. We will prevail.\n       What about al Qaeda in Libya? Gaddafi blames the uprising \n     on al Qaeda and there were several reports mentioning some \n     kind of al Qaeda presence in Libya.\n       There is no al Qaeda in Libya. Gaddafi is using this as a \n     scare tactic to create fear and distrust between us the \n     international community, but the world learned a long time \n     ago not to trust or believe Gaddafi. There is no place for al \n     Qaeda in Libya, now or in the future. The Libyan people are \n     moderate Muslims and do not subscribe to these extremist \n     ideologies. Libya is and will be a moderate Muslim country \n     where democracy and rule of law will be supreme.\n       The Libyan people suffered so much for over 41 years from \n     Gaddafi's extremist ideology and will not replace it with \n     anything but democracy and the rule of law. Libya is part of \n     the Mediterranean basin and has a rich history and will \n     always be a source of moderation and stability. We will \n     respect all international laws and cooperate with the world \n     community and bring the respect and trust that Libya enjoyed \n     with the rest of the world before Gaddafi's 41 years of \n     darkness.\n       There have been many reports in the Western press about the \n     lack of a central opposition. How did you come up with the \n     council and does it represent the Libyan people?\n       The council derives its legitimacy from the local councils \n     that were organized by the local revolutionaries in every \n     village and city, political councils organized to administer \n     the local people's affairs like providing services, food, law \n     and order.\n       Each locality nominated representatives to be members in \n     the National Transitional Council, according to their \n     population ratio of the total Libyan population. The main \n     role of the council is to represent the interest of the \n     Libyan people locally and internationally. Members of the \n     council were chosen with no regard to the political views or \n     leaning.\n       How long will this council last?\n       The role will end with the end of Gaddafi's regime. A \n     transitional government will be formed around the members of \n     the crisis team, of whom we named only two of its members: \n     Ambassdor Ali Issawi and Omar al-Hariri, head of the military \n     affairs. The council withheld names of members in other \n     cities like Zawiya, Nalot, Musrata, Zentan, Zawara, Tripoli, \n     Jado.\n       Given the unwieldly nature of such an organization, what's \n     your decision-making mechanism?\n       We use wide consultations within and outside the council, \n     we debate and discuss and try to reach consciences as we keep \n     our goals. We don't suffer from any real disagreements or \n     conflict within the council. We have developed several \n     committees and teams to deal with legal, political, social, \n     humanitarian, defense, oil, economy that we hope to become \n     the seeds for the transitional government.\n       Should you prevail, what's your vision of the new Libya?\n       We are striving for a new democratic, civil Libya, led by \n     democratic and civil government that focuses on economic \n     development, building civil society and civil institutions \n     and a multi-party system. A Libya that respects all \n     international agreements, is good to its neighbors, stands \n     against terrorism, with respect for all religions and \n     ethnicities.\n       How would you the transition to a democratic Libya?\n       We will be seeking a smooth peaceful transition, with a \n     drafting of a new constitution that will lead the country to \n     a free and fair legislative and parliamentarian elections as \n     well as presidential election. No member of the transitional \n     council will have the right to run for any of these \n     elections. There will be peaceful conference of governance \n     according to elections, under the observation of the \n     international organizations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/14/senate-section/article/S1584-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1584-S1586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRAGEDY IN JAPAN\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a minute to say what \ncame to my mind over the weekend about Japan. Prime Minister Kan of \nJapan described this earthquake and tsunami as the worst thing to \nhappen to Japan since World War II.\n  I suppose what struck me and struck probably a lot of other Americans \nwas, of course, Japan and the United States were at war with each other \nin World War II. Today, the U.S.-Japanese relationship is extremely \nclose. I believe\n\n[[Page S1585]]\n\nwe don't have a better, more steadfast ally in Asia than the Japanese \npeople. It is part of why I hope the people of Japan understand that \nthe people of the United States are with them at this moment in which \nthey suffer so from this natural disaster, and we will do everything we \ncan to help them.\n  They are a proud people, but now they can't handle this all alone. We \nwant to help them. We are a proud people. I want to share with my \ncolleagues a conversation I had with the gentleman who was serving in \nthe American Embassy in Tokyo at the time of Hurricane Katrina. He told \nme yesterday the Japanese people lined up outside our embassy in Tokyo \nafter they heard about, watched films of Hurricane Katrina, to offer \nhelp, whatever they could offer. One private citizen of Japan, \nunannounced, arrived at the embassy and wrote out a private check for \n$1 million for Hurricane Katrina relief. This is the closeness of the \nrelationship.\n\n  I hope and I am confident we will be as supportive of the Japanese \npeople as they respond to this earthquake and tsunami and rebuild as \nthey were to the people of the gulf coast in America in the aftermath \nof Hurricane Katrina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Connecticut have done eloquently in their ways, I wish to \nexpress on behalf of the people of Tennessee to the people of Japan our \nsympathy for the devastation they have experienced.\n  I applaud the administration and the American people for their \nimmediate response to offer assistance, charitable aid, and search and \nrescue teams to find survivors. There is no more important two-country \nalliance than that of Japan and the United States. The former \nAmbassador Mike Mansfield used to teach that to all of us younger \nGovernors during the eighties and nineties. We will stand with the \npeople of Japan until they recover from this disaster.\n  There is a special relationship between the Japanese and Tennesseans \nbecause of the location of so many Japanese industries in our State \nover the last 30 years. As a result, Tennesseans have been reaching out \nto our friends and their families in Japan.\n  We should also commend the Japanese for their courage they have shown \nin dealing with the devastation and in particular with their level-\nheaded response to the damage at their nuclear reactors at Fukushima \nDaiichi. In this age when instant communication can sometimes create \nmisinformation and even panic, the Japanese leadership and nuclear \nscientists are working with organizations from around the world in \nresponding to the danger and keeping the rest of the world informed.\n  This is the largest earthquake in Japan's recorded history--30 times \nmore forceful than the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and 700 times \nstronger than the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. While the risk is by no \nmeans over and the events in Japan continue to evolve, the reactor \nsafety systems so far appear to have done their job in withstanding the \nearthquake, tsunami, power loss, and explosions, and no other reactor \ncontainment structures seem to have been breached in these worst-case \nsituations. The lessons that America can take away from this tragedy \nare this: Learn all we can from the Japanese experience to make the \noperation of American reactors as safe as possible.\n  Since the 1950s, the U.S. Navy has safely traveled more than 136 \nmillion miles on nuclear power. Today, 104 civilian reactors produce 20 \npercent of America's electricity and 70 percent of our clean \nelectricity. That is without sulfur, without nitrogen, without mercury, \nor without carbon. No one has ever died from a nuclear accident at any \nof our commercial or Navy reactors.\n  Let me say that again. No one has ever died from a reactor accident \nat one of our Navy or commercial reactors.\n  Without nuclear power, it is hard to imagine how the United States \ncould produce enough cheap, reliable, clean electricity to keep our \neconomy moving and keep our jobs from going overseas.\n  Here is what we know about what has happened in Japan. We have all \nseen the video of the explosion of the building at Daiichi unit 1, now \nunit 3. I am sure many of us have thought those were reactors \nexploding. Fortunately, that is not what happened. A buildup of \nhydrogen gas in the secondary containment structures led to explosions \nwhich destroyed the buildings themselves but the primary containment \nstructures inside appear not to have been compromised. To reduce the \nresulting increase in containment pressure, a relatively small amount \nof radioactive vapor has been dispersed into the atmosphere.\n  The Tokyo Electric Power Company has told us that the highest level \nof radiation detected onsite to date is 155.7 millirem per hour, and \nthat has since been reduced to 4.4 millirem per hour. But what does \nthat mean in regard to human exposure risk? To help put that in \nperspective, here are a couple of facts. The average American receives \nabout 300 millirem of radiation exposure each year from naturally \noccurring sources, such as the Sun, and another 300 millirem of \nradiation exposure from medical applications, such as CT scans and x \nrays.\n  What did happen after the earthquake is that the ensuing tsunami \ncrippled the backup electrical generators and batteries needed to keep \ncooling water circulating in the plants after they had been safely shut \ndown. This ultimately led to use of the last line of defense emergency \ncore cooling system--flooding the entire containment vessel with \nseawater. While this pretty much assures that the reactors will not \never be used again, as long as the seawater continues to be pumped in, \nthe possibilities of further damage ought to be halted.\n  People have been evacuated and authorities are taking every \nprecaution, and that, of course, is what we wish to see. Despite one of \nthe largest earthquakes in the world's history, with accompanying \ntsunamis, fires, and aftershocks--multiple disasters compounded one on \ntop of the other--the primary containment at reactors near the \nepicenter appears not to have been breached and the radioactive venting \nappears to have been controlled and minimal.\n  This experience has brought back memories of the 1979 accident at \nThree Mile Island in Pennsylvania. Although we remember Three Mile \nIsland as the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history, it is also \nimportant to remember that no one was hurt at Three Mile Island. As I \nsaid before, there has never been a death resulting from a commercial \nnuclear accident in American history. What happened at Three Mile \nIsland was basically an operator failure. A valve failed, and when the \nautomatic safety mechanism kicked in, the operators overrode it because \nthey became confused by the number of alarms.\n  Three Mile Island completely changed the American nuclear industry. \nThe Kemeny Commission, appointed by President Carter, analyzed the \nproblems and made many recommendations, almost all of which have been \nput into practice. The valve that started the whole thing had failed \nnine times, but the manufacturer tried to keep it a secret. People in \nthe nuclear industry then did not talk to each other. Now safety is a \ntop priority of the nuclear industry. The Institute of Nuclear Power \nOperations collectively shares best practices to achieve the highest \nlevels of safety, as well as reliability. Nuclear operators train for 5 \nyears before they can take over in the control room. They spend 1 week \nout of every 5 to 6 weeks in a simulator honing their skills. The \nnuclear companies have special emergency teams that can be dispatched \nanywhere in the country at a moment's notice. A Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission inspector practically lives onsite. What is more, every \nreactor in the country is on the hook for $112 million if something \ngoes wrong at another reactor. As one can imagine, they watch each \nother very carefully.\n\n  I have talked with any number of Navy veterans who had experience \nwith nuclear commands. One reason I am confident there have not been \nany nuclear reactor accidents in the nuclear Navy that killed anyone \nover the last half century is because the responsibility for the safety \nof that reactor goes right up to the captain of the vessel.\n  It was not the same at Chernobyl, the infamous 1986 Soviet accident.\n\n[[Page S1586]]\n\nChernobyl involved 60 immediate deaths and radiation exposures that, \naccording to the World Health Organization, may eventually result in \n4,000 cancers. But Chernobyl was a completely different kind of \naccident and the result of different technology.\n  More than that, the Soviets had not built a containment structure at \nChernobyl. The containment structures at these Japanese reactors--40 to \n80 inches thick concrete and steel--appear, as we speak this afternoon, \nto have withstood an 8.9 magnitude earthquake, tsunami, power failure, \nand explosion.\n  There are gas and oil fires raging in Japan. Water and sewer systems \nare damaged. The possibility of disease and starvation is imminent. \nThere are a great many things to worry about in addition to the \nproblems with the Japanese reactors. There are tens of thousands of \npeople still unaccounted for. Right now, the effort needs to be helping \nthose who need help, containing further damage and risk, and getting \nJapan back up and running again. Then we can take the lessons learned \nfrom this earthquake and tsunami and apply them to make our nuclear \nplants as safe as possible and help the world do the same.\n  America's 104 nuclear reactors provide, as I mentioned earlier, 20 \npercent of our electricity, 70 percent of our clean electricity. Japan \nhas 54 reactors and gets 30 percent of its electricity from nuclear. \nFrance gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. The \nUnited States invented nuclear power, but the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission has not issued a construction license for a new reactor in \nmore than 30 years. There are 65 reactors under construction around the \nworld. However, only one of those 65 is in the United States, and that \nis the construction of a previously halted project by the Tennessee \nValley Authority.\n  The Japanese and the French have surged into the lead in terms of \nnuclear power and are now being challenged by Korea and Russia on the \ninternational market. China, with 27 nuclear reactors currently under \nconstruction, will soon join them all.\n  Nuclear power today provides about 15 percent of the world's \nelectricity. While there are always risks with every form of energy, it \nis important that we be clear about the risks each type of energy \nposes. But it is also important to remember that we do not abandon \nhighway systems because bridges and overpasses collapse during \nearthquakes. The 1.6 million of us who fly daily would not stop flying \nafter a tragic airplane crash. We cannot stop drilling after a tragic \noilspill unless we want to rely more on foreign oil, run up our prices, \nturn our oil drilling over to a few big oil companies and all our oil \nhauling over to more leaky tankers. Mr. President, 34,000 people die in \nmotor vehicle accidents every year, but we do not stop driving because \nwe have to get our children to school and ourselves to work. In all of \nthese cases, when there are accidents, we do our best to examine the \ntragedies and make our continued operation and our lives as safe as \npossible. That is what we need to do here.\n  Our reactors in the United States are built to the highest standards \nin the world. The Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said in \na press briefing today:\n\n       Right now we believe that the nuclear powerplants in this \n     country operate safely and securely.\n\n  The Chairman said:\n\n       Nuclear powerplants in the United States are designed to \n     very high standards for earthquake effects. All our plants \n     are designed to withstand significant natural phenomena, like \n     earthquakes, tornadoes, tsunamis. We will take whatever steps \n     are necessary to ensure the safety and security of nuclear \n     powerplants in the country. But right now, we believe we have \n     a very strong program in place.\n\n  ``As we get more information from Japan,'' said the Chairman of the \nU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ``as this immediate crisis \nultimately comes to an end, we will look at whatever information we can \ngain from this event and see if there are any changes we need to make \nin our system.''\n  The Deputy Secretary of Energy said:\n\n       Nuclear power has been a critical component of the United \n     States energy portfolio.\n\n  The White House press secretary, on behalf of President Obama, said:\n\n       Nuclear power remains a part of the President's overall \n     energy plan.\n\n  Despite the fact that there has never been a death as a result of the \noperation of a commercial American reactor or in our nuclear Navy, \nwhich has been using reactors in its ships and submarines since the \n1950s, our goal should be to continue every effort to try to make \ncertain the operation of our existing and new nuclear powerplants are \nas safe as possible.\n  For example, some have suggested that so-called passive cooling \nsystems that operate on natural convection could prevent the problems \nthat arose in Japan when the backup power to pump water was lost.\n  Nuclear power is a demanding but manageable technology. As we move \nforward, let us learn the proper lessons from this Japanese experience \nto make sure that in the United States and in the world, we are even \nbetter prepared for the unexpected events of the future.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will finally consider a \njudicial nomination I have been talking about since last year. Judge \nBoasberg is one of four nominees to the vacancies that have plagued the \ndistrict court for the District of Columbia, this Nation's Capital for \nsome time. This is another of the nominations that could--and in my \nview should--have been considered and confirmed last year. Instead, it \nwas unnecessarily returned to the President without final Senate action \ndespite the nominee's qualifications and the needs of the American \npeople to have judges available to hear cases in the Federal courts. \nThe President has had to renominate Judge Boasberg, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee has had to reconsider him and now, finally, the \nSenate is being allowed to consider him.\n  I suspect the Senate will now confirm him unanimously or nearly so. \nJudge Boasberg has outstanding credentials. He was appointed to be a \njudge in DC by President George W. Bush in 2002. He has a wealth of \nexperience, having presided over approximately 500 cases. He is a \nformer assistant U.S. attorney, and received the highest peer review \nrating of well qualified from the Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary of the American Bar Association.\n  Yet as we proceed with this nomination, Senate Republicans have \nobjected to proceeding to the nomination of Amy Jackson. Both Judge \nBoasberg and Ms. Jackson were reported without opposition by the \nJudiciary Committee last year and, again, earlier this year. I have \nspoken about the vacancies in the District of Columbia on numerous \noccasions, including as recently as last week. I noted the criticism \nfrom Chief\n\n[[Page S1587]]\n\nJudge Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. \nChief Judge Lamberth wrote to Senate leaders last November urging \naction by the Senate to fill the vacancies that exist on the district \ncourt for the District of Columbia. We could and should have acted on \nboth these nominations last year in response to that request. They were \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last year. These two \njudicial nominees to fill longstanding vacancies have been waiting too \nlong for final consideration by the Senate.\n  While I am glad we are ending the wait for Judge Boasberg, the \nrefusal to proceed on the Jackson nomination is just another example of \nthe needless delays on considering outstanding nominees. Ms. Jackson is \na former assistant U.S. attorney with outstanding credentials and \nexperience. She, too, received the Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary of the American Bar Association's highest peer review rating \nof well qualified. Representative Norton has called her one of the top \npractitioners in one of the District's top law firms, and has strongly \nendorsed her nomination.\n  In addition to Judge Boasberg, there are still 10 judicial nominees \nleft waiting for Senate consideration having been reviewed by the \nJudiciary Committee: nominees to fill two judicial emergency vacancies \nin New York, a judicial emergency vacancy on the Second Circuit, a \njudicial emergency vacancy in California and vacancies on the Federal \nand DC Circuit, a vacancy in Oregon, and two vacancies in Virginia. \nThey should be debated and confirmed without delay as well. I urge the \nSenate leadership to proceed to debate and vote on them before the \nupcoming recess. We should be working to clear the calendar before the \nrecess and not unnecessarily extend these vacancies. That is what a \nreturn to regular order entails.\n  The Judiciary Committee is holding hearings every 2 weeks and we hope \nfinally to begin to bend the curve and start to lower judicial \nvacancies across the country.We can do that if the Senate continues to \nconsider judicial nominations in regular order as they are reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Federal judicial vacancies around the country still number too many, \nand they have persisted for too long. That is why Chief Justice \nRoberts, Attorney General Holder, White House Counsel Bob Bauer and \nmany others--including the President of the United States--have spoken \nout and urged the Senate to act.\n  Nearly one out of every nine Federal judgeships remains vacant. This \nputs at serious risk the ability of all Americans to have a fair \nhearing in court. The real price being paid for these unnecessary \ndelays is that the judges that remain are overburdened and the American \npeople who depend on them are being denied hearings and justice in a \ntimely fashion. When Chief Judge Lamberth wrote to Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell last November, he noted that Senate action to fill \nthe vacancies in DC was needed so that ``the citizens of the District \nof Columbia and the Federal Government and other litigants'' who rely \non the Court could receive ``the high quality of justice they \ndeserve.'' The Chief Judge wrote about the ``severe impact'' these \njudicial vacancies were having and observed that the ``challenging \ncaseload'' of the court ``includes many involving national security \nissues, as well as other issues of national significance.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Chief Judge's letter be \nprinted in the record at the end of my statement.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the end \nof my statement recent articles from the Palm Beach Post and the \nAssociated Press about the delays in judicial confirmation and some \nadditional examples of difficulties being caused. The Florida paper \nreports on the crisis in south Florida and the watch list for Federal \ncourts with high caseloads and high vacancies. The Associated Press \nreport is on the situation in Rhode Island where dozens of cases have \nhad to be reassigned to judges in New Hampshire and Massachusetts \nbecause the Senate continues to delay consideration of the nomination \nof Jack McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (see exhibits 1 and 2.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Regrettably, the progress we made during the first 2 years \nof the Bush administration has not been duplicated, and the progress we \nmade over the 8 years from 2001 to 2009 to reduce judicial vacancies \nfrom 110 to a low of 34 was reversed. The vacancy rate we reduced from \n10 percent at the end of President Clinton's term to less than 4 \npercent in 2008 has now risen back to over 10 percent. In contrast to \nthe sharp reduction in vacancies we made during President Bush's first \n2 years when the Democratically controlled Senate confirmed 100 of his \njudicial nominations, only 60 of President Obama's judicial nominations \nwere allowed to be considered and confirmed during his first 2 years. \nWe have not kept up with the rate of attrition, let alone brought the \nvacancies down. By now they should have been cut in half. Instead, they \ncontinue to hover around 100. After tonight's confirmation, they will \nstill number 96.\n  The Senate must do better. The Nation cannot afford further delays by \nthe Senate in taking action on the nominations pending before it. \nJudicial vacancies on courts throughout the country hinder the Federal \njudiciary's ability to fulfill its constitutional role. They create a \nbacklog of cases that prevents people from having their day in court. \nThis is unacceptable.\n  We can consider and confirm this President's nominations to the \nFederal bench in a timely manner. President Obama has worked with \nDemocratic and Republican home State Senators to identify superbly \nqualified, consensus nominations. The nominations on the Executive \nCalendar should not be controversial. They all have the support of \ntheir home State Senators, Republicans and Democrats. All have a strong \ncommitment to the rule of law and a demonstrated faithfulness to the \nConstitution.\n  During President Bush's first term, his first 4 tumultuous years in \noffice, we proceeded to confirm 205 of his judicial nominations. We \nconfirmed 100 of those during the 17 months I was chairman during \nPresident Bush's first 2 years in office. So far in President Obama's \nthird year in office, the Senate has only been allowed to consider 72 \nof his Federal circuit and district court nominees. We remain well \nshort of the benchmark we set during the Bush administration. When we \napproach it we can reduce vacancies from the historically high levels \nat which they have remained throughout these first 3 years of the Obama \nadministration to the historically low level we reached toward the end \nof the Bush administration.\n  I have thanked the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Grassley, for his cooperation this year. I was pleased to see \nhim taking credit for what he called ``our rapid pace.'' I was \nencouraged by his commitment to ``continue to move consensus nominees \nthrough the confirmation process.'' That should be good news to Ms. \nJackson and the other judicial nominees now available and ready to be \nconfirmed without further delay.\n  My friend from Iowa is fond of pointing to the vacancies for which \nthere are not nominees. Of course, some of that is attributable to a \nlack of cooperation by certain home State Senators with the White \nHouse. Nonetheless, I agree with the Senator from Iowa that we can do \nlittle about confirming nominations we do not have. What we can do is \nproceed expeditiously with the qualified nominations the President has \nsent to the Senate.\n  In that regard, I would temper my friend's extolling our achievements \nthis year by observing that every judge confirmed so far this year \ncould and should have been confirmed last year. Every one of them was \nunanimously reported last year and would have been confirmed had \nRepublicans not objected and created a new rule of obstruction after \nmidterm elections. We have long had the ``Thurmond rule'' to describe \nhow Senator Thurmond shut down the confirmation process in advance of \nthe 1980 Presidential election. Last year's shutdown was something new. \nI cannot remember a time when so many consensus nominees were left \nwithout Senate action at the midterm point of a Presidency. That new \nlevel of obstruction has contributed to our being so far behind and \njudicial vacancies having been perpetuated at so high a level for too \nlong.\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               U.S. District Court\n\n\n                                 for the District of Columbia,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2010.\n     Re Judicial Vacancies--United States District Court for the \n         District of Columbia\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid and Senator McConnell: On behalf of the \n     judges of the United States District Court for the District \n     of Columbia, I request that the Senate act soon to fill the \n     vacancies that exist at our Court.\n       Of our 15 authorized judgeships, we currently have four \n     vacancies. One has been vacant since January 2007. With the \n     additional vacancy that will result from Judge Ricardo M. \n     Urbina's assumption of senior status, effective January 31, \n     2011, this Court faces the prospect of having only 10 of its \n     15 authorized judgeships filled. The severe impact of this \n     situation already is being felt and will only increase over \n     time. The challenging caseload that our Court regularly \n     handles includes many involving national security issues, as \n     well as other issues of national significance. A large number \n     of these complex, high-profile cases demand significant time \n     and attention from each of our judges.\n       Without a complement of new judges, it is difficult to \n     foresee how our remaining active judges will be able to keep \n     up with the heavy volume of cases that faces us. A 33 percent \n     vacancy ratio is quite extraordinary.\n       Two nominees (Beryl Howell and Robert Wilkins) have been \n     reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee and await \n     floor votes; two nominees (James Boasberg and Amy Jackson) \n     have had their hearings and hopefully will soon be reported \n     out of Committee.\n       We hope the Senate will act quickly to fill this Court's \n     vacancies so the citizens of the District of Columbia and the \n     Federal Government and other litigants who appear before us \n     continue to enjoy the high quality of justice they deserve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Royce C. Lamberth,\n     Chief Judge.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                [From the Palm Beach Post, Mar. 6, 2011]\n\nFederal Judge Vacancies: Confirmation Lag Keeping Benches Cool in South \n                                Florida\n\n                           (By Jane Musgrave)\n\n       U.S. District Judge Daniel T.K. Hurley has been waiting 741 \n     days--about two years--for his replacement to be named.\n       Although the genial 67-year-old former Palm Beach County \n     circuit judge planned to remain on the bench in a limited \n     capacity, he said the delay is worrisome.\n       ``One of the great concerns for the court as an institution \n     is that over time we'll have other vacancies, and if the \n     vacancies aren't filled in a timely manner,'' legal logjams \n     eventually will prevent people from getting their day in \n     court, he said.\n       With two of his colleagues--U.S. District Judges Alan Gold \n     in January and Paul Huck in July--joining him on what is \n     known as senior status, his concern is more than academic.\n       The glacial speed of the U.S. Senate's judicial \n     confirmation process, blamed on partisan politics, has \n     hobbled courts throughout the country.\n       In January, a judicial emergency was declared in Arizona. \n     To help judges deal with burgeoning immigration and border \n     security cases, the declaration lets them waive 70-day \n     speedy-trial requirements and not bring criminal defendants \n     to trial for as long as six months.\n       Although spurred by the shooting rampage that left Chief \n     Judge John Roll dead and U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords \n     wounded, the situation in Arizona was dire even before Roll's \n     death.\n       South Florida is in danger of a similar crisis. Like 26 \n     district and appellate courts throughout the country, it is \n     on a federal watch list because of the high caseloads and \n     disappearing judges.\n       Today, a person filing a civil lawsuit in federal court can \n     expect to wait two years to get to trial, according to the \n     Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Such delays have \n     widespread and unintended ripple effects, said Ian Millhiser, \n     a policy analyst for the left-leaning Center for American \n     Progress.\n       ``It has serious consequences for business,'' he said. \n     ``Imagine you're a corporation with a multimillion- dollar \n     lawsuit hanging over your head. Even if you think you can win \n     it, you're not going to be hiring until it is resolved, and \n     it could take years.''\n       The number of seats that have remained vacant since \n     President Obama took office two years ago is unprecedented, \n     he said. Obama's predecessors enjoyed confirmation rates as \n     high as 93 percent, but less than 60 percent of his nominees \n     have been confirmed. George W. Bush had a 76 percent \n     confirmation rate during his first two years in office.\n       Though the Senate confirmed six federal judges last month, \n     98 seats are vacant, says the Office of U.S. Courts. More \n     vacancies are expected.\n       ``Federal judges are now retiring faster than they are \n     being replaced,'' Millhiser said.\n       Further, he said, 81 of the vacancies are district \n     judgeships, appointments that have historically never \n     generated controversy. Unlike appellate judges, who often \n     establish law, the work of the lower-court judges--drug and \n     immigration violations, job discrimination and defective-\n     product lawsuits--is generally routine.\n       ``It's not ideological,'' he said. 'There's no Democratic \n     or Republican way to set a summary judgment hearing.''\n       Rachel Brand, who oversaw judicial appointments as an \n     associate counsel to Bush, pointed out that Bush made \n     judicial appointments a priority. Although Obama initially \n     made a flurry of nominations, it slowed, she said in a panel \n     discussion in November sponsored by the American Constitution \n     Society for Law and Policy. Of the 98 vacancies, only 46 \n     nominations are pending.\n       Other priorities, such as getting two U.S. Supreme Court \n     justices confirmed, seemed to distract Obama's \n     administration, she said.\n       Further, she said the delays can't be blamed solely on \n     Senate Republicans. ``You'd think (59) senators could do \n     something,'' she said of the Democratic majority that existed \n     until the party lost six seats in the November elections.\n       The problem, Millhiser said, is that Senate rules empower \n     ``the extreme fringes.'' Though Senate Majority Leader Harry \n     Reid, D-Nev., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., \n     recently cut a deal to speed nominees through floor votes, \n     that agreement means nothing if more ideological wills \n     prevail.\n       ``The Senate rules allow an single senator to allow 30 \n     hours of debate,'' he said. ``The extreme fringe can prevent \n     a significant amount of progress. It creates a minority-rule \n     situation.''\n       Senate Judiciary Committee approval of Kathleen Williams, \n     the lawyer tapped to replace Hurley, has been delayed despite \n     the bipartisan support she received from Florida Sens. Marco \n     Rubio, a Republican, and Bill Nelson, a Democrat. Obama \n     submitted her name to the committee in July.\n       Local attorneys said they are flummoxed by the delay in \n     confirming Williams, the federal public defender for \n     Florida's Southern District since 1995.\n       Other candidates have enjoyed bipartisan support. Of the 38 \n     candidates who cleared the Judiciary Committee last year, 29 \n     were endorsed unanimously but never presented for \n     confirmation to the full Senate, Millhiser said.\n       Among local attorneys, the conclusion seems obvious: ``it's \n     just partisan politics,'' Val Rodriguez said.\n       Miami attorney Neal Sonnett, a former president of the \n     American Judicature Society, which focuses on promoting an \n     independent judiciary, agreed. Last year Republican senators \n     blocked the confirmation process, hoping they would seize \n     control of the Senate in the November elections, he said. Now \n     it appears some are intent on stalling nominations until \n     after the 2012 elections, when they hope to put one of their \n     own back in the White House, he said.\n       So far, attorneys said they haven't seen lengthy delays in \n     getting cases heard and resolved in South Florida. Chief U.S. \n     District Judge Federico Moreno said the district is lucky \n     because seven senior judges still handle some cases. Further, \n     Hurley said, case filings have slowed, in part, because of \n     the economy.\n       While he credits the 15 full-time judges with moving cases \n     quickly, attorney Ted Babbitt says eventually something has \n     to give.\n       ``The average person is going to get hurt because they're \n     going to have to wait to have their cases heard,'' he said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Associated Press, Mar. 7, 2011]\n\n             RI Judge Holdup Sends 2 Dozen Cases to NH, MA\n\n                          (By Ian MacDougall)\n\n       Providence, RI.--Rhode Island's top federal judge says a \n     four-year judicial vacancy left open amid partisan bickering \n     in the U.S. Senate has prompted her court to take the unusual \n     step of reassigning more than two dozen civil cases to judges \n     in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.\n       In an interview, Chief Judge Mary M.

Smith, with a growing \n     caseload that has begun to reach a critical mass.\n       The vacancy ``has had a major impact on the business of the \n     court,'' Lisi said. ``We have an increasing caseload being \n     handled by only two people where three judges are \n     authorized.''\n       Lisi said her primary reason for moving the cases was that \n     she worried a lag in rendering decisions at key points in the \n     litigation would leave plaintiffs and defendants in the \n     lurch. She said she chose to reassign cases with important \n     motions pending.\n       ``Our job is to resolve cases and to do so in as timely and \n     efficient a manner as we can. And when our ability to do so \n     is hampered, I don't think that's good for any participants \n     in the process,'' she said.\n       A third judge, Ronald R. Lagueux, who is a senior judge, \n     has volunteered to help to ease the burden on Lisi and Smith.\n       The case reassignment is one example of a real effect and a \n     real cost, to travelling litigants, lawyers and judges of the \n     often-snarled judicial appointment process whose unknotting \n     U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts called for in \n     December.\n       ``Each political party has found it easy to turn on a dime \n     from decrying to defending\n\n[[Page S1589]]\n\n     the blocking of judicial nominations, depending on their \n     changing political fortunes,'' Roberts wrote in his 2010 \n     report on the federal judiciary. ``There remains . . . an \n     urgent need for the political branches to find a long-term \n     solution to this recurring problem.''\n       Twenty-five of the Rhode Island civil lawsuits were \n     reassigned to New Hampshire and two to Massachusetts in late \n     January, about two weeks after President Barack Obama \n     nominated Jack McConnell, a Rhode Island trial attorney, to \n     the state's vacant judgeship for the third time. The \n     nomination has faced resistance from some Senate Republicans \n     and staunch opposition from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The \n     chamber claims McConnell's track record, which includes suing \n     former lead paint companies, evinces a bias against business \n     defendants.\n       McConnell declined to comment on his nomination.\n       In November 2007 almost a year after the vacancy opened \n     then-President George W. Bush nominated Lincoln Almond, a \n     federal magistrate judge in Rhode Island. His candidacy \n     fizzled after a lukewarm reception from U.S. Sens., Jack Reed \n     and Sheldon Whitehouse.\n       Normally, cases are assigned to judges elsewhere, who \n     follow the rules of the originating court, only when all \n     judges in a given district recuse themselves. Lisi says the \n     current situation is unique in recent state history.\n       Other districts facing stalled appointments have not yet \n     taken similar steps.\n       However, Peter Oppeneer, court clerk for the Western \n     District of Wisconsin, said that court might need to look to \n     other districts for help if a vacancy there takes a long time \n     to fill. Some Senate Republicans have opposed Obama's nominee \n     to that judgeship, Louis Butler.\n       The Rhode Island reassignment has generated some confusion \n     and consternation among state lawyers.\n       George Babcock, who's suing on behalf of more than a dozen \n     clients in a foreclosures case transferred to New Hampshire, \n     says the move is upsetting to some of his clients and \n     potentially expensive. He says the court has told him the \n     case, if it goes to trial, will be heard in Concord, N.H.\n       ``I want to work on my cases in my office, not in a Motel \n     6,'' Babcock said. ``And with all these clients, I'm going to \n     have to rent a whole wing at the Motel 6.''\n       Other lawyers with reassigned cases say New Hampshire \n     judges have offered to travel to Providence. It is ultimately \n     up to each individual judge to decide where the case should \n     be heard, according to David DiMarzio, clerk for federal \n     court in Rhode Island.\n       There are just over 2,500 civil cases and 205 criminal \n     cases pending in Rhode Island, according to court figures. Of \n     the civil cases, over 1,600 are part of multi-district \n     litigation that Lisi says the court accepted before realizing \n     it would be faced with an extended vacancy.\n       For now, Lisi says, she does not plan to transfer more \n     cases to other districts.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am about to suggest the absence of a \nquorum, but I ask unanimous consent that when I suggest the absence of \na quorum, the time be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson of Florida are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, we will confirm yet another of \nPresident Obama's judicial nominees. After today's vote, we will have \nconfirmed five judicial nominees in the last 5 legislative days. We are \nmoving swiftly in committee and on the Senate floor. Notwithstanding \nour quick pace, we hear from some that we are not moving fast enough. \nAs I have said before, our side will continue to work in good faith to \nprocess consensus nominees. But we will not place quantity confirmed \nover quality confirmed. These lifetime appointments are too important \nto the Federal judiciary and the American people to simply rubberstamp \nthem.\n  Today we will vote on Judge James Boasberg to sit on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. Judge Boasberg is not the \nfirst individual nominated to fill this vacancy. This seat became \nvacant in May 2008, when Judge Thomas F. Hogan took senior status. \nPresident Bush nominated Jeffrey Adam Rosen in June 2008. He was \nunanimously rated well qualified by the ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary. He had over 20 years of experience in private \npractice, principally involved in complex business litigation matters. \nHe had more than 5 years of public service, having served as general \ncounsel at the Office of Management and Budget and at the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation. Despite his qualifications, Mr. Rosen's \nnomination languished in committee for over 6 months.\n  While I am disappointed Mr. Rosen was not given any consideration, I \nam pleased to be able to support Judge Boasberg. He was nominated last \nJune and had his hearing in September. He was reported out of committee \nlast December, during the lameduck session, and the Senate was unable \nto complete action on the nomination. The committee moved quickly on \nhis renomination this year, reporting him out of committee last month.\n  Judge Boasberg presently serves as an associate judge of the Superior \nCourt of the District of Columbia. Following the Senate's unanimous \nconfirmation, President George W. Bush appointed him to this position \nin August, 2002.\n  Judge Boasberg earned his B.A., magna cum laude, from Yale College, \nhis master of studies from Oxford University, and his juris doctor from \nYale Law School. After completing law school, he clerked for the \nHonorable Dorothy W. Nelson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth \nCircuit. He then went into private practice, working as a litigator on \ncomplex business and white-collar defense matters.\n  Judge Boasberg also served as an assistant U.S. attorney for the \nDistrict of Columbia. There he prosecuted criminal matters and \nspecialized in homicide cases. He has received a unanimous well \nqualified rating from the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary.\n  I am pleased this seat is being filled with someone who has concrete \nknowledge of what it takes to be a judge, and I hope Judge Boasberg \ncontinues to work hard to serve the American people.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on this important lifetime \nappointment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of the time \non our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is yielded back.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof James Emanuel Boasberg, of the District of Columbia, to be United \nStates District Judge for the District of Columbia?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, last week Kansas City lost a treasure. \nA very special person to the Kansas City community passed away last \nweek. This is a man, Mike Murphy, who was loved by just about everybody \nin the area. While his family and friends are gathered now in Kansas \nCity for his memorial service--I am sure there are hundreds who are \nthere--I would like to place these words in the Congressional Record in \nhis memory. Obviously, my prayers go out to his family.\n  Mike Murphy has been part of the fabric of Kansas City for almost 50 \nyears. For over 40 years, he was the most dominant local radio \npersonality in all of the Midwest. He was popular. In fact, he became \nradio lore. At times over his career, over 50 percent of people \nlistening to the radio in Kansas City were listening to his program.\n  He began his career in radio in 1968. He went on to rise to a class \nby himself in local and regional radio and, in fact, was the winner of \nthe prestigious Marconi award in 1998.\n  Thousands of truckers and salesmen throughout the Midwest heard him \non the mighty KCMO and became his fans and his friends. His program was \nan essential part of their day. Why? What was there about this guy? He \nreally did not have a political agenda. Unlike today, he was not busy \ntrying to get people all upset about the issues of the day. He did not \ntake sides on political issues. He rarely had big stars as guests, but \nfrom time to time they came through wanting to promote something. \nBecause his show was such a dominant show in the area, they wanted to \nget on it. He was just a funny, irreverent guy who always made you feel \nas if you knew him when you listened to his program. He talked like a \nreal person. He did not try to show off his intellect. He was smart as \na whip, but he never felt the need to impress anybody--I mean anybody. \nHe just wanted to be your pal. He was fun and funny.\n  He is most famous in Kansas City for starting the second largest St. \nPatrick's Day parade in the country. How did he start it? In 1973, he \nwas having a drink at a bar that a buddy of his owned. He and a very \nprominent PR guy who worked in campaigns around Kansas City, Pat \nO'Neill, Sr., and maybe one or two of their other friends, called Larry \nMoore, a local news reporter, and said: We are going to start a parade. \nThey went out of Hogarty's bar, marched a few blocks, and they got a \nlittle film on TV that night, and the Kansas City St. Patrick's Day \nparade was born.\n  Years later, and thousands of floats and hundreds of thousands of \nspectators, every year in the St. Patrick's Day parade, where was Mike \nMurphy? On a garbage truck. He always rode on a garbage truck. It was \nhis way of signaling to the people of Kansas City: I am no big deal. I \ndon't need a fancy car. I am happy up here on the garbage truck.\n  He was getting upset about Kansas City's heritage at one point, so in \n1996 he decided: We need to have a cattle drive again through Kansas \nCity--harkening back to the days of a frontier town, and the stockyards \nwere an important part of Kansas City's legacy. What did he do? He \nstarted a cattle drive through downtown Kansas City. He would get some \namateur cowboys and then invite a lot of his pals to get on horses and \ntake these cattle down the main street of Kansas City.\n  He loved characters. He thought being called ``a little goofy'' was \nthe highest compliment you could pay him.\n\n[[Page S1591]]\n\nHe loved to talk about UFOs and aliens. His show was a vacation from \nserious. His humor was never at the expense of someone else.\n  I was so fortunate to be one of the many who became part of his large \ngroup of regulars. It all began with a phone call to his show when I \nwas driving back from Jefferson City to Kansas City as a young State \nlegislator. This was over 20 years ago. He was saying stuff on the \nradio--of course, I was listening to Mike Murphy as I drove because \neverybody listened to Mike Murphy. He was saying something on the radio \nthat was not correct. This is before cell phones. I pulled my car off \nthe highway. I remember to this day exactly where it was. I got on a \npay phone, and I called his show because he was saying something that \nwas not correct. I was scared to death. He took my call. I was scared. \nHe was funny. And we became friends. Like hundreds of other people just \nlike me, we became friends.\n  In fact, we became such close friends that he taunted me until I \nagreed to be part of the cattle drive. One year, there I was on the top \nof a horse riding through downtown Kansas City behind a bunch of \ncattle. That might have been the last year of the cattle drive because \nI think that was the year some of them escaped into a parking garage in \ndowntown Kansas City, and the Kansas City police were called to see if \nwe couldn't get them off the top of a multistory garage in downtown \nKansas City.\n  I was blessed to be in a bleacher seat to watch his heart at work--\nfrom his annual Salvation Army show to small acts of kindness to mere \nacquaintances, to his incredible loyalty to his friends.\n  His heart was as enormous as his patience for BS was small. He also \nhad no patience for pompous. Some of his famous shows were shows where \nsomeone came on his show who would be considered a big deal, a star. If \nthat person began being arrogant on Mike Murphy's show, if that person \nstarted talking down to Mike Murphy's friends--his listeners--Mike \nwould let him know in no uncertain terms that the interview was over, \nthat he was not interested in allowing anyone to talk down to his \npals--his listening audience.\n  I will never, ever forget the twinkle in Mike Murphy's eye. It is \nimportant that he remain one of Kansas City's brightest legends of all \ntime.\n  My hope for Mike Murphy's memory--I am not surprised that Mike chose \nthe first 17 days of March to meet his Maker because of the fun he had \naround St. Patrick's Day.

It would be great if that story would \nbe about Mike Murphy, but the most important thing is that it is a \nfunny story. Let me tell you, Mike will not care if it is not even \ntrue.\n  To Mike Murphy, the kind of man who walks as a giant among us and we \ndo not even realize it until he is gone, a man who never lost sight \nthat the little salesman out there driving in his car and the mother at \nhome doing her family's laundry were the most important people on the \nEarth--here's to you, Mike.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the importance \nof a landmark piece of legislation, the Clean Air Act. Congress passed \nthe Clean Air Act over 40 years ago with broad bipartisan support from \nboth Chambers of Congress, and President Nixon wisely signed it into \nlaw. Since then, we have seen remarkable benefits to the health of our \nNation. We have seen significant reductions in pollution from lead, \nmercury, sulfur dioxide, and a host of other contaminants. America \nreduced pollution and made remarkable strides in improving public \nhealth even while our economy adjusted and thrived. In fact, the Clean \nAir Act has a long track record of promoting job creation and economic \ngrowth while reducing pollution.\n  The economic benefits of the Clean Air Act are significant. For every \n$1 spent on Clear Air Act protections, we get $30 of public health \nbenefits in return.\n  In the year 2010 alone, the Clean Air Act saved 160,000 lives and \navoided millions of cases of pollution-related illness, including 1.7 \nmillion cases of asthma exacerbation, 130,000 heart attacks, 86,000 \nemergency room visits, 3.2 million lost school days, and 13 million \nlost work days.\n  This is a profoundly important law. It protects every single American \nfrom the types of pollution that can cause asthma attacks, lost school \ndays for young children, emergency room visits, heart attacks, strokes, \nand even premature deaths.\n  The House of Representatives recently passed a continuing resolution \nfor the remainder of the fiscal year that would make truly Draconian \ncuts to Clean Air Act funding and authority. These policy riders do not \nbelong in the 7-month budget. And I am glad the Senate recently voted \ndown that legislation.\n\n  Upon passage of the House bill, the American Lung Association, which \nis the leading organization working to save American lives from the \nravages of lung disease, said:\n\n       The House of Representatives also adopted amendments that \n     would block implementation of the Clean Air Act and its \n     lifesaving protections . . .\n       These provisions and others adopted by the House would \n     result in millions of Americans--including children, seniors \n     and people with chronic disease such as asthma--being forced \n     to breathe air that is unhealthy.\n       Breathing air pollution can cause asthma attacks, heart \n     attacks, strokes, cancer and shortened lives.\n\n  That is coming from one of the most respected public health \norganizations in the world telling us that this weakening of the Clean \nAir Act would have dire public health consequences, that more Americans \nwill get sick from toxic pollution.\n  We can and should be flexible and listen to the industries affected \nby the law, but we cannot undermine its purpose. Legitimate concerns \nabout regulation should be addressed so we can prosper and grow jobs in \nthe United States of America. It is important that the Clean Air Act be \nenforced in a commonsense manner that is workable for American \nbusinesses, but we cannot abandon its core charges--to preserve public \nhealth and ensure the cleanliness of the air we breathe.\n  I know there is often tension between the EPA, the regulated \ncommunity, and stakeholders seeking to navigate the Clean Air Act, and \nthere probably always will be. Our economy functions best and in a way \nthat is best for our citizens when we seek a robust Clean Air Act and \nare responsive to the needs of our economy.\n  An example of this working well is recent praise that the \nadministration received from the CEO of a leading energy company, who \nsaid:\n\n       When I look at what EPA has done so far . . . it's actually \n     been pretty moderate.\n\n  When the same CEO was asked whether Congress should delay the \nadministrations's work to protect public health for 2 years, he said:\n\n       That's just two more years of uncertainty where I think a \n     lot of the investment will remain on the sideline in our \n     industry instead of being invested in technology. We know how \n     to build . . . I don't support delay for those reasons.\n\n  I support continued implementation of the Clean Air Act and will \noppose efforts to undermine this important law. For my part, the \ndecision is very simple: We should let doctors and scientists dictate \nour public health policy instead of politicians. I hope my friends on \nboth sides of the aisle will come to this same conclusion as well and \nvote against efforts to weaken the Clean Air Act.\n  For more than 40 years, we have seen that protecting the air we \nbreathe does not have to come at a cost to the Nation's economy. Both \ncan improve, both must improve hand in hand.\n  To close, I would like to reiterate that the Clean Air Act has been \nsuccessful in reducing levels of dozens of dangerous air pollutants and \nprotecting the health of millions of Americans, all while our economy \ngrew. This is a landmark law that has had strong bipartisan support for \ndecades. The Senate should not weaken it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have been around Congress a few years. \nWhen I served in the House of Representatives 16 years ago, the \nRepublicans won control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. \nThey promised to change how business was done in Washington and they \nelected Newt Gingrich of Georgia as Speaker of the House. On his first \nday on the job, Speaker Gingrich addressed a black tie dinner of happy \nsupporters and took aim at an enemy he said was undermining America's \nvalues, and that enemy was Big Bird.\n  Newt Gingrich denounced public broadcasting as a sandbox for the rich \nand he condemned it for ``eating taxpayers' money.'' He went on to say: \n``They are simply enclaves of the left using your money to propagandize \nyour children against your values.''\n  Once the Gingrich Republican revolutionaries finished passing their \nso-called Contract With America, Gingrich vowed he would do everything \nin his power to do away with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, \nNational Public Radio, and the Public Broadcasting Stations. \nFortunately, in the Republican and Democratic parties, cooler heads \nprevailed. Big Bird was spared.\n  Well, to borrow a line from former President Reagan, ``Here we go \nagain.'' When we should be talking about the serious budget deficit \naffecting America, the House Republican budget spent too much time \nresurrecting the old bumper stickers of the past. They went to \nAmerica's bumper sticker museum and said: Well, let's see if there are \nsome oldies but goodies here, and they loaded up the Republican budget \nbill with a lot of old issues. Some of them finally went back to the \nday when Newt Gingrich went after Big Bird. Sixteen years after Newt \nGingrich, this new band of Republicans in the House is once again \ndenouncing public broadcasting as a hotbed of subversive values, and \nthey have vowed to pull the plug.\n  You may remember, Mr. President, our friends across the aisle \nactually tried to end funding for the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting last November during the lameduck session. At that time, \nthe rallying cry was outrage over NPR's firing of commentator Juan \nWilliams. Now there is a new defunding effort underway and a new source \nof outrage. James O'Keefe, a rightwing activist with a video camera and \na conservative agenda, released a video last week which he claims \nproves National Public Radio is a biased liberal organization that \nneeds no Federal funding.\n  In the video, two allies of Mr. O'Keefe's pretend to be members of a \nMuslim education group who are considering making a large donation, \nthey said, to NPR. Then they secretly recorded their meeting with two \nNPR executives.\n  If the name James O'Keefe rings a bell with Members of the Senate, it \nshould. Remember some of the other things he was caught doing? It was \nJames O'Keefe and his colleagues who posed as telephone repairmen and \ntried to lie their way into the office of our colleague, Senator Mary \nLandrieu of Louisiana. They were going to try to make one of their \n``gotcha'' videos there. They went too far. At the end of it, Mr. \nO'Keefe pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of entering Federal property \nunder false pretenses. A Federal judge sentenced Mr. O'Keefe to 3 years \nprobation, a fine of $1,500, and 100 hours of community service.\n  This same Mr. O'Keefe, in 2009, posed with some of his friends as a \npimp and prostitute to secretly film a discussion with staffers of the \ngrassroots antipoverty group ACORN. Their video of that meeting was so \ninflammatory Congress vowed to eliminate all Federal funding for that \ngroup.\n  I cannot tell you, Mr. President, how many amendments we had on the \nfloor of the Senate--in the midst of all the problems we were facing in \nthe country and around the world--focused on ACORN. Three separate \ninvestigations, incidentally, later cleared ACORN of any wrongdoing. A \nreport by the Congressional Research Service found Mr. O'Keefe's \nundercover videotaping may have broken laws both in Louisiana and \nMaryland.\n  Mr. O'Keefe, obviously, is not too concerned about breaking a law if \nhe thinks he is going to come up with a sensational video. He was \nconvicted in Louisiana, as I mentioned earlier.\n  The New York Daily News--not exactly a liberal news organization--\nconcluded, when it came to the ACORN incident, ``they edited the tape \nto meet their agenda.'' As California's then-Attorney General Jerry \nBrown said, after they investigated the ACORN video:\n\n       Things are not always as partisan zealots portray them \n     through highly selective editing of reality. Sometimes a \n     fuller truth is found on the cutting room floor.\n\n  Mr. O'Keefe appears to be engaged in creative editing again, and this \ntime his target is National Public Radio. That is not just my opinion. \nThe Web site of none other than FOX News' own Glenn Beck--that is \nright, Glenn Beck--compares the edited and unedited versions of Mr. \nO'Keefe's latest video and concludes that the edited version appears to \nbe deceptively edited in order to portray statements by one of the \nsecretly recorded NPR executives out of context. An example: On the \nvideo, Ron Schiller, who was then in charge of fundraising for NPR, and \nhas since been terminated, is heard to say:\n\n       It is very clear that we would be better off in the long \n     run without Federal funding.\n\n  I have heard that repeated over and over; that this NPR fundraising \nexecutive said ``we would be better off if we didn't have Federal \nfunding.'' The far right has seized on this statement as proof NPR \ndoesn't need it and shouldn't get it. But here is the part that ended \nup on the cutting room floor. Schiller explained, when they looked at \nthe full transcript, that most ``philanthropists'' think NPR is almost \nfully funded by the government, which prevents many of them from \ndonating. Mr. Schiller also said that if NPR lost all Federal funding \nnow, ``we would have a lot of stations go dark.''\n  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting supports nearly 1,300 local \nradio and TV stations in communities all across America--in Illinois \nand I bet in West Virginia. Direct support for those stations makes up \nnearly 75 cents out of every dollar they spend. I know, because when \nyou turn them on to listen to the news, they are begging for money. You \nsend them a check and you think, I hope they will leave us alone for a \nlittle while.\n  Mr. President, 170 million Americans use public broadcasting services \nevery month. That is more than half the population of America. In my \nState of Illinois, 1 million people listen to our 14 public radio \nstations, and 3 million people rely on our 8 public television \nstations. All totaled, funding for public broadcasting works out to \nabout $1.35 per American per year--11 cents a month. I would say that \nis a bargain. It is a fraction of what people would pay to get good \ninformation.\n  Eliminating Federal funding for the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting is going to force many smaller stations to close, if the \nHouse Republicans have their way. The first ones hit--West Virginia, \nthe rural areas of Illinois, and smalltown America. They will be the \nones to lose the service first. Rural communities will be hard hit, as \nthey rely more than big stations in big cities on Federal funding.\n  Cutting all funding for public broadcasting? Does anybody seriously \nbelieve that will affect the deficit? But it would be a great loss to \ntens of millions of Americans who rely on public broadcasting for \nquality entertainment and honest, in-depth news coverage. With the \nmomentous changes occurring in the world, and the major challenges \nfacing our Nation, it is essential we maintain the integrity and \nviability of public broadcasting. There is nothing in commercial \nbroadcasting that can replace it.\n  Some of our conservative friends--and one of them came up to me on \nthe plane when I was heading home to Chicago last weekend--say they \ndon't object so much to the content of public broadcasting, they just \nobject philosophically to the whole idea of taxpayers' money being \nspent to subsidize radio and TV. They said let them go on the free \nmarket. If they can survive, fine; if they cannot, so be it. Here is \nwhat they ignore: FOX, NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, virtually all the major \nnetwork stations receive billions of dollars each year in public \nsubsidies. How?\n\n[[Page S1593]]\n\nIn the form of free use of the public TV spectrum. These stations do \nnot own the airwaves. The American people own the airwaves, and we give \nthem licenses to use our airwaves, America's airwaves, to make their \nprofits.\n\n  The New America Foundation estimated the total value of the TV \nspectrum used by commercial TV stations at nearly $5.5 billion a year, \nand that doesn't count the additional tens of millions of dollars that \ncommercial TV stations make selling political ads every campaign \nseason. Sound familiar? We have all been there, writing checks to these \ncommercial TV stations to put on our ads so we can run for office and \npreserve the right of that TV station to use the public airwaves--free. \nThe public subsidies to commercial stations dwarf what we spend on \npublic broadcasting.\n  I admire the reporting on NPR, but I am a progressive Democrat. Many \nconservatives admire their reporting. David Brooks is a conservative I \nrespect. He writes for the New York Times and I look forward to his \ncolumn. Even when I disagree with him, I know it is a thoughtful \nanalysis of the challenges we face. Listen to what he said:\n\n       I think NPR has done a good job over the last 10 years of \n     reducing that bias. I thought it was really biased 10 years \n     ago, but now I think it's pretty straight, and the Federal \n     money for NPR doesn't go so much for the big stations. It \n     goes out to the rural parts of the country which wouldn't \n     have those stations otherwise.\n\n  David Brooks, you are right. If the Republicans have their way in the \nHouse, the losers will be a lot of red States in red parts of America \nthat want to hear both sides of the story, as I believe all Americans \nshould.\n  Tony Blankley was a longtime aide to Newt Gingrich who works now for \nFOX News and NPR. He said:\n\n       I've been on NPR regularly for a very long time. . . . From \n     a personal perspective they have always given me plenty of \n     access, I am clearly a right-wing commentator so I cannot \n     complain. There's a conservative on and there's a liberal on, \n     so that's all fair.\n\n  He added:\n\n       No editor or host has ever suggested, ``Could you not be \n     quite so conservative on this show?'' I have been open and \n     free to express my opinion.\n\n  Michael Medved is a conservative radio host. This is his take on NPR:\n\n       I think NPR tries harder to be fair than just about any \n     other media source. . . . I listen almost every day to \n     Morning Edition and All Things Considered. I think that they \n     do as good a job as anybody in media in reporting the news.\n\n  The conservative blogger said of NPR:\n\n       My own interaction with them has been fine. I have found \n     them to be fair. I think their coverage is often quite good. \n     I think NPR does a good job.\n\n  As proof of NPR's political bias, some critics of public broadcasting \npoint to what appear in the video to be critical comments Ron Schiller \nmade about the Tea Party.\n  This is another incident of deceptive editing. The full transcript \nshows that Mr. Schiller was recounting the views expressed to him by \ntwo top Republicans, including a former ambassador.\n  Let me say very clearly: Even repeating those comments was ill-\nadvised on Mr. Schiller's part. He no longer works for NPR.\n  And his comments have been roundly condemned by journalists who have \ngiven years of good work to NPR. In an open letter released last week \nto NPR listeners and supporters, the journalists said Mr. Schiller's \ncomments:\n\n     . . . violated the basic principles by which we live and \n     work: accuracy and open-mindedness, fairness and respect.\n\n  But the suggestion that NPR cannot be relied on to cover the Tea \nParty or conservative organizations fairly is refuted by Tea Party \nmembers themselves.\n  Katrina Pierson is a Tea Party activist in Houston. She told the \nmedia watchdog group Media Matters:\n\n       I think NPR was very cordial to our group. They actually \n     came to Texas and Spent a few days with us visiting our \n     homes, and our work places. They attended meetings and asked \n     questions. I enjoyed having them here. I think the reporting \n     that they ended up using for All Things Considered, it was \n     fair.\n\n  At a time in America when we value our government, when we applaud \nfreedom, when we preach it to the world, when we beg authoritarian \nregimes to give their people a chance to hear both sides of the story, \nwhen we say that our Bill of Rights, when it comes to free speech and \nfree press, should be a guidepost for the world, can we be in the \nbusiness of shutting down this opportunity for Americans every single \nday to hear both sides of the story when it comes to the big issues? I \ndon't think what was done in the House is about money. I think it is \nabout a political philosophy. Many of them think they just want to shut \ndown NPR because they are offended by some things that are said.\n  Let me say from my side of the spectrum, I have been offended the \nother way. I thought they went too far the other way. But isn't that \nwhat it is all about? They give you both sides, make up your own mind, \nand that is the way it should be.\n  We have seen what could happen when people rush to judgment after \nseeing selectively edited and sometimes deceptively edited videos. \nShirley Sherrod was fired from her job at the Agriculture Department \nand painted unfairly as a bigot when she was, in fact, making a \npassionate plea for racial tolerance. Her comments were knowingly \ndistorted in a video produced by a man who has, in the past, supported \nMr. O'Keefe.\n  Congress voted to cut off Federal funding for ACORN before there was \nany objective investigation into Mr. O'Keefe's damaging video about \nthem. Later investigation showed there was no criminal wrongdoing.\n  Let's not make the same mistake again. Let's not be duped by \ndeceptively edited videos at a time when Americans need the objective \nreporting and informative programming that public radio and public \ntelevision provide.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Earlier today in Columbus, OH, the State capital \nof my great State, I was at the Ohio State University's Fisher College \nof Business. We talked by phone with Under Secretary of Commerce \nFrancisco Sanchez, who is one of the leaders at the Department of \nCommerce, on how to grow exports in this country.\n  The President has charged the Congress, our businesses, encouraged \nall of us to find ways to double exports as a major path to economic \ngrowth, especially to grow manufacturing in our country. We know that \nfor the last several months, we have seen manufacturing growth, albeit \ntoo small, but manufacturing growth in this country.\n  That is especially important in Ohio. My State is the third leading \nmanufacturing State in the country, behind only California and Texas, \nStates which are two and three times our size in population. Yet Ohio \nhas kept pace with doing relatively well in manufacturing. But we know \nwhat has happened to manufacturing in our country in the last 30 years.\n  Only 30 years ago, manufacturing was more than one-quarter of our \nGDP, financial services was about 10 or 11 percent of GDP. In these 30 \nyears that position has almost flipped. Financial services is over one-\nquarter of our GDP, manufacturing is only 10, 11, or 12 percent. That \nis why the President and his push on exporting is so important, not \nthat we only export manufacturing goods, of course, we export services, \nas we should. But clearly manufacturing is a major component of that.\n  I sit on the President's Export Advisory Council with leaders of the \nadministration and the CEOs of some of America's largest companies and \nmany successful mid-sized and small companies in this country. We had a \nmeeting last Friday with Secretary Locke, Under Secretary Sanchez, \nSecretary of State Clinton, Jim McNerney of Boeing, Ursula Burns of \nXerox, Alan Mullaly of Ford, as part of the President's export council.\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\n  In Ohio, as a result, I have put together an export advisory council. \nWe met today in Columbus. That is what our meeting was about, to talk \nabout ideas. We heard from Albert Green of Kent Displays, William \nDawson of NexTech Materials, Philip Irwin of Ametek Solidstate \nControls, Randall Willaman of Command Ilkon, Inc., Mark Friedman of \nNational Biological Corporation, Arlinda Vaughan from Volk Optical, and \nKen Hagen from Fosbel.\n  All of them raised concerns directly to the Under Secretary of \nCommerce and directly to me, concerns about corruption in Russia, \nconcerns about tariffs in Brazil, concerns we all face and all of our \ncompanies face in breaking into the Chinese market, and many other \nconcerns about everything from medical devices to export of services \nand all of that. So the meeting was important.\n  I will mention one other. Susan Helper, the head of the Economics \nDepartment at Case Western, had particularly good thoughts about how we \ngrow manufacturing in this country. We know those jobs are created by \nmedium and small businesses. We also know that fewer than 1 percent of \nAmerican companies actually export. Even as close as we are to Canada \nor to Mexico, only 1 percent of our businesses export. So we know we \nhave to do much more.\n  In Germany, for instance, 20 percent of their workforce is in \nmanufacturing. They have a trade surplus with the rest of the world, \nwhile we have a huge almost insidious trade deficit. Germany has done \nsome pretty interesting things in encouraging manufacturing.\n  As many people point out, we have not had in our country a \nmanufacturing policy. I spoke with Pat Russo tonight, who is the former \nCEO of Lucent Technologies and a couple of--she sits on the General \nMotors board and a couple of other people from the GM board I spoke to, \nand talked about the fact that we do not have a manufacturing policy in \nthis country. That is why we are seeing other countries begin to do \nmuch better in manufacturing, while we have, by and large, drifted in \nour policies and our strategies on manufacturing.\n  There are several things that came out of this meeting that we need \nto do. We need to pay particular attention on economic development \nassistance and creating economic development partnerships and business \nincubators.\n  We need to pay special attention to help those companies get access \nto capital. That has been a vital roadblock--as the Presiding Officer \nfrom Oregon has been involved--a roadblock to our full economic \nrecovery. We need to look at our R tax credits.\n  Part of a national manufacturing policy should be increases in R \ntax credits, including making 48(C) a part of the Code that encourages \nconservation, encourages more efficiencies in energy production and in \nenergy use, making 48(C) permanent.\n  It means workforce training--our Sectors Act, which matches up what \nlocal businesses and labor unions and community colleges and workforce \ninvestment boards do to retrain workers so they find jobs after that \ntraining. That is why we are doing at end of the month our fourth \nannual Ohio College Presidents Conference, where I invite in some 55, \n60 college presidents. We have done it for the last 3 years, since my \nsecond year in the Senate, to talk about these issues: How do we \nencourage people to become engineers? How do we help with access to \ncollege, particularly in light of the fact that Republicans are trying \nto cut Pell grants several hundred dollars per student, sometimes a \ncouple of thousand, $3,000 a family, whatever.\n  How do we fight back and make sure that students have access to \neducation and to our higher education system, those who choose to go to \ncollege? We have a lot of work to do. All of this includes, as I said \nat the White House the other day in the meeting of the President's \nExport Council, while we work on exports, we need to fix our trade \nagreements, we need to fix our tax policy, we need to make sure those \nworkers who lose their jobs because of trade--and this is so often \nforgotten about by my Republican colleagues--workers who lose their \njobs because of trade have to be compensated. They need to be \nretrained. They need to keep their health care. That is why the \nPresiding Officer and I and many others have to fight for the \nextension--Senator Casey especially from Pennsylvania--of trade \nadjustment assistance and the health coverage tax credit, two long-time \nFederal programs. The TAA, Trade Adjustment Assistance, was started \nbipartisanly under President Kennedy in 1962.\n  Those are so important for workers who have lost jobs through no \ndoing of their own but because of trade agreements passed wrongfully, \nwrongheadedly in this body and in the House. Because of trade \nagreements they have lost their jobs. We need those workers to have the \nopportunity to be retrained and to continue to keep their health \ninsurance after they have been laid off through no fault of their own.\n  Our efforts to double exports is extraordinarily important for \neconomic growth. At the same time it is important that we are sensitive \nto those workers who have lost their jobs because of trade policy. We \ncan do this right. We can enforce our trade laws more aggressively as \nPresident Obama has begun to do. We can work on trade agreements. We \ncan fix trade policy so it actually helps American workers and American \nconsumers.

Mr. President, you hear a lot of talk about \nthe trouble in the Middle East, and people are saying that oil prices \nare going up and, therefore, the pain at the gas pump is being felt \nbecause there is this shakiness in the oil markets. You hear the \ncommentary: Well, we ought to be solving this problem by drilling more \nin the United States. In essence what people are talking about is they \nwant to drill more in the Gulf of Mexico. Of course, there is plenty of \nopportunity to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. There are 30 million acres \nthat are already under lease that have not been drilled. There are 7 \nmillion acres that are being drilled under lease, but there are an \nadditional 30 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico under lease, so there \nis plenty of opportunity. There is a lot more opportunity for domestic \ndrilling.\n  But what I want to talk about today is, it is this simplified message \nthat if we drill more domestically--which we clearly have the capacity \nto--that is going to solve the problem. That is not the problem, and \nthat is not the reason for why the gas prices are going up as they are.\n  I will grant you that whenever there is an oil-producing region of \nthe world where there is a disruption, then that does have some effect \non the price of oil. But what we have seen is an extraordinary spike in \nthe last couple of months in the price of oil. I want to try to point \nout to the Senate why this Senator thinks, and a number of my \ncolleagues join me, that spike in gas prices is going up.\n  There is further evidence that our energy markets are no longer \ngoverned just by the economic dictums of supply and demand when it \ncomes to oil prices. That is what I want to talk about. It is simply \nthis: The speculators are back. We saw the speculators in oil futures \ncontracts. We saw their handiwork 2 years ago when the price of oil hit \nan all-time high of $147 a barrel. This time the speculators are \nseizing on the turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa to use that \nas an excuse to drive this price of oil sky high. Yet recent upheavals \nabroad have had little, if any, effect on the actual supply of oil.\n  Again, coming back to the economic theories of supply and demand, \nLibya, for example, controls only 2 percent of the world's oil supply. \nWell, there is a key piece of evidence that points the finger at these \n``condo flippers'' in the commodities market. Data from the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, the CFTC, reveals that since January, when \nthe protests began in Egypt, speculators have increased their\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\nbetting on future oil price increases by more than 38 percent.\n  Meanwhile, legitimate hedgers for oil futures contracts, legitimate \nhedgers such as airlines and shipping companies and oil companies have \nactually reduced their holdings in oil futures contracts.\n  All you need to do to see what is happening is as represented on this \nchart. You see closely how the rise of oil prices, the red line, tracks \nthe increases in speculative activity, the white line. A long position \nin a futures contract means you are betting that the price of oil will \ngo up and, therefore, you buy a contract to buy oil at a determined \namount in the future. That is what this chart is about.\n  As you go over here, on January 25 of this year, the day the protests \nbegan in Egypt, the speculative money was on long held positions in \njust over 217,000 West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures contracts. \nWest Texas Intermediate crude is the standard by which they judge. When \nthe protests began in Egypt, they were down at 217,000 futures \ncontracts. That is the equivalent of about 217 million barrels of oil. \nOn March 8, the last day for which we have the data, these same \nspeculators held the equivalent of more than 301 million barrels of \ncrude, which was an increase of 38 percent, from 217,000 to 301 \nmillion.\n  Look how closely the price of oil tracks those swings. This is the \nspeculative buying or betting in futures contracts, the white line. \nLook how closely the price of oil follows the red line.\n  During the same period, from January 25 to March 8, the price of oil \nclimbed from $85 a barrel all the way up to $105 a barrel. That is an \nincrease of nearly 24 percent. Guess who is the loser in this game of \nprofit gouging. It is the American consumer. Our gasoline prices mean \nless money for anything the American consumer has to buy. And, at the \nend of the day, guess who else is the big loser. It is the American \neconomy.\n  These speculative bubbles in oil prices are becoming more and more \ncommon. We saw it in the summer of 2008 when oil spiked up to an \nunbelievable $147 per barrel, only to plummet almost 80 percent a few \nmonths later. You cannot say that going from $147 a barrel all of a \nsudden down to $30 a barrel back in 2008 had anything to do with supply \nand demand. There had to be another influencing factor.\n  Because of this, last year when we passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act, Congress empowered the CFTC to rein \nin excessive speculation to keep the commodities markets from flying \noff the rails. Just look. It is in the last 2 months. Yet, the \nCommission, the CFTC, has yet to finalize new rules to govern the \nspeculative position limits.\n  Meantime, what happens is speculators continue to buy $100 worth of \noil futures with $6 down, 6 percent down to buy oil contracts for \nfutures. I believe the law we passed last year has given the CFTC an \nextremely effective tool at its disposal that it could use to \ndiscourage excessive energy speculation and bring down gas prices our \nAmerican consumers are now finding hurting their pocketbooks so much. \nThat authority is the authority to impose higher margin requirements on \noil futures contracts. So instead of $6, they could require that there \nbe more than 6 percent they would have to pay down on buying a futures \noil contract.\n  In the current system some ordinary investors have to put down as \nmuch as 50 percent in order to buy things, while financial speculators \nhave to post only 6 percent to buy a futures contract in oil. That does \nnot seem to me to be fair and is leading to this kind of system which \nis now causing pain at the pump.\n  These kinds of margin requirements are not set by Federal regulators \nbut, rather, by the exchanges themselves. For the same reason we do not \nlet pharmaceutical companies approve of their own drugs, we should not \nlet futures exchanges self-regulate by setting their own margin \nrequirements. Fortunately, in a section of the Dodd-Frank bill, section \n736, Congress removed the broad statutory restriction that prohibited \nthe CFTC from setting those margin requirements. That section \nauthorizes the CFTC to call for higher margin requirements in order to \nprotect the financial integrity so this kind of event does not happen.\n  I am calling on the CFTC now to exercise the authority the Congress, \nsigned into law by the President, gave them last July. I am asking them \nto get going.\n  There is a letter that has been circulated here among the Senators \nencouraging the CFTC to use the Commission's power to increase margin \nrequirements on these oil speculators. I want to urge my colleagues who \nare listening to join in this letter as it is circulated among your \noffices. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, these new margin requirements would \ntake effect as soon as July. But the CFTC must begin the rulemaking \nprocess now, because if we do not, and get into the summer driving \nseason, you know what is going to happen here. This is March. It is \ngoing to keep going up and up.\n  I want to be clear, that where those who have a legitimate reason, \nsuch as airlines, shipping companies, oil companies, to buy future \ncontracts, that margin level would not apply. It will only apply to the \nspeculators. Imposing a higher margin level on speculators is \nconsistent with existing exchange practices. For example, the New York \nMercantile Exchange, the major trading platform on oil futures, imposes \ndifferent margin rates on speculators as compared to bona fide hedgers. \nAnybody who has been at the gas pump recently knows this is a real \nissue, and they are asking us to do something about it.\n\n  Then we hear in return it is supply and demand. I am trying to prick \nthat balloon, bust that bubble. Congress and the administration need to \nbe out front doing everything we can to ensure that the price of oil \nreflects the real supply and demand, not the irrational speculative \nfervor. With the right policies, we can discourage the damage excessive \nspeculation is doing.\n  I ask two things of my colleagues. I ask that they all take a look at \nthe letter being circulated to Commissioner Gensler, Chairman of the \nCFTC. Don't fall for the notion that more drilling is going to put an \nend to the spiral. I am all for drilling in all those acres out there \nthat are already leased. I am all for it, if it is done safely. But \nguess what we are hearing. We are starting to hear: Drill, baby, drill.\n  Facts are stubborn. Even if there was expanded drilling in the United \nStates, it is not going to affect the price of gas in the short term or \neven over the next half a dozen years. That is largely because the \nUnited States holds 2 to 3 percent of the world's supply, which is not \nenough to affect prices globally. Further, the oil and gas companies \nhave 30 million acres that are leased but not drilled offshore and \nanother 30 million acres onshore and they are not even drilling yet. \nSimply put, attempts to link the recent increases in the price of oil \nto the need for increased drilling are off the mark. Frankly, we \nhaven't changed the way we do business with oil companies. \nUnfortunately, it has been a little less than 1 year since the \nDeepwater Horizon oil rig exploded. We know what damage that did to the \nfisheries, the tourism, the economy of the entire gulf region. A lot of \noil is still there. American citizens continue to fight to get their \nlost claims paid. We are not going to know for years to come what the \nlong-term impacts will be, but certainly the economic damage is rising \nand rising.\n  Even worse, if another spill happened today, the responsible party \nwould still have only a liability cap of $75 million. We have to \naddress that.\n  In the meantime, we have to confront high gas prices. We need a \nmultipronged approach that includes getting the CFTC to do its job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/14/senate-section/article/S1595-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1595-S1596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CLUSTER MUNITIONS CIVILIAN PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on March 10, my friend from California, \nSenator Feinstein, and I introduced S. 558, the Cluster Munitions \nCivilian Protection Act of 2011. It is identical to the bill she and I \nintroduced last year and similar to those in prior years.\n  Cluster munitions, like any weapon, have some military utility. But \nanyone who has seen the indiscriminate devastation cluster munitions \ncause over a wide area understands the unacceptable threat they pose to \ncivilians. These are not the laser-guided weapons the Pentagon showed \ndestroying their targets during the invasion of Baghdad.\n  There is the horrific problem of cluster munitions that fail to \nexplode as\n\n[[Page S1596]]\n\ndesigned and remain as active duds, like landmines, until they are \ntriggered by whoever comes into contact with them. Often it is an \nunsuspecting child or a farmer. In Laos today, people are still being \nkilled and maimed by millions of U.S. cluster munitions left from the \nVietnam war. That legacy, resulting from years of secret bombing of a \npeaceful, agrarian people who posed no threat to the United States, \ncontaminated more than a third of Laos' agricultural land and cost \ncountless innocent lives. It is shameful that we have contributed less \nmoney in the past 35 years to clean up these deadly remnants of war \nthan we spent in a few days of bombing.\n  Current law prohibits U.S. sales, exports, and transfers of cluster \nmunitions that have a failure rate exceeding 1 percent. The law also \nrequires any sale, export, or transfer agreement to include a \nrequirement that the cluster munitions will be used only against \nmilitary targets.\n  The Pentagon continues to insist that the United States should retain \nthe ability to use millions of cluster munitions in its arsenal which \nhave estimated failure rates of 5 to 20 percent. It has pledged to meet \nthe 1 percent failure rate for U.S. use of cluster munitions in 2018. \nBut, like Senator Feinstein, I do not believe we can justify using \nantiquated weapons that so often fail, so often kill and injure \ncivilians, and which many of our allies have renounced. That is not the \nkind of leadership the world needs and expects from the United States.\n  Senator Feinstein's and my bill would apply the 1-percent failure \nrate to U.S. use of cluster munitions beginning on the date of \nenactment. However, the bill permits the President to waive the 1-\npercent requirement if he certifies that it is vital to protect the \nsecurity of the United States. I urge the Pentagon to work with us by \nsupporting this reasonable step.\n  Since December 3, 2008, when the Convention on Cluster Munitions \nopened for signature in Dublin, 108 countries have signed the treaty, \nincluding Great Britain, Germany, Canada, Norway, Australia, and other \nallies of the United States. However, the Bush administration did not \nparticipate in the negotiations that culminated in the treaty, and the \nObama administration has not signed it.\n  Some have dismissed the Cluster Munitions Convention as a pointless \nexercise since it does not yet have the support of the United States \nand other major powers such as Russia, China, Pakistan, India, and \nIsrael. These are some of the same critics of the Ottawa treaty banning \nantipersonnel landmines, which the United States and the other \ncountries I named have also refused to sign. But that treaty has \ndramatically reduced the number of landmines produced, used, sold, and \nstockpiled, and the number of mine victims has fallen sharply. Any \ngovernment that contemplates using landmines today does so knowing that \nit will be condemned by the international community. I suspect it is \nonly a matter of time before the same is true for cluster munitions.\n  It is important to note that the United States today has the \ntechnological ability to produce cluster munitions that meet the \nrequirements of our bill, as well as the treaty. What is lacking is the \npolitical will to expend the necessary resources. There is no excuse \nfor continuing to use cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to \ncivilians.\n  I urge the Obama Administration to review its policy on cluster \nmunitions and put the United States on a path to join the treaty as \nsoon as possible. In the meantime, our legislation would be an \nimportant step in the right direction.\n  I again commend Senator Feinstein, who has shown such passion and \npersistence in raising this issue and seeking every opportunity to \nprotect civilians from these indiscriminate weapons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/14/senate-section/article/S1596-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1596-S1597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL METRO SAFETY ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, on Thursday I reintroduced the National \nMetro Safety Act with Senators Cardin, Murray, Warner and Webb. I first \nintroduced this bill on July 23, 2009, after the deadly crash on the \nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's Metro system that \nkilled 9 people and injured more than 50.\n  This legislation does three things. First, it gives the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation Secretary the authority to establish and \nenforce national safety standards for metro systems across America. \nSecond, it requires the U.S. Department of Transportation to work with \nthe National Transportation Safety Board to develop these standards. \nThird, it requires the U.S. Department of Transportation to implement \nNTSB's most wanted safety standards. These include: crashworthiness, \ndata event recorder, emergency entry and evacuation standards for rail \ncars; and hour of service regulations for train operators.\n  On Monday June, 22, 2009, the unthinkable happened right here in our \nNation's Capital. A Metro train struck another train during evening \nrush hour. Eight passengers were killed including one Marylander from \nHyattsville and one Metro employee. Over 50 passengers were injured by \nthe crash. It was the worst accident in Metro's history.\n  Approximately, 1 year later, the NTSB released its report from its \ninvestigation of the crash. This was the saddest report with grim \nrevelations. It found that the Metro crash could have been prevented \nand nine lives could have been saved. The NTSB's investigation found \ntwo probable causes: a faulty track circuit and the lack of a track \ncircuit verification test. This test would have identified the \nmalfunctioning circuit and could have prevented the crash.\n  The NTSB also found attributing causes to the crash. These included a \nlack of a safety culture at Metro; failure to monitor the train control \nsystem and replace its oldest railcars; lack of a maintenance plan from \nthe circuit manufacturer; Metro Board and the Tri-State Oversight \nCommittee's ineffective safety oversight; and the Federal Transit \nAdministration's lack of authority to provide safety oversight.\n  In its report, the NTSB also made 23 recommendations to prevent \nfuture fatal crashes. Among these was the recommendation to the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation to seek the authority to provide safety \noversight to transit systems and to establish and enforce national \nsafety standards. The NTSB did its job and now it is time for Congress \nto do ours. We must pass this bill to give the U.S. Department of \nTransportation the authority it needs to establish Federal safety \nstandards.\n  We have Federal safety standards for airplanes, commuter rail, and \nbuses, but none for metro systems. Rail transit is the only \ntransportation mode without Federal safety standards, oversight and \nenforcement even though it has over 14 million daily riders. This is \nmore than U.S. airlines with 2 million domestic flights daily or \npassenger railroads like Amtrak and MARC each with 74,430 and 30,000 \ndaily riders respectfully. Up until now, safety has been left up to the \nstates. Each State has its own safety and enforcement practices. States \nhave oversight agencies with very little staff, small budgets and \nvarying amount of expertise. These oversight agencies also aren't \nalways independent of the transit systems they oversee.\n  I know the Obama administration has its bill to establish standards \nand the Banking Committee has its bill. I support both of these but let \nme tell you why I am crazy about my bill. It requires the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation Secretary to implement the NTSB's most \nwanted. These are the recommendations the NTSB has consistently called \nfor.\n  Congress must do two things. First, it must meet its Federal funding \nobligation for Metro. We must provide $150 million for Metro in the \nyear-long continuing resolution. I want to thank Senator Murray for \nincluding these vital funds in the Senate's bill. This is really $300 \nmillion for Metro with the local matching funds.\n  Metro needs this money to implement the NTSB's recommendations and \nprevent future crashes. This money is essential to Metro's reform. It \nis American's subway. This isn't a local pork barrel. America needs it \nto go to work. Metro serves not only our civilian population, but also \nthe many people working at the Pentagon every day that need to be at \ntheir duty station and their battle station. We need Metro to be safe \nand operational reliable.\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\n  Second, Congress must pass this legislation. We owe it to the people \nthat ride Metro and we owe it to the people that work at Metro. We can \nnever forget the people that died that fateful day. I urge the Senate \nto pass safety legislation so no community ever has to suffer the loss \nthat the National Capital Region did during the summer of 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/14/senate-section/article/S1597-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO VICKIE BEAVER\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, my state of Oregon is blessed with a \ntremendous number of generous and philanthropic individuals. But I \nwould like to take a moment today to single out one of them and \nrecognize her years of dedication to helping others.\n  Vickie Beaver of Lebanon, OR, has been elected president of the \nInternational Association of Rebekah Assemblies by her fellow members. \nThe town of Lebanon and the State of Oregon have benefited greatly from \nVickie's civic and philanthropic work. Now, in her position as \npresident, she can do the same for people all across the U.S. I am \nhonored to know of such an exemplary leader in the State I proudly \nserve.\n  This is nothing new for our State. Vickie is the fifth Oregonian to \nserve as national president of the Rebekahs, and the second Lebanon, \nOR, native.\n  The Rebekahs, along with their partners the Independent Order of Odd \nFellows, are a 192-year-old service organization with more than 10,000 \nlodges spanning over 25 countries around the world. The aim of the \nRebekahs and Odd Fellows is the simple but awe-inspiring goal of making \nthe world a better place to live. It is a daunting goal that both \norganizations take very seriously. Members are involved in a variety of \ndifferent relief projects, including the Educational Foundation which \nprovides scholarships and loans for students aspiring to go to college, \nthe SOS Children's Village which is an orphanage project in Cambodia \nand the Living Legacy project which plants trees and enhances the \nenvironment of neighborhoods. The organization's philosophy is that \nfriendship, love and truth, can create peace and harmony in the world.\n  Vickie has been active in the Rebekahs for more than 30 years, \ncontinuing a family legacy of service that goes back four generations. \nWithin Rebekahs, Vickie is known for her commitment to the community \nand hard work in support of the Rebekah initiatives. It is this \ndedication that led to her election to various leadership positions in \nthe organization over the years, and, finally, as president. During her \ntenure as the guiding spirit of the Educational Foundation, she worked \nclosely with the Lebanon School District as well as with nationally \nrecognized organizations such as the Boys and Girls Club. Through its \ngrants, the foundation provides deserving young men and women the \nopportunity to attend college, something they otherwise would not be \nable to do because of financial limitations. Since its creation in 1927 \nwith the goal of educating future generations, the foundation has \nprovided loans and grants to over 3,500 college-bound students. The \nRebekahs believe that education is the foundation of a more enlightened \ncommunity, and has made it their mission to offer that gift to \ndeserving young men and women around the country.\n  Vickie's genuine concern for the well being of the young adults in \nher community certainly strengthened the Educational Foundation's \noutreach to the students. I am sure Vickie will bring the same \ndedication to her new position as president of the Rebekah Assemblies.\n  I would like to once again congratulate Ms. Vickie Beaver, an \ninspiring leader from the town of Lebanon in my State of Oregon. \nVickie's work clearly embodies the Rebekah Assemblies' and Odd Fellows \nefforts to make the community a better place for America's youth to \nlive, grow and prosper. I know that she will take her new role in the \nRebekah Assemblies very seriously, and I have no doubt in my mind that \nshe will do an exceptional job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/14/senate-section/article/S1597-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1597-S1598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FWS FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, like many Arkansans, I am very concerned \nabout the administration's proposal to cut $6,288,000 from the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service, FWS, National Fish Hatchery Operations, \nwhere the production of fish is for the purpose of mitigating the \neffects of Federal water development projects. Under this proposal, \nseveral National Fish Hatcheries, including the Greers Ferry and \nNorfork National Fish Hatcheries in Arkansas, are scheduled to lose \ntheir FWS funding. The reliability of alternative mechanisms to provide \nFederal funding for the operation of FWS mitigation hatcheries is \ncurrently uncertain.\n  I am working with the Arkansas delegation and the administration to \npreserve the ongoing responsibility of FWS to fund and operate the \nNational Fish Hatcheries at Norfork and Greers Ferry Dams, and to make \nsure we ``allow the investment in these hatcheries to continue to \ncontribute to the economic vitality'' of Arkansas communities and our \ncountry.\n  Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent to have the Arkansas House \nResolution No. 1014 of 2011, which was adopted in its entirety on \nFebruary 24, 2011, by the Arkansas House of Representatives, printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       House Resolution No. 1014\n\n       Whereas, the United States Fish & Wildlife Service plans to \n     cut the budgets for the trout hatcheries below Norfork and \n     Greers Ferry dams; and\n       Whereas, these fish hatcheries provide the foundation for \n     Arkansas's world-renowned trout fishery waters that produce a \n     total economic impact of well over one hundred fifty million \n     dollars ($150,000,000) annually but only 9 cost taxpayers \n     approximately one million five hundred thousand dollars \n     ($1,500,000) annually to operate. The hatcheries at Norfork \n     and Greers Ferry dams alone generate five million five \n     hundred thousand dollars ($5,500,000) in federal tax \n     revenues, roughly three dollars and sixty-five cents ($3.65) \n     for every one dollar ($1.00) invested; and\n       Whereas, seventy-five (75) years ago, north Arkansas's \n     White River was arguably the best smallmouth bass stream in \n     America. Fisherman came from all over the country to \n     experience once-in-a-lifetime float trips down the beautiful \n     bluff-lined river; and\n       Whereas, upon a series of dams being built in the White \n     River basin in the 1940s, the federal government assured the \n     state's citizens that mitigation efforts would be included to \n     offset the loss of the river's incredibly productive native \n     fishery. The key component of this commitment was the \n     construction of Norfork National Fish Hatchery in 1955 near \n     Norfork Dam and the establishment of world-class trout waters \n     below both Norfork and Bull Shoals lakes; and\n       Whereas, a decade later, the trout hatchery at the base of \n     Greers Ferry Dam provided the means for a similarly \n     successful fishery to be established at the Little Red River \n     in Greers Ferry; and\n       Whereas, these modest projects rank among the all-time \n     success stories of our federal government because of the \n     overall economic impact and return on investment they \n     produce; and\n       Whereas, fish production at the Norfork hatchery employs \n     nine hundred ninety-four (994) individuals, and the Greers \n     Ferry hatchery employs an additional seven hundred fifty-two \n     (752) people; and\n       Whereas, dozens of resorts employing hundreds of \n     individuals have been established in these world-class \n     fishing areas because of the increase in tourism. The town of \n     Cotter, Arkansas, for example, bills itself as ``Trout \n     Capital USA''; and\n       Whereas, trout fishing in the White River basin is worth \n     about three times the annual flood losses prevented by \n     Beaver, Table Rock, Bull Shoals, Norfork, Greers Ferry, and \n     Clearwater reservoirs, and these structures averted fifty-one \n     million four hundred thousand dollars ($51,400,000) in \n     damages in the last fiscal year; and\n       Whereas, the electricity generated from Bull Shoals Lake \n     and Norfork Lake averages approximately one hundred million \n     dollars ($100,000,000) of electricity each year, but the \n     trout fishery is worth an additional fifty percent (50%) more \n     than that on an annual basis; and\n       Whereas, investment in the Norfork and Greers Ferry Fish \n     hatcheries has consistently demonstrated positive returns for \n     more than half a century. The federal government's goal to \n     reduce the federal deficit and increase economic growth would \n     be damaged, not enhanced, if funding for trout programs is \n     reduced or eliminated to the detriment of its promise to \n     Arkansas and to these small towns whose livelihood depends on \n     the fish hatcheries: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-\n     Eighth General Assembly of the State of Arkansas, That the \n     President and Congress of the United States work together to \n     continue the immediate and future funding of the national \n     fish hatcheries at Norfork and Greers Ferry dams and allow \n     the investment in these hatcheries to continue to contribute \n     to the economic vitality of these towns, the State of \n     Arkansas, and the entire country; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives forward official copies of this resolution to \n     the President\n\n[[Page S1598]]\n\n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President of the Senate of the United \n     States Congress, and to all the members of the Arkansas \n     Congressional Delegation with the request that this \n     resolution be officially entered in the Congressional Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/14/senate-section/article/S1598-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO GENERAL GEORGE W. CASEY, JR.\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my Army \nCaucus cochair, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Jim Inhofe, I \nrise today to recognize one of our country's finest soldiers. GEN \nGeorge W. Casey, Jr., the 36th Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, is \nretiring after over 40 years of distinguished service to our Nation. \nGeneral Casey has led soldiers at every level from platoon to division \nand all the way to chief, continuing the tradition of service begun by \nhis father, MG George W. Casey, Sr., Commander, 1st Cavalry Division, \nkilled in a helicopter crash on July 7, 1970, while visiting his troops \nduring his assignment in Vietnam.\n  Later in 1970, General Casey earned his commission as a second \nlieutenant through Georgetown University's Reserve Officer Training \nCorps and began his service to our Nation as an infantry officer. While \nserving in Germany, he excelled as a platoon leader and was selected to \nattend Ranger School and Infantry Officer Advanced Course, Fort \nBenning, GA, in 1974. Over the next 12 years, General Casey was \nassigned to units within the 4th Infantry Division, Mechanized, Fort \nCarson, CO. These postings culminated in his promotion to lieutenant \ncolonel, serving as Commander, 1st Battalion, 10th Infantry in 1985.\n  In 1991, then-Colonel Casey continued his career with the 1st Calvary \nDivision, Fort Hood, TX. His success led to an Army fellowship and \ncongressional liaison assignments in the Washington, DC area. Colonel \nCasey then returned to Europe as the Chief of Staff, V Corps, United \nStates Army Europe. When forces were ordered into Bosnia in support of \nOperation Joint Endeavor, Colonel Casey deployed to Taszar, Hungary, as \npart of USAREUR Forward. Later, leading the 1st Armored Division as \nAssistant Division Commander for Maneuver, he oversaw the peaceful \nresettlement of Bosnian villages throughout the Multi-National \nDivision-North MND(N) area of operations. He also oversaw the security \nof the first free elections on September 14, 1996, as mandated by the \nDayton Peace Accord.\n  Over the next 10 years General Casey would make historic and lasting \nimpacts as a leader at the highest levels of the Army. From 2001 until \n2003, as the Director, Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5) to the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Casey was a key figure in the \ncrisis action planning to prosecute the global war on terror. In this \nposition, General Casey was responsible for advising National, Defense, \nJoint and Army senior leadership about strategic issues and joint \ncapabilities, requirements and resources. Later, his participation in \nDepartment of Defense and interagency affairs helped shape concepts \nthat defined the future conduct of joint training and operations. The \nresults of his efforts are visible today in the ongoing transformation \nof the American military into a more lethal, flexible, and responsive \nJoint force.\n  In 2003, as Director of the Joint Staff, General Casey's \nuncompromising support of our nation's deployed forces contributed to \nsuccessful operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Horn of Africa, the \nPhilippines, and elsewhere around the world. During this period of \nchanging global conditions and evolving challenges to the security of \nthe United States, General Casey led the Joint Staff with unparalleled \nprofessional leadership and expertise. His participation in the \nnational security decisionmaking process directly enhanced the security \nand welfare of the Nation.\n  As the 30th Vice Chief of Staff of the Army from 2003 until 2004, \nGeneral Casey employed his outstanding leadership and management skills \nto assist the Chief of Staff in supporting the Nation's war on terror \nand put the Army on course for one of the most profound transformations \nin their history. Recognizing the soldier as the centerpiece of the \nArmy as well as the need to sustain the all-volunteer force that was \nstressed and strained by conflict, General Casey aggressively worked to \ncare for soldiers and their families, ensuring the forces' success \nthroughout the world. His legacy as the Vice Chief of Staff is an Army \npostured to meet the challenges of the 21st century as a result of his \nsuperior ability to lead in a period of war and profound transition.\n  As the Commanding General of Multi-National Force-Iraq from 2004 \nuntil 2007 during Operation Iraqi Freedom, General Casey's leadership \nof a 32-nation coalition, in coordination with its Iraqi partners, \ndeveloped and implemented the actions that eliminated numerous \nterrorist safe havens. This began the rollback of insurgent gains \nthroughout the country, setting the conditions for Iraq's first free \nnational elections after 30 years of tyranny. Later, through the \nimplementation of a vigorous counterinsurgency and counterterrorism \ncampaign, he established a level of stability and security which \nallowed infrastructure reconstruction activities in Iraq to quadruple.\n  Following his service in Iraq, General Casey was selected to serve as \nthe 36th Chief of Staff of the Army in 2007. He synchronized the \ncontinuous generation and deployment of combat power to meet \nrequirements of two ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and multiple \noperations around the world. A strategic leader for our Army, and our \nNation, he has personally led the transformation of the Army to meet \nthe security challenges of the 21st century and restore balance to the \nforce to set the conditions for continued success in the second decade \nof this era of persistent conflict. These innovative changes enabled \nArmy forces to execute wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as \nsuccessfully implement multiple humanitarian missions around the globe.\n  When history looks back at the decades of service by the 36th Chief \nof Staff of the Army, it will be clear that he embodied the highest \nideals of the American military professional. Our Nation owes General \nCasey, his wife Sheila, and their family its sincere appreciation for \nhis truly extraordinary dedication to duty and service to the United \nStates throughout his distinguished career in the U.S. Army. I wish \nhim, his wife Sheila, their two sons Sean and Ryan and their families \ncontinued success and happiness in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/14/senate-section/article/S1598-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1598-S1599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAJOR OF THE ARMY KENNETH O. PRESTON\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my cochair \nof the Army Caucus, the junior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Daniel Akaka, I \ncongratulate Sergeant Major of the Army Kenneth O. Preston for his \nextraordinary dedication to duty and service to the United States as \nthe 13th Sergeant Major of the Army. Sergeant Major of the Army Preston \nis retiring after 36 distinguished years of service.\n  Sergeant Major Preston is a native of Mount Savage, MD. He entered \nthe Army as a cavalry scout in June 1975, and has served in every \nenlisted leadership position, including cavalry scout, platoon \nsergeant, and tank commander. He served as Command Sergeant Major of \nthe 1st Armored Division, V Corps in Germany and the Combined Joint \nTask Force 7 in Baghdad, Iraq, during Operation Iraqi Freedom, where he \nwas an instrumental leader during the invasion of Iraq.\n  In 1975, Sergeant Major Preston was a member of the 1st Cavalry \nDivision, as they were transforming from an Air Cavalry Division to a \nHeavy Division. He spent his first years in the military as a scout, \nexcelling on every vehicle from motorcycles to dune buggies, surpassing \nhis peers and distinguishing himself as a superior leader. Two years \nlater, Sergeant Major Preston was promoted to sergeant and moved to the \n33rd Armor Regiment, 3rd Armor Division in Germany. His commanders \nagain recognized his superior leadership skills and selected him first \nas a senior gunner and then as the commander of the battalion \ncommanders tank. Throughout his command, his tank was consistently \nnamed top tank in the battalion.\n  Sergeant Major Preston took the knowledge and expertise he gained in\n\n[[Page S1599]]\n\nGermany to Fort Knox where he became a master gunner instructor. He \nexcelled once again and was hand-picked for an exchange tour with the \nBritish Army as a tank instructor in Dorset, England. Sergeant Major of \nthe Army Preston has served in every senior enlisted position in the \nArmy, from platoon sergeant to command sergeant major. He held command \nsergeant major positions at 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st \nCavalry Division; then at 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, at 1st \nArmored Division, and finally at V Corps in Germany. Before becoming \nSergeant Major of the Army, he was the command sergeant major for \nCombined Joint Task Force 7 serving in Baghdad, Iraq, during Operation \nIraqi Freedom. His leadership and operational expertise were \ninstrumental in planning and executing the attack on the forces of \nSaddam Hussein.\n  One of the most enduring contributions Sergeant Major Preston has \nmade to our Nation was implementing the largest transformation of the \nArmy's noncommissioned officer education system since the system was \nfirst developed. As the backbone of the Army, noncommissioned officers \nhave specific education requirements throughout their career. The \nAdvance and Senior Level Courses now are more in line with what our \nleaders need in Afghanistan and Iraq. With the roll out of Structured \nSelf-Development, an online module system that will ensure our \nnoncommissioned officers receive the best training, noncommissioned \nofficers are better educated, which pays huge dividends on the \nbattlefield. Also, with new distributed learning, the Army's first-line \nleaders are able to spend more time at home with their families while \ntaking classes online.\n  Over the last 7 years, Sergeant Major of the Army Preston served as \nthe Sergeant Major of the Army, the highest enlisted position \nattainable in the Army. He assumed this position during the first year \nof Operation Iraqi Freedom and proved  himself a tremendous wartime \nleader, demonstrating unselfish devotion to our Nation and the \nsoldiers. He worked tirelessly to restore balance to a force stretched \nand stressed by the demands of the longest war our Nation has ever \nknown. His personal observations and advice helped guide Army \nleadership during the implementation of the most comprehensive \ntransformation of the Army since World War II. The end result was \nbuilding of the most versatile Army in the history of our Nation. Its \nmodular units and improved capabilities enabled the Army to execute its \nstrategy of full-spectrum operations. Sergeant Major of the Army \nPreston was instrumental in ensuring that this plan adhered to \nprinciples of commonsense and care for soldiers and their families. He \nworked with Army leadership to increase support to families by \nimplementing the Army Family Covenant and the Army Community Covenant. \nThese programs increased support for Army families by expanding and \nimproving services while raising awareness about the unique challenges \nmilitary families face. Sergeant Major of the Army Preston testified \nnumerous times before Congress on behalf of the 1.1 million soldiers \nand millions of family members under his care. His clear and passionate \ntestimony resulted in increased compensation, improved housing, \nimproved health services and an overall better quality of life.\n\n  The impact of Sergeant Major of the Army Preston's efforts will be \nfelt and seen in our Army for decades to come. His untiring devotion to \nduty, his love for the Army and its soldiers and families, and his \nprofessionalism has left a legacy of trained and educated soldiers. \nWhen history looks back at the Army's 13th Sergeant Major of the Army, \nit will be clear that his personal leadership contributed to the \nbuilding of the most professional Non-Commissioned Officer Corps the \nworld has ever known. We wish him and his wife Karen continued success \nand happiness in all of their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/14/senate-section/article/S1599-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/14/senate-section/article/S1599-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/14/senate-section/article/S1599-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 830.

A bill to establish an employment-based immigrant visa for \nalien entrepreneurs who have received significant capital from \ninvestors to establish a business in the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to support the StartUp Visa Act of \n2011, as the leading Republican cosponsor, because I believe this \nlegislation will increase the possibility that companies such as \nGoogle, Intel, Yahoo and Proctor & Gamble--which were all started \ncompletely or in part by immigrant entrepreneurs--will continue to be \nfounded in America. This legislation will help immigrant entrepreneurs \nlike Paroon Chadha, Purdue University alumnus and cofounder of a \ncompany that currently employs more than two dozen American-born \nHoosiers and continues to grow--as demonstrated by plans to hire four \nadditional staff members in April 2011. Paroon and I believe America \nremains the best country in the world to do business and that we should \ncontinue attracting immigrant entrepreneurs to help drive innovation \nand job creation here at home.\n  At a time when our country struggles to achieve full economic \nrecovery, foreign-born entrepreneurs who wish to establish companies \nand create jobs in the United States, often with the financial backing \nof American investors, are instead operating from other countries \nbecause they find the process of immigrating to the U.S. too difficult. \nThe logic of our current approach places America at a competitive \ndisadvantage in the global race to attract the very best talent and is \ncounterproductive to our national interest.\n  According to a 2009 survey of American entrepreneurs conducted by the \nKauffman Foundation, an overwhelming majority of the participants felt \nthat ``the United States cannot have a sustained economic recovery \nwithout another burst of entrepreneurial activity.'' Over the past 15 \nyears, immigrant entrepreneurs have started 25 percent of venture-\nbacked public companies and 40 percent of companies in the high \ntechnology sector. A 2007 report commissioned by the National Venture \nCapital Association noted that the market capitalization of publically \ntraded venture-backed companies founded by immigrant entrepreneurs \nexceeded $500 billion.\n  The StartUp visa represents a commonsense solution to this problem \nand does not require the creation of new visas. The bill proposes to \ndraw from existing visas under the EB-5 category, which is a set-aside \nof visas for immigrants who invest at least $1 million in the U.S., and \nthereby create 10 jobs, to obtain a green card. In areas where \nunemployment is high, foreign nationals need only invest $500,000 to \nobtain residency. Many more visas are annually allocated for the EB-5 \ncategory than are used, so the addition of immigrant entrepreneurs will \nnot require additional visas.\n  Better utilizing existing visas, immigrant entrepreneurs living \noutside the United States would be eligible to apply for a StartUp visa \nif a qualified American investor agrees to financially sponsor their \nentrepreneurial venture with a minimum investment of $100,000. After 2 \nyears, their business must have created five new jobs and raised not \nless than $500,000 in additional capital investment or generate not \nless than $500,000 in revenue.\n  Additionally, immigrant entrepreneurs currently residing in the \nUnited States on an unexpired H-1B visa or immigrant entrepreneurs \ncurrently in the country who have completed a graduate level degree in \nscience, technology, engineering, math, computer science, or other \nrelevant academic discipline from an accredited United States \ninstitution of higher education would be eligible for a StartUp visa. \nEligibility in each of these cases is contingent upon the immigrant \nentrepreneur demonstrating that they will be self-sufficient and that a \nqualified U.S. investor will financially back their entrepreneurial \nventure with a minimum investment of $20,000. After 2 years, their \nbusiness must have created three new jobs and raised not less than \n$100,000 in additional capital investment or generate not less than \n$100,000 in revenue.\n  Finally, immigrant entrepreneurs living outside the U.S. who have \ncontrolling interest of a company based in a foreign country that has \ngenerated, during the most recent 12-month period, not less than \n$100,000 in revenue from sales in the U.S. would be eligible to apply \nfor a StartUp visa. At the conclusion of 2 years, this immigrant \nentrepreneur must have created three new jobs in the U.S. and raised \nnot less than $100,000 in additional capital investment or generate not \nless than $100,000 in revenue.\n  Immigrant entrepreneurs want to come to America, hire Americans, and \ncreate jobs right here for Americans--and we should be helping them \ncome. Senator Kerry and I believe that it is in our national interest \nto encourage those who can help drive the next generation of innovation \nto do it here, not someplace else. This plan has the support of \ninvestors, immigrants, technology organizations, and taxpayers. I ask \nfor your support on passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 566. A bill to provide for the establishment of the National \nVolcano Early Warning and Monitoring System; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a bill and \ntalk about an issue that has, unfortunately, become a regular \noccurrence in Alaska and holds great interest to the Nation and the \nworld. I am talking about volcano monitoring. While erupting volcanoes \nare a early constant part of our lives in Alaska, it usually takes a \nworldwide event such the eruption last year of a volcano in Iceland, \nwhich disrupted air traffic in Europe and around the world, to capture \nthe public's attention.\n  Two years ago it was the eruption of Mount Redoubt, which cancelled \nhundreds of flights in Alaska that motivated me to introduce the \nNational Volcano Early Warning and Monitoring System Act. I reintroduce \nthe bill now because it is still vitally important to the United \nStates.\n  The volcanoes in Alaska make up well over three-quarters of U.S. \nvolcanoes that have erupted in the last two hundred years. About 50 \nvolcanic eruptions occur around the world every year, according to the \nUnited States Geological Survey, USGS. The United States ranks third, \nbehind Indonesia and Japan, in its number of historically active \nvolcanoes.\n  That is why it is so important to fund volcano monitoring, which in \nAlaska is through the Alaska Volcano Observatory. The Alaska Volcano \nObservatory, AVO, is one of five Volcano observatories in the United \nStates. It is a joint program of the United States Geological Survey, \nthe Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and \nthe State of Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. AVO \nis unique in the United States and probably the world, in that it is a \nthoroughly collaborative undertaking of federal scientists, state \nscientists, and university faculty and students.\n  AVO was formed in 1988, after an eruption of Mount Augustine, and \nuses federal, state, and university resources to monitor and study \nAlaska's hazardous volcanoes, to predict and record\n\n[[Page S1603]]\n\neruptive activity, and to mitigate volcanic hazards to life and \nproperty. Alaska has over 30 active volcanoes currently being monitored \nby the Alaska Volcano Observatory. No other observatory in the world \ncomes even close to that number. AVO also analyzes available satellite \ndata twice daily for thermal anomalies and ash plumes at about 80 \nvolcanoes in the north Pacific. Russian volcanoes frequently put ash \ninto areas where the U.S. has aviation safety responsibilities. \nAlaska's active volcanoes also offer superb opportunities for basic \nscientific investigations of volcanic processes. An important component \nof AVO's program is to conduct research at selected volcanic centers.\n  Alaska's volcanoes are potentially hazardous to passenger and freight \naircraft as jet engines sometimes fail after ingesting volcanic ash. On \nDecember 15, 1989, a Boeing 747 flying 240 kilometers, 150 miles, \nnortheast of Anchorage encountered an ash cloud erupted from Redoubt \nVolcano and lost power in all four jet engines. The plane, with 231 \npassengers aboard, lost more than 10,000 feet of elevation before the \nflight crew was able to restart the engines. After landing, it was \ndetermined the airplane had suffered about $80 million in damage. The \nU.S. Geological Survey said about 100 encounters of aircraft with \nvolcanic ash were documented from 1983 to 2000. In some cases engines \nshut down briefly after sucking in volcanic debris, but there have been \nno fatal incidents.\n  The FAA estimates, based on information provided by the Federal \nAviation Administration, that more than 80,000 large aircraft per year, \nand 30,000 people per day, are in the skies over and potentially \ndownwind of many of Alaska's volcanoes, mostly on the heavily traveled \ngreat-circle routes between Europe, North America, and Asia. Along this \nroute, which coincidently follows the northern portion of the Pacific \n``ring of fire'', are over 100 volcanoes capable of depositing ash into \nthe flight path. Some are in Japan, many are in Russia, but about half \nare in Alaska. By analyzing satellite imagery and working with the \nNational Weather Service to predict where winds will carry the ash, AVO \nassists the Federal Aviation Administration in warning aircraft of \nareas to avoid.\n  Volcanic eruptions from Cook Inlet volcanoes, Spurr, Redoubt, \nIliamna, and Augustine, can have severe impacts, as these volcanoes are \nnearest to Anchorage, Alaska's largest population center. The last \nmajor series of eruptions of Mt. Redoubt occurred in the spring of \n2009. The Alaska Volcano Observatory had recorded 26 volcanic eruptions \nand/or explosions at Redoubt volcano.\n  There were several impacts from this series of eruptions from Mount \nRedoubt. Two major lahars, mudflows, moved down the Drift River and \npartially inundated an oil terminal. Airborne ash clouds posed a hazard \nto aviation and caused multiple flight cancellations and reroutes. \nAlaska Airlines cancelled approximately 200 flights. FedEx, United \nParcel Service and several other cargo airlines rerouted aircraft to \nSeattle. Ash fall forced Ted Stevens International Airport, the third \nbusiest cargo airport in the world, to close for 20 consecutive hours. \nDisruption to the aviation industry was significant for passenger \ntravel and cargo transportation between Asia and North America. Minor \nash fall impacted several communities as far downwind as Delta \nJunction, Alaska, 400 miles northeast of Anchorage. Elmendorf Air Force \nBase assets were temporarily relocated. There were also impacts to oil \nfield operations due to the cessation of oil storage at Chevron's Drift \nRiver Oil Terminal. The economic impact is estimated to be less than or \nequal to the Redoubt eruptions also disrupted air traffic in the \nregion. Hundreds of commercial flights were cancelled and cargo \ncompanies were significantly impacted. This resulted in employees being \nplaced on unpaid leave during periods when airport operations were shut \ndown.\n  International volcano monitoring is also a role of the Federal \nGovernment. It likely saved many lives--and significant money--in the \ncase of the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, where \nthe United States had military bases at the time. The cataclysmic \neruption lasted more than 10 hours and sent a cloud of ash as high as \n22 miles into the air that grew to more than 300 miles across. The \nUnited States Geological Survey spent less than $1.5 million monitoring \nthe volcano and was able to warn of the impending eruption, which \nallowed authorities to evacuate residents, as well as aircraft and \nother equipment from U.S. bases there. The USGS estimates that the \nefforts saved thousands of lives and prevented property losses of at \nleast $250 million.\n  It is not enough to justify a program by just identifying a danger. \nThe more important question is whether something can be done to reduce \nthe impact of a volcanic eruption in terms of property damage and loss \nof life. That means getting people out of harm's way by providing \nadvance warning. And this is exactly what the USGS Volcano Hazards \nProgram seeks to do through the existing volcano observatories in the \nUnited States.\n  The advances made in monitoring can now provide much more accurate \nand timely predictions of eruptions. As an example, in 1989, AVO was \nonly able to provide a few days warning before Mount Redoubt erupted. \nThis year, they began to detect activity and notified the public two \nmonths before it eventually erupted.\n  The biggest challenge remains finding an adequate and stable source \nof funding. The USGS Volcano Hazards Program has been constantly \nunderfunded. Both USGS and the FAA provide funding, but it is not \nenough to manage all the observatories or provide for an expansion of \nthe system to cover increased monitoring and volcano research.\n  It is because of the inadequate funding, and critical importance of \nthis program, that I intend to introduce a bill that will provide the \nfunding stability that volcano monitoring needs. This program shows \nthat with a modest investment, a very large benefit can be produced in \nreducing the impacts of catastrophic events.\n  My legislation will establish a National Volcano Early Warning and \nMonitoring System within the United States Geological Survey to monitor \nwarn and protect citizens from undue and avoidable harm from volcanic \nactivity. The USGS will coordinate a management plan with the other \nrelevant federal departments, including the Department of \nTransportation, Federal Aviation Administration; the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Homeland Security and \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n  The legislation authorizes appropriations of $15 million annually to \nthe Department of Interior to carry out the Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 567. A bill to amend the small, rural school achievement program \nand the rural and low-income school program under part B of title VI of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, \nSenator Collins, as we introduce the REAP Reauthorization Act of 2011. \nNearly one-third of America's public schools are in rural places, and \n23 percent of our students attend these schools. Unfortunately, the \nunique nature of rural schools creates significant challenges as they \nwork to meet federal education requirements.\n  Geographic isolation, diseconomies of scale, and poverty are some the \nchallenges commonly cited as major barriers to education delivery in \nrural places. Unfortunately, Federal education funding programs--which \nare often based on population--do not provide adequate resources for \nrural schools to overcome these obstacles and meet programmatic \nrequirements. Additionally, rural school districts often forgo federal \neducation dollars because they lack the capacity to apply for \ncompetitive grants.\n  Senator Collins and I began working together a decade ago to ensure \nequity for rural schools. With bipartisan support, we successfully \nfought to include the original Rural Education Achievement Program--\notherwise known as REAP--in the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  To date, REAP is the only source of federal funding dedicated to \nhelping\n\n[[Page S1604]]\n\nrural school districts overcome financial inequality caused by \ngeographic isolation and poverty. REAP dollars make a critical \ndifference in rural States like North Dakota, where schools with \ngraduating classes of five try to enact the same education reforms and \nprovide ash same opportunities as those provided by schools with \ngraduating classes of 500. Since its creation, REAP has provided rural \nschools with flexibility and over $1.5 billion to carry out Federal \neducation programs.\n  With the pending reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, we are reintroducing our REAP Reauthorization Act in the \n112th Congress. The REAP Reauthorization Act makes improvements to the \nRural Education Achievement Program that will more closely target \nFederal resources to geographically isolated and high-poverty rural \ndistricts.\n  The program-wide changes made in this bill will provide many \ndistricts with access to necessary resources by allowing eligible \ndistricts that do not receive funds under the Small Rural Schools \nProgram to participate in the Rural Low Income Schools Program. Our \nbill also incorporates new locale codes to make the program consistent \nwith those developed by the National Center for Education Statistics.\n  Additionally, the bill makes program-specific improvements to the \nSmall, Rural School Achievement Program to increase minimum and maximum \ngrant allocations when REAP is funded at $200 million or above. Lastly, \nour REAP Reauthorization proposal incorporates a more accurate \nmeasurement of poverty to determine eligibility for the Rural and Low-\nIncome Schools Program. With these changes, more school districts and \nstudents in rural America will benefit from REAP resources.\n  I am pleased that Senator Collins is joining me again this year as an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to pass this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 567\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a program \ndesigned to address the unique needs of rural schools. The Rural \nEducation Achievement Program, or REAP, is designed to help level the \nplaying field for small and high-poverty rural school systems. It is \nthe only dedicated Federal funding stream to aid rural school districts \nin overcoming the increased expenses caused by geographic isolation.\n  Nearly one-third of America's public schools are in rural places, and \nmore than 21 percent of our public school students attend these \nschools. Students in rural America should have the same access to \nFederal dollars and a good education as those students who attend \nschool in urban and suburban communities. For this reason, I worked \nwith Senator Kent Conrad in 2001 to author the law creating the REAP \nprogram. REAP created two grant programs including the Small and Rural \nSchools Achievement Program, SRSA, which provides additional funding \nand flexibility to small rural school districts, and the Rural and Low-\nIncome School Program, RLIS, which provides additional funding for poor \nrural school districts.\n  Prior to enactment of this law, rural school districts received funds \ncalculated on school enrollment. In many of these districts, Federal \nformula programs, which are based on population, do not produce enough \nresources to carry out the purposes the grant is intended to fund. One \nschool district in Maine, for example, received only $28 in 2001 to \nfund a districtwide safe and drug-free school program.\n  In addition, small and rural school districts often forgo Federal \neducation dollars because they lack the personnel and the resources to \napply for competitive grants. Having fewer personnel also creates \nadditional challenges in providing professional development \nopportunities. Small rural districts are often located long distances \nfrom other districts, towns, and universities, drastically reducing \nopportunities to partner or collaborate. By allowing rural school \ndistricts to combine funds, as well as providing additional funds, REAP \ngives these districts the levels of resources required to undertake \nsignificant reform. Funds from this program have already helped to \nsupport new technology in classrooms, distance learning opportunities, \nand professional development activities, as well as a vast array of \nother programs which will help rural districts make progress towards \nthe goals of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  In 2007 and 2009, along with Senator Conrad, I cosponsored \nlegislation to reauthorize this important program. Unfortunately, no \naction has been taken. The REAP Reauthorization Act of 2011 would \nreauthorize and enact a few focused changes to the law. These changes \nwill allow Federal funds to be even more closely targeted to \ngeographically isolated districts. One important change will allow \nprogram eligible districts to participate in the Rural and Low-Income \nSchool Program if they would not receive financial benefits from the \nSmall and Rural Schools Achievement Program.\n  Education is an essential driver for economic development. This rings \ntrue especially in rural America, where schools are the linchpin of \nrural communities. I am encouraged to see that the Maine School \nManagement Association has spoken in support of the REAP \nReauthorization Act of 2011. As cochair of the Senate Rural Education \nCaucus, I will continue to work towards our goal of advancing the \neducational interests of rural schools and districts.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the Maine School Management Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Maine School\n\n\n                                       Management Association,\n\n                                    Augusta, Maine, March 1, 2011.\n     Re Reauthorization of REAP.\n\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The Maine School Boards Association \n     and the Maine School Superintendents Association want to \n     thank you for your continued sponsorship of the REAP Program. \n     Specifically, our Associations are pleased to support the \n     2011 Reauthorization of REAP. Throughout the years, REAP \n     funding has helped to provide equity for many small schools \n     in Maine and our expectation is that will continue with this \n     Reauthorization.\n       Both, the National School Boards Association and the \n     American Association of School Administrators also are \n     supportive of the Reauthorization of REAP.\n       The Maine School Boards Association and the Maine School \n     Superintendents Association appreciate your continued support \n     for public education. We want to commend you for your \n     willingness to pay attention to various legislative issues \n     that may impact Maine public schools. We also want to praise \n     your staff for their expertise and accessibility to our \n     organizations. As always, our Associations are available as a \n     resource to you and to your staff.\n       Thank you again.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Terry McCabe,\n                                     Associate Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Graham, \n        Mr. Reid, Mr. Lee, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Lieberman, and \n        Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 569. A bill to provide for fairness for the Federal judiciary; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Federal \nJudicial Fairness Act of 2011.\n  I want to thank Senator Hatch, as well as Senators Leahy, Graham, \nReid, Lee, Inouye, Bingaman, Lieberman, and Kerry, for working with me \nas cosponsors of this important bill.\n  The Federal Judicial Fairness Act is a straightforward bill that \nwould ensure that Federal judges receive cost-of-living adjustments to \ntheir salaries on the same terms as other Federal civilian employees.\n  Let me be clear from the outset: This bill would not provide a \njudicial pay raise. In fact, it would not even guarantee a cost-of-\nliving adjustment for this year, the next year, or the next. Instead, \nit would simply guarantee that in years in which other Federal civilian \nemployees receive cost-of-living adjustments to their salaries to \naccount for inflation, Federal judges will as well.\n\n[[Page S1606]]\n\n  Under current law, two procedural requirements prevent this from \nhappening.\n  First, the ``linking'' of judicial and Congressional salaries means \nthat judges cannot receive a cost-of-living adjustment unless Congress \nfirst votes to provide an adjustment for its own Members.\n  Second, due to a 1981 provision known as ``Section 140,'' even if \nCongress votes to adjust its own Members' salaries, Congress must pass \na second, special provision stating that judges should receive this \nadjustment as well.\n  The Federal Judicial Fairness Act's would amend this pay structure \nand provide that Federal judges should receive adjustments on the same \nterm as other Federal civilian employees.\n  Why is this important?\n  Article III of the United States Constitution requires that Federal \njudges shall ``receive for their services, a compensation, which shall \nnot be diminished during their continuance in office.''\n  This is a constitutional guarantee, entitled to due respect. Serious \nconcerns arise when, as is the current system, political pressures \nresult in the real value of judicial salaries diminishing and declining \nover time. Justice Kennedy expressed it this way in his 2007 testimony \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Please accept my respectful submission that, to keep good \n     faith with our basic charter, you have the unilateral \n     constitutional obligation to act when another branch of \n     government needs your assistance for the proper performance \n     of its duties. It is both necessary and proper, furthermore, \n     that we as judges should, and indeed must, advise you if we \n     find that a threat to the judiciary as an institution has \n     become so serious and debilitating that urgent relief is \n     necessary. In my view, the present Congressional compensation \n     policy for judicial officers is one of these matters.\n\n  Additionally, as members of the Senate, I believe we have a \nresponsibility to make every effort to recruit and retain the very best \nfor the Federal bench. Both recruitment and retention become far more \ndifficult when we cannot assure candidates that the salary provided at \nthe beginning of a life appointment will hold its value over time. This \nassurance is basic for other Federal employees and should be for our \nFederal judges as well.\n  The Federal Judicial Fairness Act is a commonsense, good government \nbill. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 569\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Judicial Fairness \n     Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. JUDICIAL COST-OF-LIVING INCREASES.\n\n       (a) Repeal of Statutory Requirement Relating to Judicial \n     Salaries.--Section 140 of the resolution entitled ``A Joint \n     Resolution making further continuing appropriations for the \n     fiscal year 1982, and for other purposes.'', approved \n     December 15, 1981 (Public Law 97-92; 95 Stat. 1200; 28 U.S.C. \n     461 note), is repealed.\n       (b) Automatic Salary Adjustments.--Section 461(a) of title \n     28, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Effective at the beginning of the first applicable \n     pay period commencing on or after the first day of the month \n     in which an adjustment takes effect under sections 5303 and \n     5304 of title 5 in the rates of pay under the General \n     Schedule, each salary rate which is subject to adjustment \n     under this section shall be adjusted by an amount, rounded to \n     the nearest multiple of $100 (or, if midway between multiples \n     of $100, to the next higher multiple of $100) equal to the \n     percentage of such salary rate which corresponds to the \n     overall average percentage of the adjustment in the rates of \n     pay under the General Schedule.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Franken, and Mr. Begich):\n  S. 571. A bill to amend subtitle B of title VII of the McKinney-Vento \nHomeless Assistance Act to provide education for homeless children and \nyouths, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about legislation that I \nhave introduced that is essential to the academic success of millions \nof vulnerable children and youth.\n  The Educational Success for Children and Youth Without Homes Act \nresponds to the growing crisis of homelessness in our nation. The \nlegislation will help homeless children and youth thrive in school, \ndespite the constant moves, trauma, and loss associated with \nhomelessness.\n  The recession has contributed to homelessness among two groups of \nstudents: children who are homeless with their families, and youth who \nare homeless on their own. This reality was brought starkly to light in \na recent CBS 60 Minutes special about homeless children. The series \ndocumented several Florida families that have fallen on hard times, yet \nare doing their best to make ends meet and keep their children in \nschool. It was heartbreaking to see these families who are struggling. \nHowever, it increased my resolve and determination to introduce this \nlegislation, which will provide much-needed support for kids across the \ncountry.\n  The numbers of homeless children are shocking. During the 2008-2009 \nacademic year, there were almost 1 million homeless children enrolled \nin public schools across the nation. That was a 41 percent increase \nover the previous two years. Unfortunately, this alarming trend shows \nno sign of abating. Many states are reporting increases between 5 and \n35 percent for the 2009-2010 school year. We owe it to these children \nto provide them with a safe place where they can learn and become \nsuccessful adults.\n  We know that school offers homeless children and youth structure, \nnormalcy, support, and hope--it is a place where they can obtain the \nskills that they will need to avoid poverty and homelessness as adults. \nYet these students face great educational challenges. High mobility, \nprecarious living conditions, and severe poverty combine to create \nmajor barriers to school enrollment and regular attendance. Many \nhomeless children and youth lack basic supplies and a reasonable \nenvironment where they can do homework. As a result of their \ncircumstances, homeless students often perform below their peers in \nmath and reading and are more likely to be held back.\n  We must do more to assist these students so they do not continue to \nbe left behind. The Educational Success for Children and Youth Without \nHomes Act of 2011 would do just that. The bill amends the McKinney-\nVento Act's Education for Homeless Children and Youth program. It makes \na strong law even stronger by reinforcing and expanding the law's key \nprovisions: school stability, enrollment, and support for academic \nachievement.\n  My legislation will enhance the right of homeless children to stay in \nthe same school, so that children who have lost their homes do not also \nlose their schools. It will assist schools in meeting the challenges of \ntransporting homeless students by increasing the authorized funding \nlevel and allowing other federal funds for educating low-income \nstudents to be used for homeless transportation. When staying in the \nsame school is not possible, or not in a child's best interest, the \nlegislation will help the student make a seamless transition to a new \nschool.\n  One of the most successful features of the McKinney-Vento program is \nthe requirement for every school district to designate a liaison for \nhomeless children and youth. Liaisons identify homeless students, \nensure their enrollment and attendance, and connect them to community \nresources. Liaisons are the backbone of this program, the unsung heroes \nwho have become a lifeline for children and youth in crisis. Yet most \nliaisons do not have the capacity to carry out their required duties; \nthey wear many hats and struggle to meet the growing demands of this \npopulation. As a result, too many homeless children and youth are \nfalling through the cracks and missing out on school. The Educational \nSuccess for Children and Youth Without Homes Act will strengthen the \ncritical position of homeless liaison by ensuring that liaisons have \nthe time, resources, and training to fulfill their mandated duties.\n  The Educational Success for Children and Youth Without Homes Act also \nrecognizes the unique needs of certain groups of homeless children: \npreschool-aged homeless children, and unaccompanied homeless youth.\n  Young children who are homeless have higher rates of developmental\n\n[[Page S1607]]\n\ndelays and other problems that set them back as they start out life, \nyet they face numerous barriers to participating in early childhood \nprograms. They miss out on services that can mitigate the harmful \neffect of homelessness on their development. This legislation will \nincrease homeless children's participation in preschool programs by \nrequiring public preschool programs to identify and prioritize homeless \nchildren for enrollment, and to develop the capacity to serve all \nidentified homeless children.\n  Unaccompanied homeless youth struggle to go to school without the \nbasic necessities of life or a parent to guide them. We must assist \nunaccompanied homeless youth to overcome the unique educational \nchallenges related to being without a home and without a parent or \nguardian. This legislation will help ensure that unaccompanied homeless \nyouth have the supports necessary to stay in school, graduate with \ntheir peers, and move on to a brighter future.\n  The history of litigation under the McKinney-Vento Act makes clear \nthat we must do a better job helping educators learn about homelessness \nand support them in implementing the law. To this end, the legislation \nprovides funding for technical assistance and training, and requires \nparticipation in professional development activities.\n  As we work on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, we must recognize that children who do not know where \nthey will sleep at night, or where their next meal will come from, face \nfar greater challenges than simply remembering to do their homework. We \nmust acknowledge that children who bounce between schools with each \nchange of residence have little hope of taking advantage of even the \nbest school programs. The most qualified teacher, or the most \nexceptional math or reading program, will not benefit children who are \nnot enrolled in school, not attending regularly, and not assisted to \novercome the barriers caused by homelessness. The Educational Success \nfor Children and Youth Without Homes Act builds upon the proven \nsuccesses of the McKinney-Vento Act's Education of Homeless Children \nand Youth program, while addressing remaining challenges. It is \ncritical legislation that will help ensure that the homeless children \nof today do not become the homeless adults of tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/14/senate-section/article/S1607-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 101--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE RELATING TO \n          THE MARCH 11, 2011, EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN\n\n  Mr. REID of Nevada (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lugar, \nMr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \nBegich, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Blunt, Mr. \nBoozman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. \nBurr, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, \nMr. Coats, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Coons, \nMr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, \nMr. Enzi, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Graham, Mr. \nGrassley, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Hoeven, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johanns, Mr. \nJohnson of Wisconsin, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Kirk, Ms. \nKlobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, \nMr. Lee, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Manchin, Mr. McCain, Mrs. \nMcCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Moran, Ms. \nMurkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \nMr. Paul, Mr. Portman, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed of Rhode Island, Mr. Risch, \nMr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nSessions, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Shelby, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \nTester, Mr. Thune, Mr. Toomey, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Udall of New \nMexico, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Warner, Mr. Webb, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Wicker, \nand Mr. Wyden) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.
