Mr. President, although the House of Representatives has \nnot yet voted on Speaker Boehner's plan, that plan is flawed. That is \nwhy they have struggled for days to pass this inadequate legislation \nwithout a single Democrat even being involved in the process. They have \nplowed forward looking only to Republicans.\n  But as the battle to pass the continuing resolution went forward to \nkeep our government open for business just a few months ago, the \nRepublican leadership realized they were unable to get the necessary \nvotes for the CR and they reached out to Democrats. Speaker Boehner had \nto look to Democrats; he did not have enough votes. Obviously he should \nhave looked to the Democrats again.\n  That is the way we need to move forward on something that is \nbipartisan. That is how it is supposed to work, Democrats and \nRepublicans working together for our country. The bandaid approach to \nthe world crisis--and it is an embarrassment--to Congress, frankly to \nthe country and to the world--is a sad commentary.\n  United Senate Democrats, all 53 of us, have informed the Speaker that \nhis legislation was doomed in the Senate because we would not vote for \na short-term extension of the debt ceiling. It would put our great \nNation on a path to another default extravaganza as we have experienced \nin the last few weeks.\n  Frankly, that new extravaganza would start in a matter of weeks \nagain. Virtually every expert--economist, rating agency, market \nanalyst--has said the kind of short-term plan the Speaker has proposed \nis no answer to the crisis. Republicans created the crisis, and what \nthey want to do is no answer to it.\n  If we are really trying to avert the kind of financial calamity \ndefault would bring, the Republicans' plan is not a solution. I had a \nvery sobering conversation a half hour ago with Secretary Geithner. \nRight now, businesses cannot borrow--big businesses, what they use to \nsurvive, moving money for bonds and other things; that is how the world \neconomy works--they cannot\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\nborrow more money than overnight because no one knows what the interest \nrate will be tomorrow. So the Republican plan is not a solution. As the \nexperts say, all too soon we would be back in the midst of partisan \nwrangling with our economy once again held prisoner by extremists in \nthe Republican party lead by the tea party.\n  Our economy cannot bear this kind of uncertainty any longer. Congress \nand the White House are on lockdown, and the business of the country is \nnot being conducted. I say no, not again, will we fight another battle \nsuch as the one in which we are now engaged. We cannot do that. That is \nwhy a short-term extension is not what we need. It is not what this \nCongress will do.\n  But default is not an option either. We cannot wait for the House any \nlonger. It is time for Republicans to stop the political games and \nembrace compromise. No matter how long Republicans delay, the deadline \nwill not move. We have hours--I repeat hours--to act. That is why by \nthe end of today I must take action on the Senate's compromise \nlegislation.\n  The legislation in point would cut $2.5 trillion from our deficit \nover the next decade and avert default on our national debt. It would \nprotect Social Security and Medicare without raising a penny of \nrevenue. The question is: Will today's Republicans break away from the \nshrill voice of the tea party and return to the Republican Party of \nRonald Reagan?\n  This is likely our last chance to save this Nation from a default. I \nhave invited Senator McConnell to sit down with me and to negotiate in \ngood faith, knowing that the clock is running down. I hope he will \naccept my offer. I cannot do this alone. There are only 53 of us, and \nunder the rules that Republicans put in place--it used to be used \nsparingly but is used all of the time now--we will need to get 60 \nvotes; a majority is not good enough.\n  I know the Senate compromise bill the Democrats have offered is not \nperfect in the eyes of the Republicans. It is not certainly perfect in \nthe eyes of the Democrats. But together we must make it work for all of \nus, because it is the only option. The settlement on the table will \nnever give either party everything it wants, but it already meets the \nRepublicans' demands. John McCain, the Republican senior Senator from \nArizona, President Obama's opponent in the Presidential election, has \nasked his party to compromise. He did it here on the Senate floor.\n\n  He said, it ``is not fair for the American people to hold out and say \nwe won't agree to raising the debt limit.'' He called the radical \nRepublican approach ``unfair'' and ``bizarro.'' It is time we listen to \nthe markets, he said. It is time we listen to the American people and \nsit down and seriously negotiate.\n  Former Senator Fred Thompson, whom I served with here in this body, a \nRepublican, asked Members of his own party to come to their senses. ``I \nrespectfully suggest that you rake in your chips and stuff them in your \npockets.'' That was his quote. He believes they have already won--all \ndiscretionary spending, no revenue.\n  I hope my friend, Senator McConnell, will come to me by the end of \nthe day and indicate what constructive ideas he has to move the process \nalong. My door is open. I will listen to any ideas to get this done in \na way that prevents a default and a dangerous downgrade to our \ncountry's credit rating.\n  Time is short. That is an understatement. Too much is at stake to \nwaste even one more minute. The last train is leaving the station. This \nis our last chance to avert a default. The vote on this compromise will \ndetermine whether we enter the frightening world of default. A vote for \nthe Senate compromise will be a vote on the financial obligations of \nthis great Nation to pay the bills.\n  I would ask my friends, my Republican friends, break away from this \nthing going on in the House of Representatives. They were going to vote \nat 4:30 yesterday, 6:30, 7:30, 8:30, 9:30--10:30 they finally quit. \nRumors flying around. Rumors flying around. The Wall Street Journal \nsaid they put too much money in for Pell grants. They were going to \ntake that out. Rumors flying around they need a balanced budget \namendment added. Rumors that the Speaker was seen in my office--which \nhe did not come. All these rumors made no sense.\n  The scariest thing is, late last night, Leader Cantor said from the \nHouse: You have three choices: Boehner, cut, cap and balance, or \ndefault. That is the second ranking Member in the Republican leadership \nwho said that.\n  We need to honor the financial obligations we have with the country. \nSo a vote against the compromise I have talked about--now listen to \nwhat my compromise is: No revenue. The Congressional Budget Office has \nscored it more than $2.4 trillion, which will take us to probably--not \nprobably, it will take us to March of 2013. We can do the country's \nbusiness. There is a joint committee that will be set up to see if we \ncan do some good work on a more long-term approach and to get back to \nwork doing our country's business.\n  I repeat: CBO and OMB have scored our bill for more than $2.4 \ntrillion--not billion, trillion dollars. That is dollar for dollar, as \nthe Speaker said he wants to reduce the debt. So a vote against this \ncompromise will be a vote to default on the full faith and credit of \nthe United States.\n  I repeat to everyone within the sound of my voice: We have the \nframework of a bill. We are going to change it. I have some ideas that \nwe need to change. I want to discuss them with the Republican leader. \nIf anyone has any other ideas, come to me. But the time has come to \nmake a decision. The time factors are very clear. Why am I filing \ntonight on my bill? Why? There is no more time. I have to do it \ntonight. Would I like to wait until tomorrow to see if there is some \ngood will that comes from the Republican side? Of course I would. But I \nwould suggest to my friends on the other side of the aisle, this is a \npretty good deal. They, in effect, as Fred Thompson said, have gotten \neverything they want and should put those chips in their pockets and \nwalk away and declare victory.\n  There will be no time left to vote on another bill or consider \nanother option in the Senate. This is our last, best chance to preserve \nthe character and credit of our great Nation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague, the majority leader, yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank our leader.\n  Mr. President, the leader outlined it well. The House, for all its \nmachinations, delays, and struggles, is pursuing a path to nowhere \nbecause their bill will not pass, will not become law. Fifty-three of \nthe fifty-three Democrats have signed a letter saying they will not \nvote for it, and the President has said he will veto it--all for a \nsimple reason: because if we do this short term, we don't calm the \nmarkets and, at the same time, we start all over in a few weeks going \nthrough this again.\n  As the leader said--and it is true--the bill he will put on the floor \nis our only chance, and the reason it is our last chance is very \nsimple: After tonight, anything put on the floor--is this true, Mr. \nLeader, that after tonight, if we were to put anything on the floor, \ngiven the rules of the Senate, nothing could be voted on before default \nwould occur?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New York, under the rules we have \nin the Senate, if I move tonight, we cannot have the final vote until \nTuesday morning. The country defaults at 12 o'clock on Tuesday on its \ndebt.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the leader continue to yield?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That means this bill the leader will put on the floor \ntonight is the last train out of the station, and it also means, given \nthe rules of the Senate, that only with bipartisan cooperation can we \ndo it.\n  So we are hoping and praying that our colleagues from the other side \nof the aisle, led by their leader--and 15 signed a letter talking about \na bipartisan compromise as part of the Gang of 6, or Gang of 8--that \nthat group could come forward and make suggestions, not simply say the \nBoehner bill because that will not pass, but make suggestions on \nmodifications to the Reid plan. That is our only hope of avoiding \ndefault, and we must act now. Is that a correct depiction of the status \non the floor and of where we are headed?\n  Mr. REID. That is absolutely true.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will ask one more question. If we are \nunable\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\nto come to a compromise on the leader's bill, there is virtually no \ntime, no matter what the House does, for the Senate to do anything \nbefore default is over. That means our Republican colleagues have the \nball in their hands in terms of default; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been told personally by some \nRepublicans in the Senate they will do everything they can to stop \nlegislation from proceeding. That is not a majority; it is a handful of \npeople on the Republican side of the aisle.\n  That is why I said in my remarks that I hope the Republican Party \nwill turn back to the party of Ronald Reagan. He raised the debt \nceiling 19 times during the time he was President. He was a man who \ncompromised. That was who he was. He hated communism. Who was the man \nwho brought down the Iron Curtain? Ronald Reagan. He was willing to \ncompromise even with somebody he spoke of in the worst terms. He knew \nhow to compromise, and even though he was elected as the most anti-\nCommunist President in the history of the country, the day he was \nelected he sent his embassy personnel to the Soviet Union so they could \nwork with them. That led to the great decision by our countries to \nbring down the Iron Curtain.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I see that the minority leader is here, and I thank the \nmajority leader for yielding.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the minority leader doesn't mind, I \nwould like to ask the majority leader a question.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. During the period of time we were waiting yesterday for a \ndecision by the House of Representatives, which they still didn't come \nto--during that period of time, we had an opportunity to have many \npersonal conversations among Senators--Democrats and Republicans--and I \nwould say that unanimously, to a person, Democratic and Republican \nSenators agreed that a default would be an economic disaster for the \nUnited States of America.\n  The majority leader has been briefed this morning by the Treasury \nSecretary about some of the prospects of default. We have heard only \none that I know of--a Republican Senator--come to the floor and say \nthat a default on our debt could be managed very easily.\n  I want to ask, since I have heard from business leaders in Illinois \nof closings that were literally canceled this week for multimillion-\ndollar investments in the city of Chicago in the State of Illinois \nbecause of what is happening in the House of Representatives, can the \nmajority leader please tell us, as much as he can at this moment, what \nthe prospects are if we do reach the point of default on this national \ndebt?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am familiar with the situation in Illinois \nwhere a $146 million construction project was turned down at the last \nminute because they were so afraid of the credit.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have one further question. In terms of the impact on \nour Nation, as the Secretary of the Treasury has told the leader, can \nhe give us, for the record, an idea of what we face if the Republicans \nin the House continue to delay and hold to a strategy that has no hope \nof passage?\n  Mr. REID. Secretary Geithner said it has already started. The \ninternational community is extremely worried they could only get \novernight loans. It is extremely precarious for our country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is not surprising that I have a \nlittle different take on what has been happening in the last few days \nthan my colleague, the majority leader.\n  Let me explain what has been going on in Congress this week. The \nAmerican people have been waiting on us to do something to prevent \ndefault. They want us to end this crisis right now. Over in the House \nof Representatives, we have the Speaker of the House doing his job. \nSpeaker Boehner has been doing the hard work of governing, working day \nand night to put together a bill that can actually pass the House of \nRepresentatives and end this crisis now. He should be commended for his \nefforts.\n  What about over here in the Senate? The contrast could not be \nstarker. Rather than working in the last few days toward a solution to \nthe crisis the way the Republican majority in the House has, the \nDemocratic majority in the Senate has been wasting precious time \nrounding up ``no'' votes to keep this crisis alive. Rather than being \nresponsible and doing their duty and coming up with a bill that can \nactually pass, they have been busy signing up people for the ``not good \nenough'' caucus and ginning up opposition to everything else.\n  Lawmakers should be working a solution to the crisis, not a blocking \nstrategy. Our Democratic friends in the Senate have offered no \nsolutions to this crisis that could pass either Chamber--not one. \nInstead, all day long yesterday we got chest-thumping comments about \nhow they are going to kill any piece of legislation that comes over \nfrom the House, that it is dead on arrival.\n  Democrats are out bragging about how they are going to prolong the \ncrisis instead of doing the hard work of trying to solve it. That \nincludes the President.\n  Look, if the President hadn't decided to blow up the bipartisan \nsolution that Members of Congress worked so hard to produce last \nweekend, we would be voting to end this crisis today.\n  Instead, Democrats in Congress are still talking about blocking a \nsolution to the crisis, and the President is rolling out new mileage \nstandards today. Let me repeat that. Here we are a few days from when \nthe Secretary of the Treasury says we will be in a default situation, \nand the President of the United States is rolling out new mileage \nstandards today.\n  How about this: How about a plan from Democrats in Washington that \ncan pass both Chambers, prevent the crisis, and protect Americans from \na worsening economy?\n  I suggest to my friends on the other side this morning that they \nstart taking their responsibilities as a majority party a little more \nseriously because at this point, the only people who are disregarding \nthe consequences of default are Senate Democrats--not the Republicans \nin the House but Senate Democrats.\n  Republicans have been doing the hard work of governing this week. It \nis about time our Democratic friends join us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend's statement. I didn't \nhear it all, but I certainly heard the context of the statement. We are \nwilling to work with him and his staff, as we have, to try to come up \nwith a solution. I want the record to reflect very clearly, as I said \nin my remarks this morning, for my friends who didn't have the \nopportunity to hear it, we cannot have in this country a 6-month \nextension because a 6-month extension is no extension. A 6-month \nextension of what we are dealing with would put us back, in a matter of \nweeks, in the same fiscal extravaganza trying to move forward with the \nwork of the country.\n  The country is locked down. Congress is inoperable. The White House \nis unable to do very much because they are focused on this huge \nproblem. I want the record to be spread with the fact that I will work \nas closely as I can on any suggestions they have, as I have indicated. \nBut, please, everyone, don't come to me with a 6-month extension.\n  The proposal I am moving forward with--and Fred Thompson said take \nyour chips, my Republican friends, and put them in your pocket and walk \naway--gives the Republicans everything they have asked for: no \nrevenues, $2.4 trillion in cuts. That is a pretty\n\n[[Page S5030]]\n\ngood deal. That is not a 6-month deal; it is a solution that takes us \nuntil 2013, in the month of March.\n  Help me work through this. I have no pride of authorship. If somebody \ncan figure out another way to improve that suggestion, I will work with \nthem. I am willing to work with them. As I have said on the floor \nbefore--and I don't want anybody to consider this as a sign of \nweakness--I have compromised my whole life. When I practiced law, that \nis what I did in trying to represent people and get a result. I \nbelieved many times that I was a failure when I had to go to court. But \nI went to court over 100 times to try cases to juries.\n  I always believed that compromise was the right thing to do, even in \nthe law. As a legislator, it is a sign of integrity and confidence when \nyou say you will compromise. Legislation is the art of compromise.\n  Again, I am here indicating to the world that I have spent my whole \nadult life trying to compromise and build consensus.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for up to 5 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID.

As one Senator, I thank the majority leader and the \nRepublican leader for their comments. We all know what we need to do. \nWe have two objectives. At a time when we are borrowing 40 cents of \nevery dollar we spend, we need to reduce the debt. We also need to \nhonor our obligations, and we know why.

We don't want the most creditworthy Nation in the world to \ngo to a place where it begins to pay its bills selectively out of a \ncigar box, which is why I am hopeful--and I believe all of us are \nhopeful--that we can find a way for the two leaders to recommend to us \nand the House a solution that the President will sign, which will \nreduce our debt and honor our obligations.\n  But to suggest that the majority leader's proposal--his bill--which \nhe offers in good faith, I know that--is a compromise, that is a little \nhard to accept. It is a Democratic proposal. The other side has spent \nmost of its time this week saying: We can get 53 of us to make sure \nthat as soon as the Republican proposal passes the House, if it does, \nwe will beat it in an hour. We will not even consider it. We will kill \nit. We are not going to vote on it. We will table it and put it away.\n  That is not the spirit of compromise. The proposal the Speaker is \ntrying to pass may be about the only thing he can pass in the House of \nRepresentatives. That may not be what a Democratic Senate would like, \nbut this is a Democratic Senate and that is a Republican House. We have \nto come up with something that both can pass and the President will \nsign. We all know that.\n  I hope the spirit of today, tomorrow, and Sunday is that we spend \nless time plotting about how we can defeat each other's proposals as \nquickly as possible and more time working together to come up with ways \nto reduce spending and honor our obligations.\n  The Democratic whip is on the Senate floor. I have probably \nundermined his support in some groups for complimenting him for his \ncourage. I support the same thing he does. For example, the work of the \nGang of 6 is supported by one-third of the Senate, a very good example \nfor the rest of us in the Senate about what can be accomplished when we \nwork together.\n  I hope we will recognize the Speaker is trying as hard as the \nmajority leader to come up with something that can pass the House. The \nmajority leader wants something that can pass the Senate, but it must \npass both and be signed by the President. We must reduce our spending \nand we must honor our obligations, and every single Republican Senator \nas well as every Democrat knows that, I think.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5030-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this is a historic weekend in Washington, \nand I think those who are visiting the Capitol and following the \nproceedings understand the gravity of the decisions that lie before us.\n  On August 2, our debt ceiling expires. That has never happened in our \nhistory. One time there was a technical period of 1 or 2 days, but \nthere has never been a long period of time when the United States of \nAmerica basically defaulted on its debt. And it is a very serious \nmatter. It is one that affects our Nation, our debt, and literally \nevery family and business that lives within our boundaries.\n  Here is the reason why it is so important. In 1939, we created this \nlaw which said that a President could come to Congress periodically and \nask for the authority to borrow money to pay for the things Congress \nhas already appropriated. So, as an example, when Members of the House \nand Senate say to the President of the United States: We want you to \ncontinue to wage war in Afghanistan, at the cost of $10 billion a \nmonth, this President knows he will have to borrow about $4 billion a \nmonth to meet that congressional appropriation. You see, we borrow \nabout 40 cents for every dollar we spend.\n  Similarly, when it comes to the payments we make to our veterans who \nare disabled, we have promised them: We will pay you because you served \nour country and you lost a limb or you were injured, and we will \ncompensate you for that loss for the rest of your life. We understand \nin making that commitment we are also making a commitment to borrow the \nmoney necessary to do it.\n  So periodically a President will come to Congress and say: I \nunderstand our obligations which you have sent to me and I have \napproved, and now I ask you to extend my authority to borrow the money \nto meet those obligations. That has happened 89 times since 1939. Since \nwe passed this law, Presidents of both parties have come to Congress \nand asked for that authority. As I mentioned, not one time did Congress \nsay no except that one technical period in I believe 1979--89 times, 55 \ntimes by Republican Presidents and 34 times by Democratic Presidents.\n  When you look at the Presidents who have requested extensions of the \ndebt ceiling I have just described, the President who holds the record \nfor the most requests is President Ronald Reagan, who, in an 8-year \nperiod of time, asked to have the debt ceiling of the United States \nextended 18 times, more than twice a year. During the Ronald Reagan \nPresidency, the debt of the United States tripled. That is why he came \nto Congress so often.\n  The President who ranks second in terms of increasing our national \ndebt during his 8 years is President George W. Bush. The debt of \nAmerica virtually doubled during his Presidency because we waged two \nwars we didn't pay for; we did something we had never done in our \nhistory: cut taxes particularly for the rich in the midst of a war; and \nwe had many programs unpaid for.\n\n[[Page S5031]]\n\n  So President after President has used this statutory authority to \ncome to Congress and ask for approval to extend the debt ceiling. \nPresident Obama has done the same. As of August 2, his authority to ask \nto borrow money will expire. That is a serious moment if we default on \nthe debt. It will be the first time it has happened in our history.\n  What will it mean to the United States of America to default on our \ndebt and fail to extend the debt ceiling? Well, imagine if you decided \nas a homeowner to stop making your mortgage payments. Within a period \nof time, you would receive a phone call from your creditor saying: Did \nyou forget your check this month? And if you say: No, I am just not \ngoing to pay it, you understand the consequences--your credit status is \ngoing to be affected.\n  The credit status of the United States is the best in the world. We \nhave a AAA bond rating--the highest of any nation--and because we have \nthat high bond rating, we have the lowest interest rates that we pay to \nborrow money.\n  Well, go back to the homeowner. If you have just defaulted on your \nmortgage, your credit report is going to look pretty bad. The \nlikelihood that you could turn around and borrow money the next month \nis in doubt, and if someone will loan you money at that point, it will \nbe at the highest interest rate because you are a risk now; you failed \nto make your mortgage payment. Similarly, if the United States fails to \nextend the debt ceiling, our credit rating will go down from AAA, the \ninterest rate charged the U.S. Government will increase, and what has \nbeen considered the rock-solid, best economy in the world will be \njeopardized by this action.\n  What does it mean for the interest rate on the debt of the United \nStates to go up? This calculation has been made by many, and I believe \nit is accurate. For every 1 percent increase in the interest rate the \nUnited States pays on its debt, we will add $130 billion a year to our \ndebt--$1.3 trillion, roughly, over a 10-year period of time. So the \nfailure to extend the debt ceiling, the default of the United States, \nand higher interest rates will make our debt worse. That is why what we \nare facing this week in Washington is so terrible, because what we are \ndealing with here is a politically manufactured crisis. We are dealing \nwith a self-inflicted wound.\n  Because the House Republicans under Speaker Boehner refuse to extend \nthe President's request for the debt ceiling when our current authority \nexpires August 2, we could find ourselves paying higher interest rates \nand even deeper in debt. And it gets worse because when the interest \nrates paid by the U.S. Government go up, interest rates across our \neconomy go up. What it means is that a lot of innocent people who are \nborrowing money to buy a car or a home or to pay for college loans or \nto pay off their credit card are going to pay more. It is like imposing \na tax on every family and business in America at the worst possible \ntime. We are recovering from a recession. Too many people are out of \nwork. Businesses need to expand and borrow money. Raising interest \nrates stops that. This doesn't have to happen. This self-inflicted \nwound by the House Republicans and Speaker Boehner does not have to \nhappen.\n  In fairness to Speaker Boehner, his goal is to reduce America's debt. \nI accept that challenge. In fact, for the last year and a half, I have \nengaged personally on a bipartisan basis to meet that challenge, first \nas a member of President Obama's deficit commission, the Bowles-Simpson \nfiscal commission. We sat for months and listened to testimony, and \nfinally 11 out of 18 of us voted for the report issued. What it came up \nwith was a 10-year plan to reduce our debt by $4 trillion--not easy. It \nsounds as though it would be easy when you look at all the money we \nspend, but when you get into the specifics, it is politically painful. \nBut what we agreed to do was to put everything on the table. And I want \nto tell you, I did that with some reservation.\n  I am concerned about many things in our country but two things in \nparticular. I am concerned about the most vulnerable people in America, \nthose who are aged, poor, and sick. I want to make certain that at the \nend of the day, America still has a safety net, that this good and \ncaring Nation is doing everything it can to help these people.\n  What programs do they rely on? Well, they rely on the earned-income \ntax credit under our Tax Code, the childcare tax credit, Medicaid, the \nhealth insurance that covers one-third of the children in America and \nmany elderly people in nursing homes. So when we talk about cuts in \nthese programs, I was very sensitive to them and determined to make \nsure we didn't cut any more than necessary to reach our goal.\n  We also put revenue on the table. We have to do that. How can we ask \nworking families in America to pay more on their children's college \nstudent loans and be prepared to sacrifice and how can we ask the \nseniors in America to be willing to sacrifice when it comes to their \nMedicare Program and not turn to the wealthiest people in our country \nand ask them to join in this sacrifice? That has become the major \nstumbling block in this negotiation. You see, Republican Speaker \nBoehner has said: I will not accept any--underline the word ``any''--\ntax increases on the wealthiest people in America. I will agree, he \nsaid, to cut everything else, every other benefit for every other \nperson, but not one penny more in taxes from the wealthiest people in \nAmerica. That doesn't strike me as fair or just or reasonable, but that \nis where we are.\n\n  We also put spending cuts in this program, substantial spending cuts \nso that every single program in America would be closely inspected, \nreduced in spending, and move us toward a deficit-reduction goal.\n  Then I went a step further. I joined with five of my colleagues--\nthree Republicans and three of us on the Democratic side--and we sat \ndown for 6 months and worked on something called the Gang of 6 and came \nup with a specific plan of how to do this.\n  Well, Mr. President, you know we had a meeting a couple weeks ago, \nand we invited most of the Members of the Senate to come and listen to \nwhat we had proposed. Forty-nine Senators showed up, Democrats and \nRepublicans, in a room not far from here and listened as we laid out \nwhat we considered a bipartisan plan to deal with the deficit. We then \nwent back to those Senators and said: How many of you will put your \nname on the line to join us in a bipartisan effort to reduce the \ndeficit? And we are now up to 36 Senators who have done that. Over one-\nthird of the Senators have signed on to a bipartisan effort to reduce \nthe deficit.\n  What a sharp contrast that is from what is going on in the House of \nRepresentatives, where right now the Speaker of the House, the \nRepublican Speaker, is negotiating only with Republican Members to pass \na plan. I don't think that is what the American people sent us here to \ndo. I don't think they said to Democrats, come to Washington but don't \nspeak to Republicans, or to Republicans, come to Washington but don't \nspeak to Democrats. The bottom line is that, Democrats and Republicans \nnotwithstanding, we are all Americans, and we all have a \nresponsibility.\n  So here we are today at this impasse, and Speaker Boehner announced \nMonday night, when he had a press conference at the same time as the \nPresident's announcement to the Nation, that he had a plan--he called \nit a bipartisan plan--that he would pass in the House of \nRepresentatives. We expected that to happen Tuesday, and it didn't; and \nthen Wednesday, and it didn't; and then yesterday, and he failed to \npass it then, too. We waited all night until 11:00--when we finally \nadjourned--for the Speaker to pass what he considered to be a good plan \nand for us to react to it. Now we hear the Speaker may be able to get \nto it later in the afternoon or in the early evening hours. Mr. \nPresident, this is unacceptable.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, that is unacceptable. By my calculation, \nwe have 4 days before we default on our debt, 4 days before the \nAmerican economy suffers this mortal blow, 4 days before we default on \nAmerica's full faith and credit for the first time in our history, 4 \ndays while businesses across America are withholding agreements and \nnegotiations that create\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\njobs, 4 days where America people have to worry that if we default on \nour debt, the government will have to pick and choose those who will \nreceive government checks in August.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania came to the floor for the last 2 days \nand said: Oh, if we default on the debt, we can manage that. Really? If \nwe default on the debt, we will have $172 billion to spend and $306 \nbillion in obligations.\n  He said: Well, of course we have to pay interest on the other debts. \nWe don't want to default on everything. OK.\n  He said: Of course we have to pay everybody under Social Security. \nYes.\n  He said: Of course we have to pay our soldiers who are in combat. \nAgreed. All good ideas.\n  Then he said: And then we will work the others out.\n  Whom did he leave off the list? He left every Federal employee off \nthe list. That would be all of the people working at the Central \nIntelligence Agency monitoring terrorists to stop them from attacking \nthe United States. That would be the air traffic controllers in our \nairline system across America. That would be the Federal prison guards \nworking the Federal correctional facilities. That would be all of our \nveterans receiving disability checks.\n  Easily managed? Not so fast. It wouldn't be easily managed. There \nwould be losers in that process, and many of them are innocent people \nwho would be lost to the frustration of this political process.\n  There is a way through this, but the only way through it is if \nMembers of both parties come together and do it quickly. I don't think \nit is going to happen in the House. The House has decided they are \ngoing to do an all-Republican, all-day approach. That isn't going to \nsolve the problem in the House or the problem on Capitol Hill.\n  This morning, the majority leader, Harry Reid, standing at this desk, \nturned to Senator McConnell from Kentucky, the Republican leader, and \nsaid: Now it is our turn. Now we have to step up. Now we have to come \nup with a bipartisan approach and show leadership. Senator Reid is \nright. Senator McConnell has demonstrated in the past that he has been \nwilling to do that and now more than ever he should. I think the 36 \nSenators who have stepped up, joined me and others in saying we can \nfind a bipartisan way to deal with this must be heard. Our voices must \nbe heard but, more importantly, the spirit of compromise must be heard. \nThat is what the American people expect of us. They didn't send each of \nus here to win every battle under our own terms and not give. They sent \nus here to govern and to respect this great country.\n\n  I would sincerely hope we will approach the next 72 hours with the \nspirit of humility--humility to understand that so many innocent people \nacross America, families and businesses, are waiting on us and counting \non us. We cannot fail them. No one will care at the end of the day who \nhas the great political headline, but we will all be judged--Democrats \nand Republicans, House and Senate--as to whether we met our \nconstitutional obligation to this Nation and the people who live here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the challenges we face are difficult. I \nam proud of the work the House of Representatives has done. I do not \nappreciate it being suggested that somehow they are unreasonable \nbecause I don't believe that is fair to say about them. They worked \nvery hard. They complied with the congressionally mandated statutory \nrequirement to pass a budget. They passed a 10-year budget that was \nhonest and open. It was publicly debated in the House of \nRepresentatives. They passed it, and it would have fundamentally \naltered the debt trajectory of America. It would put us on a sound \npath. It could have gone a little farther, frankly, but it goes farther \nthan anything else we have seen and puts us on the path to a sound \neconomic future.\n  What happened in the Senate? I am ranking Republican on the Senate \nBudget Committee. We are required to mark up a budget in the Senate by \nlaw. It doesn't say you go to jail if you don't follow the law. It \ndoesn't have any penalty, I will acknowledge. It is a law, but we don't \nhave to follow it, except we certainly have an obligation to do so. \nCertainly we would want, I think, to have a budget in the Senate. We \nhave not had one now for over 800 days, over 2 years. We were within a \nweek--less than that--of commencing hearings to mark up a budget that \nwould be moved by the Democratic majority. When they do so, it is not \neven subject to a filibuster. It can be passed with 50 votes, and there \nare 53 Democrats in the Senate. The majority party always has that \nobligation to move a budget. Senator Reid, the Democratic leadership, \ndecided they wouldn't do it. He said it would be foolish to have a \nbudget so we haven't passed a budget.\n  The House has said it would reduce spending by up to $5 trillion or \n$6 trillion. Because of the Senate's objection and the President's \nobjection, they have agreed to raise the debt limit by $1 trillion, and \nthey have agreed to cut spending in America by $1 trillion. They have \ntried to reach an agreement so we wouldn't have a shutdown. Then, all \nof a sudden, my Democratic colleagues now come forward and say they \ndon't want to accept that. They want the Reid amendment.\n  The Reid amendment has the same actual savings. We have looked at the \nnumbers and we have seen how they have done it. There is about a $1 \ntrillion savings in the Reid bill with a reduction in spending of about \n$1 trillion. He claims it is $2.7 trillion. That is almost three times \nwhat it actually achieves. Therefore, they want to continue to raise \nthe debt limit by almost $3 trillion, the largest amount it has ever \nbeen raised. Why? Because the President said so. This is what the \nPresident said a week ago:\n\n       The only bottom line that I have is that we extend this \n     debt ceiling through the next election, into 2013.\n\n  The President thinks this is about him. It is all about him. This is \nabout America and what is good for this country. It is not about the \nPresident. It is not about politics. If it were about politics, I \nwouldn't vote for the Boehner amendment and neither would a lot of \nthose patriotic Members of the House because it is not enough. It does \nnot do what we need to do. We need to do $4 trillion, $5 trillion, $6 \ntrillion over 10 years. The debt is going to increase over the next 10 \nyears from $9 trillion to $13 trillion, and $1 trillion is not enough. \nIt can only be seen as a step in the right direction. So forgive me if \nI am a little frustrated about that.\n  I want to talk about something that is problematic and needs to be \nknown. It is not being focused on, and this is Senator Reid's amendment \nand his solution to the deficit problem. He wants to raise the debt \nceiling so we can keep borrowing money and spending more than we take \nin. We are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. The President \nthis morning said he liked the Reid amendment and is what he wishes to \nsee. He doesn't like the House version. I think there are some things \nwe all ought to think about and know that are in the Reid amendment.\n  As I have said, we have gone 821 days without a budget. The law \nrequires us to have a budget. A lack of a congressional budget \ncontributes to our fiscal nightmare. Since we last passed a budget, we \nhave spent $7 trillion. The reason we don't have a budget is because it \nis carefully and deliberately orchestrated that we not have one by the \nleadership of this Senate. They have planned for just the eventuality \nthat is occurring. I have warned for weeks and months on the floor of \nthe Senate that we would be at the eleventh hour with people scurrying \naround in secret, plotting deals to try to figure out how to deal with \nthe crisis this Nation faces. That is exactly what is happening.\n  Today it was announced that the second quarter economic growth was \n1.3 percent. That is anemic and well below what we were hoping to see \nand thought we might. We have had expert testimony that the debt we \nhave pulls down economic growth. Had the Senate adopted a budget in a \ntimely manner this year, as the House did, we would not be at this \nlast-minute crisis. It was deliberately orchestrated because it gives \nmaximum leverage to the President and the press. The question becomes \nnot what is in the deal, but do you have a deal? Just do anything. We\n\n[[Page S5033]]\n\nare going to be in a crisis if you don't pass something. We want a \ndeal. The House has come up with a very reasonable compromise. It looks \nas though some people want to have this fuss and put us through the \ncrisis even when they get basically what they have asked for.\n  The Reid amendment to increase the debt limit deems two consecutive \nbudget resolutions for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. In other words, it \nbasically takes over the budget process and sets the basic spending \nnumbers. Does the President think the Senate should go 2 more years \nwithout crafting or passing a budget? We have already gone 2 years. The \nReid amendment sets spending allocations for most Senate committees at \nthe Congressional Budget Office's rising baseline. These are \nbureaucratic members. They work hard, but they are not elected. They \nare not constitutionally accountable. It says we are going to deem the \namount we spend by what CBO has projected our growth in spending to be, \nand CBO projects growth in spending. They don't set that as right for \nAmerica, but they project that is what will occur under the current \ncircumstances. This deems those higher growing numbers as what should \nbe.\n  Without hearings or debates on these allocations, this provision \nwould provide a further excuse for avoiding a budget and increase the \nlikelihood that the Congressional Budget Act will be violated for the \nthird straight year. This is an abrogation of the responsibilities of \nthe Senate and of the Budget Committee of the Senate. We are not \nelected to the Senate and chosen to sit on the Budget Committee to see \nmost of the budget levels automatically raised based on a set of \nspending growth projections by the CBO. They are not empowered to do \nthat. They don't claim to, actually. I should not demean them. They do \nwhat their duty is. It is this kind of process that has placed the \ncountry in a financial crisis.\n  We keep locking in spending levels that are going up. When we reduce \nthe growth in spending a little bit, you know what we say we are doing? \nWe are cutting spending, and it is spending more. That is the way the \nbudget is. When they say we are going to save $1 trillion through the \nHouse plan----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would ask for 2 additional minutes to wrap up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The provision that takes over that and sets us on an \nautomatic growth course is not the right one. Both the Reid amendment \nand the House bill say we save about $1 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. I would note that the difference between the two is how long or \nhow much is achieved by that. Senator Reid wants almost 2 years and the \nHouse Members would do it based on a dollar-per-dollar manner. That $1 \ntrillion in the Reid amendment does not reduce spending. It only \nreduces the growth in spending, and that is one of the reasons Congress \nis able to hide the amount of money we are spending every year. That is \none reason debt is so high.\n  The Budget Committee should be allowed to fulfill its duties. The \nBudget Committee should be allowed to mark up in fiscal year 2012. It \nwill begin October 1 of this year. We need a budget now. We are past \ndue. Once a budget is adopted by the committee, it should be taken to \nthe full Senate and allowed to be amended as the law provides. I am \ndisappointed that the President doesn't seem to agree with that. He \nseems to have bought into the idea that the regular processes of the \nSenate should not be followed. He agrees with Senator Reid, apparently, \nthat if they can keep it all bottled up to an end and we come up on a \ncrisis, they can all maneuver in secret and cut a deal. They feel that \nis the way we serve the American people.\n  I feel strongly that we are undermining the great power and \nresponsibility of the Senate as that place where the great issues are \ndiscussed publicly and openly and where we are accountable and cast \nvotes. Let me say again, the reason the majority leader did not want a \nbudget to come up is because when you bring a budget up, you have to \nvote, people have alternatives, they offer amendments, and the Members \ngo on record. He is protecting his Members from having to do the \nprimary responsibility of Senators who are before the world to cast \ntheir vote and to be accountable to the people who sent them there.\n  It is not good for this body. This body should be engaged in a \nhistoric debate about the threat the debt poses to our future, and we \nhave been unengaged. The discussions are being taken in secret without \nthe American people being able to hold their representatives \naccountable. I object.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I try to listen very carefully to \nfolks at home. I would not quarrel with my friend from Alabama in \nsaying that it is very clear to me--and it has been clear to me for a \nlong time--that Missourians are very worried about spending in the \nFederal Government. In fact, my friend from Alabama and I started work \non this before, if one can say--we were trying to cut spending before \ncutting spending was cool. He and I were working this floor for votes \nto try to do something about spending long before last November's \nelection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for recalling that event. I know \nthe Senator continued working across the aisle on another proposal that \nhas the potential to be more effective than even the one we worked on \ntogether last year. So I thank the Senator for being willing to work in \na way that could be effective to do better.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama. There \nis nothing wrong with walking across the aisle and finding common \nground. Frankly, it is what I thought would be common when I came to \nthe Senate. It is kind of what I learned in the history books; that it \nwould be common.\n  I have been watching what is developing, knowing my folks at home \nwant us to cut spending. I certainly have been part of wanting to cut \nspending. I have watched this debt ceiling approach. It is like \nwatching a movie and watching a car driving along, and you are in a \ncamera above it and you see what is ahead, and you see this cliff and \nyou see this car driving toward this cliff, and you are thinking, as \nyou start tensing--Oh, surely, you are not going to go over the cliff.\n  Well, they have an opportunity to avoid going over the cliff. They \nare not going to go over the cliff. We are not going to see these \npeople die. They are not going to drive over that cliff. They are not \ngoing to knowingly drive over a cliff. I have been thinking for the \nlast several weeks: There is no way people who are elected--because \nthey love their country--are going to let the car go over the cliff. I \nhave to tell my colleagues, I am worried.\n  What do we have to do to keep from going over the cliff? Make no \nmistake about it. It is a cliff. It is a historic moment for our \ncountry. Never before in the history of our country have the world \nmarkets been worried about whether the United States of America will \npay its bills. Never has that happened before in our history. So what \ndoes it take?\n  Well, it is not complicated what it takes. It takes one basic \ningredient: compromise. To keep from going over the cliff, all we have \nto do is compromise.\n  I will tell my colleagues, reading my mail and listening to phone \ncalls that have come in on the answering machine--and I am going to \ntake phone calls myself over the weekend--what Missourians are now \nsaying: Please don't go over the cliff. Please compromise. I am \nconfident that is what most Missourians want.\n  Compromises have already occurred--big compromises. Most of us on \nthis side of the aisle believe the way we get at our long-term debt \nstructure is a responsible approach that includes some revenues. I \nadvocate cleaning out the goodies in the Tax Code so we can lower tax \nrates. I don't understand how we can vote to gut the Medicare Program \nand at the same time vote to continue writing checks to Big Oil. I \ncannot conceive how a Member votes that way. I cannot imagine I would \nvote to keep writing a taxpayer check to the most wealthy and \nprofitable corporations in the history of the world at the same time I \nwas voting to put Medicare\n\n[[Page S5034]]\n\non a voucher program. That would be saying to seniors, if they are 83 \nand they have three chronic illnesses, and they run out of Medicare \ncoverage, they are on their own. I can't imagine doing that.\n  But we compromised. We compromised and said: OK, we will set revenues \naside, for now. You will not vote for revenues, Republican Party. \nMembers of the House in the Republican Party, you will not vote for \nrevenues.\n  So we took revenues off the table. By the way, some people in my \nparty were not happy with that. I got those phone calls: Why did you \ncapitulate? Why did you give in? We gave in because we care about our \ncountry, and we don't want to go over the cliff. That is why we gave \nin. So we gave in on revenues.\n  The Republicans wanted us to cut spending by more than we raised the \ndebt ceiling. It is a political thing we need to do, not required by \nthe economics, but we have done that. So now we put revenues aside--\ncompromise. We have said we are going to cut spending by more than the \nrise in the debt ceiling.\n  Now the only thing we have not compromised on, the only thing--which \nI think is, really, when we think about it--I didn't think, frankly, \nthis may have been as big of a deal until I stand here today--is to do \nthis again in 6 months, to leave this loaded gun on the table. We are \ngoing to leave this loaded gun on the table for our economy?\n  People can talk to small businesses right now and learn they are \nscared about what is going to happen next week. Will they be able to \nborrow money? Will people be able to afford to borrow money to buy \ncars? Will they be able to afford to borrow money to buy homes?\n  We talk about the economy going in a tailspin, and we want to keep \nthat loaded gun on the table for another 6 months? There is no way we \ncan provide the certainty in this kind of economic climate if we leave \nthe loaded gun on the table.\n  So the only thing we have not agreed to that is in the Boehner plan--\nwell, it depends on which plan it is. They keep changing it to try to \nget enough votes. I don't know what it is today. But the only thing we \nare not going to budge on is saying to this country and our business \ncommunity and our job creators: We are going to kill job creation for \nsure for the next 6 months by telling you we want to repeat this \nridiculous exercise in 6 months. We are not going to do that.\n  The irony is, the people who want us to do that are the people who \nhave been preaching certainty: We have to have certainty. By the way, \nlet's do this again in 6 months. We have to have certainty. It is \nimportant we do this again in 6 months.\n  I know the leader is working on trying to get a compromise today, and \nI am confident that before the day is over there will be some kind of \ncompromise that will be before this body that we will have a chance to \nvote on.\n  I will tell my colleagues this: People will never hear me brag about \nrefusing to compromise. Some of my colleagues from Missouri who serve \nin the House of Representatives are willing right now to brag about \nrefusing to compromise. They are willing to say it is a good thing to \ngo off the cliff. I will never brag about refusing to compromise \nbecause I don't think that is what we do here. When we look back in \nhistory, America's brightest moments usually happened around the table \nof compromise. The most difficult questions this country has wrestled \nwith through the years, we have forged a way forward through \ncompromise, and that is what we needed to. That is what we need \ntomorrow. That is what we need as we approach the edge of the cliff.\n  So my last message I will leave with my colleagues across the aisle \nis this: We have shown our willingness to compromise. Please show us \nyours. Please show us yours and allow us to vote. Allow us to vote on \nthe compromise. If my colleagues don't want to vote for the compromise, \nthen don't vote for it. But allow us a chance to vote for it. Is that \ntoo much to ask, just to allow us an opportunity to move to a vote, to \navoid this country having a permanently diminished status in the world? \nI don't think that is too much to ask.\n  So let us vote, and if my colleagues can't compromise on the \nsubstance of the compromises that will be put forward, at least allow \nour voices to be heard by allowing a vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe quorum call be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues that this \nwork period was supposed to be our opportunity to finally enact, after \nyears of delay, the Free Trade Agreements with our allies South Korea, \nColombia, and Panama.\n  These agreements were signed over 4 years ago, and this \nadministration has had more than 2\\1/2\\ years to submit them to \nCongress for consideration, but they have failed to do so. \nUnfortunately, we are going to have to continue to wait at least until \nSeptember before we get a vote.\n  Why does it matter that we pass these agreements? It matters for two \nreasons: first, because expanding trade opportunities creates American \njobs; second, because we live in a competitive global economy and other \nnations are not standing still while we delay.\n  Economists overwhelmingly agree that expanding trade opportunities \ncreates jobs. The Obama White House, for example, estimates that \nenactment of these three trade agreements will boost exports by at \nleast $12 billion, supporting over 70,000 American jobs.\n  The fact that lowering barriers to U.S. exports will create jobs for \nAmerican workers is common sense. Consider that our market is already \nlargely open to foreign imports, including those from Korea, Colombia, \nand Panama. Without trade agreements to ensure similar treatment for \nour exporters, American businesses will continue to face high tariff \nand nontariff barriers abroad.\n  Consider one example: the market for agricultural products in Korea, \nwhich is the world's thirteenth largest economy. Korea's tariffs on \nimported agricultural goods average 54 percent, compared to an average \n9-percent tariff on these imports into the United States. Mr. \nPresident, 54 percent added on for us to get our agricultural products \ninto Korea; only 9 percent for them to get those same products into the \nUnited States, that is a 45-percent differential.\n  Passage of the Korea Free Trade Agreement will level this playing \nfield. Yet this administration continues to delay sending the \nagreements to Congress. The Obama White House would prefer to hold \nthese agreements hostage because of a desire to expand the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program rather than improve the competitive \nposition of American producers.\n  At a time of near record unemployment and slow economic growth, this\n\n[[Page S5035]]\n\ndelay is unacceptable. I want to put a fine point on that by saying \nthat just this morning the numbers came out. The Bureau of Economic \nAnalysis released its advance estimate of growth in the inflation-\nadjusted gross domestic product, GDP, for the second quarter. According \nto the advance estimate, annualized GDP growth in the second quarter \nwas 1.3 percent.\n  They went back and revised the first quarter of 2011. They revised it \ndownward to .4 percent, down from a reported rate of 1.9 percent. So \nthey have adjusted downward the first quarter growth rate from 1.9 \npercent down to .4 percent, and we now know, according to the advance \nestimate at least, that second quarter GDP growth is only 1.3 percent--\nway under what the assumptions have been, way under what the estimates \nhave been, and way under what it is going to take for us to get the \neconomy turned around and growing again and get people back to work.\n  Couple that with the job-crushing regulations, the taxes that have \ncome since this administration has taken office, and it is making it \nvery difficult for our economy to recover and to grow and to get back \non track. So the administration wishes to hold these agreements hostage \nbecause of their desire to expand the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram rather than get these producers back access to these markets we \nshould have access to in some of these countries, and we cannot afford \nto wait any longer to do that.\n  The reasons are very clear. We have an economy that is sluggish, that \nis struggling to get back on its feet. We have three free trade \nagreements that have been hanging around here languishing literally now \nfor 4 years that would open up export opportunities and, as I said, \neven according to the President's own estimates, add 70,000 jobs to our \neconomy.\n  The position of Leader McConnell and Republican Senators has been \nconsistent from the beginning. We are happy to have a debate on the \nmerits of expanding trade adjustment assistance and to consider this \nbill as a stand-alone measure. But we will not hold the trade \nagreements hostage to consideration of trade adjustment assistance.\n  I want to commend my colleagues Senators Portman and Blunt for the \nletter they recently spearheaded with 10 other Republican Senators \ncommitting to support the necessary procedural votes to consider trade \nadjustment assistance as a stand-alone measure and on its own merits.\n  In light of this letter, it is very clear the administration has run \nout of excuses for not submitting the trade agreements to Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have the Portman-Blunt \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 19, 2011.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: as Republican Senators, we urge you to \n     submit the Korea, Colombia and Panama trade agreements as \n     soon as possible, with the understanding that we will support \n     a separate Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) bill that \n     reflects the bipartisan reforms negotiated by Chairmen Baucus \n     and Camp and the White House.\n       In order to move this process forward, we commit to \n     supporting cloture on the motion to proceed to such a TAA \n     bill and cloture on the bill itself. We believe that the \n     trade agreements and TAA should receive separate up or down \n     votes on their merits.\n       We therefore urge you to separate the pending trade \n     agreements and TAA, and immediately submit the three trade \n     agreements to Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n         Roy Blunt, Scott P. Brown, Rob Portman, John Boozman, \n           John Hoeven, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Johnny \n           Isakson, Ron Wicker, Dan Coats, Thad Cochran, Mike \n           Johanns.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. There is a path forward in both the House and the Senate \nfor trade adjustment assistance, and we have bipartisan majorities in \nboth Chambers waiting to vote for the Korea, Colombia, and Panama \nagreements. So why are we still waiting for the White House to do the \nright thing and send us these agreements?\n  This ongoing delay is having a real impact on American businesses, \nand it will only get worse. On July 1, the European Union-Korea trade \nagreement went into effect. According to press reports, European \nexports to Korea rose 16 percent in the first 13 days after the Korea-\nEU Free Trade Agreement entered into force.\n  Let's be clear about what this means. Korean consumers are choosing \nto buy German, French, and British cars, electronics, and agricultural \nproducts rather than American-made products because these European \nproducts now have a price advantage. This was entirely preventable if \nwe had acted on the U.S.-Korea agreement sooner.\n  Likewise, the Canada-Colombia agreement will go into effect on August \n15. This will result in an advantage for Canadian goods, such as \nconstruction equipment, aircraft, and a range of other industrial and \nagricultural products. Much as with Korea, the United States businesses \nwill find themselves at a competitive disadvantage because we have \nfailed to act.\n  Again, this did not have to happen. The administration finalized its \nlabor action plan for Colombia back in April. We have had plenty of \ntime to consider these agreements over the past several months. \nInstead, we are facing a situation where United States wheat producers \nare likely to be completely shut out of the Colombian market once the \nagreement with Canada has gone into effect.\n  This is amazing, when you think about it, when you consider that just \na few years ago American wheat producers dominated the market in \nColombia with a 73-percent market share. That was as of 2008.\n  In 2010, for the first time in the history of United States-Colombia \ntrade, the United States lost to Argentina its position as Colombia's \nNo. 1 agricultural supplier.\n  Consider the story of three crops we grow in South Dakota: soybeans, \ncorn, and wheat. The combined market share in Colombia for these three \nU.S. agricultural exports has decreased from 81 percent in 2008 to 19 \npercent as of 2010--a decline of 62 percentage points in a 2-year \nperiod; an 81-percent to a 19-percent market share in corn, wheat, and \nsoybeans, for American agricultural producers. Think about that. That \nis a staggering collapse, which was totally avoidable, totally \npreventable, if we had simply acted on these trade agreements much \nsooner. This is the real cost of our delay while our trading partners \ncontinue to pursue new regional and bilateral trade agreements.\n  We are living in a global economy where America cannot afford to \nstand still on trade. As Senator Baucus noted at a recent Finance \nCommittee hearing, in 1960, exports accounted for only 3.6 percent of \nour entire U.S. GDP; today, exports account for 12.5 percent of our \nGDP. Exports of U.S. goods and services support over 10 million \nAmerican jobs.\n  It is long past time we get back in the game by passing the three \npending trade agreements. America's manufacturers, America's farmers, \nand America's service providers cannot afford to wait any longer. So I \ncall upon the administration to submit the trade agreements to Congress \nbefore the August recess. We are not going to be able to consider these \nagreements until September, but sending them to Congress now will send \na strong signal that this administration is finally serious about \ngetting them done. It would also be an important show of good faith to \nour close allies, South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. These job-\ncreating, market-opening trade agreements should be at the top of the \nagenda when we get back in September.\n  Again, I want to reemphasize the importance of that in light of these \neconomic numbers, the data that is coming out that points out that in \nthe second quarter of this year our economic growth was a sluggish 1.3 \npercent, and that the revised estimate now for the first quarter of \nthis year was .4 percent.\n  We will never get the unemployment rate down, we will never get \nAmerica's economy expanding and back on its feet, we will never start \ndealing with these massive debt issues we have, one, if we do not cut \nspending--which is the other issue we are debating today--but also if \nwe are not growing and expanding the American economy.\n  We can do that. There are so many things these trade agreements would \ndo not only for agricultural exporters but for other producers of \nAmerican goods, and we ought to be doing that.\n\n[[Page S5036]]\n\nIt is high time we at least do some of the things we can do to get the \neconomy growing again. I cannot emphasize enough the lost market \nopportunities, the lost chance at economic growth, the lost jobs that \nare associated with the fact that this administration has delayed now, \nsince they have been in office--2\\1/2\\ years--in submitting these three \nfree trade agreements to Congress, three free trade agreements that \nhave broad bipartisan support from Congress, which we as Republicans \nhave been waiting to act upon now for almost the 4 years since these \nagreements were negotiated in the first place.\n  So it is high time we change that. It is one thing that we can do to \naffect the economy in this country, among the other things. I would \nsimply add as sort of a final point, the debate we are having about the \ndebt limit is also one that needs to be dealt with if we are going to \nget serious about growing the economy and creating jobs.\n  If we look at the economy, we look at this President's economic \nrecord, and we look at the data, almost every metric we can measure, he \nhas made this economy much worse. The President has said repeatedly--\nand he said it in his speech the other night--he blames the previous \nadministration for where we are today. I do not think anybody here will \ndispute the fact that he inherited a difficult set of economic \ncircumstances. But there is no question, if we look at every metric, \nthat he has made the situation much worse.\n  Whether that is unemployment, which is up 18 percent--there are 2.1 \nmillion more people unemployed today than there were when he took \noffice--whether it is the debt, which has grown by 35 percent since he \ntook office; whether it is the number of Americans who are receiving \nfood stamps, which has gone up by 40 percent since he took office--and \nI might add in my State of South Dakota, a 58-percent increase in the \nnumber of people receiving food stamps.\n  The cost of health care in this country is up 19 percent since this \nPresident took office. The cost of gasoline has gone up almost 100 \npercent--99 percent--since this President took office. The amount of \nthe debt per person in this country has gone up by $11,000. Every \nAmerican now owes $11,000 more as their share of our Federal debt since \nthis President took office.\n  The economic record of this administration is abysmal. It is high \ntime we took the steps to do something about that. It strikes me at \nleast, as I look at the policies they have been putting in place, that \nthey seem to want to make it more difficult and more expensive for \npeople in this country to create jobs. We see that in regulations \ncoming out of all of these various agencies. We see it in the massive \nrunup in the growth, in the size of government, the new mandates that \nhave been imposed on a lot of our small businesses as a result of the \nnew health care bill, the new taxes that have been imposed on our small \nbusinesses as a result of the new health care legislation.\n  At every turn American small businesses, which create the jobs that \nwill get this economy growing again, tell us the economic uncertainty, \nthe job-crushing policies that are coming out of this administration \nhave been a major inhibitor, a major impediment to them creating jobs \nand getting people back to work in this country.\n  The trade agreements are just something I would add on to that list. \nWe have three trade agreements that have been teed up. It has been \nalmost 4 years since they were negotiated. This administration has been \nin office now for 2\\1/2\\ years. The President continually gets up, as \nhe did at the State of the Union, and talks about wanting to double the \ntrade in 5 years, talks about supporting these three trade agreements. \nYet it is a very simple thing. All he has to do is submit them to \nCongress. The trade agreements are negotiated. All he has to do is send \nthem here. We are ready to act to put Americans back to work, to open \nup export opportunities to American producers, to get the economy \ngrowing again, and create jobs.\n  I hope in addition to dealing with the issue of runaway spending and \ndebt, which, in my view, is the predominant issue we need to deal \nwith--and, clearly, between now and Tuesday we have to get a solution \nin place that will avert the economic adversity we could be dealing \nwith, the adverse circumstances if we do not deal with that. But that \nneeds to be accompanied by serious reductions in spending, spending \nreforms. Then we have to be putting in place policies that will enable \neconomic growth in this country, that will make it less expensive, less \ndifficult for small businesses to create jobs, not more difficult.\n  Unfortunately, that is the record to date of this administration. I \nhope we can change that and start today by sending these trade \nagreements to the Congress so we can act on them and get these things \napproved and get American businesses exporting to these three \ncountries.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are now reaching a critical hour in the \nCongress of the United States on the question of extending the debt \nlimit of the Nation and of fundamentally dealing with the debt of the \nNation. I don't think there is any serious person in either body who \ndoes not understand that we must deal with the debt itself as we extend \nthe debt limit. We are borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. The \ngross debt of the United States will reach 100 percent of our GDP by \nthe end of this year. The best economists in the country, of whatever \nphilosophical stripe, are telling us we are on an unsustainable course \nthat must be changed.\n  Mr. President, in the midst of this, we have had the House so far \nunable to send us a package. Now, we are told they do have the votes \nbecause they have added a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \nas part of their package. The balanced budget amendment they previously \nproposed in the House of Representatives can never pass the Senate--at \nleast as this body is currently constituted--and it should not pass \nthis body. It is deeply flawed. To attach that to a measure that has to \npass both Houses before Tuesday of next week, frankly, is an indication \nof a lack of seriousness on the part of our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Ultimately, there has to be a bipartisan agreement. Our friends in \nthe other party control the House of Representatives, the Senate is \ncontrolled by my party, the Democratic Party, and we have a Democrat in \nthe White House. No serious person can fail to understand that putting \nan amendment to the Constitution of the United States that is deeply \nflawed into that package absolutely guarantees it cannot pass in this \nChamber. That would take a two-thirds vote. I don't believe it would \neven command a simple majority here, much less a two-thirds vote.\n  So here we are at the eleventh hour, and people in the other body \nseemingly are still not serious about coping with the challenge of both \nextending the debt limit to avoid a default, which would be \ncatastrophic, and dealing with the debt itself. I understand \nideological rigidity. The time for that is past. The time now is to \nwork together in some reasonable way so we advance legislation that \nboth extends the debt limit to avoid the catastrophic consequences of a \ndefault and deals with the debt threat itself.\n  The New York Times on Wednesday had this story: ``On All Levels of \nthe Economy, Concern About the Impasse.'' What they were talking about \nis the rating agencies saying that if we don't do both, if we don't \nextend the debt limit and deal effectively with the debt itself, they \nare going to downgrade the rating of our credit as a country. The story \ngoes on to say:\n\n       Economists and analysts are trying to gauge the costs to \n     the economy and consumers if the United States loses its \n     solid-gold credit rating--a move that appears more likely now \n     that the stand-off in Washington over government spending has \n     calcified. Some economists say the effects of lowering the \n     Federal Government's credit rating\n\n[[Page S5037]]\n\n     to AA from AAA can be measured in the billions of dollars in \n     increased borrowing costs for the government and in the \n     billions more that consumers, corporations, states, and \n     municipalities will have to pay for their credit. It also \n     could erode consumer and business confidence, slowing even \n     further the economy and job creation.\n\n  It has started already. We have just learned the latest numbers on \neconomic growth. They were a tepid 1.3 percent. This uncertainty being \ncreated by a failure to deal with our debt and with an extension of the \ndebt limit is creating a headwind for our economy, reducing economic \ngrowth, slowing job creation, and costing us a stronger recovery.\n  I want to remind colleagues that every 1 percentage point increase in \ninterest rates adds $1.3 trillion to the deficits. So kicking this can \ndown the road and not facing up to it has enormous consequences: $1.3 \ntrillion added debt for every 1 percent increase in interest rates. \nThis is just the effect on the Federal Government. Trillions more would \nbe the effect on consumers, on companies, and on other levels of \ngovernment with an increase in interest rates.\n  The proposal by the Speaker that apparently the House is now prepared \nto send us has fatal flaws, and here they are:\n  First of all, it would repeat the default crisis in just 6 months. \nThat would continue the uncertainty and put the economy at further \nrisk. Our friends on the other side have repeatedly said how \nuncertainty is hurting this economy, and now they themselves want to \ncreate more uncertainty. It makes no sense.\n  The Boehner plan includes significantly less deficit reduction than \ndoes the Reid plan. The Boehner plan, as I understand it--we have not \nbeen able to calculate his newest version fully--was in the range of $1 \ntrillion of savings. Majority Leader Reid's plan is well over $2 \ntrillion of savings.\n  Third, the Boehner plan provides no firewall between security and \nnonsecurity spending. That means even deeper cuts on the domestic side \nof the ledger because we all know what happens if you don't have a \nfirewall.\n  Finally, it requires an irresponsible balanced budget amendment \napproach that has been clearly rejected here and will be rejected \nagain. That is certain.\n  Standard & Poor's has warned against repeated debt ceiling debates. \nHere is what they said on July 26:\n\n       We would be concerned if we thought that the debt ceiling \n     debate would come back and be open and we'd have to go \n     through all this again and again and again. That would be a \n     negative, in our view.\n\n  This is the rating agency that determines what the interest rates \nwill be on the debt of our country--not directly but indirectly because \nif they rate down our creditworthiness, that will increase interest \nrates. So they are sending a very clear signal: Don't do the Speaker \nBoehner plan that has only a 6-month extension and repeat this whole \nprocess and create more uncertainty and put the economy further at \nrisk. To avoid a U.S. credit rating downgrade, S wants to see a \nbipartisan debt-reduction effort, not the totally partisan approach \nSpeaker Boehner has for the moment chosen to pursue. I don't know what \ncould be more clear.\n  The other body is in control of our friends in the other party; this \nbody is in control of the Democrats. At the end of the day, we have to \ncome together. We have to work together.\n  Now, I have been part of two efforts to work together.\n  Last year, the fiscal commission--18 of us were given the \nresponsibility to come up with a plan to get our debt under control. At \nthe end of the day, 11 of the 18 agreed on a plan--5 Democrats, 5 \nRepublicans, and 1 Independent--fully bipartisan. I was proud to be \npart of the 11 who agreed to that plan.\n  This year, I have been part of the Group of 6--3 Democrats, 3 \nRepublicans--who were asked by about 30 of our colleagues to see if we \ncould find a way to implement the findings of the commission because \nfor the commission's findings to be implemented, they had to have a \nsuper-supermajority. They had to have 14 of the 18 agree, and even \nthough we had 11 of 18, it wasn't enough. So about 30 Senators met at \nthe beginning of this year, the end of last, and asked a group of us--\n6, 3 Democrats and 3 Republicans--to see if we could come up with a \nbipartisan plan. We worked all year, hundreds of hours, and we have \nagreed. We have laid out a plan for our colleagues. It is the only \nbipartisan plan before either Chamber.\n  Speaker Boehner at this late hour is still pursuing a plan only on \nthe Republican side of the aisle and only in one Chamber. That can't \npossibly be a recipe for success.\n  David Beers, Standard & Poor's global head of sovereign ratings, said \nthis on July 26:\n\n       We will measure the deal on a number of parameters. One is, \n     is it credible? And credibility, among other things, means to \n     us that there has to be some buy-in across the political \n     divide, across both parties, because politics can and will \n     change going forward. And if there's ownership by both sides \n     of the program, then that would give us more confidence. It's \n     not just about the number. It's about the all-in intent.\n\n  Mr. President, are our colleagues listening? The solution cannot be \nfound on just one side of the aisle in one Chamber. This is going to \nrequire bipartisan, bicameral cooperation. We are going to have to act \nlike adults, not like kids in a schoolyard pointing fingers, spreading \nrumors, spreading blame. That will not lead to success.\n  Here is the circumstance we face. The red line is the spending line \nof the United States going back 60 years, and the green line is the \nrevenue line of the United States going back 60 years. What you can see \nis that the revenue of the United States as a share of our national \nincome is the lowest it has been in 60 years. Spending as a share of \nour national income is the highest it has been in 60 years. Revenue is \nthe lowest, spending is the highest--that is why we have record \ndeficits. Clearly, you have to work both sides of the equation to get a \nsolution.\n  Some of our friends on the other side are saying: Don't touch \nrevenue. Some of our friends on both sides are saying: Ah, and don't \ntouch entitlements. Don't touch Medicare, don't touch Social Security, \ndon't touch Medicaid.\n  If you can't touch revenue and you can't touch the entitlements, you \ncan't solve the problem by definition. When you are borrowing 40 cents \nof every dollar and you exclude all revenue--that is half the \nequation--and you exclude 60 percent of Federal spending--if you \neliminated all the rest of Federal spending, every dime for defense, \nfor nondefense discretionary, if you eliminated every dime, it wouldn't \nsolve the problem. At some point we have to get serious and real with \nthe American people. The balanced budget amendment our colleagues in \nthe House sent us previously, that has already been rejected here once. \nNow they are putting it in the package to send to us again at the \neleventh hour--it is a balanced budget amendment that is as deeply \nflawed as any amendment I have seen in 25 years in this Chamber.\n\n  Let me review what our friends on the other side sent us in a \nbalanced budget amendment that was rejected here just in the last few \nweeks:\n  No. 1, it would restrict the ability to respond to economic \ndownturns--meaning we would compound the decline. That is bad \neconomics, and it is not going to pass.\n  No. 2, it uses Social Security funds to calculate balance and \nsubjects that program to the same cuts as other Federal spending even \nthough Social Security has its own trust fund and is separately funded.\n  No. 3, it shifts the ultimate decisions on budgeting to unelected and \nunaccountable judges.\n  No. 4, it requires a State ratification process that could take years \nto complete. We don't have years to wait for a State ratification \nprocess for a constitutional amendment. We need to make these spending \nand revenue decisions ourselves, and do it now. It is our \nresponsibility. Let's not wait for the States to ratify a \nconstitutional amendment before we take the action that is necessary.\n  The balanced budget amendment the House previously sent us has the \nrisk of turning a recession into a depression. Why do I say that? There \nis no provision in the amendment they sent us for an economic downturn \nas being an exemption from the balanced budget requirement. That is \nHoover economics all over again. How many times do we have to learn the \nharsh lesson that when we are in an economic freefall, the only entity \nbig enough to pull us out is the collective organization of\n\n[[Page S5038]]\n\nour government? That is the only place that has the muscle to prevent a \nrecession from turning into a depression. The balanced budget amendment \nour colleagues sent us before would absolutely lock down the Federal \nGovernment's ability to respond. That would be a profound mistake and \ncontradict all we have learned in economics since the Great Depression.\n  This is what Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise \nInstitute, said about this constitutional amendment. He called it a \n``really dumb idea.''\n  This is what he said:\n\n       Few ideas are more seductive on the surface and more \n     destructive in reality than a balanced budget amendment.\n       Here is why: Nearly all our States have balanced budget \n     requirements. That means when the economy slows, States are \n     forced to raise taxes or slash spending at just the wrong \n     time, providing a fiscal drag when what is needed is \n     countercyclical policy to stimulate the economy. In fact, the \n     fiscal drag from the states in 2009-2010, was barely \n     countered by the Federal stimulus plan. That meant the \n     Federal stimulus provided was nowhere near what was needed \n     but far better than doing nothing. Now imagine that scenario \n     with a federal drag instead.\n\n  The Washington Post ran an editorial about the House balanced budget \namendment headlined, ``A Bad Idea Returns.''\n\n       Rewriting the Constitution is the wrong way to deal with \n     the debt.\n\n  Here is what they said in their editorial:\n\n       Worse yet, the latest version would impose an absolute cap \n     on spending as a share of the economy.\n       It would prevent Federal expenditures from exceeding 18 \n     percent of the Gross Domestic Product in any year. Most \n     unfortunately, the amendment lacks a clause letting the \n     government exceed that limit to strengthen a struggling \n     economy. No matter how shaky the State of the Union, \n     policymakers would be prevented from adopting emergency \n     spending such as, the extension of unemployment insurance and \n     other countercyclical expenses that have helped cushion the \n     blow of the current economic downturn.\n\n  It doesn't stop there. This is what Senator McCain said on the \nRepublican balanced budget amendment proposal on July 27:\n\n       What is amazing about this, some members are believing we \n     can pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution in \n     this body with its present representation, and that is \n     foolish. That is worse than foolish. That is deceiving many \n     of our constituents. . . . That is not fair to the American \n     people to hold out and say we will not agree to raising the \n     debt limit until we pass a balanced budget amendment to the \n     Constitution. It is unfair. It is bizarro. Maybe some people \n     who have only been in this body for 6 or 7 months or so \n     believe that. Others know better. . . . It is time we \n     listened to the markets. It is time we listened to our \n     constituents. Most of all, it is time we listened to the \n     American people and sit down and seriously negotiate \n     something. . . .\n\n  Senator McCain had it exactly right. Sending us a deeply flawed \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States at \nthe eleventh hour is not designed to achieve a result. It is designed \nto achieve a headline, a bumper sticker slogan that will not help us \nsolve the problem.\n  Here is what a top economic adviser to former President Reagan said \nabout the House balanced budget amendment. This is Bruce Bartlett, a \nformer Reagan administration top economic adviser. He said:\n\n       I have previously explained the idiocy of right wing \n     advocates . . . of a balanced budget amendment. However, the \n     new Republican balanced budget proposal is especially \n     dimwitted. . . . In short this is quite possibly the \n     stupidest constitutional amendment I think I have ever seen. \n     It looks like it was drafted by a couple of interns on the \n     back of a napkin. Every Senator cosponsoring this balanced \n     budget amendment should be ashamed of themselves.\n\n  That is from a former top economic adviser to Ronald Reagan. Is \nanybody listening? Is anybody paying attention to how far off base \nthings have slipped in the other body to send us at this moment, at \nthis critical juncture, a plan that has absolutely no chance of passing \nin this body, and should not?\n  What is so deeply flawed is--in addition to the other points I have \nmade--the balanced budget amendment the House Republicans sent us \nearlier set a spending cap of 18 percent of GDP. Well, let's add up \nwhat that would mean.\n  We can see Social Security is the red band. That is about 5 percent \nof GDP. If we add defense and all other nonhealth care spending, that \ntakes us up to about 16.5 percent of GDP. Interest on the debt takes us \nto over 18 percent of GDP.\n  Do you notice what is missing? Medicare. In the Republican plan they \nsent to us with a spending cap of 18 percent of GDP, if we fund Social \nSecurity, if we fund defense and other nonhealth spending, and we fund \ninterest on the debt, there is no money left. There is no money for \nMedicare. There is no money for Medicaid. There is no money for any \nhealth care spending. That is what the House of Representatives sent us \nin the last several weeks as a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  When some on our side called it cut, cap, and kill Medicare, they \nwere not kidding. If we add it up, it does not add up. Not only that, \nthe balanced budget amendment our colleagues in the House sent us in \nthe last few weeks also said it would take a two-thirds vote to get any \nadditional revenue even though revenue is the lowest it has been in 60 \nyears. They would apply a two-thirds requirement to get more revenue. \nReally? So they would protect with a two-thirds vote requirement every \ntax scam, every offshore tax haven, every abusive tax shelter that is \ncurrently being used by some to avoid and evade the taxes they owe our \ncountry.\n  I have shown this picture on the floor of the Senate many times. This \nis a little building in the Cayman Islands. It is a little five-story \nbuilding that claims to be home to 18,857 companies. They all say this \nis their business headquarters. I have said that is the most efficient \nbuilding in the world. A little five-story building down there, and it \nis the headquarters of 18,000 companies. Anybody believe that? Anybody \nbelieve that 18,000 companies are operating out of that little building \ndown in the Cayman Islands? They are not operating their businesses out \nof there. They are engaged in a giant tax scam to make all the rest of \nus pick up their responsibilities.\n  All of us who pay what we owe are getting stuck by the companies that \nare hiding out in this little building down in the Cayman Islands \navoiding the taxes they owe our country. There are no taxes down in the \nCayman Islands, so they operate out of this little building down there, \nfive-story building, 18,000 companies. They avoid paying the taxes they \nowe and stick all the rest of us with the responsibility. That is not \nright.\n  The constitutional amendment our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives sent us would protect that behind a wall of a two-\nthirds vote, which means we would have an impossible time ever fixing \nthis problem. It is hard to get a 60-percent vote much less two-thirds. \nThey would protect every offshore tax haven, every abusive tax shelter, \nevery unfair tax preference that is in the current code because they \nwould require a two-thirds vote to change it. That flawed amendment is \nnot going to pass the Senate--not now, not later this year, not next \nyear because it, itself, would require a two-thirds vote. It is not \ngoing to happen. So I would say to our colleagues in the other Chamber \nthat sending us a totally partisan approach with a deeply flawed \nconstitutional amendment is not going to work. It is not going to help \nsolve the problem.\n\n  Now is the time for us to join in a serious dialogue about solving \nthe problem--solving the debt threat overhanging the country which will \nrequire not a $1 trillion package as is in the House offering but a $4 \ntrillion package. The occupant of the chair well knows of what I speak. \nHe was Governor of West Virginia. He dealt with a fiscal crisis in his \nState, and he guided his State through that crisis not by operating \njust on one side of the aisle but by working together with people on \nboth sides to come up with solutions, not political slogans.\n  We are way beyond that. We are within days of a default on the debt \nof the United States that would have catastrophic consequences for the \neconomy of our country.\n  It is time. It is time, I say to my colleagues, to come together to \ndo something that can pass--to deal, yes, with the debt limit but also \nto deal with the debt itself. It will be an empty gesture if we just \nextend the debt limit and we don't deal with the debt itself.\n  Our leader, to his credit, has put something together that begins to \ntake ideas from both sides of the aisle to try\n\n[[Page S5039]]\n\nto resolve this crisis. It would save the Nation from an immediate \neconomic crisis. It would provide a significant downpayment on deficit \nreduction--more than $2 trillion--and it would put in place a special \njoint congressional committee, equally divided, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to find additional savings. Also, there is no new revenue \nin this plan. Our friends on the other side have thus far said--at \nleast in the House of Representatives--they can accept no new revenue, \nnone, not a penny. So our leader has said: OK. I don't like that, but \nif that is your line in the sand, for right now we will accept it so we \ncan find a solution both sides can support. So no new revenue, more \nthan $2 trillion of spending cuts, and a special joint committee to \ncome up with a plan to achieve even greater savings. That is a pretty \ngood offer to the other side to say: We hear you. We want to work with \nyou because we need a solution.\n  We are just days away from a true crisis, one that would be self-\ninflicted. I say to my colleagues, let's not go there. Let's come \ntogether. We have shown we can do it in the past. We need to do it \nnow--not with blame, not with finger-pointing, but by saying this is a \ntime to join together, to stand shoulder to shoulder to prevent \nirreparable damage being done to our country.\n  I say to my colleagues: Now is the time, this day, we have to find a \nway to come together.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nlooming August 2 deadline for raising the debt ceiling and making \nreforms, or budget cuts at least, that would allow us to show we are \nnot going to have business as usual in Washington but that we are going \nto raise the debt ceiling with the necessary reforms.\n  Despite the differences in this body, we are all here to share three \nconcerns:\n  First, we do know at this point, because of the time it has taken us \nto cobble together something that could be put through both of our \nHouses and signed by the President, that we have fundamental \ndifferences in the principles of how we should run our government. I \nthink it is very clear that Republicans have stood for no taxes, \nespecially in this economic environment. We believe piling taxes on top \nof the cost of the Obama health care system that is in the process of \nbeing implemented would keep our businesses from hiring people and \ngetting this 9.2-percent unemployment rate down. I think we all agree \nwe need to bring that unemployment rate down, but we have fundamental \ndifferences about what is causing it and how we can solve it.\n  No. 2, we all agree, I believe, or 95 percent of us agree, that we \ncannot default on the debt in our country. I do believe in both Houses \nthe vast majority believe we should not go into default. The costs of a \ndefault are not being considered nearly enough. The costs of a default, \nof interest rates going up, of having to give backpay, having to \ncorrect some of the many issues we will face by having some of the \npeople who are owed money but not paid, and having to pay interest and \nextra interest if we are in default. We cannot allow that to happen. I \nthink we all agree on that.\n  We are all troubled with the delay in resolving this issue. The delay \nI think has been caused for many reasons. Of course, our fundamental \ndifferences are one. But I believe that although Members of Congress \nand leaders in Congress have been talking for a long time, the \nPresident has never put forward a real plan.\n  The Senate majority leader and the House Speaker have put forward \nplans. I believe there is a common ground that can be found between \nthese two proposals. But they are not the same. In fact, I think the \nRepublican leader in the Senate has also put forward a plan, and I \nthink we are seeing the different pieces of the plans that have been \nput forward now starting to come together.\n  I believe the Boehner plan is a good one. I believed in the cut, cap, \nand balance legislation, where you cut spending now to make your \ndownpayment, you cap spending every year for the next 10 years at a \nlevel that brings down the overall deficit, and you send a balanced \nbudget amendment to the States for ratification. I feel so certain if \nwe could pass a balanced budget amendment from this Congress and send \nit to the States, it would be ratified and it would put us on the real \ncourse for fiscal responsibility, the course that would assure that \nSocial Security is sound, that Medicare works, and that our children \nand grandchildren will not inherit a debilitating debt that hurts our \neconomy. So I do believe that cut, cap, and balance legislation was the \nright way forward. But Congress is split. We have a majority of \nDemocrats in the Senate and Republicans in the House. Therefore, we are \nnot going to get everything that any one of us believes is right. \nCertainly we are not going to get the Boehner plan in the Senate. But \nit is the right approach, and we will have to take a few steps at a \ntime and I hope we will be able to come to terms on a way forward with \nthe principles of cutting spending, putting a cap on spending, and not \nraising the debt ceiling any more than the cuts that can be counted.\n  That is what concerns me about the Reid plan. Senator Reid is calling \nfor $2.7 trillion in an increase in the debt ceiling. The purpose, as \nthe President has stated, is to get through the next election in 2012 \nand not deal with this again. But the next election should not be the \nfocus. The focus should be, how do we show that our country is on the \nright track to get this enormous debt whittled down by whittling down \nthe deficits and having sound budget principles.\n  This $2.7 trillion would be the largest debt ceiling increase in the \nhistory of America. The previous largest debt limit increase was $1.9 \ntrillion, which President Obama signed into law in February of last \nyear.\n  This debt ceiling increase in Senator Reid's proposal is not paid \nfor. It offers $1 trillion in cuts for a $2.7 trillion increase. Many \nof those cuts are illusory. They are not cuts that can be counted. To \nsay we are going to label $1 trillion of cuts savings from leaving \nAfghanistan and Iraq is not credible. We don't know what the obstacles \nare going to be in Afghanistan and possibly Iraq. We also don't know \nwhat we might have to do in the Middle East going forward. Afghanistan \nis not settled. We have to have a certain level of stability on the \nground in Afghanistan or we will have wasted the billions we have \nalready spent and the lives of our military personnel in Afghanistan \nbecause it will go back to the way it was before, a center for \nterrorism that will or can come to our country. It did once already. We \nhave been over there to try to wipe out al-Qaida and the Taliban. We \nhave been over there losing American lives and spending American \ntaxpayer dollars to protect our country from another 9/11. To say we \nare going to cut $1 trillion in the future over the next 10 years when \nwe aren't placing the emphasis on what are the conditions on the ground \nis not sound policy, and it is certainly not sound national security \npolicy. So that is illusory.\n  Then the other parts of the cuts that I think are very hard to \ndecipher are cutting waste, fraud, and abuse, which we all want to do, \nbut we don't have the guarantee of those cuts.\n  I think it is important for us to look at the cuts and try to make \nsure that if we are going to raise the debt ceiling, we raise it only \nthe amount of the actual cuts that we can produce.\n  In Majority Leader Reid's legislation there is a joint committee. \nThere is also one in the Boehner bill. In the majority leader's \nlegislation the committee has to report, but its product doesn't have \nto be passed and enacted before the debt ceiling is lifted. That is the \nreal problem in Senator Reid's proposal. The bill would lose its \nexpedited status, and the joint committee would dissolve on January 13, \n2012 under Senator Reid's proposal and then we would still have the \nlifting of the debt ceiling that has already been enacted. That is not \nthe way to go forward.\n  The joint committee proposed in the Boehner plan is forced to produce \nsavings, and the forcing mechanism in this\n\n[[Page S5040]]\n\ncase is the fact that the debt limit can't be increased unless the cuts \nare enacted. So you will keep the governor on the debt increase by \nassuring that there have to be cuts in spending dollar for dollar.\n  Third, there is no balanced budget amendment included in the Reid \nproposal and, in fact, there is no requirement that we even vote on a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I know that it would be very difficult to pass a balanced budget \namendment right now out of Congress, but I do believe it is the best \nthing we could do for the long-term security of our country. So I would \nhope as we come together--because we know the reality here. The Reid \nbill is not going to pass the House and the Boehner bill is probably \nnot going to pass the Senate. So we have got to come together with a \nplan. Maybe it is a short-term plan that has a dollar-for-dollar cut \nalong with the raising of the debt ceiling or maybe we can get more \nafter we dispatch the two bills that are now before the Congress, and \ntry to put something together that has the best parts of both.\n  I could not support the Reid plan as it is today and I do support the \nBoehner plan, but I also know that neither of them is going to pass the \nother House. So I think it is incumbent on us to now go forward and \nlet's quickly start doing the work that could produce results, and that \nis to try to get the best of both of these before the August 2 \ndeadline. I think we have got to be open to what can work that stays \nwithin the principles of no tax increases and no debt ceiling increase \nwithout the same amount of dollars at least to be cut from spending, \nwith real cuts that can be assured. I think the American public is \nlooking not for promises but for the assurance in the law that we will \nnot be able to raise the debt ceiling without some cutting of spending \nand reforms that would equal the amount the debt ceiling has increased. \nWe can go forward with those principles which I think both sides would \nagree to at this final few days we have before that debt ceiling is \nreached. It is time to vote on these bills and then get down to the \nreal work of determining what is the best in both that we can pass in \nboth Houses.\n\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to engage \nin a colloquy with my Republican colleagues for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today as the Nation \nwatches the activities in the Capitol and on Capitol Hill as someone \nfrom the State of Wyoming, where we live within our means and balance \nour budget every year, and as a result we actually have a surplus in \nthe State. Contrast that to what is happening in Washington with an \nincredible debt--$14 trillion--more than people can actually fathom.\n\n  But people understand spending more than they have or more than comes \nin, and families all around the country realize they can't do that. \nWell, in America, as a nation we have been doing that for many years--\nspending money we don't have, sending out more than comes in, to the \npoint we have had to borrow and borrow and borrow and borrow. Each time \nwe borrow too much, which continues to happen, we have to raise the \ndebt ceiling--the amount of money that can be borrowed.\n  The President has now asked that we raise the debt ceiling again, but \nhe has asked that it be raised the largest amount in the history of our \ncountry--in the history of this great land. That has an impact on \npeople and families all around the country. They are concerned because \nthey know they can't spend more than they bring in, they can't spend \nmore than they have.\n  They think back to the days of John Kennedy saying: ``Ask not what \nyour country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,'' \nand people in Wyoming are concerned that it may switch one day to: Ask \nnot what your country can do for you, ask what your country must do for \nChina because last year, of every dollar we spent in this country, 41 \ncents of it was borrowed, half of it from overseas, and a lot of it \nfrom China.\n  So how do we stay a great and strong nation, the leader of the world, \nwhen we owe that kind of money to another country--a country that does \nnot necessarily have our own best interests at heart?\n  That is why as this debate and discussion is going on about the debt \nceiling, the debt limit, people in Wyoming tell me their biggest \nconcern is not the debt limit, it is the debt. The debt is the threat. \nIt is a threat to our own national security. Those aren't just my \nwords; those are the words of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nwho said the greatest threat to our national security is our debt.\n  So I am so pleased to be joined on the floor of the Senate by my \ncolleague from Nebraska, a neighbor, a next-door neighbor, a former \nGovernor of Nebraska, who, as a Governor, lived with a system where he \nhad to balance the budget every year, and the buck stopped with him.\n  So I ask my colleague from Nebraska, a former Cabinet Member who has \nrun a major Cabinet and a department within the U.S. Government, \nperhaps he could share with us what was involved in having to make \nthose tough decisions and actually being held to make those decisions.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I thank the Senator from Wyoming. It is my pleasure to \nbe on the Senate floor with him and to talk about my experience in \ndealing with the reality of a balanced budget amendment.\n  As I said a couple of weeks ago when I spoke on the floor about this \nissue, I heard many come to the floor who said: This is a bad idea. \nThis is bad policy. Some have even gone so far as to describe it as \nalmost kind of a radical approach. I have lived with a balanced budget \namendment. I have to say I did not find it to be a radical approach \nwhatsoever.\n  In the State of Nebraska where I was Governor for 6 years, and \nactually prior to that when I was mayor of the State capital, the \ncommunity of Lincoln, I had to balance the budget. I had no choice \nwhatsoever about that. In fact, in Nebraska, we had an additional \nprovision. Decades and decades ago, when those who wrote the Nebraska \nConstitution started thinking about what kind of State they wanted, I \nthink they wisely realized that at some point the politicians would try \nto hand off or give away the State treasury and promise everything to \neverybody for obvious reasons: to get elected, to get reelected.\n  So in the State constitution they said we can't borrow over $100,000. \nSo we had two requirements. One was that on an annual basis the budget \nhad to be balanced, and the spending could not exceed the revenues. The \nsecond requirement was that we couldn't issue any bonds or debt to \nbalance that budget and, in fact, we go so far as to not have any debt \nwhatsoever, really. We have a few lease-purchase agreements on some \nequipment, but that is it. We don't even have debt for our highways. We \ndon't lay a mile of concrete for a highway if we don't have the money \nto pay for it.\n  So for those who have described this as sort of a radical approach, \nlet me describe to them how this approach has worked in our State.\n  Today in our State, our unemployment rate is 4.1 percent--4.1 \npercent. I will go across the State very soon and do townhall meetings \nin large communities--from the largest, Omaha, to some of our very \nsmallest. I can almost assure my colleagues that one of the comments I \nwill hear in our rural communities where they are working hard to be \nbusiness friendly and grow jobs and opportunities for their residents, \nthey will say to me: One of the challenges we have, Mike, is finding \nthe skill of labor we need to fill the jobs we are creating.\n  I will also share with my colleagues that this experiment--this \nradical approach that some have described--has resulted in a \nlegislative session that ended early this year, that balanced the \nbudget, and did not borrow any money. I will also share with my \ncolleagues that our pensions are funded. There are no stories about \nNebraska pensions are underfunded; that they\n\n[[Page S5041]]\n\nhave been borrowing out of the pensions so someday when somebody \nretires the pension will not be there for them.\n  I will wrap up my comments by drawing the contrast. The contrast with \nthe government that I find here is this: For over 800 days we haven't \nhad a budget. Under the leadership of my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, the Democrats, we have not had a budget for now going on 3 \nyears. We are being asked to approve the largest debt increase in our \nNation's history. That is what this debate is all about.\n  In addition, we are closing in on $15 trillion worth of debt. The \nprojection is that in about 4 or 5 years from now we will owe $20 \ntrillion of debt.\n  My colleague mentioned I was in the Cabinet. When I came to join the \nPresident's Cabinet as the Secretary of Agriculture and I shook the \nLieutenant Governor's hand who has now been the Governor for 8 years--\nhe is now the President of the National Governors Association--I wished \nhim well. I did not have to say to him: I am very sorry about all the \ndebt I have taken on, because there was none. The bills were paid, the \nbudget was balanced, the pensions were funded, the unemployment rate \nwas low, and he has continued that conservative legacy.\n  By comparison, when Barack Obama leaves the Presidency, he will tell \nhis successor: I ran up the largest debt in our Nation's history--\nlarger than any President in front of me. That is the legacy he will \nleave behind for his children and his grandchildren and ours, and that \nis the sobering reality of today's debate.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska. I think about the fact that he had to use honest \nfigures, honest accounting.\n  I see now a proposal by the majority leader that, to me, seems to be \nfull of accounting gimmicks, tricks, things such as using money as \nsavings that was never intended to be spent at all, saying we will save \nall of this money by not being at war in Iraq or Afghanistan for the \nnext 10 years and counting $1 trillion in savings when there was never \neven an intention to spend that in the first place. I don't think \nanyone in this body or on Capitol Hill believes we will be at surge \nlevels for the next 10 years in 2 wars, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  So I ask my colleague from Nebraska--and we are also joined by our \ncolleague from South Dakota--he couldn't have done something like that \nin balancing his budget in Nebraska?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, we would never have done that. Had I \nwalked into the unicameral for my State of the State Address and done \nthings such as are being proposed here today, I literally would have \nbeen run out. The State senators would have looked at the Governor and \nsaid: We need a new Governor. And I think they would have joined in a \nvery bipartisan response to that kind of approach.\n  My colleague is absolutely right. I looked through the proposal, and \nI have to say, in all due respect to the majority leader, this isn't \ngoing to get the support I think he hopes for. It isn't going to \nhappen. It is going to be voted down. It will not go to the finish line \nbecause people just can't support it.\n  This idea that somehow we are going to get a savings because we are \nnot going to be funding the surge levels in Afghanistan, well, no one \nwas going to do that. The President wasn't asking for it. That money \nwas never requested. So to grab that out, as somebody pointed out--and \nI wish I could remember who--in a column today, they said that is like \ntrying to grab a savings based upon the fact that we will not be \ninvading Canada this year.\n  Well, yes, we are not going to invade Canada, but that is not budget \nsavings, and it is not a budget savings to somehow claim we are not \ngoing to fund the Afghanistan war for the next 10 years at surge levels \nbecause that was never anticipated.\n  I want to solve this problem, but we have to be real with the \nAmerican people about how we are solving this problem--with real \nsavings. I know it is painful. My goodness, I have been there. I have \ncut budgets before. I have had to lay off people. But I think we have \nto just be straight with the American people and say this is what it is \ngoing to take to get there.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, my colleague from South Dakota is here, \nand he has been a Member of this body longer than I have. To me, this \ndebt ceiling increase seems to be the largest in history by any \nstandard, whether we include inflation or not. I think the previous \nlargest one was $1.9 trillion, and that was also with this President.\n  So when we think about this President and what he inherited and where \nwe are now, it seems to me--I would ask my colleague from South Dakota \nto respond--it just seems he is making it worse.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I certainly echo what has been said by my \nneighbors, my colleagues from Nebraska and Wyoming. Their States, as \nwell as mine, all have a balanced budget amendment that requires our \nStates to live within our means. Our States do it. They do it the old-\nfashioned way. They do it by--in our case, in the State of South \nDakota, this year--having to make some hard decisions about spending. \nBut they balanced their budget, and they did it without raising taxes, \nwhich I think is a great model for what we ought to be doing in \nWashington, DC.\n  As the Senator from Wyoming has pointed out, this is the largest \nrequested increase in the debt ceiling in history. At $2.4 trillion--\nand, of course, I think we are going to be asked at some point to vote \non the Democratic leader's proposal, which, as both of my colleagues \nhave pointed out, doesn't get us there.\n  If we even use the standard I think everybody realizes makes a lot of \nsense--and that is if we are going to increase the debt limit by $2.4 \ntrillion, we also ought to look at how we reduce spending by $2.4 \ntrillion. That way we are getting a dollar-for-dollar reduction in \nspending, and we are fundamentally addressing the real issue, which \nisn't the debt limit, it is the debt.\n  We all talk about the debt limit, and it is looming, looking us right \nin the eye right now. But the real issue is the fact that year over \nyear over year we continue to spend more than we take in.\n  We are not living within our means. Both Senators have talked about a \nbalanced budget amendment. I was here as a freshman Congressman in \n1997, the last time that was voted on. It was voted on in the Senate. \nIt never made it to the House because it needed a two-thirds vote, and \nit got 66 votes in the Senate. Had it been able to pass here and come \nto the House, I think we would have passed it.\n  I cannot help but think how much better our fiscal situation would be \ntoday had we been able to do that back in 1997, because at that time \nthe overall Federal debt was $5 trillion. Today it is $14 trillion. So \nthere has been a $9 trillion increase in the Federal debt in that short \namount of time.\n  It is important we tackle this issue. It is important we do it in a \nway so the American people know we are serious--that this is not \ngimmicks, this is not smoke and mirrors and all the things that I think \nmake people in this country so cynical about the way Washington, DC, \noperates.\n  As the Senator mentioned, the Reid proposal on the debt limit \nessentially counts over $1 trillion in savings that were never going to \nbe spent in the first place. So it is a gimmick and it is not real. It \nis phony. We all know that.\n  We have to get real. We have to put forward a serious effort if, one, \nwe are going to convince the American people we are serious about this, \nbut, more importantly, if we are going to do something meaningful about \ngetting this spending and debt situation under control.\n  I hope we will be able to defeat that when it comes to the floor and \nactually do something, if we can get the House bill over here, which \nhas not only spending cuts in the near term but also a process whereby \nwe can get some entitlement reform that deals with the big drivers of \nFederal spending; that is, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and \nthen also get a vote on a balanced budget amendment such as all of our \nStates have on the books and which has enabled our States to live \nwithin their means, not spend money they do not have, and continue to, \nin spite of this down economy, perform above the average.\n  I think of all of our States, probably in terms of unemployment, in \nterms of economic performance--if you look at them relative to other \nareas around\n\n[[Page S5042]]\n\nthe country--living within their means. It is a good model if you want \nto have a good, strong economy and create jobs for the people in your \nStates. That is something we ought to be doing at the Federal level, \nand that is why it is so important we take the right approach. The bill \nthat will come over from the House of Representatives does that. The \nbill that has been proposed by the Senate Democratic leader does not.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It is interesting because my colleague from South \nDakota mentioned this figure, this two point some trillion dollars. \nPeople in Wyoming last week said: How do they come up with that number? \nLike the Senator, I agree that for every $1 they want to increase the \ndebt limit, they should say we should find $1 of real savings, honest \nsavings, savings you can point to, as the Senator needed to do as \nGovernor, and as we believe here.\n  That is what the approach they are dealing with in the House does. \nThey have come up with a way to raise the debt ceiling, deal with \navoiding a default, and they extend this for a number of months.\n  People say: Well, how do you get this $2.4 trillion number? The \nPresident had a White House press conference last week, on July 22, and \nhe said--it is astonishing. The President of the United States told the \ncountry:\n\n       The only bottom line that I have is that we have to extend \n     this debt ceiling through the next election, into 2013.\n\n  Not extend the debt ceiling so we can avoid default, not so we can \nfocus on jobs and the economy and the overall debt and the spending, \nbut so that--as he said, his bottom line, the only bottom line, is that \nwe have to extend it beyond the next election.\n  Then the Treasury Secretary was on one of the television shows on \nJuly 24, and he said:\n\n       Most important, we have to lift this threat of default . . \n     . for the next 18 months. We have to take that threat off the \n     table through the election. . . .\n\n  This debt is the threat. This debt of nearly $15 trillion, going to \nover $20 trillion in the next couple years, to me is the threat. The \nelections can take care of themselves. I think the American people will \nbe shocked, astonished, and disappointed to hear that is the \nPresident's only bottom line.\n  I do not know what the Senator's comments or thoughts are on that, \nbut I am expecting better.\n  Mr. THUNE. If you think about what this debate ought to be about, it \nought to be about America's economic security. It ought to be about \nmaking sure we are putting the country on a sustainable fiscal path and \ncreating the conditions for economic growth, and I would argue there is \na direct correlation between those two. If we do not get spending and \ndebt under control, I think we are going to bankrupt the country, we \nare going to increase interest rates, we are going to make it more \ndifficult and more expensive for businesses in this country to create \njobs. So clearly there is a direct correlation between the issue of \nspending and debt and the economy. But the economy and the implications \nof what we do here on the economy ought to animate everything we do. We \nought to be thinking about: How is this going to impact the economy? We \nshould not be thinking about politics. That is why it was disturbing to \nhear the President say his prerequisite in all this is that we get \nthrough the next election. To me, that was a statement that was \nprofoundly about politics and certainly not about America's economic \nsecurity, which ought to be first and foremost in our minds.\n  Subsequent to that, even yesterday, you had members of the \nPresident's team suggesting this might somehow disrupt the Christmas \nvacation. I thought: You know, of all the things we ought to be \nthinking about right now, the next election, the next holiday--those \nprobably are not going to be consequential if we do not take steps to \naddress the issue before us today; that is, this massive increase in \nour Federal debt, the year-over-year deficits we continue to run, the \nfact that we continue to live way outside of our means. That is what I \nthink the American people want to see us focused on. I think that is \nwhat the people of South Dakota certainly want to see us focused on as \nwell.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. That is exactly what the people of Nebraska want to see \nus focused on.\n  The debate that is occurring now absolutely is one of the most \nimportant debates we have had literally in the history of this country. \nIt was encapsulized in a statement in a column today that I read from a \nman I have a lot of respect for, Charles Krauthammer. He said this \nabout this debate. He said:\n\n       We're in the midst of a great four-year national debate on \n     the size and reach of government, the future of the welfare \n     state, indeed, the nature of the social contract between \n     citizen and state. The distinctive visions of the two \n     parties--social-democratic vs. limited-government--have \n     underlain every debate on every issue since Barack Obama's \n     inauguration: the stimulus, the auto bailouts, health-care \n     reform, financial regulation, deficit spending. Everything. \n     The debt ceiling is but the latest focus of this fundamental \n     divide.\n\n  He could not be more right. This is a debate that must occur, as \nuncomfortable as it may be. Think of where we have been as a nation in \nthe last year and a half. Literally, when the President came to office, \nthe first thing he wanted us to do was to pass a trillion-dollar \nstimulus plan, if you factor in the interest that was going to be paid, \non promises that it was going to fix the economy and employ people, \nthat unemployment would not go over 8 percent.\n  What happened? Unemployment shot beyond that. Today we see the growth \nof our economy is literally pitiful. There is no way this economic \ngrowth can deal with employing more people.\n  Then what was the next thing? A health care bill that, quite \nhonestly, the vast majority of Americans did not want. And by the day, \nstory after story, analysis after analysis comes out and says all the \npromises made during this health care debate by the President and the \nDemocrats will not be fulfilled. There was a story yesterday that this \nis not going to bring health care costs down. This increases health \ncare costs, and it is one thing after another thing after another \nthing.\n  The American people spoke loudly and clearly in November. They said: \nGet the fiscal condition of the United States under control. I will say \nthis. I do not think anybody is expecting miracles. It took us decades \nto get in this position. It is going to take concerted, conservative \neffort to get out of this position over a period of time. But it is on \ndebates such as this where this must start. It is on debates such as \nthis where we must force this government to be smaller, to be more \nefficient; otherwise, the legacy we leave behind for our children and \nour grandchildren is $20 trillion of debt in 4 more short years. They \nwill have their own wars to fight. I wish they would be free of war. \nBut they will have their own wars to fight, their own flu pandemics to \ndeal with, their own items on their agenda--education or health care, \nwhatever, that they want to improve--and where will they begin? They \nwill begin with a $20 trillion debt in 4 years. That, as a nation, \nshould be unacceptable to us. That is why we need to do everything we \ncan at every stage to turn this around and start this Nation on the \nright course.\n  Mr. THUNE. I also had the opportunity to read the very column the \nSenator from Nebraska is referring to, the Krauthammer column this \nmorning, and I was struck by many of the same things the Senator \nobserved. I think it is important to note that we are a nation \nhistorically that has believed in a limited role for the government. \nThat is what distinguishes us in many respects from some of our \nEuropean allies. I think what this debate on the debt limit does, with \nthe broader debates we need to be having here about spending and debt \nand budgets--that is, if we ever had a debate on a budget. As the \nSenator said, we have not had now a budget in 821 days. April 29, 2009, \nwas the last time this Senate passed a budget. So it is hard to talk \nabout these big issues we need to be focused on when you do not even \nget a budget on the floor of the Senate to have an opportunity to \ndebate and vote upon.\n  In fact, when you think about the fact that we spend $3.7 trillion \nannually of the American people's tax money, you would think you would \nhave some idea, some blueprint, some path of how you are going to spend \nthat. Yet we have not had that here. So we have not had an opportunity \nto debate that budget.\n\n[[Page S5043]]\n\n  But this does get at the heart of a very big philosophical \ndifference. Our friends on the other side of the aisle have a view of \ngovernment that is much more expansive, which is why I think they can \nexplain passing the multitrillion dollar health care bill a year ago \nand the trillion dollar stimulus bill and the new CLASS Act, which is \ngoing to be another entitlement program that will end up running huge \ndeficits into the future.\n  I do not think that is what the American people have as a vision for \nthis country. I think we need to get back to a role, a size for our \ngovernment that is consistent with the historical average, the \nhistorical norm. It might surprise some of my colleagues to know, if \nyou go back to the formative stages of our Nation's history, in the \nyear 1800, we only spent 2 percent of our GDP on our government--2 \npercent. This year, we are going to spend over 24 percent. Arguably, \nlife has gotten a lot more complicated. There is a lot more going on in \nthis country, and certainly there is a responsibility that government \nhas. But we have gotten away from the concept that I think is the \nfoundation of this great country; that was a belief in a limited role \nfor the Federal Government, not this expansive, sort of Western \nEuropean social democracy type approach which the Senator from Nebraska \nalluded to.\n  I certainly think the people in my State of South Dakota, and I would \nargue in Wyoming and Nebraska, as I said before, have a history and a \ntradition and a heritage of living within their means. Also, I think \nthey have an understanding of what government should and should not do. \nI certainly believe the people whom I represent want us to get back to \nthat. And it starts here. It starts now. It starts by getting spending \nunder control, by putting Federal spending on a downward trajectory \ninstead of this consistent incline we have seen. In the last 2 years, \nwe have seen non-national security discretionary spending increase by \nover 24 percent. If you add the stimulus spending in there, it was 84 \npercent. That is how much spending has increased in the last 2 years of \nthis administration.\n  That has to stop. I think the American people sent a loud, clear \nmessage in November of last year, and it is incumbent upon us to have \nlistened to that message and to do everything we can to get this train \nturned around. I think we are going to have a big fight over that \nbecause the other side believes the way you fix this debt crisis is to \nincrease your revenues, to raise taxes, which would be a huge mistake, \nparticularly now in the middle of an economic downturn.\n  It starts by getting spending under control. It starts by keeping tax \nrates and regulations low on our job creators in this country, and \ncreating conditions that are favorable to economic growth and job \ncreation, as opposed to what we are seeing now, which is more and more \nregulation, higher taxes, more mandates--all the things that make it \nmore difficult for our job creators to do what they do the best; that \nis, to get people in this country back to work.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the column that has been referred to, the Charles \nKrauthammer column from this morning's Washington Post called ``The \nGreat Divide.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 29, 2011]\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n                            The Great Divide\n\n       We're in the midst of a great four-year national debate on \n     the size and reach of government, the future of the welfare \n     state, indeed, the nature of the social contract between \n     citizen and state. The distinctive visions of the two \n     parties--social-democratic vs. limited-government--have \n     underlain every debate on every issue since Barack Obama's \n     inauguration: the stimulus, the auto bailouts, health-care \n     reform, financial regulation, deficit spending. Everything. \n     The debt ceiling is but the latest focus of this fundamental \n     divide.\n       The sausage-making may be unsightly, but the problem is not \n     that Washington is broken, that ridiculous ubiquitous cliche. \n     The problem is that these two visions are in competition, and \n     the definitive popular verdict has not yet been rendered.\n       We're only at the midpoint Obama won a great victory in \n     2008 that he took as a mandate to transform America toward \n     European-style social democracy The subsequent \n     counterrevolution delivered to that project a staggering \n     rebuke in November 2010. Under our incremental system, \n     however, a rebuke delivered is not a mandate conferred. That \n     waits definitive resolution, the rubber match of November \n     2012.\n       I have every sympathy with the conservative \n     counterrevolutionaries. Their containment of the Obama \n     experiment has been remarkable. But reversal--roll-back, in \n     Cold War parlance--is simply not achievable until \n     conservatives receive a mandate to govern from the White \n     House.\n       Lincoln is reputed to have said: I hope to have God on my \n     side, but I must have Kentucky. I don't know whether \n     conservatives have God on their side (I keep getting sent to \n     His voice mail), but I do know that they don't have \n     Kentucky--they don't have the Senate, they don't have the \n     White House. And under our constitutional system, you cannot \n     govern from one house alone. Today's resurgent conservatism, \n     with its fidelity to constitutionalism, should be \n     particularly attuned to this constraint; imposed as it is by \n     a system of deliberately separated--and mutually limiting--\n     powers.\n       Given this reality, trying to force the issue--turn a \n     blocking minority into a governing authority--is not just \n     counter-constitutional in spirit but self-destructive in \n     practice.\n       Consider the Boehner Plan for debt reduction. The Heritage \n     Foundation's advocacy arm calls it ``regrettably \n     insufficient.'' Of course it is. That's what happens when you \n     control only half a branch. But the plan's achievements \n     are significant. It is all cuts, no taxes. It establishes \n     the precedent that debt-ceiling increases must be \n     accompanied by equal spending cuts. And it provides half a \n     year to both negotiate more fundamental reform (tax and \n     entitlement) and keep the issue of debt reduction \n     constantly in the public eye.\n       I am somewhat biased about the Boehner Plan because for \n     weeks I've been arguing (in this column and elsewhere) for \n     precisely such a solution: a two-stage debt-ceiling hike \n     consisting of a half-year extension with dollar-for-dollar \n     spending cuts, followed by intensive negotiations on \n     entitlement and tax reform. It's clean. It's understandable. \n     It's veto-proof. (Obama won't dare.) The Republican House \n     should have passed it weeks ago.\n       After all, what is the alternative? The Reid Plan with its \n     purported $2 trillion of debt reduction? More than half of \n     that comes from not continuing surge-level spending in Iraq \n     and Afghanistan for the next 10 years. Ten years? We're out \n     of Iraq in 150 days. It's all a preposterous ``saving'' from \n     an entirely fictional expenditure.\n       The Congressional Budget Office has found that Harry Reid's \n     other discretionary savings were overestimated by $400 \n     billion. Not to worry, I am told. Reid has completely plugged \n     that gap. There will be no invasion of Canada next year (a \n     bicentennial this-time-we're-serious 1812 do-over). Huge \n     savings. Huge.\n       The Obama Plan? There is no Obama plan. And the McConnell \n     Plan, a final resort that punts the debt issue to Election \n     Day, would likely yield no cuts at all.\n       Obama faces two massive problems--jobs and debt. They're \n     both the result of his spectacularly failed Keynesian gamble: \n     massive spending that left us a stagnant economy with high \n     and chronic unemployment--and a staggering debt burden. Obama \n     is desperate to share ownership of this failure. Economic \n     dislocation from a debt-ceiling crisis nicely serves that \n     purpose--if the Republicans play along. The perfect out: \n     Those crazy Tea Partyers ruined the recovery!\n       Why would any conservative collaborate with that ploy? \n     November 2012 constitutes the new conservatism's one chance \n     to restructure government and change the ideological course \n     of the country. Why risk forfeiting that outcome by offering \n     to share ownership of Obama's wreckage?\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I wanted to do that because I also want to have printed \nin the Record--and I will read just a couple of paragraphs--a letter \nthat appeared in today's Casper Star Tribune by Eric Mitchell. It is \ntitled ``Smarter than you think.'' He says:\n\n       I think they think I'm not so smart because I'm too young \n     to know what they're doing, like raising the national debt. \n     Don't they know that I owe the country about $45,000? I'm \n     only 10 years old. I could buy a lot with $45,000. I could \n     almost buy a home, I could buy property, I could buy a boat \n     and get fish for family and friends.\n\n  He is from Crowheart, WY, a small community.\n  He said:\n\n       I would buy guns and ammunition to hunt for food for my \n     family. I could buy books so I could learn more. Forty-five \n     thousand dollars could buy a lot of stuff. That's more than \n     may dad earns. But it wouldn't buy everything.\n\n  This is a 10-year-old. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S5044]]\n\n\n       Government shouldn't try to buy everything. It is my job \n     and the people's job to buy the things we need. I don't want \n     the government to think for me. They don't know that I'm a \n     little brother who doesn't like it when my big brothers tell \n     me what to do, because they aren't always responsible for \n     their own things. I don't tell my brothers what to do with \n     their money. I'm smarter than they think I am. They should \n     follow the rules.\n\n  Here you have a youngster in Wyoming who knows of values, who is \nraised in a family where they live within their means, lives in a State \nwhere we balance our budget every year, and I think the lesson Eric has \nfor the people of Wyoming and the people of this country is one we \nshould listen to: We should live within our means, not spend more than \nwe have, not continue to borrow. And the threat to our Nation, our \ngreatest threat to our national security continues to be the debt, and \nit is incumbent upon this institution to deal with that.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Casper Star Tribune, July 29, 2011]\n\n                         Smarter Than You Think\n\n                           (By Eric Mitchell)\n\n       What does the government think of me?\n       Money.

Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that has \nbeen cleared by the Republican leader. I ask unanimous consent that \nmorning business be extended until 6 p.m., with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each during that period of time; further, \nthat at 6 p.m. I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for whatever time I shall consume as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there is a simple reason we are all \ntalking about the debt limit increase. It is the fact that this \nPresident has spent more money than I ever believed would be possible. \nSo far, he has spent over $10 trillion in 3 years, and next year, if he \nhas his way, he will spend another $3.5 trillion.\n  I remember so well back during the Clinton administration--I think it \nwas 1995--I was outraged. I came down to this podium. I said: Can you \nbelieve a President has a budget of $1.5 trillion? And this President \nhas spent $10 trillion in this short period. If he had not spent all of \nthis money, then we would not be here talking about a debt limit \nincrease right now. I hate to sound so partisan about it, but it is \ntruly a partisan issue.\n  The Democrats have supported his spending, and the Republicans have \nnot. The Boehner plan we are going to vote on--they are going to vote \nin the House today, and I think we may have an opportunity to vote here \nlater on tonight--may not be perfect. None of the stuff around here is \nperfect. But it is good. It has dramatically improved over the last 12 \nhours. It allows the debt limit increase but only after we \nsignificantly cut spending. Never before have we tied--in the history \nof this country--a debt limit increase to spending cuts, but it is \nsomething we have to do now that we are so far into this mess.\n  The first step to this plan cuts spending by over $900 billion in \nexchange for a $900 billion increase in the debt limit. That will last \nthe President until around February. I think it is a fair deal. I would \nlike to cut the spending more, but we can only do so much when we only \ncontrol the House.\n  The second step of this plan is also good. It establishes a mechanism \nto quickly consider $1.8 trillion in additional spending cuts between \nnow and the end of the year.\n  It also requires Congress to pass a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution and send to it the States for ratification. This is \nsomething that just happened in the last 12 hours. People were talking \nabout, well, do we really want to do something? A balanced budget \namendment is the only way it is going to be good for now and for the \nfuture.\n  We have been talking about this for many years. I remember so well, \nway back in the 1970s, I was in the State Senate in Oklahoma when Carl \nCurtis, a very wonderful gentleman from Nebraska--he was a Senator, had \nbeen a Senator for quite some time. He was the perennial author of the \nbalanced budget amendment, but he never could get it through. He had an \nidea. He came to me in the State of Oklahoma and he said: You know, \nInhofe, we have been trying to get this balanced budget amendment for a \nlong time, and they excuse they use is, you are never going to get the \nrequired number of States to ratify it.\n  He said: I have come up with an idea. We will get three-fourths of \nthe States to preratify a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  Well, that is kind of ingenious.\n  He said: Why don't you be the first State?\n  So I did. We passed, by resolution in my State of Oklahoma, in 1975 I \nbelieve it was, a ratification of a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution that did not exist. That is kind of neat. We actually got \nup to almost three-fourths of the States, and some of the other forces \nknocked it down. But that is how long we have been doing this.\n  But in the intervening years, there hasn't been 1 year where we have \ntalked about a balanced budget amendment that it has not come up for \ndiscussion. Well, this is probably the first time it is a possibility \nbecause we have never been in the spending situation we are in right \nnow--as I said, $10 trillion just 3 years.\n  So right now, we have added that in the last 12 hours. If that \nlegislation passes, the President will get an additional debt limit \nincrease. So we are tying it to behavioral patterns in spending and \nausterity. That is a smart way to do it.\n  This proposal would keep the debt limit and the spending debate at \nthe forefront of the national conversation. We must have this \nconversation. If we do not, we will be worrying about things a lot \nworse than an increase in the debt limit. The President wants nothing \nto do with it. He just wants a blank check to increase the debt so he \ncan continue to raise the deficit. Why do I think this? Well, if we \nundid all of his policies today, the policies that so rapidly increased \nspending and are killing our economy, then we would not need a debt \nlimit increase.\n  The President's spending addiction is the only reason we are here \ntalking about a debt limit increase. This is unilateral. This is the \nPresident--his budget. It is not a group of people, it is him. A lot of \npeople are asking: Does anyone in Washington really care? One guy \ndoesn't--the President of the United States. His actions are what we \nare talking about today. We are looking at failed policies.\n  Referring to the chart, first is ObamaCare. We are talking right now \nabout trying to get something like $800 billion in these negotiations \nso we can increase the debt limit. In one fell swoop, ObamaCare was \n$1.5 trillion. This plan costs over the current decade, when fully \nimplemented--the 10-year cost nearly doubles to $2.5 trillion. This law \ndramatically expands government's influence in the health care sector, \nand together with Medicare and Medicaid, it will result in the \nfinancial ruin of this great country.\n  Second, we have the failed stimulus plan. We all know it didn't meet \nany of\n\n[[Page S5045]]\n\nPresident Obama's expectations. It met all of mine because I didn't \nexpect much. It didn't help the economy. It expanded the size of \ngovernment. Even though we were opposed to it--I am among the most \nconservative Members, and Senator Boxer is a very proud liberal. She \nand I together tried to have an amendment to take some of the $800 \nbillion and put a large amount into infrastructure.\n  Right now, we have to have roads and highways and bridges. We are \nsupposed to do that here. Of course, they didn't do it. Only 3 percent \nof the $800 billion went for that type of infrastructure. Over $1 \ntrillion of this amount, once you add in the costs, that is how we get \nup to $1 trillion, the cost of interest we have to pay for extra \nspending. That is a total of $2.5 trillion.\n  So we have the stimulus of $1 trillion and ObamaCare of $1.5 \ntrillion. Then there is the President's relentless pursuit for \nregulation. Whatever the President hasn't been able to do \nlegislatively, he is attempting to do through regulation--most of it \nthrough the EPA. Cap and trade is a good example. We have debated that \nsince the Kyoto Treaty was up. Clearly, the votes are not there. Right \nnow, in this Chamber, we would not get 25 votes for cap and trade. Yet \neverybody is talking about how it is important to have cap and trade. \nNow he is trying to do it through regulation. That alone would cost the \nAmerican people $300 trillion to $400 trillion a year--not just one \nshot; that is a year.\n  There is the boiler MACT legislation, which is maximum attainable \ncontrolled technology. In other words, what can we do? What do we have \nthe technology to do to stop emissions? We don't have it. But he has \nthat, and that was billions of dollars a year.\n  Ozone regulations: He was going to announce this week a tightening of \nthe ozone regulations that would put 608 of our counties in America out \nof attainment. I am from Oklahoma, and it would put 15 of our counties \nout of attainment. They cannot recruit industry in those counties, and \nthey cannot hire people, and many will have to go out of business \nbecause of the ozone regulations. It is not, in my opinion, legal the \nway he is doing it because he is supposed to address it every 5 years. \nIt was done in 2008 on new technology, which is a requirement. Today, \nhe is trying to do it using the same 2008 technology. Again, it is \nextremely expensive. That casts a tremendous cloud of uncertainty over \nthe business sector, and that is a key reason they announced today that \nthe economy is growing at 1.3 percent a year. That is terrible, \nespecially when we consider the recession we are in.\n  As a general rule, economies recover rapidly when coming off of a \nfinancial recession. It is not unusual for countries to grow at 4, 5, 6 \npercent for the years following a recession. But we can't even get \naround 2 percent. That has a huge negative effect on the economy and \nthe government. The President's regulatory agenda is the reason our \nunemployment rate is above 9 percent, and it is the reason our economy \nis growing so slowly. Because of this, our tax receipts are way off \ntheir historic levels. If we can get the economy to grow faster at a \nsustained period of time, the effect on tax revenues is unbelievable. \nThis is pretty well accepted. I always said that every 1 percent \nincrease in the economy equals about $50 million in new revenue. That \nis the way to grow revenue.\n  Certainly, President Kennedy knew it, President Reagan knew it, and \nso the best way to increase revenue and get the economy moving again \nis, of course, to increase growth. If the economy grows at a rate that \nis 1 percent faster than presently forecast for the next decade, \nFederal tax revenues will grow by $3 trillion.\n  I conservatively estimate that the cost to Federal revenues of the \nPresident's regulatory agenda has been $1 trillion. So we have, through \nhis regulatory behavior, another $1 trillion. That brings our total to \n$3.5 trillion.\n  Then in there is an increase in nonsecurity discretionary spending, \nwhich has added up to $500 billion in spending.\n  There is the expanded and increased spending on unemployment \nbenefits, which is also a consequence of his regulatory policies that \nhave killed the economic recovery, and the cost of that is another $500 \nbillion.\n  Together, all these failed policies add up to a $4.5 trillion \ncontribution to the Federal deficit.\n  Since Inauguration Day, the debt has increased by $3.7 trillion. It \nis on pace to increase by more than $5 trillion by the end of the \nPresident's first term. If we undid all of these failed policies, we \nwould not find ourselves in the situation we are in today. We would not \nbe debating this because it would not be necessary. It is because of \nthe President that we are even talking about raising the debt ceiling. \nIf we could undo the President's policies, we would not need to raise \nthe debt ceiling at all.\n  Where is the President? He has been totally absent from this entire \ndebt conversation. Today, he is meeting with terrorists from Cote \nd'Ivoire, and he is probably going to play golf in the afternoon--I \ndon't know. But he is not participating. He doesn't seem to care about \ndebating the debt ceiling. He wants to raise the deficit. If he did \ncare, he would see the need for the Boehner plan, endorse it, and sign \nit into law. I guess that is too much to ask.\n  We are going to have a chance to do that tonight. They are going to \nhave a vote in the House around 6 o'clock on the Boehner plan, and it \nwill come over here, and we will have an opportunity to do that. If the \nDemocrats support us--a handful of them--we will be able to get that \npassed. We will wait until tonight to see what happens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5045-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5045-S5046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HOUSE MEETING\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there is a terrorist visiting with the \nPresident right now. I will elaborate. So many people are looking the \nother way and don't know what is going on in Africa. I have been on \nthis floor nine different times talking about the atrocities that have \nbeen committed in Cote d'Ivoire.\n  They had a President there named Laurent Gbagbo. He and his wife are \ngreat people, friends of this country. An election took place, and I \nstood here and showed how it was fraudulent, and the guy who won is \nnamed Alassane Ouattara.\n  Right now, as we speak, at this very moment, President Obama is \nmeeting with the rebel leader and potential war criminal Alassane \nOuattara in our Nation's Oval Office. This is an unwise and grossly \nmisguided decision on behalf of President Obama. It is, in fact, an \noutrage that our President would welcome with open arms a man who is \nresponsible for the deaths of at least 3,000 people and the \ndisplacement of a half million refugees in Cote d'Ivoire.\n  Ouattara is an illegitimate usurper who has scandalized Cote \nd'Ivoire's electoral system and wrongfully ousted democratic incumbent \nLaurent Gbagbo.\n  Beginning late last year, Ouattara fraudulently won Cote d'Ivoire's \nPresidential election, and after Gbagbo revealed the fraud he led a \nrebel army that violently overthrew the Gbagbo government, with the \nsupport of the French military, which wrongly intervened in this former \nFrench colony.\n  This is a picture that depicts one of Ouattara's death squads \nmurdering, maiming, raping. This is happening as we speak.\n  Who is in the President's office? Alassane Ouattara. As a result, \nAmnesty International reported on July 28 that half a million Ivorians \nare displaced in postelection violence and are prevented from returning \nhome because of a ``climate of fear'' that continues to reign in this \ncountry. Amnesty International specifically singles out Ouattara's \nsecurity forces and his state-sponsored militia composed of Dozos--they \nare called--who continue to target pro-Gbagbo ethnic groups.\n  Dozos, traditional hunters, are a mercenary group that both Amnesty \nInternational and the International Committee of the Red Cross blame \nfor carrying out a massacre in April of at least 220 people in the \nwestern town of Duekoue.\n  Here they are in this photo. You can see the charred bodies of those \nmurdered by Ouattara, who is in the President's office right now. There \nare executions going on. There is a photo of a person who was burned \nand beaten on the back--from the political opposition. That is what is \nhappening today.\n  Amnesty International alleges that these forces under Ouattara's \ncommand are continuing to engage in ``documented crimes under \ninternational law and human rights violations and\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\nabuses, including extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, \nrape, and other sexual violence, torture, other ill treatment and \narbitrary arrest and detention, as well as the consequences of a high \nlevel of displacement, pervasive insecurity, and intentional \ndestruction of homes and other buildings not justified by military \nsuccess.''\n  They are talking about this. We can see that this person was being \ntortured. This photo is of someone from the cabinet--the Gbagbo \ncabinet. He tried to make a statement--Ouattara said he is trying to \nkeep some of those people, but here he is in the middle of killing him. \nHe died after this. Here they are executing another person they found \nas a Gbagbo supporter.\n  This is happening today as we speak. Ouattara's bloodletting seems \nunabated, and he doesn't seem to be interested in restraining his \nforces from eliminating perceived pro-Gbagbo supporters. He does not \ndeserve an invitation to our White House or an audience with the \nPresident in the Oval Office.\n  Instead of participating in our Nation's debt crisis, President Obama \nis meeting with this killer and human rights abuser. Even today, while \nOuattara is in the President's office, his death squads are roaming the \nstreets of Abijan. It is an outrage, and maybe now we understand where \nsome of the priorities are.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lieberman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5046-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5046-S5049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, too many Ohioans are struggling--as \nare people all over the Nation--in this economy. They are watching \nWashington with disgust as some politicians are risking economic \ncatastrophe. The House of Representatives continues to waste time as \nour Nation stands just 4 days away from a catastrophic default. Instead \nof working with us on a bipartisan basis in the Senate on a compromise \nmeasure to prevent a crisis, House Republicans are cutting closed-door \ndeals to find votes on a bill that has no chance of becoming law. We \nare simply running out of time for these kinds of games.\n  Only a bipartisan bill coming out of the Senate, negotiated with \nRepublican Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader Reid, provides hope \nfor a way out of this impasse. As the majority leader moves forward, I \nask my Republican colleagues across the aisle to proceed with its work \nand not delay the resolution with filibusters and procedural tricks.\n  In the spirit of compromise, Majority Leader Reid has come forth with \na plan to reduce the deficit by $2.2 trillion. It is truly a compromise \nbecause it meets the Republicans' main criteria. It incorporates some \nof Senator McConnell's language. It contains spending cuts to roughly \nmatch the debt ceiling increase through 2012--the spending cuts in the \nReid plan are ones Republicans had previously agreed to and, in many \ncases, advanced--and it contains no revenue increases, all criteria and \ndemands from overwhelming numbers of Senate Republicans.\n  The majority leader's plan is not perfect. It is not the balanced \napproach I hoped it would be. But most importantly, right now, it \nprevents a default, it reduces the deficit--a critical imperative for \nour children and grandchildren--and it protects Medicare and Social \nSecurity and Medicaid.\n  My office is being swamped with calls and e-mails from Ohioans who \ncannot believe we are so close to default. I can't either. Let me read \na couple letters from Ohio voters. Both of these individuals self-\nidentify as Republicans when they write to me. The first one is from \nRepresentative Marcy Kaptur's district, which is in northern Ohio, \nalong the lake. He says:\n\n       I am a 40-plus-year-old Republican who has tried to work to \n     eliminate the tax money we use that is now paid to oil and \n     gas companies as tax subsidies. I don't like my tax money \n     being given to these companies with Senators' blessings. I \n     would like to ask both of you--\n\n  He sends this, apparently, to myself and my colleague, Senator \nPortman--\n\n     to support a balanced approach being proposed by the \n     President and put debt and deficit to bed until an election \n     can be held and the American people can determine who should \n     be in Congress. We should have listened to Ronald Reagan when \n     he said this should not have been undertaken.\n\n  Meaning the debt limit issue.\n\n       The debt limit is on past bills and should not be raised \n     and not be used as a political volleyball and upset our \n     financial institutions.\n\n  Another letter writer--again, a Republican--says:\n\n       I did not vote for our current President, but I have to \n     side with him on the debt ceiling issues. I am exhausted by \n     the political bickering that goes on in Washington. Quit the \n     child-like fighting and get this thing done. The American \n     people are tired of it all.\n\n  A default would risk what amounts to a permanent tax hike on all \nAmericans. Interest rates could rise for anyone applying for a home \nmortgage, a car loan or a college loan. Credit costs for all borrowers \nwould climb. Governments at every level, businesses, not for profits, \nhomeowners, credit card holders, even several States have already been \nplaced on a credit watch. Every State would be hurt by a Federal \ndefault, which is why Governors of both parties are calling for a deal.\n  There could be repercussions for pension funds and money market funds \nthat guard the retirement savings of middle-class families. A default \non our obligations would be a knockout blow to the financial security \nof the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System. These are public \nemployees who have spent their lives working in Ohio's courts and \nschools and many other public positions in local and State government. \nThat is why the Director of OPERS--the Ohio Public Employees Retirement \nSystem--sent a letter with nine of her colleagues pleading:\n\n       America is now a debtor nation and must show the world the \n     nation's word is its bond. It is critical that the debt \n     ceiling be raised to avoid a default.\n\n  The Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, obviously, represents \nRepublicans and Democrats alike.\n  As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, I heard Chairman Ben \nBernanke, a Republican appointee, speak in March, and he said default \nwould be ``an extremely dangerous and very likely recovering-ending \nevent.''\n  Just today, several mayors of Ohio's large- and medium- sized \ncities--for example, the cities of Hillsboro, South Euclid, \nChillicothe, North Royalton, Lancaster, Akron, Middletown, Shaker \nHeights, Reynoldsburg, Dayton, Steubenville, Solon, Newark, Fairfield, \nand other cities, Republicans and Democrats alike--wrote:\n\n       As Mayors, we rely on the partnership of the federal \n     government to help us create jobs and grow our communities. \n     Uncertainty surrounding the federal budget puts key programs \n     like Community Development Block Grants and Community \n     Oriented Policing Services in jeopardy. Job-creating \n     infrastructure projects would come to a halt without the full \n     support of our federal partners. Inaction on the debt ceiling \n     threatens programs like Social Security that our citizens \n     rely on to survive.\n\n  I have heard the Presiding Officer--in a meeting today, in fact--talk \npassionately about the uncertainty this would inject into our economy--\nto follow the House lead--and do this again in 6 months and the \nirresponsibility of that proposal. As difficult as this has been for \npeople on all sides and the contentiousness and anger, it doesn't \nmatter whether we are angry or it is contentious around here, but what \ndoes matter is the message it sends to main street--Main Street \nConnecticut, Main Street Hartford, Main Street Columbus, Main Street \nNew Haven and Toledo. When businesses are thinking about expansion, \nwhen they are thinking about taking a loan out or thinking about \nborrowing money, they are not going to do it when we are in the midst \nof a financial crisis such as we are in now. If we were going to do \nthis again in 6 months, you can bet we would have the same kind of \ndivisions, the same kind of arguments.\n  The assistant majority leader told the story today about a Chicago \nbusinessperson who is terrified of this and what would happen if we \ndidn't raise the debt ceiling, if we went into default; what might \nhappen 6 months from now if we went through it again.\n  So the responsible position is for this body, on a bipartisan basis, \nto work on\n\n[[Page S5047]]\n\nthe McConnell-Reid plan, to pass this, send it to the House of \nRepresentatives, and for them to pass it. We can then focus on job \ncreation and on deficit reduction, but we will have moved forward \ntogether in a way that we have not for far too long a period of time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Of course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There have been Members of the Senate and House who have \ngone before the cameras and come to the floor in each of those bodies \nand argued that defaulting on the national debt is really not a big \ndeal, although we have never done that one time in our history--we had \none technical default for a few days but never really defaulted on our \ndebt one time in our history.\n  I ask the Senator from Ohio, in the response he is getting back from \nOhio and I am getting back from Illinois from people who are genuinely \nconcerned about a default on the national debt, I wonder if he has been \nhearing from Social Security recipients who are asking whether they \nwill be receiving their checks after August 2 if we default on their \ndebt. I wonder if he is getting calls from disabled veterans whom we \npromised to stand by the rest of their lives who receive monthly checks \nfor their medical care and other things. Has he heard from small \nbusiness leaders in Ohio, as I have in Illinois, who are suggesting \nthat an increase in interest rates at this moment in time is exactly \nwrong when it comes to job creation?\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Ohio, when one of our colleagues \nfrom Pennsylvania comes to the floor and says defaulting on the \nnational debt can be easily managed and no one will notice--I would \nlike to ask the Senator from Ohio whether that is his impression.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. That is surely not my impression. I appreciate the \ncomments from the assistant majority leader from Illinois.\n  I listen to the words, as I have read, that Ronald Reagan said. The \ndebt limit was raised 18 times in the 8 years of the Reagan \nadministration, and each time it was, there were people who didn't like \ndoing it. Nobody likes to vote for that. But there was never this: \nlet's go up to the edge and take a chance. President Reagan always \npreached--as Presidents have since in both parties--that this is not a \nrisk we can take, and I know this.\n  I hear from Social Security beneficiaries, I hear from veterans, I \nhear from small businesspeople, and I hear from contractors around \nWright-Patterson Air Force Base that they don't think we should take \nthis risk, that they are--some use the word ``terrified'' getting this \nclose to default, and most can't really believe we are this close. I \ncan't, either.\n  The Senator from Illinois and I have talked about this many times \nover the last few months, that we figured there would not be these \nlines in the sand and this belief that it doesn't matter if we default \nand we would get to a solution. But we haven't been able to.\n  But no responsible people in elected office that I can think of in \nthe last 30 or 40 years have wanted to go this close to default and \nplay chicken and just think, well, maybe it won't hurt us much. We know \nwhat happens with interest rates. We know what might happen with Social \nSecurity checks and veterans' benefits and prison guard pay and airport \nsafety and food inspectors--all of those functions that matter. I don't \nknow why any responsible leader in this body or the other body would \nwant to take that risk.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask through the Chair if the Senator from \nOhio would yield for this question.\n  He may recall the time not that long ago when we closed down the \ngovernment of the United States for a period of time, and there were \nsome radio talk show hosts who argued that America wouldn't notice, \njust as they are arguing now that America won't notice if we default on \nour national debt. I know the Senator from Ohio can recall that and the \nfact that America did notice, and those who engineered that crisis paid \na heavy political price.\n  What I am really getting to at this point, though, is to ask the \nSenator from Ohio--Monday night, when the Speaker of the House, John \nBoehner, went on national television with the President of the United \nStates and announced he had a bipartisan plan, he called it, that he \ncould pass in the House of Representatives, many of us had the \nimpression that was going to be done on Tuesday. Well, it wasn't done \non Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday. It is only today that they are \nvoting on it, some 5 or 6 days later.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Ohio, losing that 4- or 5-day \nperiod of time when we could have been moving forward to a compromise--\nthe impact that has as we face this looming deadline of a default on \nour national debt on August 2.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thank the Senator for that comment and question. \nThis is clearly more dangerous for our economy and our country, from \nWall Street to Main Street, than what happened when they closed the \ngovernment down 15 years ago or threatened to a few months ago. That \nwas troubling, and that was damaging to our country, but we don't know \nwhat exactly would happen here. We are almost sure interest rates would \ngo up. We are almost sure many people who benefit from government \nservices directly would see those benefits go away. Whether it is a \nSocial Security check or whether it is food safety or running the \nairports safely, all of those things would be at risk.\n  I have heard a lot of sort of brouhaha or a lot of strong words out \nof the House and a lot of promises, but there seems to be too many \npeople in that Chamber who don't really see the seriousness of this, \ndon't see that this really does put our economy in jeopardy.\n  You know, it is not just our economy. That is the most important \npart, but it is also our reputation around the world. It is the \nstrength of the dollar. It is the blot on our national reputation. I \nhaven't been to Europe in a long time, but I hear reports from people \naround the world that they are saying: What is going on in the United \nStates of America that you can't even agree on raising the debt ceiling \nso you can really focus on things such as jobs?\n  I had a meeting just last week--Senator Rockefeller and I, earlier \nthis week--and there were eight or nine Senators who joined us to talk \nabout focusing on a jobs agenda and what we need to do to restore \nAmerican manufacturing. In a State such as Illinois, and in \nConnecticut--the other Senator from Connecticut was in our meeting and \ntalked about Bridgeport and New Haven and all the manufacturing that is \ndone in this country. We are still a major manufacturing country. This \nis going to hurt manufacturers. It is going to mean they can't borrow \nto meet payroll or borrow to expand or borrow to create more jobs.\n  Why would we risk any of this instead of getting this done by \nfocusing on job growth, and focusing on getting our budget in order? We \nknow how do this. In the 1990s--and the Presiding Officer and the \nassistant majority leader were very much part of it--in the 1990s, we \ngot to, one, a balanced budget and, second, we got to 21 million \nprivate sector jobs net increase because we passed a responsible \nbudget. It had some tax increases for upper income people. It also had \nsome tax breaks in it for middle-income people. It also had major cuts \nand major investments. And we did all of that because we wrote a \nthoughtful budget--didn't get a lot of help from the other side, but \nput that aside, we did it right, we got to a budget surplus, and we \ncreated 21 million jobs. We know how do this. But we didn't see anybody \nplaying these kinds of games: Maybe we just let the debt ceiling go and \ngo into default. We just could not take this chance.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Ohio for \ntalking about this issue because it is on the minds of everyone here on \nCapitol Hill and across the Nation. We are getting a lot of e-mails and \nphone calls and letters, and it is understandable because this is the \nfirst time in our Nation's history that we face default on our national \ndebt.\n  I received a letter from Amy in Germantown, IL, downstate. We have a \nlot of German families in our State, and we have a town named \n``Germantown.'' Amy contacted me and said:\n\n       Please do your utmost to compromise on a budget solution \n     before the deadline expires. Our family has already weathered \n     multiple economic downturns due to the dot-com bubble burst, \n     9/11, and most recently the sub-prime mortgage crisis. We are \n     responsible\n\n[[Page S5048]]\n\n     with our income, saving for our children's education and our \n     retirement. However, we are extremely nervous about our \n     savings and investments once again. If the United States of \n     America defaults on its loan obligations, it is likely we \n     will see a significant reduction in the value of our 401K \n     and 403B investments, as well as the investments we have \n     made for our children and grandchild's education.\n       . . . I cannot stand by another day and listen to all the \n     elected officials in Washington talk about their convictions. \n     Please remember your constituents and their situations.\n\n  Another letter from Scott in Bloomington, IL:\n\n       Dear Senator, I thought I'd offer you a real life personal \n     example of what you are doing to common Americans by dragging \n     out to the last minute the resolution of the Federal debt \n     limit. Ironically, every August 1st, I receive a distribution \n     from a tax-deferred retirement account. That account includes \n     a variety of investments, not the least of which are equity \n     mutual funds. The failure to provide leadership in Congress, \n     along with the President and House leaders, will probably \n     cost me about $5,000 this year. I will never see this money \n     again. The recent fall in the equity markets is a direct \n     result of the nervousness you are creating by failing to \n     resolve the Federal debt limit issue, playing the usual \n     political games. I respectfully request that you share this \n     message with all of your colleagues as a reality check. Stop \n     your games played for your own personal advantage, and start \n     thinking about the people you are supposed to be serving.\n\n  A letter from David in Casey, IL:\n\n       I am retired and don't look forward to having my Social \n     Security or veterans benefits cut. Why is it the rich get by \n     with no additional taxes and we are taxed and our benefits in \n     jeopardy? So why don't you elected officials wake up, start \n     living like the rest of the population, put politics aside \n     and do what is right for the country.\n\n  From the Lincoln Courier newspaper:\n\n       ``From what I'm hearing, interest rates would go up,'' said \n     Jim Muschinske, revenue manager for the Illinois Commission \n     on Government Forecasting and Accountability. ``Some people \n     may be more hesitant to buy big-ticket items they would have \n     to finance.''\n\n  As a result, sales tax revenues are going to suffer for local \ngovernments. ``That could start a ripple effect,'' the newspaper went \non to write.\n\n       ``If the consumer pulls back, corporations would be more \n     hesitant to add to their payroll,'' Muschinske said. ``They \n     may cut or, at the very least, not hire. At this stage of the \n     recovery, we would hope hiring would be further along.''\n\n  What troubles me the most is this is a manufactured political crisis. \nThis is a self-inflicted political wound. Eighty-nine times since 1939 \nwe have routinely--except for one little glitch--extended the debt \nceiling. We have done it under Republican Presidents 55 times and \nDemocratic Presidents 34 times. It is bipartisan.\n  All the President is asking for is the authority to borrow the money \nto pay for what Congress has spent. Members of Congress who come to the \nfloor and pledge ``I will never vote to extend the debt ceiling'' are \nthe same Members of Congress who just weeks ago said to the President: \nStay in Afghanistan, stay the course, spend the money. We have got to \ndo it. Mr. President, $10 billion a month in Afghanistan. For every \ndollar we spend, we have to borrow 40 cents. So for President Obama to \nkeep the promise made by these same Members of Congress, he has to \nborrow funds to do it. Now that he has asked for authority to borrow \nit, they are saying: Oh, no, we want nothing to do with borrowing the \nmoney. And that is why we are here today.\n  Mr. President, let me say a word about the other issue that is being \ndebated; that is, the deficit. And I know you feel as seriously about \nit as I do. The deficit in this country has to be addressed. We are \nleaving a debt to our children that is unimaginable, and we have to \nchange it.\n  I have been working for a year and a half with the deficit commission \nthe President created and with a group called the Gang of 6, and we \nhave come up with a bipartisan approach to deal with this. It is \nsensible. It spreads the pain--and there will be pain--to everyone \nacross America and puts everything on the table--everything. We don't \nspare anyone except the poorest and most vulnerable in our Nation.\n  We basically said to people: We have to raise revenue, and we have to \nstart by increasing the tax burden of those in the highest income \ncategories. I think it stands to reason. If we are asking for sacrifice \nfrom working families who are paying for college student loans, why \nwouldn't we ask the wealthiest people in America to pay a little more \non their taxes?\n  Secondly, we put all of the Federal spending on the table, and we \nmake dramatic cuts in Federal spending--not just on the side of the \nledger that deals with nondefense but also in the Defense Department. \nThere are some Members of Congress who argue that you cannot cut a \npenny from the Department of Defense.\n  When I was on the deficit commission, we had experts who came in from \nthe Pentagon, and we learned that the Pentagon and the Department of \nDefense is the largest Federal employer in America.\n  But then Senator Conrad of North Dakota asked an important question. \nHe said: Beyond those Federal employees in the Department of Defense, \nhow many contractors, how many contract employees work for the \nDepartment of Defense?\n  The expert said: I have no idea.\n  Senator Conrad said: Well, give me a range.\n  Well, he says, between 1 million and 9 million.\n  That is quite a range. I think it is evidence that we ought to look \nat every single contract in the Department of Defense. Believe me, \nthere are some of them that shouldn't be there where we are paying too \nmuch money and not getting the security we expect for our Nation.\n  So we need to look at both sides of the ledger--the defense side and \nthe nondefense side--and save the money. Keep our troops safe and keep \nAmerica safe, but don't waste money on that which doesn't make us safe.\n  Finally, the entitlement programs--and this is where many people \nacross America do get nervous. I believe in Social Security and \nMedicare and Medicaid. I particularly believe we have a commitment to \nseniors who paid their entire working lives into these programs \nexpecting them to protect them when they reached the age of retirement.\n  This year, on January 1, 10,000 Americans reached the age of 65, \nqualifying for Social Security and Medicare. On January 2, another \n10,000; January 3, again. And for 19 more years, every day 10,000 more \npeople will qualify for Social Security and Medicaid. Welcome to the \nbaby boomers. Those who were born after World War II are now reaching \nretirement age and with that expect, because they paid in for a \nlifetime, to receive Social Security and Medicare. Now we need to look \nat those programs and ask, What can we do to make them stronger longer? \nWe may have some disagreement about exactly how that is done, but we \nboth agree that if we don't touch Medicare and leave it as is, in a \nmatter of 6, 7, or 8 years, it will be insolvent, unable to pay its \nbills. That is unacceptable. We need to find ways to make Medicare a \nstrong, viable program that will pay the medical bills of seniors and \nthe disabled when they need them.\n\n  Social Security, the same. There is good news in Social Security; it \nis solvent for 25 years. We cannot say that about many programs, if \nany, in Washington. But the bad news is at the end of 25 years, \nbenefits would have to be cut 22 percent. That is tough. A lot of \npeople have no other source of income.\n  What I have suggested, and I hope people will listen carefully: Small \nchanges we make today in Social Security will play out over 25 years to \nbuy the solvency we need in this program for decades to come. Every \npenny of savings in Social Security needs to be reinvested right back \ninto Social Security so we do not take the savings from Social Security \nfor general deficit reduction--not at all. Whatever savings are there, \nput them back into the Social Security Program.\n  There are ways to do this. We could do it in a sensible fashion, and \nthe only way I can say that with some confidence is I have done it. \nWhen I first got elected to Washington in 1983, they said: Welcome to \nWashington. Social Security is broke.\n  We sat down and fixed it. We bought over 50 years of solvency at that \ntime. We can do it again. We have to think about this in thoughtful \nterms, preserve the basic benefits of these programs but give them a \nlonger life so they will be there when they are needed in the future. \nOur Gang of 6 came up with a bipartisan agreement to deal with this. \nThirty-six Senators of both parties have agreed to join us in this\n\n[[Page S5049]]\n\neffort, and I hope it becomes the basis for us addressing our deficit \ncrisis and that we avert what clearly is a manufactured political \ncrisis coming August 2 and that we extend this debt ceiling so we do \nnot hurt our recovering economy. We cannot hurt the innocent businesses \nand families across America who count on us for leadership.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 243\n\n   Promoting increased awareness, diagnosis, and treatment of atrial \n fibrillation to address the high morbidity and mortality rates and to \n     prevent avoidable hospitalizations associated with the disease\n\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is a cardiac condition that \n     results when the usual coordinated electrical activity in the \n     atria of the heart becomes disorganized and chaotic, \n     hampering the ability of the atria to fill the ventricles \n     with blood, and allowing blood to pool in the atria and form \n     clots;\n       Whereas an estimated 2,500,000 people in the United States \n     are living with atrial fibrillation, the most common \n     ``serious'' heart rhythm abnormality that occurs in people \n     older than 65 years of age;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased \n     long-term risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause \n     mortality, especially among women;\n       Whereas people older than 40 years of age have a 1-in-4 \n     risk of developing atrial fibrillation in their lifetime;\n       Whereas an estimated 15 percent of strokes are the result \n     of untreated atrial fibrillation, a condition that \n     dramatically increases the risk of stroke to approximately 5 \n     times more than the general population;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation accounts for approximately \n     529,000 hospital discharges annually;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation costs an estimated $3,600 per \n     patient for a total cost burden in the United States of \n     $15,700,000,000;\n       Whereas better patient and health care provider education \n     is needed for the timely recognition of atrial fibrillation \n     symptoms;\n       Whereas an electrocardiogram is an effective and risk-free \n     screen for heart rhythm irregularities and can be part of a \n     routine preventive exam;\n       Whereas there is a dearth of outcome performance measures \n     that focus on the management of atrial fibrillation; and\n       Whereas evidence-based care guidelines improve patient \n     outcomes and prevent unnecessary hospitalizations for \n     individuals with undiagnosed atrial fibrillation and for \n     patients once atrial fibrillation is detected: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services should work with \n     leaders in the medical community to explore ways to improve \n     medical research, screening and prevention methods, and \n     surveillance efforts in order to prevent and appropriately \n     manage atrial fibrillation, including by--\n       (1) advancing the development of process and outcome \n     measures for the management of atrial fibrillation by \n     national developers;\n       (2) facilitating the adoption of evidence-based guidelines \n     by the medical community to improve patient outcomes;\n       (3) advancing atrial fibrillation research and education \n     by--\n       (A) encouraging basic science research to determine the \n     causes and optimal treatments for atrial fibrillation;\n       (B) exploring development of screening tools and protocols \n     to determine the risk of developing atrial fibrillation; and\n       (C) enhancing current surveillance and tracking systems to \n     include atrial fibrillation; and\n       (4) improving access to appropriate medical care for \n     patients suffering from atrial fibrillation by encouraging \n     education programs that promote collaboration among the \n     Federal health agencies and that increase public and \n     clinician awareness of atrial fibrillation, including risk \n     assessment, screening, treatment, and appropriate clinical \n     management.\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise once again to urge my colleagues to \ncome together and address this debt ceiling to reduce our deficit and \ndebt. We are at the 12th hour, and it is vitally important to the \nAmerican people we move forward. I believe there is opportunity to do \nthat. I think it is important we move forward in a way that makes sure \nwe address the root of the problem. The problem is, we have a deficit \nand a debt that is out of control. As we work together to reach \nagreement on this very important debt ceiling issue, we need to be \nmindful that we have taken a big step forward in reducing the deficit \nand debt that our country faces.\n  Let's start by taking just a minute to look at the numbers. Today \nthis country has total revenues coming into the Federal Government at \nabout $2.2 trillion. At the same time, we have expenses of $3.7 \ntrillion, leaving an annual deficit of more than $1.5 trillion. Our \ndebt is now in the range of $14.5 trillion. It is hard to even imagine \nwhat $1 trillion is, let alone $14.5 trillion. We are borrowing 40 \ncents of every dollar we spend, and our debt is growing $4 billion a \nday--$4 billion a day. The unemployment is 9.2 percent, and the latest \nGDP growth came out for the second quarter for this year. It was an \nanemic 1.3 percent.\n  We need to get our economy growing. We need to get people back to \nwork. We need to get people working, and at the same time we have to \ncontrol our spending. It is time to act.\n  We are faced with two different pieces of legislation at this point. \nOne is the Boehner plan, or the Budget Control Act of 2011, that the \nHouse will be voting on very soon, I believe. Also, there is another \nplan, the Reid plan, in the Senate. Although they have some \nsimilarities, as configured now they are different plans and different \napproaches.\n  One, very importantly, gets us on the road to recovery. The other one \ndoesn't. Let's take just a minute to talk about each of those \nrespective plans to make sure we understand them. As they vote on them \nin the House, and as we face those important votes this evening or \ntomorrow or, hopefully, very soon, we can understand the differences \nbetween these approaches so we can find a way to come together on an \napproach that we can pass in this Chamber and also in the House, and, \nof course, that truly moves our country forward.\n  Under the Boehner proposal there is $917 billion in savings that must \nbe provided in order to raise the debt ceiling, and that allows the \nfirst tranche of increase in the debt ceiling in the amount of $900 \nbillion. Those savings have to be identified first--in fact, more than \nthe amount of the debt ceiling increase.\n  Then the second tranche to increase the debt ceiling beyond that $900 \nbillion, an additional $1.8 trillion in savings, has to be identified \nand provided--$1.8 trillion in savings. That is $2.7 trillion in \nsavings to get this country back on the road to financial health in \norder to raise the debt ceiling. That is fundamentally important \nbecause that is the fundamental issue. It doesn't fully solve the \nproblem, but it gets us on the right path, and we have to get going on \nthe right path.\n  The second tranche of savings is done by a committee of six Members \nof the Senate--three Democrat, three Republican--and six Members of the \nHouse--three Republican, three Democrat--in a bipartisan committee. I \nthink that committee offers us real opportunity. Here is why: The \ncommittee has to come up with recommendations for real savings by \nNovember. It is bipartisan, and it is a straight up-or-down vote in the \nHouse or the Senate to put those savings in place, and those savings \nmust be identified before we raise the debt ceiling further. So it is \nsomething we have to do.\n  Let's think about that committee for a minute. That is a committee \nthat can bring in the ideas of the Gang of 6. That is the committee \nthat can bring in the Simpson-Bowles concept. That is a committee that \ncan bring in tax reform. That is a committee that can bring in \nentitlement reform. These are the things we are going to need to \naddress to get this economy going and get control of our spending. I \nknow we have put together many pieces of legislation that have been \nbipartisan and have been very important for this country, and I think \nthis committee truly offers us that opportunity. I hope it is something \nwe in the Senate can find a way to come together on and that we can get \nour colleagues in the House to join us.\n  In my view, I do think we need to engage in tax reform. I think the \nright kind of progrowth tax reform--some of the concepts brought forth \nby the Gang of 6--can truly help us to stimulate\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\neconomic activity. I think the real way to get revenue for this country \nis through economic growth--not higher taxes, through economic growth. \nExpand the pie, the rising tide that lifts all boats.\n  If we can engage in tax reform to stimulate economic growth, we \nreduce that unemployment rate by more than 9 percent. That is good for \nevery American, but it is also the way we create revenue to get us out \nof this deficit and debt at the same time that we control spending.\n  I absolutely believe it can work, and I think that we need to \nconvince our Members we need to come together and make it happen.\n  The Boehner proposal also includes a balanced budget amendment, and I \nknow that has been an issue of great debate in this Senate. I believe \nwe need a balanced budget amendment. I have said it many times before. \nI come from a background in my State, as a Governor, where we balanced \nour budget every year. There are 49 States that either have a \nconstitutional or statutory priority to balance their budget. We need \nthat fiscal discipline in Washington, DC. I think we need it to make \nsure we don't get ourselves into this situation in the future years for \nourselves or for these young people we see here today with us.\n  When we compare the approach of the Boehner plan, it is different \nfrom the Reid plan. It is important that we understand that. The Reid \nplan does provide that we identify $900 billion in savings, but that \nprovides that once we have identified that $900 billion in savings, we \nraise the debt ceiling by $2.7 trillion, unlike the Boehner proposal \nwhere we are finding significantly more savings than we are increasing \nthe debt ceiling. This is just the opposite. We are increasing the debt \nceiling $2.7 trillion but only requiring $900 billion in savings. That \ndoesn't get at the root of the problem. That continues the underlying \nproblem of too much spending and too much debt. Like the Boehner \nproposal, the Reid proposal does provide for a committee. That is \nimportant. That is good. Unlike the Boehner proposal, it doesn't \nrequire that committee bring back the savings and that we put those \nsavings in place before the debt ceiling is increased. It doesn't have \nthe teeth we need to make sure we get this job done for the American \npeople, and that is a problem. They are different approaches, and it \ndoesn't include a balanced budget amendment.\n  There has been talk that we must work together to find a way to \nbridge the gap and the differences, and I think that is true. We have \nto find ways to come together. Time is growing short. We need to get it \ndone now. I think it is the approach identified in the Boehner plan \nthat we need to take. We need to get our colleagues in this Chamber to \njoin with us to do it. It is the only piece of legislation that can \npass the House, but, more importantly, it is a big step forward. It is \na big step in the right direction for our country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would ask to speak for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, while we are waiting for people to \ndecide what the rest of us can vote on in regard to cutting down on the \nnational debt and what we can do about being able to continue our \ngovernment to function tomorrow, all of this is about uncertainty, and \nwe read about the uncertainty every day in the newspaper because people \ndon't know what we are going to do. That then causes businesses, small \nand large, not to hire, and it seems as though they have a lot of cash \nthey would like to spend and invest wisely. Some of that would surely \ncreate a lot of jobs and get our economy moving. Of course, the \nsituation today where the revision of the quarterly economic growth has \ncome out even less for the second quarter than we anticipated, it \nbrings a lot of things to mind as to what we can do to create jobs. \nWith 9.2 percent unemployment, that has to be our concentration.\n  I would like to advise my colleagues that a lot can be learned from \nhistory. We must change course if we want to change jobs. The 2007 to \n2009 recession was officially over during the year 2009, and here we \nare still with 9.2 percent unemployment.\n  So this month happens to be the second-year anniversary of the \nofficial start of the recovery. But what kind of a recovery, with 9.2 \npercent unemployment? It seems to be an unofficial recovery; in other \nwords, a recovery in name only. We have had about 2.8 percent annual \ngrowth average per year of that 2 years; and, of course, I just said \nthe growth of the last quarter was revised downward. When we compare \nwhat we have during this recovery from what was a very bad recession \nwith the recovery of the last deep recession, which was in 1981 and \n1982, we compare this 2.8-percent growth now with a 7.1-percent growth \nfor the recovery after the 1981 to 1982 deep recession--of course, we \ncan go even further because, as I said, compare 7.1-percent growth \nafter the deep recession of 1981 and 1982 with the 2.8-percent average \ngrowth so far during this 2 years of recovery, which has now slowed \ndown to probably 1.5-percent growth. So statistically and actually, and \nfor the people who are unemployed, recovery has, in fact, been very \nstalled since its very beginning 2 years ago, as we celebrate the 2-\nyear anniversary of a so-called recovery, and still with 9.2-percent \nunemployment.\n  I say we must change course. If we want to go back to comparing now \nwith the 1983 and 1984 period of time when we had a much more vibrant \nrecovery, people tend to blame the weak economy today, during this \nrecovery, on high personal savings rates. But, in fact, people are \nspending more now than they did in the 1983 to 1984 recovery because, \ntoday, the savings rate is about 5.6 percent, and in 1983 to 1984, the \nother recovery, it was 9.4 percent. So we can't say people aren't \nspending enough is why we don't have a recovery.\n  Then they tend to blame it on weak housing, but if we look at the \ndifference between now and 1983 and 1984, that doesn't seem to be a \nvery good reason.\n  Net exports are less now than they were in the 1983 and 1984 \nrecovery. The growth of consumption and the growth of investment is 60 \nto 70 percent less now than it was in the 1983 and 1984 recovery.\n  So what can we learn from this history that made the recovery of 1983 \nand 1984, the last great recession we had compared to this recession, \nbetter than the recovery now? Why have we stalled today when we didn't \nstall in a comparable period of recovery after the last great \nrecession? If the above doesn't explain it, then what does explain it? \nWhy, then, was the recovery of the 1980s so much more vigorous than the \nrecovery now if we are, in fact, in a recovery--and people would doubt \nthat.\n  That is the question where I think we can learn from history. \nPolitical leaders ought to learn from the lessons of the past. There \nare a lot of lessons that can be learned going back over a long period \nof time: mistakes made in the Great Depression of the 1930s, or let's \nsay the gigantic inflation of the 1970s. The 1930s and the 1970s were \ntough decades, but during those tough times and remembering them--and \nmaybe other tough times as well; I am just picking out the Great \nDepression of the 1930s and the gigantic inflation of the 1970s--but \nthese lessons learned by political leaders in the 1980s and 1990s led \nus to very unprecedented growth during those two decades when 44 \nmillion jobs were created. If 44 million jobs were created during those \ndecades, why do we have such small job growth now? I think the answer \nis that we went back to basic principles that this country was founded \nupon: political and economic freedom. The principles that dominated the \ndecades of the 1980s and 1990s when 44 million new jobs were created \naligned with the principles that are the foundation of our country: \npolitical and economic freedoms. Those were limited government, \nincentives to produce, incentives for entrepreneurship, emphasis upon \nprivate markets, and rule of law. These tended to be in ascendancy \nduring the decades of the 1980s and 1990s and it led to monetary\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\npolicy that brought about price stability. It brought about lower \nmarginal tax rates. Regulations encouraged competition and innovation. \nWe had welfare decisions that were devolved down to the States where \nthey could be handled more efficiently, and we had spending restraints \nthat led to balanced budgets during the late 1990s, paying down $568 \nbillion on the national debt.\n  So there was great hope that what was done during the 1980s and 1990s \nthat brought about 44 million new jobs would extend into the 21st \ncentury and that we would continue to bring market-based principles \ninto Social Security and other entitlement programs, bring market-based \nprinciples into education, bring market-based principles into health \ncare. Because if these market-based principles worked during the 1980s \nand 1990s of the last century and created 44 million jobs, the success \nof that ought to carry over into other government policies so we could \ncontinue down the road of creating jobs instead of stagnating as we \nhave now.\n  But sometime after 2000--and that doesn't mean just after President \nObama was elected, because there was a Republican President before \nthat--but sometime after 2000 both political parties compromised--and I \nwant to emphasize both political parties--on the principles of limited \ngovernment. They did it for a multitude of reasons. Some of these \nreasons were that they thought government ought to control business \ncycles to a greater extent, that we ought to increase home ownership, \nand we know how that worked out: We ought to have a policy that people \nought to be able to buy a house they can't afford. Now we know that is \na stupid policy, but at the time we didn't know it; also the \nprescription drug issue, as an example, although there were some \nmarket-based principles put into that.\n  But, anyway, there were a multitude of reasons why we ought to \ncompromise the principle of limited government, but it ended up more \ninterventionist and it made the Federal Government more powerful, and \nwe ended up with unintended consequences: the financial crisis we still \nremember and we are still trying to get out of; the recession, which I \nhave already talked about, of 2007 and 2009, of which we are \ncelebrating 2 years of supposed recovery that isn't real recovery; we \nhave had a great amount of expanded government debt; and now we have \nthis nonexistent recovery with 9.2-percent unemployment.\n  I think, looking back, how did this happen? I was here when it \nhappened. It reminds me of the story about--well, I guess I ought to \nsay it and then give the story. It happened so slowly, and all of these \nthings added up to be bad to bring about the great recession, and now \nnot a very good recovery, because each one of them happened independent \nof the other and without one relating to the other. So it reminds me of \nthe story of the frog and the water. If you throw a frog in boiling \nwater, he will jump out and live. If you put a frog in cold water and \ngradually heat it up to a boil, it is going to accommodate the changes \nand die. So these policies slowly developed and we got into the \nsituation we are in right now. I will say it again: Change came so \nslowly, it crept up on us.\n  Then, of course, what happened? The crash came. We had this Federal \nintervention in housing. I stated it before: Buy a house even if you \ncan't afford it. We eliminated a lot of Federal Reserve accountability, \nparticularly when they didn't have to report on monetary growth on a \nregular basis as they did before. Then we had these countercyclical \nfiscal policies that failed. We had, during periods of growth in our \neconomy, unrealistically low interest rates by the Federal Reserve \naction. Then, of course, we had government bailouts. This has led to \nthings all getting worse since 2009. We had more intervention. We had \nloose monetary policies, QE1 and QE2, of the Federal Reserve. We had a \nstimulus plan that was supposed to keep unemployment under 8 percent, \nand since it was passed in February of 2009, unemployment has never \nbeen below that. It has always been above 8 percent. It is 9.2 percent \nnow, but it was even over 10 percent. We had the Cash For Clunkers \nProgram. We had the first-time homeowners tax credit. All of these \ntogether have not brought recovery, even though the economists tell us \nwe are in the second-year anniversary of a recovery.\n  What did they bring that has stalled the recovery? What they have \nbrought is more uncertainty, and more uncertainty is bad for the \neconomy because, as I said when I started out, there is plenty of money \nout there in corporations. There are plenty of small businesses that \nwant to hire, but they do not know what we in this Congress are going \nto do to them so they are not moving forward. Consequently, the \nunemployment rate is not going down. And right this very hour, as \npeople are trying to find something that can pass this body and the \nother body so we do not have default, it even brings more uncertainty, \nand you read it in the morning paper, this morning's paper. So you have \nto come to the conclusion, with all of this intervention bringing about \nall this uncertainty, that big government is not a very good manager.\n\n  Then, as I said, this did not happen just since President Obama \nbecame President. This happened over the period of time of this decade \nand maybe even going back a little bit into the other decade. But just \nsince President Obama was elected, we have added yet more complex \nintervention: the health care reform bill, Dodd-Frank, the Consumer \nProtection Bureau.\n  The President this very week has been talking about increasing taxes, \nonly he does not use the word ``taxes.'' We have to have more \n``revenue'' or we have to have ``balance.'' But it still adds up, all \nof these things out there, that government does not know what all these \nrules and regulations--do you realize that in health care reform, there \nare 1,690 delegations of authority to the Secretaries to write \nregulations? And they are not going to be written for years. But that \nbrings so much uncertainty.\n  So we have more uncertainty, plus unintended consequences that come \nout of these, like right now, rising health care costs because of the \nbill, deterring new investments because of Dodd-Frank and deterring \nrisk-taking. Risk-taking is what entrepreneurship is all about, and \nentrepreneurship is mostly related to small businesses, where 70 \npercent of the new jobs are created.\n  Government intervention is the problem because government \nintervention or government not making decisions all adds up to more \nuncertainty. So I think the solution is to unwind government \nintervention in all these regulations of EPA and all the other \ngovernment agencies. Every day in the newspaper, you see some new \nregulation coming out. If you want to get people to hire, you ought to \njust shut down the printing presses for a while.\n  One sure thing though: We can thank God we have run out of monetary \nand fiscal ammunition because it has not worked anyway. We are going to \nprobably have a great deal of inflation because of what the Fed did. We \nhave no more spending we can do because all the spending we have done \nhas not done the good it was supposed to do. We need no more greater \ndebt, and we do not have any more zero interest rates to put out there \nbecause that is practically where it is right now.\n  Instead, what we need is spending controls, and what we need is free \nmarket principles. Historical evidence shows what works and what does \nnot. I said what works and what does not is shown from the lessons \nlearned from the depression of the 1980s and the gigantic inflation \ndecade of the 1970s. So people in the 1980s and 1990s changed to \npolicies that were market-oriented, and we created 44 million new jobs. \nSo we ought to be learning from history. Historical evidence shows what \nworks and what does not. And right this day, in this town, \ninterventionists in the market control today. We need to restore less \nintervention, the policies of the 1980s and the 1990s to restore jobs. \nRemember, it created 44 million new jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, are we under a time agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, for several months now, I have been on the \nfloor speaking, urging both Republicans and Democrats to listen to\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\nAmericans and take this unique opportunity we have before us to do what \nis right for our country's future.\n  Mr. President, 2010 sent an unmistakable message. Americans do not \nwant us to spend beyond our means, more than we take in. They do not \nwant higher taxes. They do not want budget gimmicks, and more smoke and \nmirrors. They want real, serious solutions to address our real, serious \nproblem. We have worked several months to try to do that.\n  As I talk to Hoosiers all across the State of Indiana--\nbusinesspeople, retired workers, young people, and others--I sense the \nfear, frustration, disappointment and even anger in a growing number of \npeople that started in 2010 and is accumulating as we continue to \ncareen toward a potential budget default without a sensible or serious \nplan in place to get us back on the right track toward fiscal health.\n  American families are scared. They are scared, and they are \nfrustrated, and I think rightfully so. They are worried about paying \nnext month's bills. They are worried about getting a loan to buy a \nhouse or credit to help support a business. They are worried about \nbeing able to pay for their kids to go to school in the fall, just a \nfew weeks away.\n  Our seniors are scared. Throughout this debate, they have been used \nover and over again as a political football for scare tactics. My \nphones are ringing off the hook with seniors basically saying: We have \nbeen told you are going to take away all of our benefits, but that is \nabsolutely not true. We are trying to save those benefits. We are \ntrying to take the reasonable measures necessary so those benefits for \nSocial Security and Medicare are there for seniors in the future.\n  American businesses are frustrated. They are sick and tired of \nWashington's inability to act. The Washington Post reported this week \nthat ``business leaders are growing exasperated with Washington. And \nthey say dysfunction in the political system is holding them back from \nhiring and investing.'' The markets are jittery. We have seen a pretty \ngood drop in the markets just this week. The dollar fell to a new low \nagainst the yen, and the yen is not doing that well. We continue to see \nstocks tumble.\n  So many have asked: Why haven't we acted yet? What are we waiting \nfor? Why haven't we passed a bill to avoid this default? Why are we in \nthis period of uncertainty, taking it right up as the clock ticks \ntoward August 2?\n  While the President refused to even put forth a plan, House \nRepublicans have been working to pass legislation. They passed the Cut, \nCap, and Balance Act. They brought it here to the Senate floor. We were \nnot even allowed to debate or vote on it or have amendments. For those \nwho do not like it, there would have been an opportunity to improve it, \nthere would have been an opportunity at least to have a ``yes'' or \n``no'' vote on whether this was the path to where we needed to go. But \nwe did not have that opportunity.\n  Now, even as I speak, we are moving toward another vote in the \nHouse--something similar coming forward tonight by Speaker Boehner and \nRepublicans in the House. Unfortunately, it looks as if we are going to \nbe blocked from debating that bill. There will be yet another motion to \ntable, to deny the opportunity to move forward.\n  We know there are things going on behind the scenes, but this does \nnot provide any assurance to the American people that whatever is being \ndebated and put together is going to solve the problem. We are days \naway from exhausting our financial options, and we do not even allow \nthose bills that do come before us to be debated.\n  Now, we have few options left in these few days remaining:\n  We can, No. 1, default and watch our U.S. economy be downgraded, \ninterest rates rise, and the confidence in the United States as a place \nto safely invest your money deteriorate all around the world. This \nwould be the first default in American history, except for a technical \nglitch some many years back.\n\n  The second option before us is we can pass legislation that is below \nwhere we need to be and where we ought to be, but we were not able to \nget there. Although it would avoid a default, it might not avoid a \ndowngrade of our credit because it has not matched and met the minimal \nrequirements of what most who have analyzed this situation have \nunderstood we need to undertake.\n  The third option--which has not been talked about too much, but \nseveral of us have been discussing this possibility--is to pass a \nshort-term extension that will avert a default and allow us to continue \nto work for a serious fix that gets to those minimal measures necessary \nto make progress toward fiscal health.\n  That first option is not a viable option. Default has consequences we \ncannot begin to understand, and eventually those bills which the \nAmerican people and their congressional representatives have put in \nplace have to be paid because those promises were made.\n  The second measure--it may be what we are faced with, perhaps the \nbest of the worst; is passing subpar legislation that begins the \nprocess of addressing it but is woefully short of really what needs to \nbe done.\n  The third option, the short-term extension, is a way we can avoid the \ndefault and we can achieve cuts for the amount of necessary borrowing \nauthority to get us through this period of time, whether it is 2 weeks \nor 4 weeks or 8 weeks. This short-term period of time would allow us to \nmake yet one last-ditch chance to try to bring forward something that \nwill avoid default but also put us on the road to fiscal health.\n  So I am urging my colleagues, if we cannot come up with something \nbetter than what we have, to give that serious consideration. What are \nthose minimum levels? A $4 trillion cut over 10 years has been told to \nus over and over and over by anyone who has analyzed this situation as \nthe minimal amount necessary to go forward. Others suggest quite a bit \nmore. The Gang of 6 was working on, I believe, at least $4 trillion cut \nover that period of time. Simpson-Bowles provided for $4 trillion or \nmore. Senator Coburn has brought out a plan, and others have suggested \nwe need to be in the $9 trillion to $10 trillion range. But everyone \nhas said you need to at least be at $4 trillion, and we are short of \nthat, considerably.\n  We are also short of having serious commitment, plan and timetable to \naddress the structural unraveling of our mandatory entitlement \nsystems--Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security. This has been the \npolitical football kicked around, scaring seniors and others by saying \nCongress is here to try to take away their benefits, when actually we \nare here trying to save those benefits. But without structural changes \nin those programs, it is driving this deficit to a point which will be \nunsustainable in terms of providing benefits for those who need them.\n  We are going forward without a commitment to balance our budget, \nwhich I think is absolutely, ultimately the only thing that will keep \nus from doing binge spending here. The tendency is to want to say yes \nto everybody and no to nobody. We need something that will force us to \nbe faithful to the Constitution of the United States, to have a \nbalanced budget and not spend more than we take in.\n  Also, we all know we need an overhaul of our complicated Tax Code to \nmake American businesses more competitive and to spur economic growth. \nAfter all is said and done, what this is really about is getting our \nfiscal house in order, getting our economy moving again--there was a \nterrible number this morning about the virtually small, almost nothing, \nlack of growth in the first and second quarters of this year--but \ngetting the economy growing again so we can get people back to work.\n  That is what it is all about. We are not here to have Draconian cuts \njust for the fun of it. We are here to get our budget in balance so we \ncan get our economy moving so people can have viable jobs for the \nfuture, so those kids coming out of college have a place to go, so the \n55-year-old worker who is laid off and may never get back to work can \nget back to work, and so those who are seeking meaningful employment to \npay their mortgage and raise a family and buy a home and send their \nkids to school will have the ability to do that. That is what it is all \nabout. We are not doing this just for the fun of it. It is no fun to \ntell people we have to cut this and cut that and sacrifice here and \nsacrifice there. But we have put ourselves in the position where we \nhave no other choice. To spend all of this time here, 7 months of \ndiligent work by a lot of people----\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes is up.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank my colleague, also, \nfor her patience.\n  To send us here, after 7 months, and come up with something that is \nshort of the minimum, that continues the uncertainty--are they going to \nbe able to pull it together with this two-stage process and gathering \nSenators and Congressman together to put a plan together that we have \nnot been able to do in the first 7 months but we will do it in the next \n5 months? A lot of people have some real problems with that.\n  I want to close by saying we cannot give up on the process of getting \nAmerica back to fiscal health. We have to keep working. I have proposed \na way here to try to do something better than what we are going to be \nfaced with in doing in order to avoid this default.\n  I am hoping we have the opportunity to do that. If not, I am hoping \nwe have the commitment to go forward and do what we all know we need to \ndo for the sake of the future of this country--the country we love and \nwant to be prosperous for the sake of the future of American families \nand their children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise during this very critical debate \nabout the deficit crisis to talk for a few minutes about what this \nmeans for Michigan and for the families and the businesses I represent. \nI grew up in a small northern town of Clare, MI, where my family ran \nthe automobile dealership, the Oldsmobile dealership, and my mom was a \nnurse at the local hospital.\n  My first job was washing the cars on the car lot. It was a time when \npeople believed in America and the full faith and credit of America. I \ncannot imagine--I cannot imagine--my parents and my grandparents ever \nbelieving it would be possible for America to default on its \nobligations.\n  But here we are today, and that is a very real possibility. It is \noutrageous because it does not have to be this way. We have been \nthrough a lot in Michigan. I know you know that, Mr. President. We have \nhad more people out of work than any other State in this recession. In \nfact, we have been hit harder, longer, deeper than any other State. We \ntook the brunt of the recession, and people are now just starting to \nget back on their feet. They are the lucky ones.\n  When people in Washington talk about this deficit crisis as though it \nis just another political game, it is not a game. It is not a game to \nthe families I represent. It is not a game to seniors I represent. It \nis not a game to the small businesses or to the manufacturers that have \nworked very hard to turn things around and move forward in our State. \nIt is not a game to the people who are worried about what is going to \nhappen on Tuesday if we cannot come together and create a solution, \nwhich we absolutely have to do.\n  There are nearly 2 million people in Michigan, senior citizens and \npeople with disabilities, who have earned their Social Security \nbenefits and might not receive them next week. We have 1.6 million \nseniors, people such as my mom, who may not be able to see their doctor \nand use their Medicare next week.\n  Michigan has 700,000 veterans, men and women who have bravely served \nour country, and they expect us to keep our promise to them as a \ncountry. Those are the people I am thinking about today as we are \ntrying to find a bipartisan compromise.\n  We have to solve this problem and we need to get it done now and \nthere is no reason that cannot happen. I am hearing from small business \nowners. I have been on the phone today talking to small business \nowners, the people whom we need in Michigan to turn the economy around. \nThey are doing everything they can to grow their companies and to \ncreate jobs. But now they need customers, and they have customers who \nare saying they are afraid to make a purchase, they are holding onto \ntheir dollars, they are afraid to buy a house or furniture.\n  Today, I talked to friend of mine in northern Michigan, a prominent \nauto dealer, who indicated he has people who normally come in every 3 \nyears and buy a new car, and they are just sitting because they do not \nknow what is going to happen. They do not know what is going to happen \nin the economy. They do not know what is going to happen to them and \ntheir families and they are waiting. They are waiting for us. They are \nwaiting for Washington to get its act together and to solve this \nproblem and to move on to the other challenges in front of us, \nparticularly to focus on jobs.\n  Our recovery has already taken hits. We saw that in the economic \nnumbers that came out this morning. Families from Michigan have already \ntaken the one-two punch of higher food prices, higher gas prices, and \nnow we have people talking seriously about letting the country default \nwhich will lead to higher interest rates for people trying to raise \ntheir families, for small businesses trying to hire new employees.\n  The last thing they need--that anybody needs--is higher interest \nrates. A default would cripple the ability of our companies to create \njobs, and it is the people who are already hurting the most, the \nmiddle-class working families, who will pay the biggest price, once \nagain. That is wrong.\n  Worst of all, that scenario would be entirely self-inflicted by \npeople on both ends of this building who are not willing to come \ntogether and work together on a bipartisan basis to resolve this. There \nis absolutely no reason why this country needs to default on its \nobligations. There is no reason.\n  I am hearing from seniors in Michigan who are scared that they might \nnot get their Social Security checks next week. They are living check \nto check--benefits they have worked their whole lives to earn, and it \nis absolutely ridiculous they would have to worry about that in the \ngreatest country in the world and all because people in Washington \ncannot seem to sit down and work this out.\n  For many seniors in Michigan, that is all they have to live on. That \nis all they have to pay their rent, to buy groceries, to pay for their \nmedicine. They are worried about how they are going to live if this \ncountry goes into default.\n  I am hearing from veterans in Michigan, many of whom were left \ndisabled after their service, who are angry, and rightly so, that the \ncountry they fought for might default on their payments for the first \ntime.\n  I am hearing from young people who are worried about their future and \nthe future of their generation if Congress allows the full faith and \ncredit of the United States to come into question.\n  We all know it is critical to be able to cut the deficit. We also \nneed to grow the economy. We need a full, balanced package. But we \nunderstand the critical nature and the importance of cutting this \ndeficit that has been allowed to accumulate over the last decade. We \nhave already cut spending. We will cut more.\n  The bipartisan plan that will soon come before us, and I wish to \nthank Senator Reid for his leadership in bringing this forward and \nworking so diligently and our colleagues across the aisle who have been \nworking in the Senate to create a bipartisan plan. But the plan that \nwill be before us cuts spending by nearly $2.5 trillion, and it does \neven more. It creates a second step that is absolutely critical if we \nare going to tackle the rest of the story, the rest of the country's \nchallenges so we can create a truly balanced approach to eliminating \nthe deficit.\n  People in Michigan understand that to do that, that includes cutting \nthe special subsidies and other special interest spending through the \nTax Code and creating a fairer Tax Code, so that reducing our deficit \nis not, once again, put on the backs of middle-class families and \nsenior citizens who have already paid a heavy price.\n  This has to be balanced, long term, fair, to solve the problem and \nallow us to grow the economy and create jobs. I so appreciate and have \nworked very hard to make sure the plan in front of us protects and \nmaintains Medicare and Social Security. This has been a top priority \nfor our majority.\n  The plan Senator Reid will be offering does that. Most important, the \nSenate plan creates certainty for the economy and the markets until \n2012. People in Michigan do not want us having this debate every month. \nThey certainly do not want us having this over\n\n[[Page S5057]]\n\nand over and over again and we know because we have heard that the plan \nwhich will come to a vote in the House, unfortunately, will not have \nbipartisan support, does not solve the problem, does not stop us from \nbeing downgraded in our credit rating, does not put us in a situation \nfor long-term problem solving.\n  It keeps us stuck in the mud for months over and over again by only \naddressing the debt ceiling for 4 months or 6 months. We will be right \nback here again stuck when we need to be able to solve this and move on \nand focus on growing our economy so businesses can create jobs. People \nin Michigan have had enough. I have had enough. They have had enough.\n  One man called my office earlier today. He said: I do not want to \nrelive this nightmare in a few months. I could not agree with him more. \nWe cannot be in a situation where we are not creating economic \ncertainty, solving this problem, and then moving forward as a country \nin a global economy. We have a lot of work to do to be able to compete \naround the world and make sure our businesses are creating jobs here at \nhome.\n  Families and small businesses in Michigan have been through enough. \nIt is time to get this done. We have to do it together. It is about \nworking together. It is about creating a bipartisan plan, and it is \ntime to get that done. I know my colleagues in the Senate on both sides \nof the aisle know the seriousness of this situation. I certainly know \nour leader does, and I am grateful for his persistence and focus in \nbringing people together to solve this.\n  We have a serious debt crisis that we can and must solve, and the \nHouse must join us in a bipartisan solution. We also have a jobs crisis \nin our country. We need to resolve the current impasse and then focus \nlike a laser on growing our economy so companies can create jobs, so we \ncan get out of debt, and we can stay out of debt.\n  I would strongly urge my colleagues, my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle in this Chamber, to continue to work together to find a \nsolution, to come together, to get this done in the Senate. I would \nurge my colleagues, on behalf of the hard-working men and women of the \nState of Michigan, it is time to come together to get this done. We \nknow what needs to be done. We know it has to be bipartisan, and we \nknow we have to work together. People in Michigan are saying enough is \nenough. It is time to get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, according to President Obama and Treasury \nSecretary Geithner, the Federal government will default on its \nobligations in 5 days, on August 2, 2011.\n  It is clear that some Democrats, including President Obama, want to \nuse this fiscal crisis to raise taxes.\n  Under the guise of closing loopholes, the administration wants to set \nthe stage for tax increases to finance historic levels of government \nspending.\n  When this President came into office, he saw himself as the second \ncoming of Franklin Roosevelt. He was going to finish the work that LBJ \nwas unable to complete. And a fawning media was happy to encourage his \ngrandiose vision for national economic reordering.\n  I get a big kick out of this ``Time'' magazine article entitled ``The \nNew New Deal.''\n  Using the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, he was going to \ntransform the United States into a European-style social democracy.\n  Businesses, and the individuals who start them, would no longer be \nfree entities with property rights. They would be arms of the state \nthat exist for the purpose of funding ever expanding welfare programs.\n  Taxation would no longer be a necessary evil, with citizens and \nbusinesses recognizing a legal duty to pay what was owed, but \nunderstanding that they were ceding their property rights to the \ngovernment to provide for certain public goods.\n  Instead, businesses and taxpaying citizens would be obligated to \nshare their wealth with the state.\n  Because the progressives running the administration do not believe in \nnatural rights to liberty and property because they think everything a \nfamily or business makes is in fact due only to the largesse of the \nstate paying taxes is no longer something that must be done, but \nsomething that people should want to do.\n  They owe it to the government to pay taxes, since that money is not \nreally theirs anyway. In this new progressive political community that \nthe President hopes to create, taxation becomes shared sacrifice, and \ntaxpayers become gleeful participants in ``spreading the wealth \naround,'' as the President once put it.\n  But the President and his party have hit a brick wall. The spending \npart was easy. The taxing part is hard.\n  For all of the talk about how Republicans are divided on the issue of \nraising the debt ceiling, you only have to scratch the surface to see \nthe deep divisions among Democrats.\n  The reason that the President has offered up no plan to reduce \nspending, and the reason Democrats have not passed a budget in over 800 \ndays, is because they are badly divided.\n  They all want the massive levels of new spending that the President \npushed through in his stimulus and ObamaCare. But not all want to pay \nfor it.\n  They all want to maintain existing levels of entitlement spending. \nBut not all want to raise the taxes necessary to pay for it.\n  They know that some of their constituents like all this spending, but \nthey know that the vast majority of Americans reject the President's \nfunding of his leviathan state through higher taxes.\n  So they do nothing.\n  The President has no plan.\n  I want to repeat that again.\n  The President has no plan.\n  Maybe if we shout it from the rooftops, the media will start to take \nnotice.\n  The President has no plan. And Senate Democrats don't either; \ncertainly not one that addresses our current fiscal crisis.\n  The critical issue we face is more than imminent default on our \nobligations. That is unlikely to happen. It certainly should not \nhappen. In my opinion, it will only happen if the President wants it to \nhappen. On Wednesday, I asked the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil, which is chaired by Secretary Geithner, to provide me and the \nrest of this institution with an assessment of the cash position of the \nUnited States. As Congress considers options for raising the debt \nceiling, it needs to know precisely how Treasury plans to pay its \nbills, and when it is going to fall short of cash to do so.\n  I asked that the Secretary respond to this reasonable request by \nyesterday afternoon. The Secretary chose not to respond. I want to be \nclear that this unresponsiveness by his Treasury Secretary is \nunacceptable. President Obama needs to understand that this failure to \nprovide the Senate with critical information is not tolerable and will \nnot be forgotten.\n  Still, I am confident that the Nation will get through this immediate \ncrisis, and there will be no default. But that is only part of the \nproblem. The real issue remains. The United States cannot support the \nlevel of spending President Obama has given us and that Democrats from \nthe New Deal onward have bequeathed to the Nation in the form of ever \nexpanding entitlement spending programs.\n  That is the real issue. And the majority leader's proposal does not \naddress this, any more than the President's White House bromides about \na balanced solution address it.\n  The real threat to this Nation is not the threat of a downgrade due \nto default.\n  The real long-term threat is a downgrade of the Nation's credit \nrating because President Obama has written checks that this country \ncan't cash.\n\n[[Page S5058]]\n\n  The real threat is that interest rates will go up for businesses, \nfamilies, students, homeowners and anyone who has to borrow money. The \neconomic ramifications of a downgrade threaten to bowl over our fragile \neconomy. Job creation remains weak. Annualized growth in real \ninflation-adjusted GDP was only 1.3 percent in the second quarter. This \nfollows on the heels of .4 percent growth in the first quarter.\n  Along with many others, I have said that if we do not get our \nspending under control, we are on a glide path to Greece and other \nEurozone countries whose credit ratings are destroyed and whose bonds \nhave junk status. Those countries would not have solved their problems \nby allowing the government to borrow more. Their only way out was to \nreduce the size of their welfare states.\n  Yet this is what the President, and the Treasury Secretary, and \ncongressional Democrats are suggesting as a solution. They would have \nyou believe that everything will be set right if only we give the \nPresident the legal authority to borrow an additional $2.7 trillion.\n  Americans are not buying this snake oil. I know that Utahns are not \nbuying it. They understand that our nation's fiscal problem is \nspending. Giving the President more power to borrow more money is not \ngoing to fix that problem. Reducing spending is going to fix that \nproblem.\n  The numbers could not be more clear.\n  As we can see, here are the Federal taxes and spending as a \npercentage of GDP. The red line is the spending line. We can see it is \nout of control in the 2012 Obama budget. The blue line is the average \nof what it has been in the past. We can see it is tremendously below \nwhere the President's budget is taking us.\n  Federal spending, as a share of our economy is trending at a pace 15 \nto 20 percent greater than its historical average of 20.6 percent of \nGDP. If we leave in place this year's level of taxation, including the \nmarginal rate relief of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and patch the \nalternative minimum tax--or AMT--the Federal tax take will equal or \nexceed its historic share of the economy.\n  Liberals suggest that the deficit and debt must be addressed through \ntax increases.\n  This is either deliberately misleading or sadly delusional.\n  Maybe we have found the truly shovel-ready policies of my friends on \nthe other side, and they smell like a freshly fertilized farmer's \nfield. Or maybe my friends on the other side simply refuse to come to \ngrips with reality. But sticking their heads in the sand is not an \noption here. The markets, and the American people, understand the \nnature of our crisis.\n  Non-defense discretionary spending is at historic levels. And our \nentitlement programs are headed for bankruptcy. This fiscal year we \nhave a projected budget deficit of $1.5 trillion.\n  We have a debt of over $14.3 trillion.\n  President Obama's budget assumes $13 trillion in new debts. This \nspending needs to be brought to heel. But the proposal of the majority \nleader does not get the job done.\n  It allows for the largest debt ceiling increase in history.\n  This makes sense. President Obama has given us the largest deficits \nin our history, and his borrowing needs are historic as well.\n  To pay for his political science experiment to turn the United States \ninto Sweden, he earlier required a $1.9 trillion debt limit increase. \nThat was the largest in the Nation's history.\n  But now he is coming back for another $2.7 trillion.\n  Conservatives understand that this is not sustainable. It is one \nthing to raise the debt limit. It is another thing to do so without \nreforms that would keep us from getting into a fiscal crisis of this \nmagnitude again. That is why I, and many others in Congress, pledged to \nvote against a debt ceiling increase prior to the institution of \nimmediate spending cuts and spending caps, and sending a strong \nbalanced budget amendment with taxpayer protections to the States for \nratification.\n  To be clear, that commitment to cut, cap, balance passed the House \nwith bipartisan support. The Senate could have taken up that bill last \nweek, but Democrats chose to table it rather than debate it. And the \nPresident chose to tell us what he did not support rather than what he \ndoes support.\n  Any increase in the debt limit needs to be accompanied by serious \nspending reductions, but the bill of the majority leader does not get \nus there. All it does is provide President Obama with an opportunity to \nborrow more money to pay for more spending.\n  The President would get a $2.7 trillion debt limit increase but less \nthan $1 trillion in cuts.\n  And most of those cuts are gimmicks. They assume savings from war \nspending that the President has not requested and that is unlikely to \nmaterialize.\n\n  It does not include a balanced budget amendment. And most importantly \nfrom my perspective, it assumes a massive tax increase in 2013 by \nallowing the 2001 and 2003 tax relief to expire, allowing the AMT to \nhit middle-class taxpayers, and allowing for increases in estate taxes \nthat are a small business and job killer.\n  You won't see that though in the talking points. They bury the \nbreadth of that tax hit in their baseline assumptions.\n  But we know that President Obama and his liberal allies are planning \nmassive tax increases on the middle class. While their rhetoric \nsuggests that we can fix out debt crisis just by raising taxes on the \nrich and closing loopholes, the reality is that they are setting the \nstage to roll back tax expenditures.\n  And cutting back tax expenditures will be a tax increase on middle \nincome itemizers.\n  When Democrats talk about tax expenditures, they are talking about \nyour ability to purchase a home, or save for retirement, or give to \nyour church, or put away money for your children's education.\n  That is where the money is. It is not in bonus depreciation for \ncorporate jets. And it is not in tax benefits for energy companies. It \nis not in changing the treatment of carried interest for private equity \ncompanies. It is not in repealing the deduction for mortgage interest \nrelated to yachts used as second homes.\n  This issue of tax expenditures is confusing and demands greater \nclarity. As ranking member of the Finance Committee, it is my \nresponsibility to correct the record on what the curtailment or \nelimination of tax expenditures would really mean for taxpayers and \nfamilies.\n  I have spoken about tax expenditures a number of times in the last \nfew weeks, but given the failure of the President and his congressional \nallies to take on our spending crisis, I want to reemphasize the \nessential point--if Democrats are allowed to balance the budget their \nway, it will result in new tax burdens for the middle class.\n  Tax expenditures are not ``spending through the tax code.'' They are \nan opportunity for you to keep more of your own money.\n  And they are not, by and large, special interest benefits that \ndisproportionately benefit wealthy taxpayers. The Democrats' rhetoric \non expenditures does not jibe with the reality of our Tax Code. The \ndata are clear. Tax expenditures tend to skew towards taxpayers below \nthe President's definition of the rich.\n  Let's work through some examples of what concrete proposals to \ncutback tax expenditures would yield in revenue and what they will mean \nto middle income Americans.\n  I am going to take a look at the budget outline presented by our \nfriend and colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee. The Senate Democratic Caucus outline was discussed among the \nlarger Democratic Caucus. Republican members, including long-standing \nBudget Committee members, were briefed by reading the details of the \noutline in the Washington Post. The Senate Democratic budget called for \n$2.38 trillion in tax increases when measured against the current \npolicy baseline. The current policy baseline represents the level of \ntaxation Americans are currently paying.\n  According to materials released by Senate Budget Committee Democrats, \nthey are looking at three categories of tax increases.\n  The first category would raise marginal rates on single taxpayers \nwith $500,000 and over in income and married couples with $1,000,000 \nand over in income. For those taxpayers, including many small business \nowners, the marginal rates would rise by 17 percent.\n\n[[Page S5059]]\n\nAccording to the Tax Policy Center, the TPC, a think tank often cited \nby our friends on the other side--certainly not a conservative think \ntank--at least 38 percent of flowthrough income, much of it small \nbusiness income, would be subject to the marginal rate hike.\n\n  The marginal rate on capital gains and dividend income would rise by \n33 percent. Keep in mind the IRS Statistics of Income group reports \nthat 65 percent of capital gains income would be hit by this tax hike. \nAdd in the tax increases from ObamaCare, and in less than 18 months the \nmarginal rates on capital gains and dividends will rise by 59 percent. \nIs that a positive signal for investors to move capital into projects? \nThat tax hike represents $380 billion of tax increases in the \nDemocratic budget.\n  Now, look at this chart, the Senate Democratic budget tax increases. \nThe total tax increases needed are $2.380 trillion. They suggest, No. \n1, raise the marginal rates on singles over $500,000 and married \ncouples over $1,000,000. That would be $380 billion. No. 2, closing \ncorporate loopholes and curtailing offshore tax evasion is $262 \nbillion. After that, the remaining tax increases needed from tax \nexpenditures would be $1.738 trillion.\n  So, again, we would take the total tax increases needed--$2.380 \ntrillion--reduce that by the $380 billion gained from raising the \nmarginal rates on singles earning over $500,000 and married couples \nover $1,000,000 and closing corporate loopholes and curtailing offshore \ntax evasion with $262 billion, and the remaining tax increases needed \nfrom the tax expenditures alone would be $1.738 trillion.\n  The second category of tax increases in the Democratic budget is a \nset of concepts we have heard about for years in Senate floor speeches. \nPresident Obama frequently refers to them as well. We also see these \nconcepts mentioned in the vast left-of-center DNC think tank \nestablishment and by liberal pundits. They fall into two groups of \nproposals: The first group is closing corporate loopholes, and the \nsecond group is curtailing offshore tax avoidance or evasion.\n  Again, as you can see, they want to increase taxes by $2.380 trillion \nby raising the marginal rates on singles earning over $500,000 and \nmarried couples earning over $1,000,000, which is $380 billion. Then \nthey want to close corporate loopholes and curtail offshore tax \nevasion, and they think they can save $262 billion on that. That still \nleaves $1.738 trillion.\n  The Finance Committee Republican staff compiled all known, specified, \nand scored proposals in these two groups. Staff calculated the \nproposals as summing $642 billion over 10 years. The numbers are Joint \nCommittee on Taxation scores.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na summary of the staff calculations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     Treasury estimates\n                                   JCT Estimates        (in billions)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOther revenue changes and                    $ 262                 $ 336\n loophole closers..............\nEliminate fossil-fuel                         40.7                  46.2\n preferences...................\nIncrease unemployment taxes....               47.4                  61.0\nSimplify the tax code..........

To President Obama's credit, he put his money where his \nrhetoric is. Most of the loophole closures and offshore measures were \ncontained in his budget.\n  If we subtract the two categories of tax increases, there remains \n$1.73 trillion in tax increases the Senate Democratic budget must find \nby cutting back tax expenditures.\n  Here we go again. This is a very important chart. I will remind \neveryone of something I mentioned in my first discussion of tax \nexpenditures. The Joint Committee on Taxation warns us that tax \nexpenditure figures are not the same as revenue estimates for policy \nchanges.\n  In March 2011, the CBO released a set of budget options for deficit \nreduction. On the revenue options, CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimated the proposals. There are a number of them that deal with \ncutbacks on tax expenditures.\n  If we start with the Senate Democratic budget's target of $1.73 \ntrillion, we can see an illustration of some policy options that tax \nwriters would have to consider. I have a chart that lists the revenue \nraised from some of these options.\n  Let's look at this chart. It may be difficult to read on a television \nmonitor, so I will go through these. These are tax expenditure policy \noptions from the Congressional Budget Office to raise revenue. In other \nwords, we have a tax to take away these tax expenditures.\n  No. 1 would be eliminate the deduction for State and local taxes. I \ndon't think many people are going to want that to happen.\n  No. 2, they will tax Social Security benefits similar to the defined-\nbenefit distributions. That is $438 billion right there in increased \ntaxes.\n  No. 3 is tax investment income from life insurance and annuities. \nThat is $260 billion.\n  No. 4, curtail the deductions for charitable giving. Can you believe \nthat? That is $219 billion.\n  No. 5, gradually eliminate the mortgage interest deduction. Take that \naway from people who buy homes?\n  That is $215 billion.\n  No. 6, eliminate the child tax credit. That is $117 billion.\n  No. 7, raise tax rates on capital gains. That is $49 billion.\n  No. 8, eliminate education tax benefits, which is $48 billion.\n  No. 9, reduce 401(k) contribution limits, which is $46 billion.\n  And No. 10, tax carried interest as ordinary income, which is $21 \nbillion.\n  Well, the first one should cause some concern to my friends on the \nother side. It would eliminate the State and local income and sales tax \ndeduction. The so-called blue States generally have very high local and \nState tax burdens. Eliminating that deduction would mean the \nconstituents of my friends representing those States will find \nthemselves with an effective tax increase of up to 35 percent. That is \nwhat they are doing to themselves. Eliminating this deduction would \nyield revenue of $862 billion over 10 years.\n  The second one would reduce the aftertax value of Social Security \nbenefits received by seniors. This CBO option would tax Social Security \nbenefits like we do employer-provided defined benefit retirement plans. \nFunny how much fur has flown over Social Security reform. Yet this \ncutback on Social Security benefits has flown under the radar. It \nappears not all tax expenditures are about corporate jets and yachts. \nThat proposal would raise $438 billion over 10 years. I mean, come on, \nhit Social Security for something like that?\n  Well, let's look at the third tax expenditure cutback option. That \nwould tax the inside buildup in life insurance. Here is an example. \nUnder current law, if a father and mother buy a $100,000 life insurance \npolicy and make the surviving spouse or children beneficiaries, death \nwill trigger a tax-free benefit of $100,000. Under this option, this \ntax expenditure--if they get rid of that--the difference between the \nface amount of\n\n[[Page S5060]]\n\nthe policy and premium payments would be taxable. According to the CBO \noption book, that new tax would raise $260 billion over 10 years. Who \nwants to do that?\n  The fourth on the list is a tax benefit near and dear to many of my \nfellow Utah families. It is the itemized deduction for charitable \ndonations. Under this option, only those deductions that exceed 2 \npercent of adjusted gross income would be deductible. For many Utahns \nwho tithe--and I am one of them--10 percent of our gross income, this \nwould mean an automatic cut of 20 percent of our deduction. This would \naffect not just Utahns but charitable givers all over the country. This \nproposal would reduce the tax benefit of charitable giving by $219 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  Now, the fifth one is well-known to tens of millions of our \nconstituents. It is the home mortgage interest deduction. If a taxpayer \nsaves up a down payment and borrows for a home, they can take the \ninterest paid on the mortgage as an itemized deduction. This proposal \nwould gradually eliminate the home mortgage interest deduction. In 10 \nyears, the deduction would be gone. This proposal would raise $215 \nbillion over 10 years.\n  The sixth tax expenditure cutback option involves the current $1,000-\nper-child tax credit. That credit drops to $500 per child in 18 months \nif the 2001-2003 tax relief plans are not extended. It is, by \ndefinition, limited to low- and middle-income taxpaying families. CBO \ntells us if we were to eliminate it, there would be $117 billion raised \nover 10 years.\n  The seventh tax expenditure cutback would partially eliminate the tax \nexpenditure for the lower rate on capital gains and dividends. It \nwould, in effect, eliminate 25 percent of that tax expenditure and \nsignificantly drive up capital gains and dividends rates. As I \nindicated earlier, the top marginal rate on capital gains and dividends \nis set to rise by 59 percent in less than 18 months if the President \nand my friends on the other side get their way. This option--though \ndescribed as a cutback on a tax expenditure--would drive that rate up \nhigher.\n  The marginal rate on two-thirds of capital gains income would be \ndriven up 72 percent. It would raise $49 billion, though, over 10 \nyears, for our tax-seeking friends.\n  The eighth tax expenditure cutback option would sharply curtail tax \nbenefits for families who send their kids to college. It would \neliminate the Hope Scholarship and lifetime learning credits and phase \nout the student loan interest deduction. For that half of the \npopulation that pays the freight in society, the 49 percent who pay \nincome tax, our friends on the other side are telling them their load \nis just going to get much heavier. That would be their message to \nmiddle-income American families who want to send their kids to college. \nThis option would raise $48 billion over 10 years.\n  The ninth tax expenditure cutback option would reduce limits on \ncontributions to retirement plans. About 50 percent of American workers \nparticipate in retirement plans. They save for their own retirement. \nThey do not look to rely only on Social Security. There is bipartisan \nconsensus that for America to remain prosperous, families and \nindividuals must save more during their working lives. Yet this option \nwould go in the other direction. It would mean less in retirement \nsavings. CBO says it would raise $46 billion over 10 years if we take \nthat one away.\n  Now, the tenth tax expenditure cutback option is one we have heard \nmuch about from my friends on the other side. It would tax partnership \ninterests--known as carried interest--like ordinary income rather than \ncapital gain. Interestingly enough, with a solidly Democratic Senate \nlast year, this revenue raiser did not pass. There is a lot of \nspeculation about that. I will not join it, but it is curious that when \nconstituencies that favor Democrats decisively raised legitimate \nconcerns about the possible negative effects on private equity and \nenterprise value, this proposal didn't quite make it past the finish \nline. That proposal would raise $21 billion over 10 years.\n  If you assume no interactive effects, the list of options I walked \nthrough adds up to $2.27 trillion in tax hikes. That is a lot more than \ncalled for by the Senate Democratic budget outline. Recall that outline \nproduced by Senate Democrats boiled down to $1.73 trillion in cutbacks \non tax expenditures. But look at how broad these tax hikes are. They \nhit big chunks of the 49 percent of American households who pay income \ntaxes.\n  Take a look at the chart again. This is a chart that confirms what \nmany of us have suspected. Although they might not come clean about it, \nwhen you look at the code and you look at our deficits, there is only \none place for Democrats to go if they are going to close the deficit \ntheir way, with no meaningful spending reductions. They are going to \nhave to hit tax expenditures, and specifically those that benefit \nmiddle-class itemizers.\n  They hit residents of blue States. They hit seniors. They hit \neveryone who owns a life insurance policy. They hit everyone who takes \nan itemized deduction for giving to their church, local food kitchen, \nor other charities. They hit everyone with a mortgage, everyone who \nreceives a child tax credit, and anyone with capital gains. They hit \nmiddle-income families and students who benefit from education tax \nbenefits. They hit those who save for retirement. They hit those folks \nwho start up businesses and take a future profits interest in the form \nof a capital gain. But to hear the President talk, you would think we \ncould get there by taxing corporate jets and yachts.\n  I am accustomed to the media carrying the water of liberal \npoliticians, but there has been a real dereliction of duty in allowing \nPresident Obama to get away with this. Even at this late date, he is \nstill getting away with it. He has no plan. Tell me. He has no plan. \nShow it to me. He talks about his plan, but we have yet to see it in \nwriting. In fact, there is no plan.\n  The press ridiculed Richard Nixon for his secret plan to end the war \nin Vietnam. But here we are in a catastrophic crisis, and President \nObama gets a pass when it comes to his secret plan to balance the \nbudget.\n  To suggest that a debt crisis triggered by $14.3 trillion in debt can \nbe fixed by taxing the luxuries of evil rich people is so childish and \nlacking in seriousness that the President should have been called out \non it immediately. But he wasn't. He was allowed to get away with it.\n  President Obama's balanced approach--he talks about a balanced \napproach all the time--one that includes meaningful reductions to his \nhistoric levels of spending, is a plan for economic stagnation and \nnational ruin, and it is a plan to bankrupt seniors.\n  He wants shared sacrifice. From whom? We were shown that the middle \nclass is going to get hit the hardest. I want shared prosperity by \ncutting back on spending and getting the Federal Government out of most \nof our lives in ways that are intrusive and costly, to being able to \nget jobs and raise jobs and do what has to be done in this country.\n  It is a plan to bankrupt our seniors. The President knows this, as do \nhis colleagues in Congress. He knows his supposed plan does nothing to \nfix the long-term trajectory of his deficit spending. So the question \nfolks need to ask is, what is he hiding? How does the left plan on \nclosing the gap and balancing the budget their way? The answer is the \nelimination or reduction of tax expenditures. And that means middle-\nclass tax increases. To hear my friends on the other side, you would \nthink the only folks hit by Democratic tax increases will be corporate \njet owners, yachtsmen, and millionaires. But when you peek behind the \nrhetorical curtain, you find that does not pan out. Most of the tax \nbase is in the middle and upper middle income families who make up that \n49 percent of Americans who are the only ones who shoulder the burden \nof the income tax.\n  We know that the recent numbers are the bottom 51 percent of all \nhouseholds do not pay income taxes. No, it is the 49 percent of \nAmericans who shoulder the burden of the income tax; that is where the \nmoney is. As I have shown with the CBO and Joint Committee on Taxation \noptions, that is where you have to go. Without a counterbalancing rate \ncut, this version of tax reform means fewer resources for home \nownership, retirement savings, and charitable giving.\n  But don't say I did not warn you. Those who want to treat tax \nexpenditures as some abstract budgetary honey pot risk having the folks \nwho\n\n[[Page S5061]]\n\nmake the honey, the taxpaying bees, to rightfully sting you. As one who \nhails from the Beehive State, I can tell you, you will feel the sting.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon to discuss \nour work toward addressing the national debt and staving off a \ncollision with our debt ceiling or a default on our financial \nobligations.\n  First, I wish to commend Majority Leader Reid for putting forward a \nproposal which would make a very serious $2.4 trillion downpayment on \ndeficit reduction and, most importantly, end the impasse over the debt \nceiling. I encourage my Republican colleagues to support it or offer \nsome reasonable changes that would allow them to support it.\n  But let me also address some developments on the other side of the \nCapitol, where an extremist group of House Republicans is continuing \ntheir ``my way or the highway,'' what President Lincoln called ``rule \nor ruin,'' approach to these negotiations.\n  Amazingly, news reports indicate that Pell grants--Pell grants--may \nbe put on the chopping block in Speaker Boehner's latest effort to \nappease the most extreme members of his party. This is getting \nridiculous. Rhode Island's great Senator Claiborne Pell first proposed \nthe grants that now bear his name. He envisioned a grant that would \nenable low-income students to attend our country's wonderful colleges \nand universities so they too could share in the American dream. Why do \nthese far-right extremists in the House want to snuff that out?\n  In 1976, the first year Pell grants were fully funded, a full Pell \ngrant paid 72 percent of the cost of attendance at a typical 4-year \npublic college. Today, a full Pell grant covers 34 percent of those \ncosts, and even that they are willing to attack. This vital assistance \nfrom Pell grants can often mean the difference between being able to \nattend college or not. With many families in Rhode Island and across \nAmerica still struggling in this struggling economy, we should be \nlooking for ways to strengthen Pell grants, not weaken them. America \nneeds more college graduates, not fewer.\n  During my time in the Senate, we have taken steps to improve the Pell \ngrant program. After 4 years of level funding under President Bush, we \nbegan to increase the maximum grant from $4,050 in academic year 2006-\n2007 to $5,050 for this coming academic year. We also increased the \nminimum family income that automatically qualifies a student for the \nmaximum Pell grant, a change which better reflects today's economic \nrealities.\n  Despite the clear need for continued investment in our future through \nPell grants, a need that has long had bipartisan support and backing, a \ngroup of House Republicans this year began an outright assault on Pell \ngrant funding. These grants are needed more than ever, as the economic \ndownturn has led more people to seek higher education in an effort to \nfind a job. But not to this band of extremists. The House Republican \nbudget would have slashed Pell grants, reducing the average award by \n$1,775, and cutting off more than 1.3 million Americans, including \nnearly 5,800 students in Rhode Island.\n  I understand the need to find savings in the Federal budget and to \nmake difficult choices, and Leader Reid's proposal offers up $2.4 \ntrillion worth. But we could also make bad choices in going about this, \nand of all the bad choices we could make, cutting Pell grants is among \nthe worst. America needs a highly trained workforce, and Pell grants \nhelp make the promise of a college education a reality.\n\n  After America spoke out and the Senate defeated the extreme House \nRepublican budget, I hoped the assault on the Pell grant was behind us, \nat least for a while. Yesterday, however, The Hill, a newspaper here in \nWashington, reported that some Republican House Members are opposing \nSpeaker Boehner's debt ceiling increase bill over funding if it \nprovides for Pell grants. In this article, someone called Pell grants \nwelfare. Some welfare, helping kids afford college and pursue their \ndreams. Today there is talk that cuts to Pell grants are being \ndiscussed as the pound of flesh required by the most far-right Members \nof the Speaker's caucus as the price of supporting his bill. Remember \nthat these House Republicans continue to protect every tax giveaway to \nspecial interests, every one, while they want to cut off access to \ncollege for regular kids.\n  The simple fact is Pell grants help lower income people achieve \ndreams of college and improve those young people's prospects for \ncareers and employment. It is good for them and it is good for America. \nThe Pell grant program doesn't give a free ride, but it does give a \nboost and is a wise investment in the future of our country, a future \nwhere the fates of nations will depend on the education of their \npeople.\n  Earlier this week, student and education advocacy organizations, \nincluding the Education Trust, Campus Progress, the National Council of \nLaRaza, and the United States Student Association, joined together to \n``Save Pell.'' I applaud their advocacy and commitment in fighting for \nPell grants, and I am proud to join their effort. I strongly urge the \nfar-right extremists who are pulling their party and the House of \nRepresentatives and this country over the cliff to end their reckless \nattack on the American middle class, take the victory you have been \noffered, and stop the damage.\n  Ronald Reagan in 8 years I believe raised the debt ceiling 18 times. \nThe Tea Party has been here 6 months and has put the country on the \nbrink of default days away. Instead, I ask my colleagues to work with \nDemocrats on a bipartisan solution that does not attack the fundamental \nunderpinnings of a successful middle class, such as Medicare, Social \nSecurity, Pell grants. Avert the looming debt ceiling collision and \nreduce our deficits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. THUNE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue with the call of the roll.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll, and the \nfollowing Senators entered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n                             [Quorum No. 4]\n\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Durbin\n     Johanns\n     Lautenberg\n     McConnell\n     Merkley\n     Murray\n     Pryor\n     Reid (NV)\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Thune\n     Whitehouse\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Yes, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is it the majority leader's intention, after we have \nthe vote on tabling the proposal that came over from the House, to file \ncloture on the Reid budget?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend, we would be happy to have that \nvote tonight. And I will also mention to my friend that the House of \nRepresentatives intends to vote on the Reid amendment tomorrow \nafternoon at 1 o'clock. In order to accommodate the schedules of \nSenators, we would be more than happy to accommodate the majority and \nhave the vote on the Reid budget tonight.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair, I say to my friend, the \ndistinguished Republican leader, let's hope they are more timely on \ntheir 1 o'clock vote than they have been in the last few days.\n  I would say this very directly: We would be happy to have a vote on \nthe Reid amendment just like the House did today, a majority vote. We \nhave gotten into a situation that is untoward. Everything that moves is \na supermajority. That isn't the way it should be. So we are happy to \nhave a vote anytime. But it should be a majority vote just like the \nHouse had. They had a majority vote today, and they had an overwhelming \nextra vote of none. So we would be happy to have a simple majority vote \non the Democratic proposal that we are putting forward.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is that a consent?\n  Mr. REID. That is a consent that we will be happy to have a vote if \nit is a simple majority vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nsay that this is almost an out-of-body experience to have someone \nsuggest a 50-vote threshold on a matter of this magnitude in the \nSenate. I am perplexed, Mr. President--genuinely perplexed--that my \nfriend, the majority leader doesn't want to vote on his proposal as \nsoon as possible. I object.\n  Mr. REID. Let's have order. Let the Republican leader be heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  Mr. REID. So it is obvious to the world that in the Senate this is \nnow another filibuster. That is what this is; it is a filibuster to \nstop us from moving forward on legislation. This is a filibuster in any \nname that you want.\n  I am disappointed. I asked for a rollcall vote on the tabling motion. \nI ask that we move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the motion to concur.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 41, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 120 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     DeMint\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Lee\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Paul\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--41\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Brown (MA)\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Enzi\n     Grassley\n     Heller\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kirk\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Toomey\n     Wicker\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I oppose the motion to table the motion to \nconcur in the House amendment to S. 627, the Budget Control Act of \n2011. Although I do not support the bill as written, I believe that the \nSenate should proceed to it in an effort to amend the bill to include \ngreater spending cuts, caps, and provisions which will boost our \neconomy like progrowth tax and regulatory reform.\n  I strongly oppose the proposal put forth by Senate Majority Leader \nReid. The bill is filled with accounting gimmicks and does nothing to \nencourage enactment of a constitutional balanced budget amendment--an \nessential step towards ending our unsustainable deficits and debt that \nenjoys bipartisan support in both Chambers of Congress. Amazingly, as \nour economy continues to struggle, the Reid proposal appears to assume \na tax hike upwards of $3 trillion, which would kill jobs and impede \nefforts to grow the economy and reduce our staggering debt in the \nprocess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                Motion to Concur With Amendment No. 589\n\n(Purpose: To cut spending, maintain existing commitments, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment to \nS. 627 with an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment to my \ninstructions, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 593 to amendment No. 592.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the amendment, strike ``2 days'' and insert ``1 day''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. REID. If my friend the Republican leader wishes to speak, I, of \ncourse, would withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the majority leader.\n  I wish to commend the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, for his \ndetermination and perseverance.\n  It wasn't easy, but Speaker Boehner has been working tirelessly over \nthe past few months and especially over these past few days to build \nconsensus within his party and to pass a bill through the House that \nwould end this crisis and take an important step toward getting our \nfiscal house in order.\n  While Democrats in the Senate have been over here plotting about how \nthey can prevent a solution to this crisis, Speaker Boehner rolled up \nhis sleeves and did the hard work needed to prevent the crisis. So I \nthank him for taking his responsibilities as a legislator, as a leader, \nand as a citizen so seriously and getting the job done. He and the \nother Republicans in the House have now passed two bills that would not \nonly end this crisis, but would actually do something about its root \ncause.\n  They know as well as I do that Washington cannot continue to borrow \n40 cents of every dollar it spends and not expect a reckoning. It may \nnot be this Tuesday. But unless we do something to rein in our spending \nand our debt an even bigger crisis will come. That is why House \nRepublicans have insisted on including a provision in the legislation \nthey just passed that would only allow Congress to raise the debt \nceiling if it also passes a law that requires Washington to balance its \nbooks.\n  This isn't exactly a radical proposal.\n  If Congress's inability to live within its means is the reason for \nthis crisis, then why not pass a law that requires it? It makes perfect \nsense to almost everybody in America except a few hundred Democrats in \nWashington.\n  But that has been the story of this whole summer.\n  A lot of people look at Washington right now and say what they are \nseeing is a dysfunctional government. This isn't dysfunction. What you \nsee in Washington right now is Democrats refusing to admit they've got \na spending problem, and fighting any attempt to get it under control.\n  That is what this is all about.\n  Just take a look at what has been happening here in the Senate over \nthe past 48 hours.\n  Rather than do their duty and come up with a bill that can pass, \nSenate Democrats have been busy ginning up opposition to everything \nelse. Senate Democrats have not offered a single solution to this \ncrisis that has a chance of passing either Chamber in Congress. Think \nabout that: we have been staring at this deadline for months. And the \nmajority party in the Senate hasn't even made the effort to come up \nwith a solution that could pass a Chamber they control!\n  They have put all their energy into defeating everything else.\n  The majority leader claims he has a plan.\n  Well, here is what it does.\n  It asks Congress to make the largest debt ceiling increase in \nhistory, without paying for it.\n  It creates a committee that has no real power to generate more \nsavings down the road.\n  And it doesn't require us to balance our books.\n  Until yesterday, the only reason Senate Democrats had for opposing \nthe House bill was that it didn't raise the debt limit beyond the next \nPresidential election.\n  Yesterday, they came up with another excuse. They said the debt limit \nincrease doesn't last long enough to provide certainty to the markets.\n  Leave aside the fact that Democrats have spent the last 2\\1/2\\ years \nperfecting the art of creating economic uncertainty.\n  Leave that aside.\n  The fact is, of the 31 times the debt limit has been raised over the \npast 25 years, 22 lasted less than a year. And I don't recall any of \nthe Democrats who voted for those increases expressing any concern \nabout economic uncertainty.\n  The simple truth is this: Senate Democrats have no good reason \nwhatsoever for opposing the bill the House just passed.\n  This bill was actually negotiated in direct consultation with the \nDemocrat leaders who now claim to oppose it.\n  You want proof? Well, ask yourself this: why does the Reid bill have \nthe same title as the bill the House just passed? Coincidence? Why do \nthe two bills contain pages of identical text? Coincidence? Look \nthrough it yourself.\n  Look at the Democrat priorities that are in there. How do you think \nthey got in there?\n  I will tell you how: because they put them in there.\n  So it is an absolute mystery to me why any Democrat in the Senate \nwould have opposed that bill.\n  There isn't an argument against it that is left standing. And we \nwould all be voting to approve it right now if President Obama hadn't \ntold Democrats to oppose it last weekend. The only reason--the only \nreason--we are\n\n[[Page S5064]]\n\neven still talking about this crisis is because the President of the \nUnited States doesn't want to have another debate about his own fiscal \nrecklessness before his next election.\n  One more thing.\n  Just so there is no doubt that Democrats in Congress have abdicated \ntheir responsibility by failing to produce a solution of their own, I \nhave a suggestion. Let's test out the Reid bill. Let's call it up and \nvote on it tonight. See how it does. Let's see the fruits of the \nDemocrats' labors. Let's see what they came up with as this crisis \napproached.\n  The Speaker has sent over two bills that could end this crisis now. \nLet's call up the majority leader's bill and see if it will fly. And if \nit doesn't, then let's take up the House bill, pass it, and end this \ncrisis now.\n  But Republicans have done our job.\n  Mr. President, I just wanted to ask my friend one more time. We have \nhere a situation where the Senate has voted to table, in effect, the \nHouse-passed measure and the majority leader has filled up the tree and \nfiled cloture on his proposal. As I indicated earlier, every single \nmember of my conference here in the Senate would be happy to move up \nthat vote.\n  As we all know, the markets are waiting to see if we are going to \nact. It strikes me that it might make sense for all of us on a \nbipartisan basis to go on and act as rapidly as possible. I believe \nevery Member of the Senate has pretty well determined how they would \nvote on cloture on the motion to proceed to my friend's measure. \nTherefore, I would again ask consent that we immediately proceed to a \nvote on invoking cloture on the Reid amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is very obvious there should be a vote on \nmy amendment and it should be with a simple majority. That is the way \nit has traditionally been in this body until the Republicans have tried \nto establish a supermajority, which doesn't work. This is a filibuster. \nThis is something that should not be filibustered. They should back off \nthe filibuster and let us vote. Let us vote. That is where we are. We \nfeel very strongly on this side that if the House can pass something \nwith a simple majority, so can we.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is noted.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I don't want to belabor this. I would \njust finally point out that we are in the rather curious position that \nthe House of Representatives tomorrow at 1 p.m. will vote on the Reid \nproposal before my friend and his conference are willing to let us vote \non his proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we know that if the legislation in the House \nof Representatives had required a supermajority, we would not be \ndealing with the Boehner--I am trying to say a nice word--the Boehner \nlegislation. We wouldn't be doing that.\n  We are here now. We have tried our utmost to come up with a fair \nproposal that deserves an up-or-down vote. It is fair. It reduces the \ndebt by $2.4 trillion. In fact, most every bit of it includes material \nthat the House has voted on before, the Senators have voted on before. \nIt is something we should do. It is fair.\n  We have tried to compromise. That is not a bad word. I had a \ntentative meeting set with some Republican Senators this afternoon. The \nmeeting didn't come to be. I have asked my friend the Republican leader \nto negotiate, and he has chosen not to do that. That is too bad.\n  I want to move forward. And if my friend wants to negotiate with \nothers, fine. My door has been open all day. But we are doing the right \nthing. We will not agree to a 6-month extension, putting our country in \njeopardy in just a few weeks. The Ryan budget has been out there \nwhacking Medicare, whacking Medicare fraud. The cut, cap, and whatever \nit was does the same thing.\n  What I have put forward is a fair proposal. It is something we should \ndo. It would get rid of the disaster that is facing us. It is the right \nthing to do.\n  The American people want us to work this out, and we have tried. We \nhave given. We have compromised. There has just been no give on the \nother side. In fact, Mr. President, it has been quite the opposite.\n  We had a wonderful agreement set up here between the two people who \nran the Budget Committee for years, Senators Conrad and Gregg, a \nwonderful proposal to move forward expedited procedures. What happened? \nWhen we moved to it, seven Republicans who sponsored the legislation \ndidn't vote for it. Then we moved forward with the Biden group. What \nhappened with that? The Republicans walked out of that meeting. We had \na situation where meetings were going on with the President. Leader \nCantor from the House walked out on that meeting. Speaker Boehner \nwalked out on the President twice. The Gang of 6, trying to work \nsomething out, one of the leaders--the most vocal leader of that group \ntook a sabbatical leave and stepped back in just a few days ago.\n  We have tried our utmost to negotiate something in fairness. We are \nwhere we are. We want an up-or-down vote on my proposal.\n  If the Republicans continue to filibuster this, they are going to \nhave to show at 1 o'clock Sunday morning or thereabouts that they are \ngoing to continue the filibuster. We are not going to give up on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think we all agree it is fairly \nroutine to have the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, particularly on a \nmatter of enormous significance such as this. It is almost unheard of \nto suggest that a matter of this magnitude would be dealt with at a 51-\nvote threshold.\n  Where are we? It is an interesting history lesson my friend gives us \nabout various debates we have had in the past, but this is where we are \nright now. Where we are right now is our good friends on the other side \ndo not want us to move forward with a vote on what they are advocating.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, we do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Majority vote.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S5064, July 29, 2011, the Record reads: Mr. DURBIN. \nMajority veto.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: Majority vote.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We just heard the majority leader talk about--could we \nhave order in the Senate, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We just heard the majority leader making the arguments \non the merits for his proposal. That is what we wish to move forward \nwith. We would be happy to have the vote on cloture on his measure \ntonight so we could move forward and finally get a resolution here. We \nhave the curious position the majority is in effect stopping action on \nits own proposal and the House of Representatives tomorrow will vote on \nthe Reid proposal, apparently before the Senate will vote on the \nproposal of the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, the Republican leader said we don't need to carry \nthis on forever. I agree with my friend. This legislation is of utmost \nimportance. It has great significance, as he said. All the more reason \nthere should not be a filibuster being conducted on this legislation. \nOur country is in the throes of an economic disaster. To think that \nthey would filibuster this, they are not negotiating, and that is why \nwe are at the last--we waited as long as we could to come forward with \nsomething that we would try to get through here. But we have not been \nable to do it because they have not negotiated in good faith. All the \nnegotiation has been with ourselves.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this evening, the Senate is considering S. \n627, as amended by the House of Representatives--the bill now called \nthe Budget Control Act of 2011. Earlier this week, the House Republican \nLeadership used a procedural maneuver to strip from this bill \nbipartisan provisions to strengthen the Freedom of Information Act, \nFOIA, that unanimously passed the Senate. I urge the Senate to restore \nthe bipartisan Leahy-Cornyn Faster FOIA Act of 2011, as originally and \nunanimously passed by the Senate in May, when the Senate considers its \nbudget bill.\n  The Faster FOIA Act enjoys broad bipartisan support from across the \npolitical spectrum. The Senate unanimously passed this bill in May, \nafter the Judiciary Committee favorably reported the bill by voice \nvote. Recently, more than 35 transparency organizations urged the House \nCommittee on\n\n[[Page S5065]]\n\nOversight and Government Reform to act on this legislation. On Tuesday, \nthe Washington Post editorialized that the House should promptly enact \nthis bipartisan bill to improve the FOIA process.\n  Senator Cornyn and I first introduced the Faster FOIA Act in 2005, to \naddress the growing problem of excessive FOIA delays within our Federal \nagencies. During the intervening years, the problem of excessive FOIA \ndelays has not gone away. We reintroduced this bill in 2010, and the \nSenate unanimously passed it last year. The current bill is the most \nrecent product of our bipartisan work to help reinvigorate FOIA.\n  The Faster FOIA Act would establish a bipartisan Commission on \nFreedom of Information Act Processing Delays to examine the root causes \nof excessive FOIA delays. The Commission would recommend to Congress \nand the President steps that should be taken to reduce these delays, so \nthat the administration of the FOIA is more equitable and efficient.\n  The Faster FOIA Act will help ensure the dissemination of government \ninformation to the American people, so that our democracy remains \nvibrant and free. This is a laudable goal that we all share. Neither \nChamber of Congress should allow partisan politics to obstruct the \nimportant goal of this bill.\n  The ongoing debate in Congress about the national debt has made clear \nthat we must find ways to work together, across party lines and \nideologies, to address the many challenges facing our Nation. This \nbipartisan spirit is at the core of the Faster FOIA Act. I have said \nmany times that open government is neither a Democratic issue, nor a \nRepublican issue it is truly an American value and virtue that we all \nmust uphold. I urge the Senate to include the Faster FOIA Act in its \nbudget bill, and I urge the Congress to promptly enact this good \ngovernment measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letters in \nsupport of reinstating the Faster FOIA Act in the final debt ceiling \npackage.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Sunshine in Government Initiative,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 29, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     U.S. House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     U.S. House of Representatives.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, \n     Speaker Boehner, and Minority Leader Pelosi: We urge the \n     Congress to reinstate the bipartisan, uncontroversial \n     language strengthening the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) \n     that was removed from S. 627, the Faster FOIA Act, as it was \n     amended to address the unrelated issue surrounding the debt \n     limit. The original language would create a bipartisan \n     commission to recommend concrete ways to strengthen \n     transparency in the federal government and has broad, \n     bipartisan support.\n       The Sunshine in Government Initiative is a coalition of \n     media associations promoting government transparency, \n     especially focusing on FOIA. SGI members include the American \n     Society of News Editors, the Associated Press, Association of \n     Alternative Newsweeklies, National Newspaper Association, \n     Newspaper Association of America, Radio Television Digital \n     News Association, Reporters Committee for Freedom of the \n     Press and Society of Professional Journalists.\n       Especially in this fiscal environment, the Faster FOIA \n     Commission would help the public understand how taxpayer \n     dollars are being spent by bringing together experts inside \n     and outside the government to look ``under the hood'' of \n     agency FOIA operations and to propose within a year the most \n     realistic, effective and cost-efficient improvements to \n     improve government transparency.\n       The Freedom of Information Act is the vital law that helps \n     ensure the public can see what its government is up to while \n     protecting personal privacy, national security, trade secrets \n     and other important interests. The Commission's work should \n     provide timely insight to help inform next steps that \n     Congress with your leadership might undertake to strengthen \n     transparency in the federal government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Rick Blum,\n     Coordinator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 28, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives, The Capitol, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, The Capitol, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, \n     Speaker Boehner and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the \n     undersigned organizations concerned with government openness \n     and accountability, we are writing to urge you to restore the \n     bipartisan Faster FOIA provisions in S. 627, now known as the \n     Budget Control Act of 2011.\n       This week, Speaker Boehner took S. 627 as a vehicle for his \n     budget bill. This procedural maneuver could shave a few days \n     off of Senate consideration, should the House pass the \n     Boehner budget control bill. However, in doing so, the \n     Speaker unnecessarily stripped the Faster FOIA Act from \n     S.627, completely replacing the language with the budget \n     bill. If the Faster FOIA language is not restored in S. 627, \n     the bipartisan progress made by the Senate on the legislation \n     will be wiped out. This is a setback for openness and \n     accountability in the executive branch, and bipartisan action \n     in Congress.\n       The Senate unanimously passed the Faster FOIA Act, authored \n     by Senator Leahy (D-VT) and Senator Cornyn (R-TX) in May. The \n     legislation would establish the Commission on Freedom of \n     Information Act (FOIA) Processing Delays (the Commission) to \n     examine several thorny issues that create unreasonable bars \n     to public access under the FOIA and recommend to Congress and \n     the President steps that should be taken to reduce delays and \n     make the administration of the FOIA equitable and efficient \n     throughout the federal government.\n       The Faster FOIA Act enjoys strong support among a broad \n     range of non-governmental organizations. Recently, more than \n     35 organizations joined to urge the House Committee on \n     Oversight and Government Reform to act on the legislation. A \n     recent editorial in the Washington Post also called on the \n     House to embrace the bill in the same bipartisan spirit as \n     the Senate in the interest of improving the FOIA process.\n       We urge you to advance openness and accountability to \n     restore the bipartisan Faster FOIA provisions in S. 627. We \n     thank you in advance for your consideration of our request.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Library Association, Citizens for Responsibility \n           and Ethics in Washington--CREW, Electronic Frontier \n           Foundation, Freedom of Information Center at the \n           Missouri School of Journalism, Fund for Constitutional \n           Government, National Freedom of Information Coalition, \n           National Security Archive, OMB Watch, \n           OpenTheGovernment.org, Project On Government \n           Oversight--POGO, Public Citizen, Reporters Committee \n           for Freedom of the Press.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5065-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5065-S5066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BROWN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I believe libraries are critical \ninstitutions to our Nation and our democracy. Today, I recognize one \nlibrary in particular, Brown University Library, for its 150th \nanniversary as Rhode Island's oldest Federal Depository Library.\n  The Federal Depository Library Program was established by Congress to \nensure that the American public could access government records and \ninformation locally. The 10 depository libraries in Rhode Island are \npart of a network of more than 1,200 libraries nationwide that provide \nfree access to Federal Government materials, both in print and online.\n  In 1861, under a newly enacted law granting each Senator the \nauthority to assign one depository in their State, Senator James F. \nSimmons designated the Brown University Library as an official \ndepository to receive U.S. Government publications. While Brown \nUniversity had been receiving government documents through various \nchannels since revolutionary times, this designation established Brown \nas the first depository library in Rhode Island and one of the earliest \nso designated libraries in the Nation.\n  For the past 150 years, the Brown University Library has helped \nstudents, faculty, and residents throughout Rhode Island find and use \ngovernment information. The collection at Brown contains a wide variety \nof government documents that reflect the rich history of Rhode Island \nand the Nation as a whole, including historical debates surrounding the \nadoption of the 13th amendment abolishing slavery and legislation \nauthored by my predecessor Senator Claiborne Pell establishing the \nNational Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the \nHumanities. It is also home to a wealth of information useful to Rhode \nIslanders, such as demographic\n\n[[Page S5066]]\n\ndata on the changing and diverse nature of the State's population; a \nvast array of health and wellness materials; and business and economic \nnews and reports.\n  Since 1994, Brown and other Federal depository libraries have worked \nin partnership with the U.S. Government Printing Office to make \ngovernment information in a digital format directly accessible to the \npublic via the Internet. First, through the GPO Access online system, \nand now through GPO's Federal Digital System, the American public has \nfree access to authenticated information from all three branches of the \nFederal Government.\n  Across the country, Federal depository libraries enable the public to \nstay informed on the workings of our government and provide free access \nto all types of essential information. Additionally, they play a vital \nrole in preserving the historical record of our democracy. I \ncongratulate Brown University Library for its 150 years of serving as a \nresource for the people of Rhode Island and am proud to celebrate an \ninstitution that is dedicated to informing Rhode Islanders and \nadvancing the values of our democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5066-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5066-S5067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVE JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today, with several of my colleagues \nto recognize the outstanding service and contribution of a fellow \nHoosier and life-long public servant, Dave Johnson.\n  Dave first joined my staff in 1987 and he has been a brilliant \nresource to me over the years since then. Dave is a truly gifted \nindividual. He is knowledgeable about all facets of agricultural and \nfood policy and is able to see all of the potential opportunities and \nchallenges with proposed legislation. Dave is always prepared to \ninteract with a Member on the Senate floor during consideration of \nagriculture legislation, and equally at ease in dealing with Indiana \nconstituents or farmers from anywhere in the United States. His mark \ncan be found on countless pieces of Senate food and agriculture \nlegislation, ranging from nutrition to biomass to conservation. Dave is \nalways an available and willing resource to members on the Agriculture \nCommittee, or other members from the Senate as a whole who seldom delve \ninto agricultural policy discussions.\n  Dave and I have shared one true passion over our years of service--\nnutrition. I have long been an advocate of nutrition programs, and \nspecifically a supporter of the school lunch program. It has been \nDave's dedicated counsel and advice that has helped to shape these \nimportant programs into what they are today. I remember that on one \noccasion, while traveling back home in southern Indiana, I learned from \nmy constituents of some of the deficiencies in a local summer \nchildren's nutrition program. I shared these concerns with Dave, and \nwithin a matter of days Dave responded to my request and had a bill on \nmy desk. That legislation proposed a pilot project, which was approved \nby Congress, and today has been expanded to a nationwide program.\n  Dave has never been intimidated by the vastness of diversity in \nagriculture. He has always been able to determine the appropriate \nsolution to a real problem, and then draft the implementing legislation \nto go along with it. He is never too busy to take the time to mentor \nyoung staff members by sharing his vast knowledge and experience, and \nhe is always willing to reach across the aisle to contribute to more \neffective results for American agriculture.\n  Dave, I don't know how we will write a farm bill without you. You \nwill be sincerely missed.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Dave Johnson for \n23 years of service to the Federal Government. I am very grateful for \nhis effective and dedicated leadership as chief counsel of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee during the time I served as chairman of the \nCommittee.\n  He also served in important jobs at the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as \nthe Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. The farm \nbills that Mr. Johnson helped draft during his career are impressive \nexamples of his insight and good judgment.\n  The far-reaching effects of his contributions to the field of \nagriculture are illustrated by the successes we have had as a Nation as \na result of our food and agriculture policies. I congratulate Dave \nJohnson for his impressive career of improving the quality of life of \nrural America.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Dave \non his 23 years of service as a public servant. His career, including \nservice in the Senate, the Department of Agriculture and the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission, has led him to be one of the \nmost influential staffers on legislation supporting farmers, ranchers \nand the less privileged across the country.\n  For those of us who have had the pleasure of knowing and working \nclosely with him, we know Dave as a true professional and an extremely \nthoughtful individual. His knowledge and experience have served as a \nvirtual encyclopedia for policy makers on this Committee and in the \nExecutive Branch. The talent and knowledge that Dave possesses reflects \na career of dedicated service that cannot be replicated or easily \nreplaced. His well-earned departure will create a void that will be \ndifficult to fill.\n  As I look back at Dave's career and the years I served as chairman of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee, I can say I am particularly proud of \nDave's work on nutrition and food assistance programs. I know my \ncolleagues and I can attest to Dave's care for and dedication to \nimproving the lives of the less privileged. His tireless efforts to \nsecure funding for the hungry and less privileged through the 1996 farm \nbill, the 1994 Child Nutrition Act and countless other pieces of \nlegislation are a testament to his sense of duty and his nonpartisan \napproach to identifying solutions that advance the promise of our great \nNation to all of our citizens. I was always honored to have his passion \nand advocacy for the disadvantaged on my side of the aisle.\n  Dave has made a real impact on the lives of all Americans and has \ndone so with a modest approach that sought solutions over recognition. \nDave is one of the most modest individuals I have ever met and I am \ncertain his modesty is born of his upbringing. Dave's approach to work \nin Washington, DC, has always been governed by the lessons he learned \non his family farm in rural Indiana. He does not boast of his many \nachievements nor lecture those who seek his counsel or advice. I have \nalways known him to be quiet and unpretentious in spite of his \nachievements and station. He has sought to act as a mentor to young \nstaffers and wise counsel to the Senators and policy makers who have \ncalled on him throughout the years.\n  On behalf of my former agriculture committee staff and for myself, I \nwant to thank Dave for his service to the U.S. Senate and to our \ncountry. I wish him the best as he moves on to his next adventure.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to echo my colleagues in \nrecognizing Dave Johnson for his commitment to public service. Having \nspent 23 years working on agriculture and food policy for the Federal \nGovernment, Dave has demonstrated a rare dedication to an industry that \nprovides food, feed, fiber and fuel to people all around the globe.\n  While serving as Secretary of Agriculture, I had the privilege of \nworking closely with Dave, who was Deputy Chief of Staff at the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. I fondly remember the many hours Dave spent \nputting pen to paper and drawing together our ideas into legislative \nlanguage for Congress to consider as part of the 2007-2008 farm bill \nprocess. His knowledge of agriculture policy and his work ethic were \ninvaluable to our efforts. The many hours we spent working on farm \npolicy led to a friendship that I continue to appreciate.\n  Twenty-three years is a long time to spend as a public servant and \nDave has earned our sincerest gratitude for his years of service to \nfarmers, ranchers, conservationists, nutrition advocates, rural \nAmericans and all those affected by USDA policies, who have directly or \nindirectly benefitted from his work.\n  I wish Dave the very best as he opens a new chapter in his life. I am \nconfident that with his positive attitude, principled approach and \ngenuinely kind heart, success will follow him down whatever path he \nchooses.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would like to take a few moments this morning to \nwander from regular order to recognize a long-\n\n[[Page S5067]]\n\ntime staffer and public servant who will be retiring next Friday.\n  August 5 will be Dave Johnson's last day as a Republican staffer on \nthe Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. It will \nalso be the end of a 23-year career in public service--most of that \nright here on this committee.\n  Dave has served me as ranking member since March. He previously \nserved as both the chief Republican counsel and deputy staff director \nof this committee. His service includes working for Chairman Lugar from \n1987 to 1991 and again from 1994 to 2003. He then served Chairman \nCochran from 2003 to 2005 and Chairman Chambliss from 2005 to 2007. And \nfrom 2007 to 2008 he served then-Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns \nas a deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He \nthen moved to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission where he served \nuntil we convinced him to come back and help us get up and running this \npast spring.\n  Dave's record speaks for itself. But I am not sure some understand \njust how valuable his service has been to this Committee and \nagriculture and nutrition policy.\n  As those who know Dave can tell you, his first love has been \nnutrition policy. He has worked on numerous child nutrition bills and \nthe nutrition title of no less than four farm bills, by my count. I \nalso know that if you sit down and visit with him, he'd probably tell \nyou that one of his proudest moments was the work he did on the 1996 \nWelfare Reform Act.\n  Dave has always been a straight shooter. He gives you the answers you \nneed to hear. But one of his greatest strengths is reminding you of the \nthings you haven't considered and need to think about. He has been a \ntremendous mentor to young staff on both sides of the aisle and he was \noften the first stop many of them made when looking for advice on how \nto learn the ropes of the committee.\n  Finally, Dave's attention to detail and proofing proposed legislation \nis legendary. If you are scrubbing a bill and making sure it is done \nright, his is the set of eyes you want on it. A member of my staff was \nonce told by a former member of the Senate Parliamentarian's office \nthat a farm bill Dave had helped write and scrub was ``among the best \nwritten bills we've ever seen come through the Senate.''\n  That pretty much sums up Dave's service to this committee. Dave, as a \nformer bucket-toter myself, thank you for your years of service to our \ncountry, the Senate, the members of this Committee and our \nconstituents. You have been a true public servant and we all wish you \nonly the best as you head home to Indiana.\n  Job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5067-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE READY SCHOOLS ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, August marks the start of a new \nschool year for more than 1.8 million students in Ohio. It is a time of \nexcitement and nervousness as students prepare for challenging classes, \ndifferent classmates, and new teachers.\n  As the summer winds down, high school students are cramming in the \nsummer reading that they pushed off in favor of a bike ride with \nfriends or a game of baseball. Middle school students are crossing \ntheir fingers in hopes that their best friend from the last school year \nis in their class this year. And soon-to-be kindergarteners are \npracticing their numbers and letters in preparation of their first day \nof elementary school.\n  Student readiness for kindergarten is generally defined by the Ohio \nSchool Readiness Initiative as a child who has age-appropriate \ncognitive and social skills and a healthy mind and body. Student \nreadiness can be fostered through a child's participation in high-\nquality and developmentally appropriate preschool programs like Head \nStart. These programs are important because if a child is not prepared \nfor elementary school, they are more likely to fall behind their \nbetter-prepared peers and remain behind as they progress through \nschool.\n  However, it is equally important that schools are prepared to accept \nand support all students as they arrive at the schoolhouse door. \nStudent readiness also means school readiness.\n  That is why I am introducing The Ready Schools Act of 2011 with my \ncolleague Senator Kay R. Hagan of North Carolina. This legislation \nincorporates the recommendations of a report conducted by the \ncongressionally commissioned National Education Goals Panel, which \nstates that elementary ``school readiness'' involves not only preparing \neach child for school, but also preparing schools to support each \nchild's learning and development needs.\n  The Ready Schools Act of 2011 would require title 1 eligible Local \nEducational Agencies to work with their elementary schools to develop a \nready-school needs review. This review would focus on ways an \nelementary school can develop policies that would create a positive \nschool environment. It would help teachers provide students with \ndevelopmentally and culturally appropriate curriculums. Finally, it \nwould empower collaboration with early childhood education providers in \nthe school attendance area to ensure a smooth transition from preschool \nto elementary school.\n  In my State of Ohio, the SPARK Ohio partnership has led the way in an \neffort to make every school a ``ready'' school. Through a strong \npartnership comprised of the Sisters of Charity, the Ohio Department of \nEducation, the WK Kellogg Foundation and others, SPARK Ohio has helped \ndeveloped a ``ready'' school needs review that is now a national model. \nI am proud of these efforts, and the hard work of the students, \nadministrators, teachers, and families that have ensured the success of \nthe more than 40 ``ready'' schools in Ohio.\n  The Ready Schools Act is about more than making our schools the best \nthey can be. It is about making Ohio, and all States in the Nation, the \nbest they can be. By strengthening the alignment and delivery of early \neducation, our youngest students can continue on a path of academic and \nlife achievement. Research shows that third-grade reading skills can \nserve as an indicator of whether or not a student will graduate from \nhigh school. And not only is school readiness an educational \nimperative, it is an economic one as well. High school students \ndropping out from the class of 2010 alone will cause the State of Ohio \nover $10 billion in lower lifetime earnings, higher health care costs, \nand crime related costs.\n  The building blocks critical to a lifetime of learning are laid \nduring the elementary school years. This is why I am proud to introduce \nthe Ready Schools Act. It will not only improve our system of education \nbut will ultimately lead to a stronger nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5067-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5067-S5068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO HAL DAVID\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the 90th \nbirthday of Hal David, a wonderful lyricist who has entertained the \nworld with his delightful songs for more than half a century.\n  Born in Brooklyn, Hal David developed a talent for music at an early \nage while studying violin and playing in bands. His first hit record \ncame in 1949 with ``The Four Winds and the Seven Seas'' by Vic Damone. \nDuring the 1950s, David began his legendary collaboration with composer \nBurt Bacharach, and the two created hit songs such as ``Walk on By,'' \n``I'll Never Fall in Love Again,'' ``The Look of Love,'' and ``What the \nWorld Needs Now Is Love.'' Hal's talents earned him four Academy Award \nnominations, including an Oscar for ``Raindrops Keep Falling on My \nHead'' from the film ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid''; and an \ninduction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Nashville \nSongwriters Hall of Fame.\n  Hal David has also fought to protect and promote other songwriters. \nAs president of the American Society of Composers, Authors and \nPublishers, ASCAP, he worked tirelessly to protect the intellectual \nproperty rights of musicians. As chairman & CEO of the Songwriters Hall \nof Fame, he helped create the Songwriters Hall of Fame Gallery at the \nGrammy Museum in Los Angeles.\n  Hal David's extraordinary songs will continue to touch the lives and \nhearts of future generations. I invite all of my colleagues to join me \nin honoring Hal David as he celebrates his 90th birthday.\n\n[[Page S5068]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5068-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          ISABEL, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I recognize \nthe community of Isabel, SD, on reaching the 100th anniversary of its \nfounding. Located in Dewey County, Isabel has a strong farming and \nranching tradition, which has been passed on through the generations. \nIsabel will celebrate its centennial August 2-7, 2011.\n  Isabel began its settlement in the spring of 1910 along the Milwaukee \nRailroad and the town became a legal corporation on March 13, 1911. \nIsabel was named for the daughter of President Earling of the Milwaukee \nRailroad. With its vast prairie, Isabel was a prime location for cattle \nand sheep ranching. The Homestead Act of 1908 encouraged pioneers to \nmove West and these pioneers built the first stores and businesses in \nIsabel. Businesses allowed local farmers and ranchers to thrive and \nbecame hallmarks of the community.\n  Isabel will celebrate its 100th anniversary with an All School \nReunion, a parade, two rodeos, powwows, and dances. Isabel's centennial \ncelebration will also include a wagon train and trail ride, which will \nretrace an old wagon route to neighboring settlements.\n  Isabel's strong sense of community helped the town endure challenges \nin its early settlement, including the severe drought of 1911. Isabel \ncontinues to be a steadfast farming and ranching community today. I am \nproud to honor Isabel on its 100th anniversary. Isabel holds the \nvirtues and values that lay at the very heart of South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5068-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO J.

Michael Miley, as he nears the end of his term as the 106th \nchairman of the Nation's largest insurance association, the Independent \nInsurance Agents & Brokers of America, IIABA. Mike is an executive with \nthe Gibson Insurance Group in Plymouth, IN, and was installed as the \nassociation's chairman last September.\n  Mike began his insurance career in 1973 and joined the Gibson \nInsurance Group in 1983. His relationship with the IIABA began in 1978, \nwhen he became a member of the Marshall-Fulton-Starke Counties \nIndependent Insurance Agents Association, ultimately climbing the ranks \nto serve as its president. During his affiliation with the Independent \nInsurance Agents of Indiana, IIAI, Mike served at numerous posts, and \nwas elected to the executive committee of IIAI and served as president \nin 1995. He was elected Indiana's State national director to the board \nof IIABA in 1997.\n  Over the years, Mike has been the recipient of numerous awards, \nincluding the 1987 Chairman of the Year Award for his work on the New \nProducts and Services Committee, Indiana Agent of the Year Award both \nin 1989 and 2006, Honorary Commissioner of Insurance in 1990, and in \n1991 he was the first recipient of the Harry P.

Mr. President, today I recognize Rapid City, SD. \nRapid City has recently been designated America's ``Most Patriotic \nTown'' by Rand McNally and USA Today in their inaugural Best of the \nRoad competition, which recognizes achievements of small towns across \nthe country. Rapid City will be one of five towns featured on USA \nToday's Web site, www.bestoftheroad.com, and featured in the new 2013 \nRand McNally Atlas.\n  Rapid City is the second-largest city in South Dakota and is located \non the eastern slope of the Black Hills in the western part of the \nState. Nearby Mount Rushmore National Memorial and Ellsworth Air Force \nBase make Rapid City a patriotic mecca. However, I believe it is not \nthe location but the people of Rapid City that gave the town the honor \nof being named the most patriotic town in America.\n  The citizens of Rapid City live their lives in support of both their \ncommunity and their country. This patriotic town strives for excellence \nwhile its residents live the American dream. I would like to offer my \ncongratulations to the citizens and the community of Rapid City on this \naccomplishment and wish them continued prosperity in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5068-4", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5068-5", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5068-6", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:05 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2056.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \nthe establishment of a commercial truck safety program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Commercial Truck \nSafety Act of 2011 to address one of my top priorities, and one of my \nconstituents' greatest concerns in recent years, keeping trucks on the \nInterstate Highway System whenever and wherever possible.\n  Improving truck safety has been one of my key concerns for more than \na decade. What seemed like a simple task so many years ago has become a \nlong battle, fighting for common sense changes that would allow all \ntrucks in Maine to use the Interstate system.\n  In 2009, Senator Collins and I, and our colleagues from Vermont, were \nable to secure a one-year pilot program that allowed 100,000-pound \ntrucks on Interstates in Maine. The program reinforced the need for a \npermanent change to the outdated and inconsistent regulations that \ngovern the weight of trucks on our Interstate highways.\n  During the 2009-2010 pilot program, there were 14 fewer crashes, a 10 \npercent improvement, involving six-axle vehicles, even with increased \ntraffic volume on Maine's Interstate system. In fact, there were no \nfatal crashes on the Interstate during the pilot program, and 5 fewer \ninjuries on secondary roads.\n  Maine's Department of Transportation collects fatal accident data \nregarding large trucks, and more than 96 percent are on secondary \nroads, not the Interstate, including the portion of 1-95 that has a \npermanent exemption. Crash rates for Maine trucks on secondary roads \nare 7 to 10 times higher than on Interstate highways.\n  Trucks belong on the highway, but Interstate highway weight limits \nare inconsistent across state lines, and shippers are forced to use \nsecondary roads to move goods through states still restricted by weight \nlimits established decades ago. In the 122 miles between Hampden and \nHoulton, Maine, a common route for shippers, these legal 100,000-pound \ntrucks are forced to pass by 9 schools, 270 intersections, and more \nthan 3,000 driveways.\n  The Commercial Truck Safety Act will allow states to petition the \nSecretary of Transportation for a waiver from current Interstate weight \nlimits. The Secretary would have the authority to authorize a 3-year \npilot program, during which time state engineers, highway users, and \nsafety advocates would weigh the advantages and disadvantages, and \nreport to the Secretary who could then set reasonable, permanent weight \nlimits.\n  The Secretary would authorize a 3-year pilot program within a state, \nand require the creation of a safety committee, composed of engineers, \nsafety advocates, and highway users. This team would report to the \nSecretary on whether the pilot program should be made permanent, \neliminating the need\n\n[[Page S5073]]\n\nfor individual States to come to Congress for special exemptions.\n  Under my plan, only six-axle vehicles would be eligible to carry \nloads over 80,000 pounds. A 2000 Federal Highway Administration study \nnoted that these trucks cause LESS fatigue on both rigid and flexible \npavements. There is no question that allowing these vehicles on the \nInterstate will have safety, environmental, and efficiency benefits.\n  A total of 27 States already have some type of permanent exemption, \nand 47 states allow trucks weighing over 80,000 pounds on some roads \nwithin their State. To offer a clear picture of this, if you are \ndriving a 100,000-pound truck from Gary, Indiana, just outside of \nChicago, to Portland, Maine, you would be forced to unload the \nadditional weight to continue on the Interstate in Maine, or travel \nthrough the state on local roads, needlessly raising the risk of an \naccident on a local road or street. Conversely, and inexplicably, you \ncan drive a truck weighing 90,000 pounds all the way from Kansas City, \nMO to Seattle, WA, exclusively on the Interstate system.\n  If a State's chief highway engineer can certify the safety of a \nroute, and the condition of a road, a State should have the flexibility \nto change its weight limit on Interstate highways.\n  Pulp and paper produced in Bucksport and Lincoln, Maine, are vital to \nthe economic health of my State, but with the return to previous weight \nlimits, Maine is at a significant disadvantage due to the higher cost \nof transportation caused by this fundamental inequity. Some of my \nconstituents noted that the pilot program increased efficiency so \nappreciably, it was as if the factory had been moved 200 miles closer \nto the customer. While at first glance this may seem insignificant, we \nmust not forget that diesel prices are well above $4.00 per gallon, and \ntractor trailers operate at approximately 6 miles per gallon. Not only \nwill this bill save fuel and costs for shippers, it will reduce costs \nfor states. A 2004 study commissioned by the Maine Department of \nTransportation indicates that a permanent change would reduce the \nstate's pavement costs by more than $1 million per year. It would also \ncut bridge rehabilitation costs by more than $300,000 per year.\n  It is critical that we maximize our current highway capacity, and \nensure that freight movement is efficient and timely. The Commercial \nTruck Safety Act will provide states with the flexibility they need to \nimprove freight mobility and increase safety on our highways. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill, and allow States to update truck \nweight limits that no longer enhance safety or boost our economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, and Mr. \n        Reed):\n  S. 1452. A bill to promote simplification and fairness in the \nadministration and collection of sales and use taxes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, ``Level the Playing Field.''\n  When I ask small business owners what they would like the Federal \nGovernment to do to help them thrive, the answer I most frequently hear \nis, ``level the playing field.''\n  It may be a cliche, but there's truth to it. Most small \nbusinesspeople don't want a government handout. They don't want special \ntreatment. They just want to be able to compete fairly against other \nbusinesses.\n  That is why I am introducing the Main Street Fairness Act.\n  If you are a small business owner in Peoria or Springfield or Alton, \nyou compete against neighboring businesses down the street and, \nincreasingly, with sellers on the internet. The businesses down the \nstreet have to collect the same State sales taxes that you do. But, \nmany internet sellers don't.\n  That means internet sellers have a built-in price advantage. That \nisn't fair, and it's not a level playing field.\n  The Main Street Fairness Act would address that. The bill would give \nCongressional endorsement to the Streamline Sales and Use Tax \nAgreement, which 45 States and the District of Columbia created years \nago to help make it feasible for businesses selling online to collect \nState and local sales taxes already owed.\n  Why is this Agreement necessary? The Supreme Court ruled in the early \n'90s that the maze of current sales tax rules and rates was too complex \nto expect online retailers to comply. The States worked together to \naddress that problem.\n  The Main Street Fairness Act says that any State that wants to do so \ncan require online retailers to collect the same sales taxes that Main \nStreet businesses collect, provided that small online retailers are \nexempt, online retailers are compensated for any startup administrative \ncosts associated with collecting sales taxes, and all retailers are \ntreated equally regarding sales tax collection.\n  Let me be as clear as I can on one point: this bill is NOT a tax \nincrease.\n  It doesn't amend the Internal Revenue Code in any way. It simply \nprovides states the option to require all retailers to collect the \nsales taxes that are already owed.\n  The Main Street Fairness Act provides two other big benefits.\n  First, consumers will no longer be asked to itemize the sales taxes \nthey owe from their online purchases on their year-end tax forms. Few \nconsumers comply with the law today--most don't know they should--but \nthe Main Street Fairness Act would eliminate the need to do so.\n  Second, State and local governments would collect taxes that are \nalready owed.\n  It is no secret that many States and cities, including the State of \nIllinois and local governments across my State, are struggling to \nbalance their budgets.\n  The State of Illinois estimates that we lose as much as $153 million \neach year in unpaid taxes on internet sales alone.\n  Passing the Main Street Fairness Act would help State and local \ngovernments balance their budgets without cutting spending or raising \nnew taxes.\n  The Main Street Fairness Act is supported by the National Governors' \nAssociation, National Conference on State Legislatures, Governing Board \nof the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, National Retail \nFederation, International Council of Shopping Centers, Retail Industry \nLeaders Association, and the National Association of Real Estate \nInvestment Trusts.\n  The Main Street Fairness Act will level the playing field for our \nsmall businesses. I urge its passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1452\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CONSENT OF CONGRESS.\n\n       Congress consents to the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax \n     Agreement.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) States should be encouraged to simplify their sales and \n     use tax systems.\n       (2) As a matter of economic policy and basic fairness, \n     similar sales transactions should be treated equally, without \n     regard to the manner in which sales are transacted, whether \n     in person, through the mail, over the telephone, on the \n     Internet, or by other means.\n       (3) Congress may facilitate such equal taxation consistent \n     with the United States Supreme Court's decision in Quill \n     Corp. v. North Dakota.\n       (4) States that voluntarily and adequately simplify their \n     tax systems should be authorized to correct the present \n     inequities in taxation through requiring sellers to collect \n     taxes on sales of goods or services delivered in-state, \n     without regard to the location of the seller.\n       (5) The States have experience, expertise, and a vital \n     interest in the collection of sales and use taxes, and thus \n     should take the lead in developing and implementing sales and \n     use tax collection systems that are fair, efficient, and non-\n     discriminatory in their application and that will simplify \n     the process for both sellers and buyers.\n\n[[Page S5074]]\n\n       (6) Online consumer privacy is of paramount importance to \n     the growth of electronic commerce and must be protected.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for extended months of Medicare coverage of immunosuppressive \ndrugs for kidney transplant patients and other renal dialysis \nprovisions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Comprehensive \nImmunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Kidney Transplant Patients Act'' \nwith my colleagues Senators Cochran, Levin, Cardin, Schumer, Inouye, \nand Brown of Massachusetts.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about \n13 percent of American adults, 26 million people, have chronic kidney \ndisease. Some of these individuals can improve their condition with \nmedication and lifestyle changes, but approximately half a million of \nthem have irreversible kidney failure, or end-stage renal disease, \nESRD. These patients require dialysis or a kidney transplant to \nsurvive.\n  Organ transplantation is a medical success story. Thousands of \ntransplants are done every year, and for the patients fortunate enough \nto receive a donated organ, the quality and length of their lives can \nbe dramatically improved. Of the more than 28,000 transplants performed \nin 2010, over 16,898 of them were kidney transplants.\n  A large portion of these kidney transplants were paid for by the \nMedicare system, which provides healthcare to aged and disabled \nAmericans, as well as those living with ESRD. Medicare also covers \ndialysis for patients who have not received a donor kidney and \nimmunosuppressive drugs for kidney transplant recipients. Organ \ntransplant recipients must take immunosuppressive drugs every day for \nthe life of their transplant to reduce the risk of organ rejection.\n  In 2000, Congress wisely eliminated the 36-month time limitation for \naged and disabled beneficiaries who had Medicare status at the time of \ntransplant. So today, for an older or disabled person on Medicare, \nimmunosuppressive drugs are covered by Medicare for the life of the \ntransplant.\n  However, we still have an unfair and unrealistic gap in coverage for \npeople with ESRD who are neither disabled nor elderly. For those \ntransplant recipients, Medicare coverage, including coverage of \nimmunosuppressive drugs, ends 36 months after transplantation. Without \nregular access to immunosuppressive drugs to prevent rejection, many \npatients find themselves back in a risky and frightening place, in need \nof a new kidney. This is economically inefficient and morally wrong.\n  Since Medicare covers the cost of the transplant for end stage renal \ndisease, it makes sense for Medicare to preserve this investment by \ncovering anti-rejection drugs. It would be far less expensive for \nMedicare to cover immunosuppressive drugs at a cost of $10,000 to \n$20,000 a year than to pay for dialysis at $78,000 a year or another \ntransplant at a cost of $110,000 if a patient's kidney fails and he is \nonce again eligible for Medicare coverage.\n  I am pleased to introduce the Comprehensive Immunosuppressive Drug \nCoverage for Kidney Transplant Patients Act along with my colleagues. \nThis legislation would allow kidney transplant recipients to continue \nMedicare coverage for the purpose of immunosuppressive drugs only. All \nother Medicare coverage would end 36 months after the transplant.\n  It is time to pass this legislation to provide continuous coverage \nfor immunosuppressive drugs through Medicare. My legislation will \nreduce the need for dialysis and kidney re-transplants and provide \nreliable, sustained access to critically important, life-saving \nmedications for thousands of Americans. In both moral and economic \nterms, this is the right decision.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1454\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 242\n\n       Whereas ovarian cancer is the deadliest of all gynecologic \n     cancers;\n       Whereas ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer \n     deaths among women in the United States;\n       Whereas almost 21,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian \n     cancer in 2011, and 15,000 will die from the disease;\n       Whereas these deaths are those of our mothers, sisters, \n     daughters, family members, and community leaders;\n       Whereas the mortality rate for ovarian cancer has not \n     significantly decreased since the ``War on Cancer'' was \n     declared 40 years ago;\n       Whereas all women are at risk for ovarian cancer, and 90 \n     percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer do not have a \n     family history that puts them at a higher risk;\n       Whereas some women, such as those with a family history of \n     breast or ovarian cancer, are at a higher risk for the \n     disease;\n       Whereas the pap test is sensitive and specific to the early \n     detection of cervical cancer, but not ovarian cancer;\n       Whereas there is currently no reliable early detection test \n     for ovarian cancer;\n       Whereas many people are unaware that the symptoms of \n     ovarian cancer often include bloating, pelvic or abdominal \n     pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, urinary \n     symptoms, and several other symptoms that are easily confused \n     with other diseases;\n       Whereas in June 2007, the first national consensus \n     statement on ovarian cancer symptoms was developed to provide \n     consistency in describing symptoms to make it easier for \n     women to learn and remember the symptoms;\n       Whereas there are known methods to reduce the risk of \n     ovarian cancer, including prophylactic surgery, oral \n     contraceptives, and breast-feeding;\n       Whereas, due to the lack of a reliable early detection \n     test, 75 percent of cases of ovarian cancer are detected at \n     an advanced stage, making the overall 5-year survival rate \n     only 45 percent;\n       Whereas there are factors that are known to reduce the risk \n     for ovarian cancer and that play an important role in the \n     prevention of the disease;\n       Whereas awareness of the symptoms of ovarian cancer by \n     women and health care providers can lead to a quicker \n     diagnosis;\n       Whereas, each year during the month of September, the \n     Ovarian Cancer National Alliance and its partner members hold \n     a number of events to increase public awareness of ovarian \n     cancer; and\n       Whereas September 2011 should be designated as ``National \n     Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month'' to increase public awareness \n     of ovarian cancer: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of \n     National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5077-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5077-S5078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 243--PROMOTING INCREASED AWARENESS, DIAGNOSIS, AND \n  TREATMENT OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION TO ADDRESS THE HIGH MORBIDITY AND \n MORTALITY RATES AND TO PREVENT AVOIDABLE HOSPITALIZATIONS ASSOCIATED \n                            WITH THE DISEASE\n\n  Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Rubio, \nand Mr. Toomey) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 243\n\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is a cardiac condition that \n     results when the usual coordinated electrical activity in the \n     atria of the heart becomes disorganized and chaotic, \n     hampering the ability of the atria to fill the ventricles \n     with blood, and allowing blood to pool in the atria and form \n     clots;\n       Whereas an estimated 2,500,000 people in the United States \n     are living with atrial fibrillation, the most common \n     ``serious'' heart rhythm abnormality that occurs in people \n     older than 65 years of age;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased \n     long-term risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause \n     mortality, especially among women;\n       Whereas people older than 40 years of age have a 1-in-4 \n     risk of developing atrial fibrillation in their lifetime;\n       Whereas an estimated 15 percent of strokes are the result \n     of untreated atrial fibrillation, a condition that \n     dramatically increases the risk of stroke to approximately 5 \n     times more than the general population;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation accounts for approximately \n     529,000 hospital discharges annually;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation costs an estimated $3,600 per \n     patient for a total cost burden in the United States of \n     $15,700,000,000;\n       Whereas better patient and health care provider education \n     is needed for the timely recognition of atrial fibrillation \n     symptoms;\n       Whereas an electrocardiogram is an effective and risk-free \n     screen for heart rhythm irregularities and can be part of a \n     routine preventive exam;\n       Whereas there is a dearth of outcome performance measures \n     that focus on the management of atrial fibrillation; and\n       Whereas evidence-based care guidelines improve patient \n     outcomes and prevent unnecessary hospitalizations for \n     individuals with undiagnosed atrial fibrillation and for \n     patients once atrial fibrillation is detected: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services should work with \n     leaders in the medical community to explore ways to improve \n     medical research, screening and prevention methods, and \n     surveillance efforts in order to prevent and appropriately \n     manage atrial fibrillation, including by--\n       (1) advancing the development of process and outcome \n     measures for the management of atrial fibrillation by \n     national developers;\n       (2) facilitating the adoption of evidence-based guidelines \n     by the medical community to improve patient outcomes;\n       (3) advancing atrial fibrillation research and education \n     by--\n       (A) encouraging basic science research to determine the \n     causes and optimal treatments for atrial fibrillation;\n       (B) exploring development of screening tools and protocols \n     to determine the risk of developing atrial fibrillation; and\n       (C) enhancing current surveillance and tracking systems to \n     include atrial fibrillation; and\n\n[[Page S5078]]\n\n       (4) improving access to appropriate medical care for \n     patients suffering from atrial fibrillation by encouraging \n     education programs that promote collaboration among the \n     Federal health agencies and that increase public and \n     clinician awareness of atrial fibrillation, including risk \n     assessment, screening, treatment, and appropriate clinical \n     management.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/29/senate-section/article/S5078-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 244--CONGRATULATING OMEGA PSI PHI FRATERNITY, INC. \n FOR 100 YEARS OF SERVICE TO COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES \nAND THE WORLD, AND COMMENDING OMEGA PSI PHI FOR UPHOLDING ITS CARDINAL \n      PRINCIPLES OF MANHOOD, SCHOLARSHIP, PERSEVERANCE, AND UPLIFT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mrs. Hagan, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Brown of Ohio, \nMr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Levin, Mr. Cardin, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. \nCornyn) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

It shall also be \n     in order for any Member\n\n[[Page S5085]]\n\n     of the Senate to move to proceed to the consideration of the \n     joint committee bill at any time after the conclusion of such \n     2-day period.

All time used for consideration of the \n     joint committee bill, including time used for quorum calls \n     and voting, shall be counted against the total 30 hours of \n     consideration.\n       (4) No amendments.--An amendment to the joint committee \n     bill, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit the \n     joint committee bill, is not in order.\n       (5) Vote on passage.--If the Senate has voted to proceed to \n     the joint committee bill, the vote on passage of the joint \n     committee bill shall occur immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on a joint committee bill, and a \n     single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested.

The vote on passage of the joint \n     committee bill in the Senate shall be considered to be the \n     vote on passage of the joint committee bill received from the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (3) Vetoes.--If the President vetoes the joint committee \n     bill, debate on a veto message in the Senate under this \n     section shall be 1 hour equally divided between the majority \n     and minority leaders or their designees.\n       (g) Loss of Privilege.--The provisions of this section \n     shall cease to apply to the joint committee bill if--\n       (1) the joint committee fails to vote on the report or \n     proposed legislative language required under section \n     301(b)(3)(B)(i) by November 23, 2011; or\n       (2) the joint committee bill does not pass both Houses by \n     December 23, 2011.\n\n     SEC. 303.
