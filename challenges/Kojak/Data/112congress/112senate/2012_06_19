Mr. President, following my remarks and those of the \nRepublican leader, there will be 2 hours equally divided and \ncontrolled, with the majority controlling the first half and the \nRepublicans controlling the final half.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  The hour that is under the control of the majority has been given and \nI ask unanimous consent now that Senator Kerry be recognized for the \nhour we have allotted to us.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. That will be a full hour to Senator Kerry and a full hour \nto the Republicans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. The Senate will recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. to \nallow for our weekly caucus meetings.\n  Last night, we reached an agreement to complete action on the farm \nbill. As a result, there will be several rollcall votes beginning at \n2:15 p.m. today.\n  Everyone who has amendments here should understand, if you know the \nresult of your amendment--it is pretty easy to figure out most of them \nbecause Senators Stabenow and Roberts will tell almost everyone how the \nvote is going to wind up--we should be able to dispose of a lot of \nthese by voice vote. I hope so. Otherwise, people can look to some very \nlong nights the next night or two.\n  We will also begin debate today on the joint resolution of \ndisapproval regarding the EPA's mercury and air toxics standards. That \nwill also occur during today's session.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. President, Republicans in Congress are fond of complaining that \nthis country's immigration system is broken. We have heard it for \nmonths and months, going into years. But they are less interested in \nworking with Democrats to fix this problem they say is broken. We have \ntried. They are totally opposed to our doing anything. We have tried, \nbut we just get a handful of Republican votes.\n  No one I know disagrees that our immigration system needs repair. It \ncertainly does. But every time we as Democrats offer to work together \non comprehensive immigration reform, Republicans find an excuse to \nfight sensible change.\n  And every time Democrats propose bipartisan legislation to provide a \npathway to citizenship for children brought here illegally through no \nfault of their own, Republicans have found an excuse to oppose our \npractical reforms.\n  There is no better illustration of Republicans' hypocrisy than their \nphony outrage this past weekend.\n\n[[Page S4254]]\n\n  On Friday, President Obama announced the administration would suspend \ndeportation of young people--upstanding young people--brought here by \ntheir parents as children, provided these young people attend college \nor serve in the military.\n  More than 800,000 young people who have done well in school and \nstayed out of trouble will benefit from this policy and become \nproductive members of society. That is what we should all be very happy \nabout.\n\n  In this Congress, and the last Congress, Republicans expressed broad \nsupport for the principles of President Obama's directive.\n  Senator Mark Rubio, the junior Senator from Florida, has even talked \nup a similar idea to the press for months, although he never actually \nproduced a proposal. This was just talk. There was not a single word \never in writing.\n  Yet Republicans' glowing expressions of support for the President's \ndecision were not forthcoming. Instead, Republicans have cried about \nthe way the directive was issued. They prefer a long-term solution. \nWell, of course we all do. They do not like the timing; they should \nhave been consulted; and an issue this important should have been left \nto Congress. Being left to Congress--we have tried to do that for \nyears, and we cannot because they will not let us. They stopped us \nprocedurally.\n  Their complaints are varied, but they have one thing in common: None \nof them actually takes issue with the substance of President Obama's \ndirective. And with the polling results today announced in the national \npress, clearly, it is overwhelmingly supported by Independents, \noverwhelmingly supported by Democrats, and, frankly, Republicans are \nnot that much opposed to it either. But the only Republicans who are \nopposed to it by a large margin are the Republicans in Congress.\n  Leading Republican voices on immigration have yet to actually \ndisagree with the decision. They just do not like the way the President \nmade the decision--I guess because he will get credit for bringing out \nof the shadows 800,000 trustworthy young men and women who know no \nother home but the United States. America is their home. It is the only \nhome they have known.\n  I talked about a girl here yesterday from Nevada, Astrid. She came \nhere to America as a tiny girl. She does not know anyplace else. This \nis her home. She is an American. She pledges allegiance to her flag.\n  So I remind my colleagues in both Houses of Congress, the next move \nis yours. This reprieve for DREAMers should not be seen as a free pass \nfor Congress. We have lots of other issues we have to deal with dealing \nwith immigration. Instead, we should see it as a chance for Democrats \nand Republicans to work together on a lasting answer to the serious \nshortfalls of our broken immigration system. And as we work, we will \nhave the benefit of knowing the specter of deportation no longer hangs \nover the heads of hundreds of thousands of young people.\n  Now is hardly the time to walk away from the DREAM Act, which would \nhave created a pathway to citizenship for young people brought to the \ncountry through no fault of their own. And it is certainly no time to \nabandon calls for comprehensive immigration reform that is tough, that \nis fair, and is practical. But that is exactly what Republicans are \ndoing. They are taking their marbles and saying: Well, OK, we will quit \nand go home. Quite frankly, a number of them have not been here anyway \nto go home. They have not helped us anyway.\n  Since last Friday, leading Republican voices on immigration reform \nhave all but ceded the debate until after the election. Republicans who \nonce favored a permanent solution for America's broken immigration \nsystem are now abandoning efforts to find common ground.\n  And the same Republicans who complained they were not involved enough \nin the President's decision are now giving up any involvement in the \nbroader immigration conversation. It makes you wonder whether they were \ncommitted to passing the DREAM Act or tackling immigration reform at \nall, because Senate Republicans have twice had their chance to vote for \nthe DREAM Act. Both times they filibustered the measure to a \nlegislative death. So perhaps it should come as no surprise that my \nRepublican colleagues are more interested in complaining about a system \nthat is broken than in working with Democrats to fix it.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Under the previous order, the following 2 hours will be equally \ndivided and controlled by the two leaders or their designees, with the \nmajority controlling the first hour, and the Republicans controlling \nthe second hour.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for generously yielding to me.\n\n\n                                Wind PTC\n\n  Mr. President, I am on the Senate floor today to continue urging this \nbody to extend the production tax credit for wind. I intend to return \nto the floor every morning until the PTC has been extended, and I am \ngoing to talk about the economic and jobs effect on the nonextension in \neach State, and I am going to press my colleagues for an immediate \nextension.\n  Today I want to focus on a wind giant in our country--Texas. Texas \nleads the Nation in wind energy production. The Lone Star State has \nmore turbines than all but five countries.\n  As you can see, this chart I have in the Chamber outlines all the \ninstalled wind projects in Texas. You can see that across the State--\nfrom the south to the west, from El Paso to Galveston, from the \nPanhandle to southern Texas--the wind industry has created thousands of \njobs and it has helped boost the manufacturing and construction sectors \nwith good-paying American jobs.\n  For example, Sweetwater, a town of 11,000 people, has become the new \nSpindletop: You drive past it on the interstate and there is a forest \nof giant wind turbines. Among the cotton fields of this west Texas \nrural community, Sweetwater is home to one of the largest wind farms in \nTexas. And the wind industry, using Sweetwater's open spaces, constant \nwinds, and transmission capacity, has helped revitalize this rural \ncommunity--and really all of Nolan County.\n  Even oil-rich Houston has become something of a wind power capital in \nTexas--thanks to developers such as EDP Renewables Pattern Energy, and \nIberdrola Renewables, as well as BP and Shell.\n  They say everything is bigger in Texas--and that certainly applies \nwhen it comes to their vast energy resources. Texas has it all, from \ntraditional sources, like oil and gas, to renewable energy, like hydro \nand wind.\n  Texas' success in harnessing wind energy is no accident. Thanks to \nsmart State policies, including a renewable portfolio standard, which \npassed in 1999, and was later amended in 2005, as well as strong \nFederal support from the wind PTC, the Texas wind industry has grown \ndramatically.\n  Texas has an all-of-the-above energy strategy. The Senator from \nMassachusetts supports that kind of strategy. I support that kind of a \nstrategy. Texas embodies this. They have shown great promise when it \ncomes to renewable resources--growing and coexisting with traditional \nenergy sources.\n  So if you look at what is happening in Texas, Texas' wind energy \nindustry supports almost 7,000 jobs. With more energy from wind than \nany other State in our country, wind powers over 2.7 million Texas \nhomes, and almost 7 percent of Texas' overall electric power comes from \nwind. It was the first State to reach 10,000 megawatts of wind \ninstallations, and that wind power has helped avoid greenhouse gas \nemissions in the equivalence of 3,725,500 passenger cars.\n  As well, the supply chain of the manufacturing opportunities in Texas \nstands out. It is home to wind turbine manufacturers such as DeWind and \nAlstom, five major tower manufacturers, blade manufacturer Molded Fiber \nGlass, and many component suppliers.\n  This is an example of why we have to act, why we have to extend the \nPTC. Without certainty, wind energy companies are not able to grow, and \nthey, frankly, will shed jobs and whole projects.\n\n[[Page S4255]]\n\n  In the Senate, we have a bipartisan coalition. Senators Grassley, \nBoozman, Scott Brown, Hoeven, Moran, and Thune have engaged with many \nof us on this side to extend the wind PTC.\n  Let me end by quoting Karl Rove, who is known as a proud Texan and \nformer senior adviser to President George W. Bush. He explains the wind \nPTC as follows:\n\n       It is a market mechanism, you don't get paid unless you \n     produce the power, and we're not picking winners and losers, \n     we're simply saying for some period of time we will provide \n     this incentive.\n\n  Let's extend the PTC now. The solution is simple. We have to act. It \nwill help American jobs. It will help the American economy. It will \nhelp our energy security efforts.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts again, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would ask I be notified when I have \nconsumed about 25 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be notified.\n\n\n                         Global Climate Change\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, 20 years ago this month, a Republican \nPresident of the United States helped bring together all of the world's \nlargest economies in Rio, in Brazil, to confront the issue of global \nclimate change. The President was unequivocal about the mission. George \nHerbert Walker Bush said simply:\n\n       The United States fully intends to be the world's \n     preeminent leader in protecting the global environment. We \n     have been that for many years. We will remain so. We believe \n     that environment and development . . . can and should go hand \n     in hand. A growing economy creates the resources necessary \n     for environmental protection, and environmental protection \n     makes growth sustainable over the long term.\n\n  When he was asked about his own target for subsequent meetings of the \nglobal stakeholders, President Bush could not have been more clear. He \nsaid the United States ``will be there with specific plans, prepared to \nshare, but more important, that others who have signed these documents \nought to have specific plans. So I think this is a leadership role. We \nare challenging them to come forward. We will be there. I think the \nThird World and others are entitled to know that the commitments made \nare going to be commitments kept.''\n  That was the President of the United States speaking on behalf of our \nNation and indeed the aspirations of the world 20 years ago. How \ndramatic and sad it is that 20 years later, shockingly we find \nourselves in a strange and dangerous place on this issue, a place this \nformer President probably would not even recognize.\n  Thomas Paine actually described today's situation very well. As \nAmerica fought for its independence, he said: ``It is an affront to \ntreat falsehood with complaisance.'' Yet when it comes to the challenge \nof climate change, the falsehood of today's naysayers is only matched \nby the complacency indifference of our political system.\n  It is well past time that we actually heed Thomas Paine's admonition \nand reaffirm the commitment first made by President George Herbert \nWalker Bush. As a matter of conscience and common sense, we should \nfight today's insidious conspiracy of silence on climate change, a \nsilence that empowers misinformation and mythology to grow where \nscience and truth should prevail.\n  It is a conspiracy that has not just installed but demonized any \nconstructive effort to put America in a position to lead the world on \nthis issue, as President Bush promised we would, and as Americans have \na right to expect we will.\n  The danger we face could not be more real. In the United States, a \ncalculated campaign of disinformation has steadily beaten back the \nconsensus momentum for action on climate change and replaced it with \ntimidity by proponents in the face of millions of dollars of phony, \ncontrived talking points, illogical and wholly unscientific \npropositions, and a general scorn for the truth wrapped in false \nthreats about job loss and tax increases.\n  Yet today the naysayers escape all accountability to the truth. The \nmedia hardly murmurs when a candidate for President of the United \nStates, in 2012, can walk away from previously held positions and \nblithely announce that the evidence is not yet there about the impact \nof greenhouse gasses on climate.\n  The truth is scientists have known since the 1800s that carbon \ndioxide and other greenhouse gasses trap heat in our atmosphere. With \nthe right amount of those gasses, the Earth is a hospitable place for \nus to live. It is, indeed, the greenhouse effect that makes life \npossible on Earth. But if too much is added, which is what we are doing \nnow at a record pace, temperatures inevitably rise to record-breaking \nlevels. It is not rocket science.\n  Every major national science academy in the world has reported that \nglobal warming is real. It is nothing less than shocking when people in \na position of authority can just stand up and say, without \ndocumentation, without accepted scientific research, without peer-\nreviewed analysis, just stand up and say: Oh, there is not enough \nevidence, and they say it because it suits their political purposes to \nserve some interest that does not want to change the status quo.\n  Facts that beg for an unprecedented public response are met with \nunsubstantiated, even totally contradicted denial. Those who deny the \nfacts have never, ever met their de minimus responsibility to provide \nsome scientific answer to what, if not human behavior, is causing the \nincrease in greenhouse gas particulates and how, if not by curbing \ngreenhouse gases, we will address this crisis.\n  In fact, when one measures the effect of taking action versus not \ntaking action, the naysayers' case is even more confounding. Just think \nabout it. If the proponents of action were somehow incorrect, contrary \nto all that science declares, but, nevertheless, if they were incorrect \nand we proceeded to reduce carbon and other gases released in the \natmosphere, what is the worst that would happen?\n  Well, under that scenario the worst would be more jobs as we move to \nthe new energy economy, the opening of a whole new $6 trillion energy \nmarket with a more sustainable policy, a healthier population because \nof cleaner air and reduced pollution, reduced expenditures on health \ncare because of environmentally induced disease, an improved outlook \nfor the oceans and the ecosystems that are affected by pollution \nfalling to the Earth and into the sea, and surely greater security for \nthe United States because of less dependence on foreign sources of \nenergy and a stronger economy. That is the worst that would occur if \nthe proponents were wrong.\n  But what if the naysayers are, in fact, wrong, as all the science \nsays they are? What if because of their ignorance we fail to take the \naction we should? What is the worst then? The worst then is sheer, \nutter disaster for the planet and for all who inhabit it. So whose \n``worst'' would most thinking people rather endure?\n  The level of dissembling--of outright falsifying of information, of \ngreedy appeal to fear tactics that has stalled meaningful action now \nfor 20 years--is hard to wrap one's mind around. It is so far removed \nfrom legitimate analysis that it confounds for its devilishly simple \nappeal to the lowest common denominator of disinformation. In the face \nof a massive and growing body of scientific evidence that says \ncatastrophic climate change is knocking at our door, the naysayers just \nhappily tell us: Climate change does not exist.\n  In the face of melting glaciers and ice caps in the Arctic, \nGreenland, and Antarctica, they say we need to ``warm up to the \ntruth.'' And in the face of animals disappearing at alarming rates, \nspecies being destroyed, they would have us adopt an ostrich policy and \njust bury our heads in the sand and pretend it can go away.\n  Just last week, a group of State senators in North Carolina passed a \nbill that bans planning for rising sea levels when creating rules for \nhousing developments and infrastructure in coastal communities. \nJeffress Williams is the lead author of the U.S. National Climate \nAssessment Report. Ask him what he thinks about his legislation, and he \nwill tell you it is ``not based on sound science.'' That is an \nunderstatement. But somehow the State senators who voted for this bill \nknow better.\n  Al Gore spoke of the ``assault on reason.'' Well, exhibit A is \nstaring us in the face: coalitions of politicians and special interests \nthat peddle science fiction over scientific fact, a paid-for, \nmultimillion-dollar effort that twists\n\n[[Page S4256]]\n\nand turns the evidence until it is gnarled beyond recognition, and \ntidal waves of cash that back a status quo of recklessness and inaction \nover responsibility and change.\n  In short, we are living through a story of disgraceful denial, \nbackpedaling, and delay that has brought us perilously close to a \nclimate change catastrophe.\n  Nothing underscores this Orwellian twist of logic more than the facts \nsurrounding the now well negatively branded cap and trade program. Cap \nand trade was a Republican-inspired idea during the debate over ozone \nand the Montreal Protocol in the 1980s. It was actually inspired \nby conservatives looking for the least command and control, the least \ngovernment-regulated way to meet pollution standards. It was \nimplemented and it worked, and it is still working. But, lo and behold, \nwhen the strategists for the political right decided to make it a \ntarget because Democrats were leading the charge to address climate \nchange, suddenly this free market mechanism was transformed into ``cap \nand tax'' and ``job killing tax.'' And guess who. Coal. Coal, the \nleading carbon polluter was leading the funding for those efforts. What \nis worse, we have all stood by and let it happen. We have treated \nfalsehood with complacence and allowed a conspiracy of silence on \nclimate change to infiltrate our politics. Believe me, we have had our \nchances to act in these last years. But every time we get close to \nachieving something big for our country, small-minded appeals to the \npolitics of the moment block the way.\n\n  The conspiracy of silence that now characterizes Washington's \nhandling of the climate issue is, in fact, dangerous. Climate change is \none of two or three of the most serious threats that our country now \nfaces, if not, in some people's minds, the most serious. The silence \nthat has enveloped the once robust debate is staggering for its \nirresponsibility. The cost of inaction gets more and more expensive the \nlonger we wait, and the longer we wait, the less likely we are to avoid \nthe worst and to leave future generations with a sustainable planet.\n  In many cases what we are talking about is vast sums of money \nfunneled into gas-guzzling industries and coal-fired powerplants. We \nare talking about pollution--pollution on a wide scale, the kind of \ndirty, thick suffocating smog that poisons our rivers, advances chronic \ndisease like asthma, lung cancer, and creates billions in hospital \ncosts and lost economic opportunity. It is the same pollution that \nRachel Carson warned us about in ``Silent Spring'' when she said:\n\n       Why should we tolerate a diet of weak poisons, a home in \n     insipid surroundings, a circle of acquaintances who are not \n     quite our enemies, the noise of motors with just enough \n     relief to prevent insanity? Who would want to live in a world \n     which is just not quite fatal?\n\n  Well, today we do live in a world where there is an absurdity in the \nair, and it has complacence written all over it. Fish are dying in \nwater polluted with pesticides. Roadless forests are being threatened \nby indiscriminate drilling. Industrial chemicals are sweeping into all \nof us. Young children are born with a burden of chemicals unprecedented \nin their amount. The burning of fossil fuels has overloaded our \necosystems with nitrogen and ravaged our plant life.\n  Just go out and look at the forests and look at the change in the \ntopography of our country. Bottom line: We have substituted fantasy for \nreason, sheer whimsy for proven epidemiology, and it is wreaking havoc \non our environment. You do not have to take my word for it. I am \nconfident a lot of our colleagues will not. But you can see it across \nthe planet with your eyes. Ice caps are melting; seas are rising; \ndeserts are expanding; storms are more frequent, more violent, more \ndestructive; pollution, famine, natural disasters, killing millions of \npeople every year.\n  These are changes that many experts thought were still years down the \nline, but climate change is now radically altering our planet at a rate \nmuch faster than the scientists or even the pessimists expected.\n  All you need to do is look out your window. We just had the warmest \nMarch on record for the contiguous United States. The naysayers will \ntell us that one hot year does not prove global warming. But just look \nat this chart which charts the acceleration of warming in the United \nStates after 1970. This is not an anomaly. It is a giant step in the \nwrong direction, and 2010 was the hottest year on record. The last \ndecade was the hottest decade since we have started recording the \nweather. April, May, and June of this year are already continuing the \ntrend.\n  For the first time in memory, the Augusta National azaleas bloomed \nand wilted before the first golfers teed off at this year's Masters. At \nthe Boston Marathon, temperatures hit 89 degrees in April, more than 30 \ndegrees higher than the average. People talk about official jackets and \ngloves and coffee? Who are you kidding? They are talking about hats and \nsunscreen and Gatorade and medical tents that were filled with heat-\nexhausted runners starting at mile 10 of the 26-mile course from \nHopkinton into Boston.\n  I have been working to connect the dots on this issue for a long \ntime. In 1988, 24 years ago, on an already hot June day, Al Gore and I \ntook part in the first hearings on climate change in the Senate with \nJim Hansen, who testified then that the threat was real, that climate \nchange was already happening in our country--24 years ago.\n  Four years later, we joined a delegation of Senators to attend the \nfirst Earth Summit in Rio, where we worked with 171 other nations to \nput into place a voluntary framework on climate change and greenhouse \ngas reductions. Back in 1992, we all came together for a simple reason: \nWe accepted the science.\n  President George H.W. Bush personally traveled to the climate change \ntalks in Rio to help plant the seeds of this new beginning. We knew the \nroad ahead would be long, but we also knew this was a watershed moment; \nthat it created the grassroots momentum that made people sit up and \nstart to listen and understand the damage we were doing to the \nenvironment. Sit up and listen they did. The principles that came out \nof Rio transformed into a mandatory requirement under the Kyoto \nProtocol. Each of the developed nations accepted its own target goal. \nThe European Union reduction would be 8 percent and Japan's would be 6 \npercent and so on. We were thinking big back then, and our goal was to \nreach a total decrease in global emissions of 5.2 percent below the \n1990 levels and reach it by 2010.\n  Well, 2010 has come and gone and so, too, have the targets. We all \nknow the story: Global political leadership was distracted or absent. \nInternational negotiations in Buenos Aires and The Hague turned tense. \nThe less-developed nations saw the targets and timetables for \ngreenhouse gas reductions as a Western market conspiracy. Then there \nwere trumped up, industry-funded so-called studies that challenged the \nscientific assertions for climate change scenarios.\n  Looking back, it is not hard to understand why the final agreement \ngot sidetracked in the Senate. After all, the developing countries were \nexcluded from the treaty's reduction targets, even though it had \nalready become clear by then that China and India were significant \nenough as industrial powers that to exempt them entirely would be a \nmistake. Nations left out were deemed capable of undoing all the \nreductions that would have been achieved by the developed nations.\n  It is no wonder people were reluctant, no wonder American companies \nwere understandably reluctant to put themselves at a competitive \ndisadvantage. Many in Congress had not yet digested the science of \nclimate change, even though we knew climate scientists were already \nstudying the phenomenon of greenhouse gases.\n  The question is not whether the Kyoto treaty had flaws; the question \nis whether we got the fundamentals right. I believe the evidence is \noverwhelming, beyond any reasonable doubt, that we did. As I remind my \ncolleagues, the view from 2012 is a whole lot different from 1992. \nCountries such as China, South Africa, Brazil, and South Korea have now \nmade far-reaching choices to reshape their economies and move forward \nin a new and very different global area. Take China. China is already \noutspending the United States three to one on public clean energy \nprojects. In the last year alone, China accounted for almost one-\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\nfifth of the renewable energy investments, with the United States and \nGermany trailing behind. Steven Chu, the Secretary of Energy, said it \nbest:\n\n       For centuries, America has led the world in innovation. \n     Today, that leadership is at risk.\n\n  Our indifference to climate change is putting America's economy and \nleadership, with respect to economics and the future of energy policy, \nat risk. So the United States is now the laggard. We are missing out on \nachieving sustained economic growth by securing enduring competitive \nadvantage through innovation. The facts speak for themselves. Today's \nenergy economy is a $6 trillion market, with 4 billion users worldwide, \ngrowing to 9 billion in the next 40 years. By comparison, the market \nthat made people so wealthy in 1990s in America and created 23 million \nnew jobs and lifted everybody was a $1 trillion market with only 1 \nbillion users. This is $6 trillion with 4 billion users today.\n  The fact is it is projected to grow to a $2.3 trillion market in the \nyear 2020. America needs to get into this. We need to get our skin in \nthe game or we are going to miss the market of the future--if not miss \nthe future itself. We would be delusional to believe China, given the \nevidence, or any of our other competitors are going to sit on the \nsidelines and let this market opportunity fall through the cracks. They \nare not doing it now and they will not do it in the future. Only the \nUnited States is sitting there with an indifference toward these \nalternatives and the renewable possibilities.\n  I realize some will argue we cannot afford to address climate change \nin these tough economic times. Frankly, nothing could be further from \nthe truth. Nothing could be more self-defeating. We will recover from \nthis slowdown. When we do, we need to emerge as the world leader in the \nnew energy economy. That will be a crucial part of restoring America as \na nation in a way that honors the hard work and innovation and measures \nprosperity in those terms.\n  Anyone who worries whether this is the right moment to tackle climate \nchange should understand we can't afford not to do this now at the risk \nof our economic future. It is now that the most critical trends and \nfacts actually all point in the wrong direction. The CO2 \nemissions that caused climate change grew at a rate four times faster \nin the first decade of this new century than in the 1990s.\n  Several years ago, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange issued a series of projections for global initiatives. Based on \nthe likely projections of energy and land-use patterns, today our \nemissions have actually moved beyond--this chart shows the emissions \nare going up from the 1960s all the way through to 2010. Today, we have \nmoved beyond the worst-case scenarios that were predicted by all the \nmodeling that was done by the IPCC. Meanwhile, our oceans and forests, \nwhich act as the natural repositories of CO2, are losing \ntheir ability to absorb more carbon dioxide. This means the effects of \nclimate change are being felt even more powerfully than expected, \nfaster than was expected.\n  The plain fact is there isn't a nation on the planet that has escaped \nthe steady onslaught of climate change. When the desert is creeping \ninto east Africa and ever more scarce resources push farmers and \nherders into deadly conflict, that is a matter of shared security for \nall of us. When the people of the Maldives are forced to abandon a \nplace they have called home for hundreds of years, it is a stain on our \ncollective conscience and a moral challenge to each of us. When our own \ngrandchildren risk growing up in a world we can't recognize and don't \nwant to, in the long shadow of a global failure to cooperate, then, \nclearly, urgently, profoundly, we need to do better.\n  Frankly, those who look for any excuse to continue challenging the \nscience have a fundamental responsibility they have never fulfilled: \nProve us wrong or stand down. Show with some science how this theory, \nin fact, is not being borne out. Prove that the pollution we put into \nthe atmosphere is not having the harmful effects we know it is and that \nthe science says it is. Tell us where the gases go and what they do if \nthey don't do what the scientists are telling us they do. Pony up one \nsingle cogent, legitimate, scholarly analysis. Prove that the ocean \nisn't actually rising. Prove that the icecaps aren't melting or that \ndeserts aren't expanding. Prove, above all, that human beings don't \nhave anything to do with it.\n  I will tell you here right now, they cannot do it. They have not done \nit and they can't do it. There are over 6,000 peer-reviewed articles, \nall of which document clearly, irrefutably the ways in which mankind is \ncontributing to this problem. Sure, we know the naysayers have their \nbought studies that don't stand up to scientific review and a few \nscientists who trade in doubt and misdirection about things such as Sun \nspots and clouds. But there is not a single credible scientist who can \nargue and withstand the peer review that climate change isn't \nhappening.\n  In fact, even the naysayers are starting to come around, in their \njudgment. Just this year, a well-known climate skeptic, Dr. Richard \nMueller, released a series of reports that were funded in part by the \nKoch brothers. Dr. Mueller thought his results were going to show \nsomething different than all the other climate studies, and what he \nfound was not what the Koch brothers sent him looking for. Here is what \nDr. Mueller, in his own words, said:\n\n       You should not be a skeptic, at least not any longer.\n\n  Bottom line: His studies found exactly what all the other credible \nclimate studies have been telling us for decades--that global warming \nis real.\n  If we just step out and look around for a moment, we can see the \neffects everywhere: floods, droughts, pathogens, disease, species and \nhabitat loss, sea level rise, storm surges that threaten our cities and \ncoastlines. No continent is escaping unscathed: increasing ground \ninstability in permafrost regions, increasing avalanches in mountainous \nzones, warmer and drier conditions in the Sahelian region of Africa \nleading to a shorter growing season, and coral bleaching events in the \nGreat Barrier Reef. All these are attributed to this change in climate.\n  I wish to take a moment to bear down on the science, the cold, hard, \nstubborn facts that ought to guide us in addressing this challenge. It \nis detailed, to some degree, but it is the very detail that detractors \ncan never address or refute. It is important to see the detail in its \ncumulative force. Unlike the naysayers, I am going to give point by \npoint to some of the falsehoods and lay out a summary of the critical \nevidence that ought to lead America and the world to action.\n  Here is what the science is telling us: Atmospheric carbon dioxide \nlevels have increased by nearly 40 percent in the industrial era, from \n280 parts per million to over 393 parts per million in the atmosphere. \nBefore long, we are likely to see a global average of concentration at \n400 parts per million and more. Within the last few months, monitoring \nstations in the Arctic region, for the first time, reported average \nconcentrations of CO2 at 400 parts per million. Because of \nthe remote nature of those monitors, they generally reflect long-term \ntrends as opposed to marginal fluctuations in direct emissions near \npopulation centers.\n  As atmospheric scientist Pieter Tans, with the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration points out:\n\n       The northern sites in our monitoring network tell us what \n     is coming soon to the globe as a whole. . . . We will likely \n     see global average CO2 concentrations reach 400 \n     ppm about 2016 [4 years from now].\n\n  Why is this important? This is important because scientists have told \nus that anything above 450 parts per million--a warming of 2 degrees \nCelsius--could lead to severe, widespread, and irreversible harm to \nhuman life on this planet. When concentrations of other greenhouse \ngases, such as methane and black carbon, are factored into the \nequation, the analysis suggests that stabilizing concentrations around \n400 parts per million of equivalent carbon dioxide would give us about \nan 80-percent chance of avoiding a 2-degree Fahrenheit increase above \nthe present average global temperatures.\n  Considering what a 2-degree Fahrenheit increase would mean, \nscientists obviously are urging us not to take the risk. James Hansen, \nDirector of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, has done the \nmath. His analysis shows that we need to be shooting\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\nfor a stabilization level of 350 parts per million in order to increase \nour chances of avoiding the 2-degree Fahrenheit increase. We have \nalready exceeded that. So we are going to have to find a way to \nactually go backward in order to be able to prevent what scientists are \ntelling us could create huge damage.\n  Even if we slam on the brakes now, science tells us we could be \nheaded for a global temperature increase of 2 to 4 degrees by the \ncentury's end and greater warming after that. Let me share what some of \nthe ``postcards from the edge,'' if you will, look like when you \nexamine what is happening to our air, our health, and our environment. \nWarming temperatures, first of all. The first 10 years of this century \nwere the warmest decade on record. And 2010 was tied with 2005 as the \nhottest year ever recorded. NOAA has reported that 2011 was the second \nwarmest summer on record, just .1 degrees Fahrenheit below the 1936 \nrecord, and the U.S. Climate Extreme Index--a measure of the area of \nthe country experiencing extreme conditions--was nearly four times the \naverage.\n\n  Last year many Northeastern States experienced their wettest summers, \nespecially those States caught in Hurricane Irene's destructive path. \nMeanwhile, persistent heat and below-average precipitation across the \nSouthern United States created recordbreaking droughts in Louisiana, \nNew Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, and these were of greater intensity \nthan the 1930s famous Dust Bowl. Texas endured the country's hottest \nsummer ever recorded for any State, at an average temperature of 86.8 \ndegrees.\n  What is shocking is that the evidence of the rate of this \ntransformation is happening faster and to a greater degree than the \nscientists predicted. So one would think reasonable people would say: \nWait a minute, they predicted this, but we are getting this way up \nhere, and everyone would sort of stop and take stock of what is \nhappening.\n  According to the new climate report from NOAA, the lower 48 States \nelbowed their way into the record books this spring with ``the warmest \nMarch, third warmest April, second warmest May . . . the first time \nthat all three months during the spring season ranked among the 10 \nwarmest since records began in 1895.'' In fact, the average temperature \nthis spring was so far off the charts that the lower 48 States beat out \nthe old 1910 record by a full 2 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  Inland, worsening conditions are going to create persistent drought \nin the Southwest and significantly increase western wildlife burn area. \nThat is critical. We have already seen the damage done to millions of \nacres of forest because of the pine bark beetles, which actually live \nlonger because it doesn't get cold and therefore they do not die in the \nnormal cycle. But in recent years, due to warmer winters, pine beetle \npopulations have exploded, devastating these once majestic forests.\n  It is also having an impact on our health. As average temperatures \nrise, we can expect to see more extreme heat waves during our summers, \nand, as we know from history, that impacts people with heart problems \nand asthma, the elderly, the very young, and the homeless. In the \nUnited States, Chicago is projected to have 25 percent more frequent \nheat wave days by the end of the century. In Los Angeles, we could see \nas much as a four- to eightfold increase.\n  Climate change may also heighten the risk of infectious diseases, \nparticularly diseases found in warm areas and spread by mosquitoes and \nother insects, such as malaria, dengue fever, and yellow fever. In some \nplaces, climate change is already altering the pattern of disease. In \nthe Kenyan Highlands, for example, it is now one of the major drivers \nof malaria epidemics.\n  It is not just the health costs that are sounding the alarm. As many \nhave seen with their own eyes, the Arctic is among one of the most \nstartling places to witness the adverse effects of global climate \nchange. Great sheets of ice have been breaking off of glaciers--sheets \nof ice the size of the State of Rhode Island. Marine mammals are now \nstruggling to survive. Where there used to be only frozen landscapes, \nthere is now open water.\n  Every new report that is public suggests the situation is getting \ngrimmer in the Arctic. Last year the multi-country Arctic Monitoring \nand Assessment Program released a new assessment of the impact of \nclimate change in the Arctic. It found that the period from 2005 to \n2010 was the warmest ever recorded. According to AMAP researchers, the \nchanges in icemelt over the past 10 years ``are dramatic and represent \nan obvious departure from the long-term patterns.''\n  Their conclusion is startling. They expect the Arctic Ocean to be \nnearly ice-free within this century, likely in the next 30 to 40 years.\n  Think about that for a second. Within our children's lifetimes, one \nof Earth's polar icecaps will be completely gone. Average annual \ntemperatures in the Arctic have increased at approximately twice the \nrate of average global temperatures. Within a generation, maybe two, \nkids will grow up learning geography on maps and globes that show \nsimply an empty blue expanse on top of the world, no longer the white \none to which we have grown accustomed.\n  In terms of impact, all of us who have been following this issue \nunderstand that the melting of the Arctic is at least partly mitigated \nby the fact that the ice is already floating, so the displacement in \nthe ocean as it melts is not that significant. But what if there is an \nice melt from the glaciers, as we are now seeing not only in the Arctic \nbut we are seeing in Greenland and in Antarctica and across North \nAmerica, South America, and Africa--when you realize that all over the \nglobe, glaciers and icecaps are losing volume--that means other day-to-\nday, practical problems for our communities.\n  This is a photograph of the glaciers that exist out in the western \npart of our country, or used to. That was 1909, and this is 2004--\nalmost gone. Here is another vision of National Glacier Park, where it \nhas almost disappeared. It is obvious for all to see the degree to \nwhich the glaciers are disappearing.\n  Many people may not also realize that a lot of communities in the \nUnited States rely on annual glacial melt for municipal water supplies \nand for hydropower. So as this disappears, the energy sourcing and \nwater sourcing for the United States disappears with it. Just ask \nWashington State, where glacial melt water provides 1.8 trillion liters \nof water every summer, or talk to the folks in Alaska, where glacier \nmelt plays a key role in the circulation of the Gulf of Alaska, which \nis important to maintaining the valuable fisheries--the halibut and \nsalmon--that reside in this body of water. All these impacts are \ninterconnected.\n  Again, the skeptics say: Hey, there are a couple of glaciers that are \nactually expanding. Yes, there are some glaciers that are responding to \nunusual and unique local conditions and increasing in snow and ice \naccumulation, but the overwhelming evidence, when we look at the vast \nmajority, shows that most of America's glaciers are shrinking. Over the \nlast four decades of the 20th century, North American glaciers have \nlost 108 cubic miles of ice. That is enough ice, translated into water, \nto inundate California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Colorado with 1 foot \nof water if it happened all at the same time.\n  In 1850 there were approximately 150 glaciers in what is now Glacier \nNational Park. Today, due to warmer temperatures, there are only 25 \nnamed glaciers remaining, and some models predict that the park's \nglaciers could disappear in just a few decades. But trust your own \neyes, if you prefer. The photographs here depict glacial melt over \nvarious time periods in Glacier National Park, Montana, and Holgate \nGlacier and Icy Bay, Alaska. As you'll see, the effects are just \nstaggering.\n  We all remember Wordsworth's lines about ``the Lake that was shining \nclear among the hoary mountains.'' Well, these mountains are no longer \nhoary, and soon, lakes will reflect not snow-covered peaks, but naked \nridges and sun-splashed steeps.\n  To make matters worse, temperatures are likely to increase \nexponentially in the next coming years. Because the environment is a \nclosed system, the more conditions change, the faster they change \nbecause each change has an impact on some other interconnected \ncomponent of the environment.\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\n  As the ice and permafrost melt, methane plumes from under the surface \nthat have been trapped for hundreds of thousands of years are now \nemerging. During a survey last summer in the east Siberian Arctic seas, \na team of scientists encountered a high density of methane plumes, some \nmore than 1 kilometer across. They were emitting methane into the \natmosphere at concentrations up to 100 times higher than normal. There \nare people who have stood by these methane plumes, lit a match, and \nthey light on fire. The fact is, over a period of 100 years, methane \nhas a warming potential roughly 25 times greater than CO2.\n  So we may become the victims not just of the climate change itself \nbut of a vicious kind of feedback and feedback cycles in the climate \nsystem. Cycles associated with less cloud cover, changes in aerosols, \npeatlands, soils, and Arctic ice cover all can lead to accelerated \nclimate change. One study estimated that thawing permafrost may turn \nthe Arctic from a carbon sink--that is to say a place that gathers and \nstores carbon--into a carbon source by the mid-2020s, releasing 100 \nbillion tons of carbon by the end of the century. What does that mean? \nOne hundred billion tons of carbon is about equal to the amount of \nCO2 that would be released worldwide from 10 years of \nburning fossil fuels. So that is the future we are looking at if we \ndon't respond.\n  Here is another postcard from the edge, Mr. President. North Carolina \ndoesn't think they need to worry about the sea level rise, but take a \nlook at the evidence. Our best studies predict a higher sea level rise \nthan previously projected. With the melting of the west Antarctic ice \nsheet alone, global sea levels could rise by as much as 3.26 meters in \nthe coming years, and the Pacific and Atlantic coasts could be in for a \n25-percent increase above the average level by the century's end. In \nall, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet has the potential to raise \nglobal sea levels by about 7 meters, and the ice sheets of Antarctica \nhave the potential to contribute to 60 meters of sea level rise.\n  Now, when people say, ``Well, global--it may not melt,'' there are \nSenators who have traveled to Greenland, who have stood on the ice \nsheet and looked down into it, into a hole 100-feet deep, and seen a \nmassive, torrential river running underneath the ice out to the sea as \nthe ice is melting.\n  Some scientists are even worried about the effects of that river \nunder the ice. Could it act as a slide, where actually whole chunks of \nice break off and slide down on this watery base on which the ice is \nsitting?\n  Think about what this all means. As the New York Times reported in \nMarch, some 3.7 million Americans living within a few feet of high tide \nare at risk from the rising sea. So all of you state senators out \nthere, listen up: the effects of climate change will spare no one--from \nTampa to Asheville, from Sausalito to Staten Island, all coastal \ncommunities are vulnerable.\n  NOAA's Benjamin Strauss, coauthor of a smart new study on topographic \nvulnerability, said the following:\n\n       Sea level rise is like an invisible tsunami, building force \n     while we do almost nothing. . . . We have a closing window of \n     time to prevent the worst by preparing for higher seas.\n\n  I think that is exactly right, and that is why city officials in \nBoston are currently actively planning for how to manage 100-year \nfloods that are now arriving every 20 years. We don't have 100-year \nfloods anymore, we have them every so often--every 5 years or 20 years. \nIn the face of a global sea level rise of 3 to 6 feet by the end of the \ncentury, there will be massive amounts of flooding. So we ought to pass \nlegislation at the State level to plan, not to ban the planning. It is \neasy politics to ban it, but it is not smart politics, and it certainly \nisn't courageous leadership. Just ask those living in Tuvalu and the \nlow-lying nation of Kiribati. Think they could use some advance \nplanning to deal with the ``king'' tides that may soon drown out life \non their shores? You bet. But instead of learning from them, we've \nsuccumbed to the siren call of short-term interests.\n  One resident of Tuvalu poignantly asked: ``What will happen to us in \nten years' time?'' I wish I could delay her fears. I wish I could tell \nher that the climate change would only be limited to occasional sea \nlevel rise, and that--naturally, surely--the king tides would recede.\n  But the truth is much more harrowing. We also have raging floods and \nwater scarcity--a dichotomy--in various parts of the world. From \nVeracruz to Songkhla Province in Thailand, floods are devastating crops \nand stealing away opportunities for millions. In my travels, I have \nseen children orphaned by raging flood waters, families deprived of \nbasic necessities, such as food, clean drinking water, and medicine. I \nhave also seen the ways in which climate change has interacted with \nconflicts, food insecurity, and water scarcity. People are fighting and \nkilling each other over water scarcity in various parts of the world. \nIn Darfur and in South Sudan, there are tensions over arable lands. \nThink of drought in Syria and its impact on farmers in southern Dara'a. \nThink of water scarcity in Yemen--and the list goes on. These are the \ninvisible tsunamis Benjamin Strauss spoke of, and they develop slowly \nand quietly and determinately, and they devastate communities just as \nsurely as they should kindle our sense of urgency about the cost of \ninaction.\n  In addition, although I am not going to go into the details now, \nthere is major decimation of animal life and plant life and species \nlife as a consequence of this interconnectedness. In addition, forests \nare under siege from drought and experiencing more fires and more die-\noff as a consequence of insect infestation because it doesn't get cold \nenough anymore to maintain the previous cycles of those insects dying \noff.\n  So the fact is that unmitigated climate change is creating enormous \neconomic dislocations already, and it is only going to get worse if we \ndon't act. Professor Frank Akerman, a prominent economist at Tufts \nUniversity, found that inaction in the face of climate change could \ncost the American economy more than 3.6 percent of GDP--``or $3.8 \ntrillion--annually by the end of the century. And he is not alone. \nHarvard economist Joseph Aldy estimates that if temperatures push past \nthe 2 degrees mark, up to 2 to 4 percent of world GDP would be lost.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 45 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  So developing countries are going to face similar costs. According to \na major international initiative on ``The Economics of Ecosystems and \nBiodiversity'', developing countries will spend an estimated $70 to \n$100 billion a year from 2010 to 2050 just to adapt to a two degrees \nCelsius change in global temperatures, with the majority spent on \nprotecting infrastructure and coastal zones, managing the water supply, \nand protecting against the effects of floods.\n  The ``grow now, clean later'' approach is no longer viable--if it \never was. Before you know it, one quarter of the world's land surface \nwill bear the marks of soil erosion, salinization, nutrient depletion \nand desertification. Imagine what this will do to agricultural \nproductivity and water supplies.\n  Another way of looking at this is to consider not the cost, but the \neconomic benefits of keeping our ecosystems intact.\n  Back in 2005 the World Bank estimated the total value of the world's \nnatural assets to be $44 trillion. The countries that manage their \nforests, agricultural lands, energy, minerals, and other natural assets \nare going to be the economic leaders in the 21st century, and they will \nbe able to reap the benefits of the ecosystem services like coral \nreefs, which provide food, water purification, tourism and genetic \ndiversity--services valued at $172 billion annually. And they'll be \nable to invest more in the ``intangible'' drivers of growth like human \nskills, education, and innovation.\n  Mr. President, the message from all of this could not be more clear. \nOver 40 years ago, 20 million Americans--fully one-tenth of our \ncountry's population at the time--came together on one single day to \ndemand environmental accountability.\n  It was called Earth Day. And they didn't stop there. They elected a \nCongress that passed the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking \nWater Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Coastal Zone Management Act, \nthe Endangered Species Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act. They \ncreated EPA. America didn't have an EPA\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\nuntil the 1970s when people said: We don't want to live next to wells \nthat give us cancer. We don't want to live next to rivers that actually \nlight on fire. So we made a huge transformation.\n  We need Congress now to do what the science tells us we have to do, \nto do what our economists tell us we have to do, to do what common \nsense demands that we do: It's time for Congress to stand up and do its \npart on climate change.\n  I don't know how many have read David Orr's terrific book, ``Down to \nthe Wire: Confronting Climate Collapse,'' but it is important for \neveryone to understand his argument. Nowhere is the challenge of our \nmoment more clearly expressed. He says:\n\n       The real fault line in American politics is not between \n     liberals and conservatives . . . it is, rather, in how we \n     orient ourselves to the generations to come who will bear the \n     consequences, for better and for worse, of our actions.\n\n  As Orr reminds us, we are at a tipping point--and it is going to take \nleadership to respond to it. Unfortunately, we have been witnessing \njust the opposite. In a talking point memo to his fellow Republicans \nlast summer, House majority leader Eric Cantor of Virginia took aim at \nenvironmental safeguards. Job killers, he called them, listing the \n``top 10 job-destroying regulations,'' seven of which dealt with \nreducing air pollution from industrial incinerators, boilers and aging \ncoal-fired power plants.\n  Job killers? The facts just don't support that.\n  The Labor Department, however, keeps close tabs on extended mass \nlayoffs, and in 2010 the Department found that of the 1,256,606 mass \nlayoffs, employers attributed just 2,971 to government regulation. That \nis only about two-tenths of 1 percent of all layoffs.\n  In fact, decreasing carbon pollution actually presents a huge \neconomic opportunity in terms of new jobs and innovation.\n  For every $1 we spend, we get $30 in benefits. The U.S. environmental \ntechnology industry in 2008 generated approximately $300 billion in \nrevenues and supported almost 1.7 billion in jobs. The air pollution \nsector alone produced $18 billion in revenue.\n  If we're going to remake the world before 2050, and this is one area \nwhere I agree with my Republican friends, we're going to have to \nharness the power of the good old American market economy. And one way \nto do that is to put a price tag on carbon and other global warming \npollutants.\n  With a price tag, we more accurately reflect the consequences of \nthese pollutants, not just for the environment but also for the quality \nof our lives and the health of our families. If we understand the \nconsequences of our choices, especially in economic terms, we'll make \nbetter choices.\n  One way to do this is to levy a pollution fee that reflects the true \nenvironmental cost of coal and oil. But there's no chance the current \nCongress will enact any tax, especially one on smokestack industries.\n  Over the course of 2011, the Republican-controlled House held nearly \n200 votes to weaken our environmental safeguards, including the bedrock \nlegislation spawned by the very first Earth Day--the Clean Air Act, the \nClean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, even the agency created to \nenforce those laws, the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  If we don't use the market, the other option is, inevitably, direct \nregulation of carbon emissions by the EPA under the Clean Air Act. The \nconservative-dominated Supreme Court has already given the green light \nto the EPA to do this. But this invites even more bitterness and \npolitical partisanship.\n  Besides, pricing pollution has already shown itself to be effective. \nDuring the 1980s, instead of imposting regulations, we used a cap-and-\ntrade system to reduce the sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants \nthat caused plant- and soil-destroying acid rain. The system included \ncash incentives to over comply: polluters received allowances for every \nton of sulfur oxide under the limits, and they could trade, sell or \nbank the allowances. The system worked so well that regulated plants \nreduced emissions 40 percent more than required.\n  There is every reason to believe some variation of that system would \nwork just as well to curb carbon emissions. But anything related to or \nresembling ``Cap And Trade'' isn't the best rallying cry these days \nthanks to the concerted, cynical re-branding of the concept. But \nwhatever rallying cry is used, the point is the time for action is now. \nWe need a ``Million Man-Million Woman-Million Child'' March on \nWashington and the voting booths of America. We need people marching up \nthe steps of the Capitol, pounding on the doors of Congress, demanding \na solution to our climate crisis.\n  We also know we need deadlines to instill a sense of urgency. There \nis a deadline coming up this week in Rio where they are now having Rio \nPlus 20, the 20-year anniversary of that meeting I referred to at the \nbeginning. Much has changed since the first Earth Day summit back in \n1992--and much of it for the worse. True, we're seeing innovation and \nentrepreneurship flourish in countries that were once considered among \nthe poorest. We should celebrate that. But I'll tell you: Twenty years \nafter Rio and 15 years after Kyoto, we are still further behind than \never. The science is screaming at us, and the planet is sending us an \nSOS.\n  We obviously failed to be held accountable or to implement the \ncommitments we put in place 20 years ago. Earlier this month, the \nUnited Nations Environmental Program issued the official summit report, \nwhich noted ``significant progress'' in only 4 of 90 environmental \ngoals over the past five years. We can--and we must--do better.\n  I spoke earlier of the need to take advantage of the green energy \neconomy. Our best economists say to ward off catastrophic climate \nchange, the green revolution has to happen three times faster than the \nindustrial revolution did. I believe that is why America and the rest \nof the world are facing this moment of truth.\n  Will we step up and put in place the policies that galvanize our \ngreen entrepreneurs, that drive development of new clean technologies, \nreenergize the economy, and tackle climate change all at the same time? \nWe are the country that invented solar and wind technology, but the \nGermans, the Japanese, and the Chinese are the ones who are developing \nit. It is a tragedy. Today, of the top thirty companies in the world in \nsolar, wind and advanced batteries, only six are based in the United \nStates. If we do this right, I truly believe that the next four or five \nGoogles will emerge in the energy sector. The question is not whether \nthe twenty-first century economy will be a green economy--it has to \nbecome one, and it will. The question is whether it happens in time to \navert catastrophe, and whether America will continue to lead.\n  Accelerating the transition to a new energy paradigm is the most \nimportant single step the world can take in order to reduce the threat \nof climate change. And Rio is as good a place as any to make that \nhappen. At the Summit, nations are expected to announce commitments to \nthe Sustainable Energy for All initiative. Tackling the challenges of \nenergy access, energy efficiency and renewable energy in an integrated \nway is absolutely essential. That's why a wide variety of \nstakeholders--from governments to businesses to civil society leaders--\nhave indicated that they will be coming to Rio with national action \nplans in hand that can be monitored over time as part of a new mission \nof the United Nations and its partners.\n\n  I am convinced countries that take advantage of the opportunities are \ngoing to be the leaders of the 21st century. I have already seen that \nsuccess in Massachusetts. Massachusetts was recently ranked first in \nthe Nation in energy efficiency and clean energy leadership, edging out \nCalifornia for the first time ever.\n  I think my State is an example of the speed in which we can turn \nthings around. Our unemployment level just went down to the 6-percent \nlevel, and it is because we do have that diversity and we are moving in \nthat direction.\n  Now, obviously, the government alone can't solve this. Government can \nhelp create a structure. Private sector is the key. But we need to put \nin place the policies that send a message to the marketplace that we \nare serious about doing this.\n  The bottom line is we need to face up to this challenge once and for \nall--not just as individuals or as separate interests but as a nation, \nwith a national\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\npurpose. The Pew poll recently showed a 46-point gap between \nRepublicans and Democrats on the need to protect the environment. And \nI'll give you one guess which party fell by 39 points in its support \nfor protecting the environment since 1992. So I understand if there is \na 46-point gap and we have had all this discounting and disinformation, \nthis is going to be hard still.\n  But David Orr is right on the mark: Our challenge is fundamentally \npolitical. It is not about budgets. It is not about regulations. It is \nabout leaders in the country who are unwilling to deal with the truth \nabout climate change and who have cowed the silent majority into \nsubmission with their contrived and concerted attacks without facts.\n  I've spoken before about this country's crisis of governance and the \ndangers of being held hostage to one party's remarkably cynical and \nselfish drive for power that comes at the expense of all common sense. \nToday, we need a transformative moment in our politics. David Orr spoke \nto that in the book I already cited.\n  He said:\n\n       Our situation calls for the transformation of governance \n     and politics in ways that are somewhat comparable to that in \n     U.S. history between the years of 1776 and 1800. In that time \n     Americans forged the case for independence, fought a \n     revolutionary war, crafted a distinctive political \n     philosophy, established an enduring Constitution, created a \n     nation, organized the first modern democratic government, and \n     invented political parties to make the machinery of \n     governance and democracy work tolerably well.\n\n  Colleagues, we have made transformative changes before, and there are \nother kinds of examples. We once burned wood for our fuel. Then we \ntransitioned to relying on oil and coal, and now other things. We can \nmake the leap to a mix of renewable energy sources--hydro, wind, solar, \nand others--but we need to set our sights on that next transformation.\n  As the old saying goes from the Arab oil minister in the 1970s:\n\n       The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones, and \n     the oil age is not going to end because we run out of oil.\n\n  Truer words could not be spoken.\n  In the end, the question is not whether we are going to pay for \nclimate change; we are already paying for it--in warmer temperatures, \nrising sea levels, melting glaciers, floods, droughts, wildfires, \ndecimation of animal and plant life, loss of crops, insurance on homes, \nincreased storms. We are paying for it. The real question is whether we \nare going to walk a path that now addresses it in a responsible way and \nhelps us break humanity's addiction to the easy way--to oil--and turn \naway from the other alternatives that face us that clean up our \nenvironment and create jobs. The question is whether we are going to \nsuffer the consequences later on a massive, unpredictable scale in the \nform of environmental devastation, war, human misery, famine, poverty, \nand reduced economic growth for decades to come.\n  I close by saying that the fork in the road points in two directions. \nThe task for us is to take the one less traveled. At the height of the \nAmerican revolution Thomas Paine wrote about the ``summertime soldiers \nand the sunshine patriots'' who abandoned the cause. The science has \nshown us, and continues to show us, that we cannot afford to be \nsummertime soldiers.\n  So in this time of challenge and opportunity, I hope and pray \ncolleagues will take stock of this science, will take stock of the \nchoices in front of us, will understand the economic opportunities \nstaring us in the face. I hope we will confront the conspiracy of \nsilence about climate change head on and allow complacence to yield to \ncommon sense and narrow interests to bend to the common good. Future \ngenerations are counting on us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                       Recent Intelligence Leaks\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, over the last 2 weeks several Members of \nthis body and I have raised serious concerns about a series of leaks \nthat recently appeared in several publications concerning certain \nmilitary and intelligence activities--activities the authors themselves \ncite as among the Nation's most highly classified and sensitive. These \nenormously troubling leaks have raised concerns amongst both Democrats \nand Republicans in Congress, including leaders of our Intelligence, \nArmed Services, Foreign Relations, and Homeland Security Committees.\n  According to Senator Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence:\n\n       These disclosures have seriously interfered with ongoing \n     intelligence programs and have put at jeopardy our \n     intelligence capability to act in the future. Each disclosure \n     puts American lives at risk, makes it more difficult to \n     recruit assets, strains the trust of our partners, and \n     threatens imminent and irreparable damage to our national \n     security in the face of urgent and rapidly adapting threats \n     worldwide.\n\n  For these reasons and more, 26 other Members and I filed a resolution \nthat conveys the sense of the Senate that the Attorney General should \nappoint an outside special counsel to investigate these leaks.\n  I have been around for quite some time. I think there is no doubt \nthat these leaks are almost unprecedented in that they are ongoing \ncovert operations that are directly involved with the greatest threats \nto our Nation's security. I certainly understand that robust public \ndebate about the Nation's offensive use of cyber-related and unmanned-\nstrike capabilities is valuable and warranted, that debate and \ndiscussion is valuable and warranted. The use of these kinds of \nmilitary capabilities is new, and how these secretive warfighting \ncapabilities should be deployed by a modern democracy deserves careful \nand thoughtful discussion, and we will have discussions in the future \nabout these new aspects of warfare and counterterrorism.\n\n  But the detail with which these articles lay out particular \ncounterterrorism activities--and as one commentator recently described, \nthe ``triumphalist tone of the leaks--the Tarzan-like chest-beating of \n[the] various leakers,'' greatly exceeded what is necessary or \nappropriate for that discussion. Something else--something very \ndifferent--is going on.\n  Considering how closely in time these items were published and how \nfavorable of an impression they left upon the President's approach to \nnational security, it is not unreasonable to ask whether these leaks \nwere part of a broader effort to paint President Obama, in the midst of \nan election year, as a strong leader on national security issues. That \nis the strong impression that is given.\n  The most compelling evidence is the obvious participation of some of \nthe administration's senior-most officials. Among the sources that New \nYork Times journalist David Sanger cited in the passage of his recent \nbook pertaining to U.S. cyber attacks on Iran are ``administration \nofficials'' and ``senior officials,'' ``senior aides'' to the \nPresident, ``members of the President's national security team who were \nin the [White House Situation Room] during key discussions,'' an \nofficial ``who requested anonymity to speak about what is still a \nclassified program,''; ``current . . . American officials . . . [who \nwould not] allow their names to be used because the effort remains \nhighly classified, and parts of it continue to this day,'' and several \nsources who would be ``fired'' for what they divulged--presumably \nbecause what they divulged was classified or otherwise very sensitive.\n  Some of the sources in recent publications specifically refused to be \nidentified because what they were talking about related to classified \nor ongoing programs.\n  In his book, which describes the administration's use of drones in \nYemen, Newsweek journalist Daniel Klaidman writes:\n\n       [W]hen I quote President Obama or other key characters, I \n     do so only if that quote was relayed to me by a source who \n     personally heard it.\n\n  That certainly narrows down the number of people who could be guilty \nof these leaks.\n  On Sunday, a reviewer of both Mr. Sanger's and Mr. Klaidman's books \nfor the Washington Post found--as I did--that ``[both authors] were \nclearly given extraordinary access to key players in the administration \nto write their books . . . [i]n some cases, they appear to have talked \nto the same sources: \n[s]everal of their stories track nearly word for word.''\n  Perhaps most illuminating in all of the articles and books is how, \ntaken together, they describe an overall perspective within the Obama \nWhite\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\nHouse that has viewed U.S. counterterrorism and other sensitive \nactivities in extraordinarily political terms and taken on a related \napproach about how classified information should be handled. Both \napproaches would have predisposed the administration to the most \nrecent, egregious national security leaks.\n  There are plenty of examples of how the administration apparently \nviewed these highly sensitive matters through a political prism. In his \nbook, Mr. Klaidman observed that then-White House Chief-of-Staff Rahm \nEmanuel, ``pushed the CIA to publicize'' successes associated with a \ncovert drone program because ``the muscular attacks could have a huge \npolitical upside for Obama, insulating him from charges that he was \nweak on terror.'' Mr. Klaidman noted, that ``[as to the killing of a \nparticular drone target,] [CIA] public affairs officers anonymously \ntrumpeted their triumph, leaking colorful tidbits to trusted reporters \non the intelligence beat, [with] [n]ewspapers describ[ing] the hit in \ncinematic detail.''\n  A recent article in The New York Times similarly noted:\n\n       David Axelrod, the president's closest political adviser, \n     began showing up at the `Terror Tuesday' meetings [by the \n     way, during which drone targeting was discussed], his \n     unspeaking presence a visible reminder of what everyone \n     understood: a successful attack would overwhelm the \n     president's other aspirations and achievements.\n\n  And, in his recent book, Mr. Sanger notes:\n\n       [O]ver the course of 2009, more and more people inside the \n     Obama White House were being `read into' the cyber program, \n     even those not directly involved. As the reports from the \n     latest iteration of the [cyber-]bug arrived, meetings were \n     held to assess what kind of damage had been done, and the \n     room got more and more crowded.\n\n  Let's look at another anecdote in Mr. Sanger's book that provides \nanother powerful example of what I am talking about. In this excerpt, \nMr. Sanger depicts a curious meeting that occurred in the fall of 2009 \nin Pittsburgh at the G 20 economic summit. He writes:\n\n       As often happens when the president travels, there was a \n     dinner organized with a number of other reporters and several \n     of Obama's political aides, including David Axelrod and Rahm \n     Emanuel. The talk was mostly politics and the economic \n     downturn. But just as coffee was being served, a senior \n     official in the National Security Council tapped me on the \n     shoulder. After dinner, he said, I should take the elevator \n     to the floor of the hotel where the president had his suite. \n     `We'll talk about Iran,' he whispered.\n       Obama was not back at the hotel when we gathered that \n     evening outside his suite. But most of the rest of the \n     national security staff was present and armed with the \n     intelligence that had been collected over many years about \n     Iran's secret site. As they laid it out on a coffee table in \n     the hotel suite, it was clear that this new site was \n     relatively small: it had enough room, they estimated, for \n     three thousand centrifuges . . .\n       Via satellite photos, the United States had mapped the \n     construction of the building--useful if it ever had to hit \n     it. It was clear from the details that the United States had \n     interviewed scientists who had been inside the underground \n     facility . . . We spent an hour reviewing the evidence. I \n     probed them to reveal how the facility was discovered and \n     received evasive answers . . . Then I went down to my hotel \n     room and began writing the story.\n\n  It absolutely eludes me under what circumstances it would be \nappropriate for a senior national security official to provide a \nreporter the opportunity to review for an hour what appears to have \nbeen raw intelligence supporting the government's recent discovery of \nsecret nuclear sites in Iran. Yet, this vignette is indicative of what \nappears throughout the book as a pervasive administration perspective \nthat viewed even the Nation's most secretive military and intelligence \nactivities in starkly political terms and was overly lax on how related \nintelligence should be handled. These stories provide a revealing \ncontext for the most recent leaks--leaks that everyone has conceded \nhave compromised our national security.\n  I would like to believe that the Justice Department will get to the \nbottom of all this. But after watching senior White House advisor David \nPlouffe's appearance on Fox News on Sunday, I highly doubt that it \nwill. I was particularly troubled by Mr. Plouffe's inability or refusal \nto answer whether the White House will cooperate fully with the \ninvestigation and whether President Obama would agree to be questioned \nby investigators as President Bush was during the Valerie Plame case. I \nwas also discomforted by Mr. Plouffe's statement that the White House \ntalked to Mr. Sanger for his book but did not leak classified \ninformation, which of course prejudges the outcome of the \ninvestigations.\n  As one commentator observed yesterday, Mr. Plouffe's answers:\n\n     were so rehearsed, clumsy and full of forced distractions and \n     faux frustration that[,] if [his] interview [on Fox News] had \n     been conducted by law enforcement[,] Plouffe would have been \n     told he was going for a ride downtown to the police station \n     for further questioning.\n\n  As this commentator noted, from these sorts of appearances, it's \napparent that ``[t]he administration has something to hide. Plouffe \ncould not have been more parsed, poorly prepared or unconvincing.''\n  Moreover, just this past Friday, The Washington Post reported that \nFederal authorities have interviewed more than 100 people in the two \nongoing leak investigations and, specifically citing ``officials \nfamiliar with the probes,'' described these interviews as ``the start \nof a process that could take months or even years.'' According to \nanonymous ``officials,'' the Post also noted that ``the pace of the \ninvestigations is partly driven by the large number of government \nofficials who had access to the material that was disclosed and who now \nmust be interviewed.'' The fact that details about these leak \ninvestigations are themselves being leaked does not inspire me with \nconfidence that we are on the right track.\n  Furthermore, according to the Post, citing ``officials who spoke on \nthe condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter,'' \nthe two pending investigations focus on the Associated Press article \nabout a disrupted terrorist bomb plot by al-Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen \nand The New York Times' report about the Obama administration's role in \nauthorizing cyberattacks against Iran. In other words, there appears to \nbe no probe of the leaks relating to U.S. drone operations. Apparently, \n``officials'' told the Post that such an investigation had not been \nrequested.\n  Why not?\n  With the passage of time, the need for the Attorney General to \nappoint an outside special counsel to independently investigate and, \nwhere appropriate, hold accountable those found responsible for these \negregious violations of our national security, becomes clearer and \nstronger. At the end of the day, can we really expect the \nadministration to investigate itself impartially in the midst of an \nelection on a matter as highly sensitive and damaging as this leaks \ncase, especially when those responsible could themselves be members of \nthe administration? Plus, we are not talking about an isolated instance \nof one leak. As my colleague, the chairperson of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein rightly observed, we \nare talking about ``an avalanche of leaks'' on national security \nmatters--the implications of which are severe.\n  To date, I have seen no evidence that suggests that the American \npeople should rely on the direction that the White House has chosen to \nprovide a full and timely investigation of these leaks. For these \nreasons, I once again call on the appointment of an outside special \ncounsel to do so today. Just as former Senator Biden and former Senator \nObama called for a special counsel in the case of Valerie Plame, a case \nfar less severe as far as the implications to our national security are \nconcerned.\n\n  As I said at the beginning of my comments, I have been around this \ntown for quite a while. I, like the rest of my colleagues, have never \nseen leaks of this nature at such a high level concerning ongoing \ncovert operations. They deserve an investigation which will have \ncredibility with the American people. So far that has not been \nforthcoming from this administration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Agriculture Reform\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I assume we are in morning business. \nBecause we are in morning business, I am going to use that time to talk \nabout four amendments I have to the Agriculture bill. I want to make \none acute observation to the American people on what is going on in \nWashington.\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\n  The four amendments I will have on the Agriculture bill are a symptom \nof the disease that is in front of our Nation. This year we are going \nto run about a $1.3 trillion deficit. At the end of this fiscal year we \nwill have 16.25 trillion dollars' worth of debt. I am 64 years of age. \nMy children and grandchildren are going to pay back my portion of that \ndebt. I am not going to be paying it back. The questions in front of \nour Nation are, No. 1, how did we get to this point, and, No. 2, what \nare we going to do about it.\n  What we are going to hear today as we begin voting on the amendments, \nwhat we are going to hear from the Senate, is why we cannot cut \nspending, why we cannot limit our appetites, why we cannot end \nsubsidies to some of the richest co-ops in the world, why we cannot \nstop sending money to the Republican and Democratic Conventions out of \nthe Treasury, why we cannot limit some of the conservation programs \nthat go to millionaires--why we cannot do it. We are going to hear why \nwe cannot.\n  This country cannot wait for us to continue hearing excuses about why \nwe cannot trim our expenditures. The real problem is the Federal \nGovernment is going to take in $2.6 trillion, and it is going to spend \nabout $3.8 trillion. That is the real problem. We ignore it politically \nby not making hard decisions, by not reforming the Tax Code for a \nprogrowth, lower rates, broader base where everybody is participating \nin the Tax Code. People, through their well-connectedness, don't have \nto get out of special benefits to them, which is $30 billion a year for \nthe very wealthy in this country in the Tax Code. We refuse to do those \nthings. We have campaigns going on all across the country and nobody is \ntalking about the No. 1 threat to this country, which is our debt and \nour deficits.\n  The reason there is no job creation is not because politicians don't \nwant job creation. It is because they refuse to reform the very things \nthat are keeping job creation from happening.\n  I am going to have four amendments. All of them actually save money \nfor the American taxpayers, our kids, and our grandkids. They are all \ncommon sense. Most people outside of Washington will agree with them \nexcept the very people who are getting the benefits. They are the well-\nheeled, and they are the well-connected who continue to get things for \nthemselves to the detriment of our future.\n  The question the American people have to start asking is when is \nWashington going to grow up? When are they going to start taking \nresponsibility for their addictive behavior? Everybody who comes into \nmy office who has lobbied me on these four amendments say: You can't \ntake anything away from me. Do my colleagues realize what the answer is \nwhen anybody says: You can't take anything away from me? The answer is \nbankruptcy and a position, in terms of the economics of this country, \nthat will be far worse than the Great Depression ever was and far worse \nthan anything our country has ever experienced. But everybody says: \nWhat I am getting now I have to keep, regardless if someone is a \nmultibillion-dollar conglomerate co-op and we are sending someone $100 \nmillion every 10 years to advertise their product.\n\n  The second point I will make before I outline these four amendments \nis the one thing we refuse to look at that can guide us on how to make \nthese decisions is article I, section 8 of the Constitution. What is \nthe real role for the Federal Government? I will tell my colleagues as \nwe look at these four amendments, we are going to have trouble squaring \nwhat our Founders said was our role with what we are doing now in these \nfour areas and then saying we are not violating the Constitution by \nspending money we don't have--money we are going to have to borrow to \nbe able to spend--and spend it in areas that help the well-heeled and \nthe well-connected.\n  All of these amendments are very straightforward.\n  I wish to make one other point. We spend $200 million a year through \nfive separate programs of the government to promote agricultural \nproducts outside of this country--$200 million a year. That is $2 \nmillion every 10 years. Let's show how effective they have been by \nlooking at this chart. Whether one thinks it is constitutional, what \nkind of a job have they done since 1997? I don't think that trend line \nlooks very good. So if we are going to spend $200 million paying for \nthe promotion of agricultural products outside of this country, maybe \nwe ought to ask the question: Why are we on a declining slope, as far \nas percentage of the world's agricultural sales, at the same time when \nfarm income in this country has never been higher? Why is it? Because \nthe Federal Government is not very good at doing things the private \nsector is very good at.\n  We have five separate programs within the Department of Agriculture \nto do this, and the question the American people ought to be asking is: \nWhy do we have five programs? If, in fact, it is a role for the Federal \nGovernment, which I highly doubt under the Constitution, why do we have \nfive? So that is how well we are doing.\n  I will talk about the first program. The market access program is one \nof the five programs the Federal Government has within the Department \nof Agriculture to do this. The Obama administration actually agrees \nwith this amendment. In their budget, they put a recommendation to trim \nthis. Yet all we have heard from everybody out there who gets the soft \nride on this is that we can't take any money away from this program. If \nwe can't take $40 million a year out of a program that is ineffective, \nhistory is here. We are going to be belly up, and the consequences of \nthat will be devastating not just for our kids but for us, because it \nis going to come in the very near future.\n  All this amendment says is out of these five programs, let's cut this \none 20 percent. The Obama administration recommended doing that. The \nGAO says there is nothing to say that this is effective use of tax \ndollars. One would think we are pulling toenails, to hear the people \nscream. I won't go into the details on this amendment because my time \nis limited. It means we are still going to spend $160 million on this \none program, which is one of five, to promote agricultural products \nwhen we are not being successful in spending that money anyway.\n  The question is, Why would we vote against it? Because there is a \nparochial interest somewhere that we are going to be beholden to that \nis greater than our interest and fidelity to the U.S. Constitution or \nour interest and fidelity to the future of this country. That is why \npeople will vote against this amendment. It doesn't have anything to do \nwith common sense. It doesn't have anything to do with the fact that we \nare going to run this significant deficit when we have a $16 trillion \ndebt. It has to do with how do I make sure I am not in trouble with the \nparochial interests rather than doing the right, best thing for our \ncountry.\n  The second amendment--and I have received a lot of criticism for it--\nis in conjunction with Senator Durbin. For those people with adjusted \ngross incomes of greater than three-quarters of a million dollars a \nyear, all this amendment does is decrease the subsidy the middle-\nincome, hard-working factory worker or service worker in this country \npays with their taxes to subsidize a crop insurance program that \nguarantees a profit and yield. Instead of a 62-percent subsidy by the \nFederal Government when they are making more than three-quarters of a \nmillion dollars per year, we take it to 47 percent. What do we hear? \nOh, we can't do that. If a person is making $750,000 a year farming, \nthat person's capital should be in pretty good shape and they should be \nable to afford to take on some more of the risks.\n  We are going to hear: Well, this will be too hard to implement. There \nisn't another agriculture program that doesn't have an income payment \nlimitation of some type associated with it, except this one. When, out \nof every dollar spent on crop insurance, the average, hard-working \nAmerican is paying 62 percent of it, it is not too much to ask those \nwho are on the upper income stream in the agricultural community to \nparticipate a little bit more in helping pay for that subsidy by taking \na reduced subsidy. So all we are doing is taking 15 percent of it.\n  Under this agriculture bill that is on the floor, there are three \nways to ensure profit, and every one of them the American taxpayer who \nis not a farmer is paying for. There is no other business in this \ncountry where they are\n\n[[Page S4264]]\n\nguaranteed that profit and revenue will be there through an insurance \npolicy that is paid for by the rest of us.\n  The GAO report said we should actually limit it to $40,000 and we \nwill save $5 billion over the next 10 years. This amendment will only \nsave $1 billion over the next 10 years. But the way we get rid of $1 \ntrillion deficits is to ask everybody to share a little bit. All this \namendment is doing is asking the most well-off farmers--the ones we \nhave been subsidizing for years; the ones who are taking hundreds of \nthousands of dollars every year from the American taxpayers--to pay 15 \npercent more on their crop insurance so the average individual in this \ncountry isn't taking off their table to subsidize somebody who is \nmaking three-quarters of a million dollars a year.\n  The third amendment is an amendment to end conservation payments to \nmillionaires. Almost every other program we have in terms of our farm \nprograms has some limitations on it, but the Department of Agriculture \nhas an exception where they can exclude this limitation. All this \namendment would do is say to somebody who has an adjusted gross income \nof $1 million a year: Wouldn't that money be better spent somewhere \nelse in the farm conservation area, No. 1; and No. 2, if it is in the \nbest interests of the farm or production of agricultural acreage, and \nsomebody has that kind of income, isn't it in their best interests to \ndo these things?\n\n  It is a very simple amendment that says: If you are making an \nadjusted gross income of $1 million or more a year, then we are going \nto put some limitations on how much money we spend on your property and \nthen go spend it on other properties where we might, in fact, have more \neffective resource conservation.\n  The final amendment I have to the bill has nothing to do with the \nagricultural bill but it has everything to do with the problems in this \ncountry. In February of this year, the U.S. Treasury wrote a check to \nthe Democratic National Convention and the Republican National \nConvention for $18.4 million each. When the Presidential checkoff \nsystem was created, the politicians in Washington wired it so that we \nthought we were giving money to a Presidential campaign when, in fact, \nthey took a percentage of it for both parties. We don't have $18.4 \nmillion to spend on a Republican convention or a Democratic convention. \nThe nominees of both parties are known. So what we have done, besides \nspending $100 million in security for both of those events--$50 million \napiece--is we sent $18 million to the heads of both parties to spend \nany way they want to spend it. What is wrong with that? That $18.4 \nmillion we borrowed from the Chinese. So we are borrowing money from \nthe Chinese to fund a hallelujah party in both Tampa and Charlotte this \nyear, each one of them getting $18.4 million. It is time that kind of \nnonsense stop.\n  This amendment is going to require 60 votes. I don't know why they \nput it at 60 votes; maybe so a lot of people can vote for it but it \nstill won't pass. But here is a test vote on whether the Senate gets \nthe problems this country faces. If somebody votes against this \namendment, what it says is they believe politics is above principle, \nthat careerism trumps character, and that they can pull the wool over \nthe eyes of the vast portion of American citizens. What could we do \nwith $18.4 million times two? Well, there are tons we could do. The \nfirst thing is we could quit paying interest to the Chinese for it. The \nsecond thing is who could we help in terms of their health care or \ntheir housing? How many HIV patients who are waiting on ADAP who can't \nget the treatment they need could we help with $18.4 million?\n  The point is this amendment is probably going to get defeated, but I \nwant my colleagues to look in that realm of the universe in America \nwhere all the politicians reacted with disdain over the GSA conferences \nspending $880,000 in what was said to be a foolish way. If they made \nany comment about the excesses of governmental agencies on conferences \nand parties, how can they not apply the same standard to their own \npolitical party?\n  My hope is that America will wake up. I am in the twilight years of \nmy life. I have seen vast changes in our country, both good and bad, \nbut we have maxed out the credit card in our country. We can't get \nanother credit card without severe pain. We are trying to not do the \nright thing in the Congress of the United States. We are trying to kick \nthe can down the road. We are trying to not make the hard decisions. \nAnd everyone who comes and lobbies says: Yes, I agree there is a \nproblem, but please don't take anything away from me.\n  The answer is leadership that says we all have to sacrifice to get \nour country out of the depths of the problems we are facing today. This \nwill be a great key vote on whether the Senators understand priorities \nand the depth of the problems we are in.\n  There is no way we should ever again send taxpayer funds to the \nDemocratic Party or the Republican Party for a convention, and this \namendment would eliminate that in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I know we are in Republican time. I would \nlike to use some of the Republican time to talk about an important \nissue in the farm bill, which is catfish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, thank you for acknowledging me. I will be \nbrief. I know we have other colleagues on the way, so I will be brief \nand I will yield when they get here and they are squared away.\n\n\n                           Catfish Inspection\n\n  Mr. President, let me just talk for a few minutes about catfish and \nsomething that I think is very important; that is, that catfish be \ninspected. This may sound like a no-brainer, something that is simple. \nWe certainly would inspect and anticipate that all catfish that are \nraised in the United States would be inspected and follow all the USDA \nand other requirements--and it is. That is one of the good things, that \nwe know our food supply is safe and wholesome and it is ready for \nconsumption by Americans.\n  However, that is not the case for catfish that is imported from Asia. \nBy the way, I think people in my State and other catfish-producing \nStates would dispute whether this is actually catfish in the first \nplace. It is actually a variety of fish that is native to Asia, and it \nis grown in places such as Vietnam. I am certainly for trade and for \nfair trade and not for protectionism. But we need to make sure fish \nthat is coming in from overseas--we need to make sure it is properly \nlabeled but also that it is properly inspected.\n  I think the way the bill is currently drafted is appropriate and \nproper. We should leave the language that Senator Stabenow and the \nAgriculture Committee have established. We should leave that language \nin the legislation as it currently is so the catfish will be inspected \nin the United States, and imported fish that is marketed as catfish \nwill also be inspected by the same standards our domestic catfish are \ninspected under.\n  In 2011, the FDA examined about 3 percent of all seafood entries and \nperformed laboratory analysis on less than 1 percent of these entries. \nWe have to understand this Asian fish is raised in places that, quite \nhonestly, run a higher risk of contamination based on the growing \nconditions, based on the overall sanctity of their environment compared \nto ours.\n  I think they present more health risks. I think it only makes sense \nonce we know that one-third of these imports comes from southeastern \nAsia nations, places such as China and Vietnam where food safety \nstandards are not as high as in the United States. Once we understand \nthat, it makes sense that they would be afforded the same inspection \nregime that we would have here in the United States.\n  These foreign countries are currently flooding the U.S. market with \npotentially harmful products, and those products could be putting U.S. \nconsumers at risk. There have been several news reports about some of \nthe growing conditions over there and some of the possible harmful side \neffects to human health if humans consume those.\n\n[[Page S4265]]\n\n  Here again, we have the safeguards in the farm bill to do the \ninspections as they should be done. The new inspection program would \nsubject domestic catfish processors to daily USDA inspection, and \nimported catfish, much of which is raised in the unsanitary conditions \nI mentioned before--and it is also treated with antibiotics and other \nchemicals that are not deemed legal here in the United States, but that \nis the growing conditions they are in over there--it would require that \nthey would receive more rigorous inspection than they are currently \nsubject to.\n  Again, I do not see this as protectionist. I think this is truly to \nmake sure that all of the food supply, whether it comes from overseas \nor is grown domestically, meets our U.S. standards, and our people, our \nAmerican citizens, understand that when they purchase fish, they are \ngoing to get something that will not make them and their families sick \nwhen they consume it.\n  With that, I want to say that I appreciate all of my colleagues \nlooking at this provision. I appreciate Senator Stabenow and her whole \nteam and, in fact, all of the members of the Ag Committee who helped on \nthis, and all of their staffs. They have been great on this issue. \nCatfish is a very small part of our agriculture picture in the United \nStates, but it is an important part. People all over, especially all \nover the southern region of the United States, love to consume catfish. \nThey need to understand when they buy catfish in the United States that \nit is going to be safe for them and for their families.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Utility MACT\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S.J. \nRes. 37, and to express my deep and profound disapproval of the Obama \nadministration's handling of the utility MACT rule.\n  Let me first address what this debate is not about. This is not about \na debate between one side that supports clean air and another side that \ndoes not. We all support and understand the importance of maintaining \nour pristine environment, maintaining the quality of human health in \nthe ecosystem. My State, the great State of Utah, holds some of the \ngreatest land resources in the country, some of the most beautiful \nlandscapes. They are a source of pride for all Americans, and \nespecially for all Utahns. They provide a significant economic benefit \nfor my State in the form of tourism dollars.\n  I would not support any legislation ever that would damage our \nenvironmental brand in Utah or that would harm our environment. What \nthis debate does expose is this administration's vigorous, unfettered \nattempts to severely limit the use of coal technology and a complete \nand utter disregard for the economic benefits of this industry, and the \neconomic effects of this kind of overly aggressive regulation.\n  If implemented fully, the utility MACT rule would give utilities \nnationwide 3 short years to fully complete very costly upgrades to \ntheir plants. Many industry experts believe that these standards are \nnearly impossible to meet in that timeframe. Utilities will need closer \nto 5 or 6 years to make the necessary upgrades required by this \nregulatory scheme.\n  Those who are unable to comply will have no choice but to shut down \nunless or until they can meet those standards. This inevitably, with \nabsolute certainty, will result in sharp spikes to energy costs, \nincreased power bills for all Americans, affecting the most vulnerable \namong us the most severely.\n  Higher energy costs will, in turn, have a direct impact on the family \nbudget. The more we as Americans spend on higher energy costs, the less \nwe have available for savings, for education, and for other priorities. \nAlthough the President campaigns around the country by trying to \nconvince Americans that he knows how to create jobs, this rule alone \nhas been estimated by some industry experts as likely to kill 180,000 \nto 215,000 jobs by 2015.\n  So one has to wonder why it is this administration is nonetheless \nimposing rules it knows cannot be met, and that if they must be met, \nwill kill this many jobs and hurt this many Americans. Why are they \nignoring the obvious economic consequences of shutting down an industry \nthat produces about half of all of the electricity we use in the United \nStates of America today?\n  It does not make any sense. We can have sensible regulations that \nkeep our air and our water and other aspects of our environment clean. \nWe need that. We want that as Americans. We can also have a balanced \napproach that considers the economic costs of new rules and \nrestrictions on small businesses and on consumers. That is what we \nneed.\n  Utility MACT is an example of a regulation that does neither. It \naccomplishes none of these interests. I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport S.J. Res. 37. I stand with a growing bipartisan group of \nSenators, private sector unions, business interests that believe we can \ndo better as Americans than imposing those kinds of regulations on the \nAmerican people, and who also believe it is vitally important that when \nwe do put these kinds of regulations on the American people we first \nhave the kind of robust debate and discussion Americans have came to \nexpect from their political institutions.\n  Two separate provisions of the Constitution, article I, section 1, \nand article I, section 7, clearly place the legislative process, the \npower to make rules that carry the force of generally applicable \nbinding Federal law, in the hands of Congress, not in an executive \nbranch agency.\n  The American people know this. They understand it. They expect it. \nThey rely on it. Because they know if we pass laws the people do not \nlike, that the people cannot accept, that kill jobs, that hurt those \nmost vulnerable among us, that we can be held politically accountable \ncome election time, every 2 years in the case of Members of the House, \nevery 6 years in the case of Members of this body.\n  When we circumvent that process, when we allow the lawmaking process \nto be carried out entirely within an executive branch agency consisting \nof people who, while perfectly well intentioned and well educated, do \nnot stand accountable to the people, we insulate the lawmakers from \nthose governed by those same laws.\n\n  This is exactly why we need to exercise our authority under the \nCongressional Review Act by passing these resolutions of disapproval \nfrom time to time. But it is all the more reason why we need more \nlasting, significant reform, reform that can be had through the REINS \nAct proposal. This is a proposal that has already passed through the \nHouse favorably and needs to be passed in this body. It is a bill that \nwould require for any new regulation promulgated that at the \nadministrative level, any new regulation which qualifies as a major \nrule because it costs American consumers and small business interests, \nindividuals, families, and all others in America more than $100 million \nin a year, it would take effect if and only if it were first passed \ninto law in the House and in the Senate and signed into law by the \nPresident.\n  This is how our lawmaking process is supposed to operate. This is a \nsystem that our Founding Fathers carefully put in place, assuring that \nthose who make the laws and thereby have the capacity to affect the \nrights of individual Americans can and will be held accountable to the \npeople for the very laws they pass.\n  I tried to get the REINS Act up for consideration in connection with \nthe Ag bill. We were not successful in doing that. Apparently some in \nthis body, some in control of this body, were unwilling to have a vote \non the REINS Act proposal as an amendment to the Ag bill. Sooner or \nlater we need to have a vote on the REINS Act. We need to have this \ndebate and discussion, to assure that the laws that are passed in this \ncountry are passed by men and women chosen by the people, accountable \nto the people, that we may yet still have that guarantee in our \ncountry, a guarantee of government of the people, by the people, and \nfor the people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4266]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of amendment \nNo. 2440 to the farm bill. This amendment would improve implementation \nof an existing program at USDA which provides loans to purchasers of \nhighly fractionated Indian lands.\n  One unfortunate legacy of policies of the late 1800s is that many \nIndian lands are highly fractionated. This means that one parcel of \nland might have hundreds or even thousands of owners. Highly \nfractionated parcels make putting these Indian lands to viable use \nvirtually impossible. This goes against any well-established Federal \nIndian policies encouraging the productive use of Indian lands.\n  As chair of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I have worked with the \nUSDA and stakeholders to craft this amendment to improve agricultural \nland use for tribal governments and individual Indians. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. This is a technical amendment. I rise in support of it, \nand I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. AKAKA.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2192.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, June 7, 2012 \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, my amendment seeks to reform the value-\nadded grant program. The USDA has awarded $240 million in grants over \nthe lifetime of this program, but the USDA has not been transparent and \nhas failed to adequately account for the grants and how they are \nawarded.\n  The last assessment of this program was in 2006 and indicated that \nmore than 40 percent of the grant recipients went out of business just \n3 years after having completed their grant project. My amendment would \nallow the program to go forward, but it would reform this program to be \nmore accountable to taxpayers.\n  The program has awarded 62 grants totaling $12.1 million to ethanol \nfacilities. It does eliminate grants to ethanol facilities. We should \nnot be wasting further taxpayer dollars to give to ethanol producers \nwhen we have already given them so many taxpayer opportunities here.\n  At least 105 wine industry groups and wineries have received $10.5 \nmillion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I would just say this is a good amendment \nfor taxpayers to reform this program and make it accountable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, unfortunately, I would urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on this amendment. It cuts in half funding for a \nprogram that helps food entrepreneurs--small businesses and farmers who \nwant to create new kinds of products and to commercialize them and get \nthem to the marketplace.\n  This is really what we are trying to do--to leverage more dollars in \nthis bill to support not only the farmer on the farm but also to move \ninto commercialization and to create new food products and jobs. In \nfact, we have created hundreds of jobs at wineries. We have done this \nall across the country--created jobs by helping small businesses and \nentrepreneurs to take a great idea and to move it to commercialization \nand add value to their product.\n  I would strongly urge a ``no'' vote, and I would ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators--if I could \nhave the attention of the Senate--we have before us why we are here. \nThis was very difficult, to get to the point we are now, where we have \na very important bill. We do these every 5 years. Senators Stabenow and \nRoberts have worked very hard to get us to this point. I congratulate \nthem both, but we have a long way to go.\n  First of all, everyone understand all the next votes will be 10-\nminute votes. That means at the end of 15 minutes we are going to cut \noff the vote. It doesn't matter if a Democrat is missing or Republican \nis missing; it does not matter. If it is a close vote, we always are \ncareful with that, we understand, but let's understand when the time is \nup, we are going to turn in the vote.\n  Second, I have instructed all of the presiders, we are going to have \n1-minute speeches--1 minute for Democrats, 1 minute for Republicans. \nWhen the time is up, the time is going to end so everyone will be \ntreated the same. We have 73 amendments we have to work through. We \nhave a lot to do the rest of this week, but this is important. No. 1, \nwe are going to keep the vote. I have an important meeting at 4 \no'clock. I have instructed my staff, if I am not here I will not be \ncounted. That is what we have to do. If you have important meetings, \nyou might have to miss a vote or two.\n  Second, I repeat, we will have 2 minutes equally divided before each \nvote, and it will be 2 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2429\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2429.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Tester], for Mr. Baucus, for \n     himself and Mr. Tester, proposes an amendment numbered 2429.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To improve the livestock forage disaster program)\n\n       On page 128, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       (iii) Annual payment based on drought conditions determined \n     by means other than the u.s. drought monitor.--\n\n       (I) In general.--An eligible livestock producer that owns \n     grazing land or pastureland that is physically located in a \n     county that has experienced on average, over the preceding \n     calendar year, precipitation levels that are 50 percent or \n     more below normal levels, according to sufficient \n     documentation as determined by the Secretary, may be \n     eligible, subject to a determination by the Secretary, to \n     receive assistance under this paragraph in an amount equal to \n     not more than 1 monthly payment using the monthly payment \n     rate under subparagraph (B).\n       (II) No duplicate payment.--A producer may not receive a \n     payment under both clause (ii) and this clause.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nBaucus-Tester amendment No. 2429. The Baucus-Tester amendment fixes a \nproblem in the livestock forage program to make sure that ranchers who \nsuffer losses in their herds because of drought are able to get the \nhelp they need. If you are in grass-based agriculture, folks, for those \nranchers the grass is the heartbeat of your operation. If you do not \nhave it, you cannot survive. It was critical this last year when record \ndroughts devastated the Southwest. Wild fires burned more than 2 \nmillion acres in Texas.\n  This program has moved into title I of the farm bill. This amendment \nfixes a problem we have seen in one of those programs. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S4268]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, can we proceed with a voice vote on this \namendment?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I know of no objection at this point. I \nyield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2429.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2190, As Modified\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are ready with \nthe amendment of Senator Snowe. I ask she be the next amendment in \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I call up amendment No. 2190.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Maine (Ms. Snowe), for herself and Mrs. \n     Gillibrand, proposes an amendment numbered 2190.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I ask unanimous consent that amendment 2190 be modified \nwith the changes I am sending to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows.\n\n       (Purpose: To require Federal milk marketing order reform)\n\n       At the end of part III of subtitle D of title I, insert the \n     following:\n\n              PART IV--FEDERAL MILK MARKETING ORDER REFORM\n\n     SEC. 1481. FEDERAL MILK MARKETING ORDERS.\n\n       (a) Amendments.--The Secretary shall provide an analysis on \n     the effects of amending each Federal milk marketing order \n     issued under section 8c of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 608c), reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural \n     Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (in this part referred to as \n     a ``milk marketing order''), as required by this section.\n       (b) Use of End-product Price Formulas.--In carrying out \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall--\n       (1) consider replacing the use of end-product price \n     formulas with other pricing alternatives; and\n       (2) submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \n     and Forestry of the Senate a report describing the findings \n     of the Secretary on the impact of the action considered under \n     paragraph (1).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment \nI have offered along with Senator Gillibrand of New York on a \nbipartisan basis. I thank the Chair and ranking member for working with \nus on the modifications in support of this amendment.\n  The underlying bill establishes a margin insurance program that helps \nvery large dairy producers but provides little assistance to small \nfamily-owned dairy producers who have exponentially fewer cows and do \nnot produce the surplus amounts of milk. Without this amendment, these \nsmall dairy farmers face possible extinction due, in part, to the \nexcessive price volatility. The prices in Europe influence the price \nour farmers right here at home receive from the government.\n  This amendment will help resolve this inequity by requiring the \nDepartment of Agriculture to provide an analysis on the effects of \namending each Federal milk marketing order and deciding how best to \nupdate the system of Federal orders, which is now 12 years old. I hope \nwe will adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I support this amendment and yield the \nremainder of our time. It is my understanding we can proceed with a \nvoice vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 2190, as modified.\n  Those in favor, say aye.\n  (Chorus of ayes.)\n  All opposed, no.\n  (Chorus of nays.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nays appear to have it.\n  All those in favor, say aye.\n  (Chorus of ayes.)\n  All those opposed, no.\n  (Chorus of nays.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nays appear to have it.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for a record rollcall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2364 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak for a moment with regard to \namendment No. 2364 that Senator Hutchison and I had intended to offer. \nWe have been in consultation with the managers of the legislation. They \nhave agreed to some changes in the report language that accommodate our \nconcern.\n  Our concern is about water conservation and ensuring that water \nconservation, particularly in the arid West but in any part of the \ncountry where there are underground aquifers and wherever there is \ndepletion of water supplies that is going to make farming and \nagricultural activities impossible in the future. The managers have \nagreed to some changes in the report language that accommodate our \nconcerns. They have agreed to a colloquy that accommodates our \nconcerns. Accordingly, we will not proceed with the amendment.\n  Before I withdraw the amendment, could I ask Senator Hutchison to \nmake any comments she would like to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate the sponsors of the bill \nworking with us. Just as an example, the Ogallala Aquifer has gone down \n100 feet since irrigation has been allowed from this water source. It \nis a source for cities such as the city of San Antonio and other cities \naround New Mexico and Texas. That is just one example. It is happening \nall over our country. So conservation has to be a part of keeping our \nfarms and ranches alive, and that is the purpose of the amendment.\n  We appreciate the managers working with us and hope we can go forward \nand highlight the importance of conservation to keep our water \nresources for our farmers and ranchers.\n\n\n               WATER CONSERVATION IN MULTI-STATE AQUIFERS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Ogallala Aquifer--\nalso known the High Plains Aquifer--region, an area that is impacted on \na daily basis by groundwater pumping for agriculture. In fact, that \nregion leads the Nation in the amount of groundwater pumped for \nirrigation purposes, with some 17 billion gallons per day being \nwithdrawn for irrigation. I\n\n[[Page S4269]]\n\nhave for many years been concerned about the rapid groundwater \ndepletion occurring in the southern portion of that aquifer. There are \nparts of the Ogallala underlying New Mexico that have seen a decline in \nwater levels of more than 150 feet since groundwater pumping for \nagriculture first started.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I share the concern of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico. A large area in western Texas overlies the Ogallala \nAquifer as well. We, too, have seen alarmingly high levels of \ngroundwater depletion. Water is a precious resource in our part of the \ncountry, and the Ogallala is a major source of water for agriculture, \nour communities, and industrial development.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I understand that the bill before the Senate will make \nresources available to address the problem of the declining groundwater \nresources in the Ogallala. It would be helpful to my colleague from \nTexas and me if the chairwoman and ranking member of the Agriculture \nCommittee could confirm our understanding on certain aspects of the \nbill. First, am I correct that substantial funds under the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentive Program, EQIP, will continue to be made \navailable for practices that result in the conservation of groundwater, \nincluding the use of more efficient irrigation systems and conversion \nto less water-intensive crops or dryland farming, which may, within the \ndiscretion of the Secretary of Agriculture, include long-term grassland \nrotation?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes, the Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I understand that the Regional Conservation \nPartnership Program is intended to address water quantity as well as \nwater quality issues, so funding under the program could be directed to \naddress situations where high historic levels of groundwater depletion \nhave occurred due to agricultural use. Is that correct?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. With respect to the designation of critical \nconservation areas under section 2401 of the bill, I would encourage \nUSDA to look to areas where they already have initiatives in place \naddressing the area. I understand that any funding under this program \nwould be in addition to funding that would otherwise be available to \nthe region under any other provision of the bill. Finally, it is my \nexpectation and understanding that in determining whether an area would \nbe designated as a critical conservation area and in determining the \nlevel of funding to be directed to the area, the Secretary would \ncarefully consider areas where continued agricultural activities are \nthreatened by groundwater depletion.\n  Ms. STABENOW. The Senator is correct in his understanding.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I agree.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the chairwoman and ranking member.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank them as well.\n  Mr. President, in light of the comments we have just made, we will \nnot call up the amendment.\n  The managers can go to the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I may take a moment to thank Senator \nBingaman and Senator Hutchison. Both New Mexico and Texas have strong \nand passionate advocates. They are lucky to have them, and we are \nlooking forward to working with them to make sure the issues they have \nraised are addressed.\n  Also, just for those following along in order, I would just indicate \nthat Senator Collins, in light of the passage of the Snowe amendment, \nwill not be proceeding with her amendment, just for the information of \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2167\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I call up my marketing loan amendment, \namendment No. 2167.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2167.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide payment limitations for marketing loan gains and \n                       loan deficiency payments)\n\n       On page 140, strike line 1 and insert the following:\n       (b) Limitation on Marketing Loan Gains and Loan Deficiency \n     Payments for Peanuts and Other Covered Commodities.--Section \n     1001 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. 1308) is \n     amended by striking subsection (d) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(d) Limitation on Marketing Loan Gains and Loan \n     Deficiency Payments for Peanuts and Other Covered \n     Commodities.--The total amount of marketing loan gains and \n     loan deficiency payments received, directly or indirectly, by \n     a person or legal entity (except a joint venture or general \n     partnership) for any crop year under subtitle B of the \n     Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012 (or a \n     successor provision) for--\n       ``(1) peanuts may not exceed $75,000; and\n       ``(2) 1 or more other covered commodities may not exceed \n     $75,000.''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendments.--\n       On page 143, line 9, strike ``(c)'' and insert ``(d)''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I tried to get this amendment adopted in \nthe 2008 farm bill. It got 57 votes, but it was under a 60-vote rule, \nso obviously it did not get adopted.\n  This amendment would cap payments that one farmer can get on \nmarketing loans and loan deficiency payments. We cannot have 70 percent \nof the farm payments going to 10 percent of the largest farmers.\n  I think this amendment will help add integrity to the program. We \nshould have caps on title I commodity programs. This will add \ndefensibility to this bill, along with the payment limit reforms we \nwere able to put in in the committee before the bill was voted out.\n  Opponents will argue--I am sure you will hear this argument--that \nthis would increase forfeitures of crop. But I believe they are \noverstating that issue, especially given current prices. And even if a \nfarmer did forfeit crop----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, this is a commonsense amendment. I hope you will \nvote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nLimiting MLGs and LDPs is disruptive to orderly marketing because USDA \nlacks the ability in real time to track eligibility. Consequently, a \nproducer may exceed his loan limit under this amendment and USDA have \nno idea he has exceeded his loan limit, so he is going to have to come \nback later on and obviously repay that in very difficult times.\n  Most farming operations secure financing for annual production costs \nas well as incur long-term debt for equipment and land. Introducing \nlimits on marketing loan benefits makes this financing more difficult \nto obtain and more difficult to administer from a farmer's standpoint \nas well as a banking standpoint.\n  I urge opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes of debate, equally divided.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, Congress has provided an average of \n$400 million for farm bills in the rural development title. The bill we \nare considering includes no funding at all. My fiscally responsible \namendment funds rural business development programs, a portion of the \nbacklog of wastewater infrastructure projects, and will help bring a \nnew generation of farmers into agriculture.\n  As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I know how important it is \nthat this amendment maintain our committee's commitment to save at \nleast $23 billion in the farm bill. I yield the rest of my time to the \nchairwoman, Senator Stabenow.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, let me add my strong support for the \namendment. We have reformed this title on rural development. We have \neliminated 16 different authorizations, tightened it up. The amendment \nstays within our parameters of $23 billion in deficit reduction. In \neffect, this benefits every small town and community across America \nthat counts on rural development. I would strongly support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. I do so \nreluctantly with my colleague on the committee. But the committee bill \ncontains no mandatory funding in the rural development title. This \namendment would take savings achieved in the bill from 23.4--used to be \n26.3--now we are down to 23.4. That would take it down to 23.2 and \nredirect $150 million mandatory spending into a few rural development \nprograms.\n  Nothing against them, but if we are going to achieve savings in this \nbill, we have to hold the line. I reluctantly oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2174.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To limit categorical eligibility for the supplemental \n   nutrition assistance program to those who receive cash assistance)\n\n       On page 312, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4002. LIMITATION ON CATEGORICAL ELIGIBILITY.\n\n       Section 5 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. \n     2014) is amended--\n       (1) in the second sentence of subsection (a), by striking \n     ``households in which each member receives benefits'' and \n     inserting ``households in which each member receives cash \n     assistance''; and\n       (2) in subsection (j), by striking ``or who receives \n     benefits under a State program'' and inserting ``or who \n     receives cash assistance under a State program''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, food stamp spending has quadrupled--gone \nup four times--since 2001, increasing twice the rate that the other \nmajor poverty program, Medicaid, has increased. It is now the second \nlargest Federal welfare program. An individual on food stamps, with all \nother government programs they may be eligible for, can receive as much \nas $25,000 a year.\n  Under this bill food stamps will average $80 billion a year for 10 \nyears; whereas, the agriculture farm programs will average $20 billion \na year. It is by far the dominant factor in this entire piece of \nlegislation.\n  Amendment No. 2174 deals with the problem through a system known as \ncategorical eligibility. Forty-three States now provide benefits to \nindividuals whose income exceeds the statutory limit--incomes and \nassets. Only 11 States did that in 2007.\n\n[[Page S4271]]\n\n  I ask that we be able to fix this problem, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote. We \nactually rejected this amendment last fall. I ask that we do it again.\n  It is true that food assistance has gone up as the economy has had a \nrough time. As unemployment goes up, food costs go up. Unemployment is \ncoming down, and in this bill we reflect savings. As the economy is \ngetting better, food help goes down. It is no different than crop \ninsurance helping the farmer in a disaster. This helps families in a \ndisaster.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment would completely change the structure \nof food help. It would dramatically affect children and families. For \nexample, it would affect someone's ability to get to work because the \nvalue of their car would somehow be reflected in a way that would \nrequire them to possibly give up their car when they are trying to get \nto work in order to be able to put food on the table for their \nfamilies. It makes no sense.\n  This bill has commonsense reforms to make sure every dollar goes \nwhere it should. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise in support of this amendment \noffered by my colleague, Senator Murray, and others, to include in the \nschool lunch program a pilot program dealing with dry beans, peas, \nlentils, and chickpeas.\n  My amendment works to improve the nutritional value of school meals \nacross America at a very economical price. With the level of obesity of \nchildren between 2 and 19, it is very important we have this program \nincluded.\n  I yield 30 seconds to my colleague from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I thank Senator Cantwell, and I rise to \nspeak in support of this amendment. I cosponsored the legislation.\n  This would provide that pulse crops--peas, beans, and lentils--are \nused in school lunch programs. It does not add additional cost. They \nare a high source of protein, very cost effective, and it is a \ngrowing--no pun intended--crop in our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Madam President, I rise to call up this \namendment addressing Federal performance payments that States receive \nto make sure Americans in tough times who need Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program benefits receive them and those who don't do not get \nthem.\n  It is a commonsense, good government amendment that builds on a 2002 \nbipartisan agreement between the States, the previous Bush \nadministration, and Congress. In my view, Congress shouldn't eliminate \nincentives to improve efficiency in SNAP, as some are proposing. \nCongress should, though, better target these Federal performance bonus \nfunds so States can use them only--and let me emphasize ``only''--to \nimprove their SNAP.\n  My amendment ensures that the incentive payments go toward activities \nthat improve efficiency, effectiveness, and the integrity of SNAP. \nThese efforts have results. Since these incentives were put in place, \nthe SNAP error rate--and overpayment and underpayment rates--has fallen \nnearly 43 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I appreciate my good friend's \namendment. I do not think it deals with the problem completely and \nappropriately. I have offered amendment No. 2172, which would end the \nbonus payments for increasing registration on the Food Stamp Program. \nStates currently receive bonuses for increasing enrollment in the Food \nStamp Program. This amendment would end that policy and would save a \nmodest $480 million--if you call that modest--out of $800 billion being \nspent on this program over 10 years, according to the CBO.\n  One of the problems we have with the Food Stamp Program, if you just \nthink about it, is that all the money comes from the Federal Government \nbut all the administration comes from the States. They have no \nincentive to manage the program in a way to reduce waste, fraud, and \nabuse. It really helps their economy if more money comes in from out of \nState. For the Federal Government to have a program that rewards States \non top of their natural incentives would be wrong.\n  I urge support of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask for the yeas and nays and call up amendment No. \n2172.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I strongly oppose this amendment. We \nare talking about improvements in managing errors, reducing errors in \nthe nutrition program. The amendment of the Senator would eliminate the \nerror-reduction bonuses that go to State governments.\n  We have seen a 43-percent drop in payment errors as a result of the \nprogram Senator Nelson has now strengthened with his amendment. In his \namendment, he would ensure that all of the additional funds that go to \nStates are used only to carry out improvements in SNAP, to lower the \nerror rates. Those savings to taxpayers dwarf the costs of this \nincentive to States to improve their processes. It is working well.\n  In addition, in this bill we eliminate any lottery winners or \nstudents living at home with their parents from receiving assistance. \nWe crack down further on trafficking in retail establishments.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am calling up this amendment, which is \nvery simple. It is about two things: First of all, it would increase \nthe frequency of so-called dairy price reporting that goes on already. \nThe Department of Agriculture does this reporting on a rather frequent \nbasis. We are just going to suggest that we codify, or make law, what \nthe USDA is already doing. So, first, it would increase the frequency \nof reporting from ``no less than once a month'' to ``more than once a \nmonth.'' So it just puts into law what is already in practice.\n  Secondly, this amendment would require the USDA to study--only to \nstudy--the feasibility of having two classes of milk as opposed to \nfour. This would help clarify whether folks who want to do that--it \nrequires that study. But, particularly, in the first part of the \namendment, we need to make sure our farmers have as much information \nabout pricing to help the farmers themselves, dairy buyers, and dairy \nsuppliers.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2181.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish an average adjusted gross income limitation of \n      $250,000 for all payments and benefits under the Farm Bill)\n\n       Strike section 1605 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1605. AVERAGE ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME LIMITATION.\n\n       Section 1001D of the Food Security Act of 1985 (7 U.S.C. \n     1308 3a) is amended by striking subsection (b) and inserting \n     the following:\n       ``(b) Limitations.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, a person or legal entity shall not be eligible to \n     receive any payment or other benefit under the Agriculture \n     Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2012, or any amendment made by \n     that Act, during a crop, fiscal, or program year, as \n     appropriate, if the average adjusted gross income of the \n     person or legal entity exceeds $250,000.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, this amendment will limit all payments or \nall farm subsidies to persons with an adjusted gross income of less \nthan $250,000.\n  My friends across the aisle are commonly saying: Why don't those of \nmeans pay more or receive less? This amendment would do precisely that.\n  Nine percent of farmers earn more than $250,000 worth of adjusted \ngross income. This would limit their payments. Currently, 9 percent of \nthe farmers--who are the well-off farmers--are receiving nearly a third \nof the benefits.\n  A good question for the Senate might be: What do Scottie Pippen, \nLarry Flynt, and David Rockefeller have in common? The answer would be: \nthat besides being very rich, they have all gotten farm subsidies in \nthe past. I think this should change and that the wealthy should not be \nreceiving farm subsidies. This amendment would get rid of this.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and encourage Senators to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this \namendment. The good news is, the people who were mentioned will no \nlonger be able to get farm subsidies under this bill because of the \nreforms we have already put in place. We have already lowered the \nadjusted gross income. We have put a $50,000-per-person cap on \npayments, which is less than half than what farmers currently receive.\n  Let me say, this would cap across the board, including conservation, \nand conservation of land and water is critically important to us as a \ncountry.\n  I yield now the remainder of my time to my ranking member.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It is not only commodity programs, I say to my \nchairwoman. This would also affect all of our conservation programs, \ncrop insurance, rural development programs, research, dairy, and \nlivestock. I doubt if Larry Flynt has anything to do with any of those.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2181.\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Mr. President, I thank the leaders who have worked so hard \non this bipartisan farm bill, especially Chairwoman Stabenow and \nRanking Member Roberts.\n  On this bipartisan farm bill, Senator Chambliss and I are grateful to \nhave our amendment heard. Poultry is a critical industry in Delaware, \nGeorgia, and in many States. Between the recession and the volatile \ncost of chickenfeed, there will be a rising number of factors that can \nhave a catastrophic impact on local economies that are well beyond the \ncontrol of our farmers and integrators. The two studies we propose in \nthis amendment would explore whether insurance programs might make \nsense as a tool for helping poultry farmers and integrators continue to \nthrive during uncertain economic times and would specifically study \nprotection from catastrophic loss from disease outbreaks or bankruptcy \nof poultry integrators.\n  This amendment is at no additional cost to taxpayers. I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senator Chambliss and me in supporting it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 2422.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To modify a provision relating to conservation innovation \n                          grants and payments)\n\n       Strike section 2207 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2207.

Mr. President, I present this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Kyl, Senator Boxer, and myself. It is a very simple amendment. \nIt maintains a provision from the 2008 farm bill that sets aside $37.5 \nmillion for air quality improvement projects.\n  This program has been used to replace old diesel tractor engines with \nnewer, cleaner ones. This improves efficiency for the farmer and air \nquality in the region. It has helped thousands of farmers comply with \nEPA, State, and local air quality regulations.\n  In California's Central Valley, we have some of the poorest air \nquality in the country. It is an EPA extreme nonattainment zone, and \nthe EPA and the State have set very strict standards for emissions.\n  This funding has achieved the equivalent of removing more than \n408,000 cars from California highways in the last 5 years. I urge its \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment--the ranking \nmember has yielded some time to me--to thank Senator Feinstein. This is \nan excellent amendment. She has done a tremendous amount of work on it. \nI urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2422) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2191\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 2191.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2191.\n\n\n[[Page S4275]]\n\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that any cooperative organization or other entity \n that receives a business and industry direct or guaranteed loan for a \n   wind energy project is ineligible for any other Federal benefit, \n               assistance, or incentive for the project)\n\n       On page 596, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       ``(12) Other federal benefits.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, any cooperative organization or other \n     entity that receives a loan or loan guarantee under this \n     subsection for a wind energy project shall be ineligible for \n     any other Federal benefit, assistance, or incentive for the \n     project under any other provision of law.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if my colleagues think it is a good \nidea to give rich developers of wind turbines a double dip into the \nFederal Treasury at a time when we are borrowing 40 cents of every $1, \nthen this provision in the farm bill is for you. If you think a single \ndip into the Treasury is justified, then this amendment is for you.\n\n  The farm bill gives new loans, new loan guarantees for wind turbines. \nThat is on top of the 14 billion Federal tax dollars we are spending \nover 5 years for wind turbines--$6 billion through the production tax \ncredit and the other $8 billion through the section 603 grants. This \nsimply says: No double-dipping. Only one dip. If you do the tax credit, \nyou can't do the farm bill.\n  Vote yes if you don't like double-dipping into the Federal Treasury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment. I \nappreciate the interest and concern of the Senator from Tennessee. Let \nme just say that this amendment would cut off access for farmers and \nsmall businesses that are looking to develop wind energy projects that \nwill create jobs. I have to say, as someone coming from Michigan, when \nI look at one of those big wind turbines, I see 8,000 parts, and every \nsingle one of them can be made in Michigan or across the country--we \nwould prefer Michigan. But the reality is this is about jobs.\n  We are in the middle of a global clean energy race with countries \nsuch as China, and this is about giving our businesses a leg up to be \nable to win that race. Frankly, it is about getting us off of foreign \noil. This is one way to do that and to create jobs.\n  Since 2005, wind energy companies have contributed more than $60 \nbillion to the economy, with over 400 facilities in 43 States. It is \nabout jobs. It is about manufacturing.\n  I would urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To repeal a duplicative program relating to inspection and \n                          grading of catfish)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 12207. REPEAL OF DUPLICATIVE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Effective on the date of enactment of the \n     Food, Conservation, and Energy Act (7 U.S.C. 8701 et seq.), \n     section 11016 of that Act (Public Law 110 246; 122 Stat. \n     2130) and the amendments made by that section are repealed.\n       (b) Application.--The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 (7 \n     U.S.C. 1621 et seq.) and the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 601 et seq.) shall be applied and administered as if \n     section 11016 of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act \n     (Public Law 110 246; 122 Stat. 2130) and the amendments made \n     by that section had not been enacted.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of debate will be equally divided.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Senator McCain and I, along with a strong \nbipartisan group of our colleagues, are offering this amendment to \nrepeal the 2008 farm bill's catfish language. Our amendment would \nrepeal this language because it is unfair to importers, it is costly to \ntaxpayers, and it provides no food safety benefit. It is duplicative of \nthe other programs, and it never received consideration or debate in \nthe House or Senate and should never have passed in the first place. It \ndoesn't make sense to have a catfish category for the regulation of \nfish, and then all other fish are in a completely separate category.\n  The GAO concluded in its recent report:\n\n       To enhance the effectiveness of the food safety system for \n     catfish and avoid duplication of effort and cost, Congress \n     should consider repealing provisions of the Farm Bill that \n     assigned USDA responsibility for examining catfish and for \n     creating a catfish inspection program.\n\n  Five years later, they are still debating what a catfish is. This is \nentirely duplicative, a waste of time, and hurts consumers and \nprocessors.\n  I hope colleagues will support us in this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, let me give the other side of the story \nhere. We have a lot of fish that gets imported from important trading \npartners such as Vietnam and other Asian countries. It is disputed \nwhether they meet the definition of catfish. They certainly aren't an \nAmerican variety of catfish; they are probably some other type of fish. \nBut regardless of all of the science there, it is important that we \ninspect these fish as they come in because they are not grown in the \nsame sanitary conditions we have in the United States. They use \ndifferent herbicides and pesticides, and they have different \npollutants. In fact, we have seen documented cases where they are \nraised in sewage water--water contaminated with sewage.\n  We need to make sure these fish are inspected when they come into the \nUnited States. That is what the underlying bill provides, and that is \nwhat I support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we can \nproceed with a voice vote on this amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2199) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S4276]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2309\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2309.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mr. Chambliss, proposes an amendment numbered 2309.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To require a study into the feasibility of an insurance \n                product that covers food safety recalls)\n\n       On page 968, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 11017. STUDY OF FOOD SAFETY INSURANCE.\n\n       Section 522(c) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. \n     1522(c)) (as amended by section 11016) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(19) Study of food safety insurance.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Corporation shall offer to enter \n     into a contract with 1 or more qualified entities to conduct \n     a study to determine whether offering policies that provide \n     coverage for specialty crops from food safety and \n     contamination issues would benefit agricultural producers.\n       ``(B) Subject.--The study described in subparagraph (A) \n     shall evaluate policies and plans of insurance coverage that \n     provide protection for production or revenue impacted by food \n     safety concerns including, at a minimum, government, retail, \n     or national consumer group announcements of a health \n     advisory, removal, or recall related to a contamination \n     concern.\n       ``(C) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this paragraph, the Corporation shall submit to \n     the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives \n     and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of \n     the Senate a report that describes the results of the study \n     conducted under subparagraph (A).''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Chambliss and myself. This is a simple amendment. It simply \nauthorizes a study into how we can better cover farmers affected by \nrecalls they did not cause.\n  When a food safety recall occurs--such as spinach, tomatoes, \ncantaloupe--consumers stop purchasing the product regardless of what \nfarm the food came from. When this happens, producers suffer major \nfinancial losses because of a recall they did not cause.\n  This amendment directs the USDA to conduct a study into the \nfeasibility of a crop insurance product that would cover a producer's \nlosses after these kinds of events.\n  The amendment has zero cost, it has bipartisan support, and it is \nendorsed by United Fresh.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I urge an ``aye'' vote. I don't \nbelieve a rollcall vote is necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I strongly commend Senator Feinstein and \nstrongly support the amendment.\n  It is my understanding we do have those who have asked for a rollcall \nvote on this amendment.\n  I yield to my ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, we have a request on our side for a \nrecorded vote. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Toomey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2217.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To eliminate the organic certification cost share assistance \n                                program)\n\n       Beginning on page 980, strike line 13, and all that follows \n     through page 983, line 20.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, the bill we are debating today has a \nprovision called the Organic Certification Cost Share and Agricultural \nManagement Assistance Program. This creates $115 million of mandatory \nspending over the next 5 years. It continues existing policy except at \na much higher spending level. It is a 53-percent increase over the 2008 \nfarm bill. Half of the funding goes to pay producers. Half of this \nfunding goes to have taxpayers pay the cost of producers that want to \ncertify that they grow an organic product. I have nothing against \norganic farming, but it is a $31 billion industry. It has had a 50-\npercent growth rate just since 2008, and this applies only to large \nproducers because small producers are not required to seek this \ncertification. This is a great market. There is a great deal of \ninterest in organic products, but I think these large producers can pay \nfor their own certification.\n\n  The other half goes to duplicative conservation efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Toomey amendment, \nwhich would completely eliminate funding for the organic certification \ncost-share assistance, risk management education, and agricultural \nmanagement assistance. These programs are highly effective and have \nhelped farmers across the entire country, which is why they have \nwidespread bipartisan support. They ensure that all producers have \nequal access to the organic certification process, support sustainable \nfarm practices, and help disseminate information about the intricate \ncrop insurance system to those who traditionally have not had access. \nThe farm bill is about fairness, equity, job growth, and protecting \nfarmers eliminating these vital programs runs counter to these \nfundamental goals.\n  The National Organic Certification Cost Share Program and the \nAgricultural Management Assistance program have proven to be highly \ncost-effective tools for farmers. With grants of up to $750, they allow \norganic producers and handlers to defray a portion of their rising \norganic certification costs. These small grants help the many producers \nwho already follow organic practices complete the costly certification \nprocess. In fiscal year 2011 alone, over 9,300 operations in 49 states \nreceived assistance through these 2 programs.\n  Demand from the marketplace has fueled the skyrocketing production of \norganic food. This food frequently yields higher prices for producers \nand gives consumers greater choice. Many small producers who often sell \ntheir goods directly to consumers--have trouble obtaining organic \ncertification, which is the last hurdle that must be\n\n[[Page S4277]]\n\novercome to access these valuable markets. The National Organic \nCertification Cost Share Program brings equity to the system and \nenables producers to properly label their goods. This ensures that \nconsumers can find American organic products and rest assured that they \nhave been produced according to organic standards.\n  The Agricultural Management Assistance, AMA, program also helps \nproducers make the conservation improvements that they would like to \nmake--such as water quality and erosion controls. This program is \ncompletely voluntary and helps farmers in states where participation in \nFederal Crop Insurance has remained low. Agricultural Management \nAssistance helps farmers develop sustainable practices that protect \ntheir farmland and ensure the health of our shared water systems. This \nis the type of program that pays long-term dividends and greatly \nreduces future mitigation costs for our Nation's farmers.\n  Last year Tropical Storm Irene devastated the landscape in Vermont, \neroding soil and spreading contaminants into our water system. Fertile \nsoil was wiped away leaving only bedrock behind. To the extent we can, \nwe should try to lessen the toll of natural disasters like Irene by \nimplementing the conservation practices that AMA supports. Eliminating \nprograms like AMA kicks the can down the road, increasing the size and \nimpact of problems that our children and grandchildren will be left to \nfix.\n  I urge all Senators to stand with our farmers and oppose this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I rise to oppose this amendment. One of the important \nprinciples in this bill is that we support the great diversity of \nAmerican agriculture. This particular amendment would go after a very \nsmall part of this bill--a provision to support the fastest growing \npart of agriculture, which is organic farming.\n  We have reformed this bill, as we have every other part of the bill. \nWe continue what has been in the farm bills of the past.\n  I might add this amendment would also reduce funding available for \nconservation and risk management assistance for States that have been \nunderserved by crop insurance.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2217.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Let me be clear, Mr. President, about what this \namendment does and does not do. This amendment does not extend or \nexpand the Food Stamp Program. It provides the exact same benefits \nfamilies are receiving today.\n  Half of the food stamp beneficiaries are children, 17 percent are \nseniors, and, unfortunately, now 1.5 million households are veteran \nhouseholds that are receiving food stamps.\n  This amendment does not take a penny from our farmers. These cuts are \nnot about waste, fraud, and abuse. According to CBO, it is $90 a month \nfrom these families' kitchen tables.\n  We all here in this Chamber take the ability to feed our children for \ngranted. That is not the case for too many families in America. Put \nyourselves for just a moment in their shoes. Imagine being a parent who \ncannot feed your children the food they need to grow. It is beneath \nthis body to cut food assistance for those who are struggling the most \namong us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I must, regretfully, oppose this \namendment. I deeply care about protecting nutrition assistance \nprograms. I hope that is not in doubt. But here is what is going on. In \na handful of States, they have found a way to increase the SNAP \nbenefits for people in their States by sending $1 checks in heating \nassistance to everyone who gets food assistance. Now, it is important \nto consider what a family's heating bill is when determining how much \nhelp they need, which is why the two programs are linked. But sending \nout $1 checks to everyone is not the intent of Congress. For the small \nnumber of States that are doing that, it is undermining the integrity \nof the program, in my judgment.\n  I appreciate we have turned down those amendments that would, in \nfact, change this structure and lower benefits. But this is about \naccountability and integrity within the program, and I must oppose the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment. This \namendment would shield over 82 percent of farm bill spending from \ndeficit reduction and prevent the bill from addressing a serious breach \nin nutrition program integrity.\n  Let me be clear. Tightening the LIHEAP loophole does not affect SNAP \neligibility for anyone using SNAP.\n  To add insult to this injury, this amendment then pillages money from \ncrop insurance----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Did we not have a minute apiece?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would ask the Presiding Officer if there is any time \nremaining in the debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All debate time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Well, we will stop at ``pillaging.''\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are \ngoing to have 2 hours of debate of the time set forth for the \nresolution of disapproval. That will start at 7:50 tonight or \nthereabouts. One of the Senators agreed to take a voice vote, and that \nsaved us 15 minutes. So we gave them 10 minutes off.\n  If everybody will look at these amendments, we have to finish this \nbill and flood insurance this week. We have to do that. I don't want to \nbe crying wolf that we are going to have to be here Friday. We need to \nfinish our work, and we can do that. People have been here, and we have \nfinished some of our votes before the time even expired. That is \ndifficult. The floor staff has a difficult time recapping the votes, \nbut everybody did a good job.\n  I hope one of the things we can look at is that perhaps Senators \nBoxer and Inhofe could look at giving back an hour of their time for \ndebate. I think virtually everybody knows how they will vote on this \nissue. The debate could be stunning and somebody could change, but I \ndoubt it. If they will consider giving back an hour of their time out \nof the 4, it will help us.\n  I don't want to be here until 2 o'clock Friday morning. I don't want \nto do that. I hope we can work through this. We will have a limited \namount of morning business tomorrow and we will start voting as soon as \nwe can and we will move quickly like we have today.

The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2263.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To maintain funding at current levels for programs providing \n    access to broadband telecommunications services in rural areas)\n\n       On page 770, strike lines 7 through 11 and insert the \n     following:\n       (7) in subsection (k)(1), by striking ``2012'' and \n     inserting ``2017''; and\n\n\n[[Page S4279]]\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, on the amendment.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, the President's 2013 budget asks for about \n$9 million for the Rural Utility Service to expand broadband services \nin rural areas. The average spending over the last 10 years for that \nservice is about $14 million. The current level of spending is at $25 \nmillion. If anything, given our $16 trillion in debt, one would think \nwe would come in somewhat below that. But the farm bill doubles our \ncurrent level from $25 million to $50 million.\n  My amendment keeps spending at the $25 million level. That is the \nleast we can do, given the President has asked for $9 million. The \naverage is $14 million, and we are now at $25 million. We at least need \nto keep it there.\n  I encourage my colleagues to have a brief moment of fiscal sanity and \nvote for my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment that \nwould cut funding for critical programs for small businesses in rural \ncommunities across the country. In the 1930s and 1940s we made a \ncommitment to rural electrification and extended what was a fairly new \ntechnology to communities across the country. We had a boom in \ninnovation and economic growth.\n  Our country no longer has a divide between urban ``haves'' and rural \n``have-nots'' as a result of that. Today, the Internet is the new \ndividing line. Too many communities still don't have access to high-\nspeed broadband Internet for businesses in these locations. It is a \nreal competitive disadvantage for them, especially in a global economy.\n  I urge that we support what we have done to invest in small \nbusinesses and the ability to connect. We don't need the new urban \n``haves'' and rural ``have-nots.'' This is about investing in rural \ncommunities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. DeMINT.

I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the Risk Management Agency and the Federal Crop \nInsurance Corporation to use plain language and a website to make crop \n                       insurance more accessible)\n\n       At the end of title XI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 110__. GREATER ACCESSIBILITY FOR CROP INSURANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) due to changes in commodity and other agricultural \n     programs made by the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act \n     of 2012, it is more important than ever that agricultural \n     producers be able to fully understand the terms of plans and \n     policies of crop insurance offered under the Federal Crop \n     Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.); and\n       (2) proposed reductions by the Secretary in the number of \n     State and local offices of the Farm Service Agency will \n     reduce the services available to assist agricultural \n     producers in understanding crop insurance.\n       (b) Requirement for Use of Plain Language.--\n       (1) In general.--In issuing regulations and guidance \n     relating to plans and policies of crop insurance, the Risk \n     Management Agency and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation \n     shall, to the greatest extent practicable, use plain \n     language, as required under Executive Orders 12866 (5 U.S.C. \n     601 note; relating to regulatory planning and review) and \n     12988 (28 U.S.C. 519 note; relating to civil justice reform).\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and \n     the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the \n     Senate a report describing the efforts of the Secretary to \n     accelerate compliance with the Executive Orders described in \n     paragraph (1).\n       (c) Website.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with \n     the approved insurance providers (as defined in section \n     502(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1502(b)), \n     shall improve the existing Internet website through which \n     agricultural producers in any State may identify crop \n     insurance options in that State.\n       (2) Requirements.--The website described in paragraph (1) \n     shall--\n       (A) provide answers in an easily accessible format to \n     frequently asked questions; and\n       (B) include published materials of the Department of \n     Agriculture that relate to plans and policies of crop \n     insurance offered under that Act.\n       (d) Administration.--Nothing in this section authorizes the \n     Risk Management Agency to sell a crop insurance policy or \n     plan of insurance.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, as everyone knows, Federal crop insurance \npolicies are extremely technical and complex. My amendment seeks to \ngive farmers additional access to clear, concise information about crop \ninsurance policies and programs approved by the USDA.\n  This commonsense amendment seeks to accomplish this goal in two ways:\n  First, it will require the Secretary of Agriculture to report back to \nCongress on the status of the agency's effort to comply with the \nPresident's Executive order to require the use of plain language. My \nhope is that this simple measure will force USDA to move quickly to \nprovide information necessary for our farmers in North Carolina and \nother parts of the country to make informed decisions about signing up \nfor the crop insurance plans that meet their specific needs.\n  Second, my amendment requires the Risk Management Agency to improve \nits existing Web site so that agriculture producers in any State can \naccess easily understandable information on crop insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, on behalf of the ranking member and \nmyself, I yield back the time.\n  It is my understanding that we may proceed with a voice vote on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2366) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2262\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n[[Page S4280]]\n\n  Mr. DeMint. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 2262.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2262.\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that nothing in this Act \nor an amendment made by this Act should manipulate prices or interfere \n                         with the free market)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _____. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that nothing in this Act or \n     an amendment made by this Act should manipulate prices or \n     interfere with the free market.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense of the Senate \nthat reflects what all of us talk about not just with the farm bill but \nwith the whole U.S. economy--the importance of a free market and \nletting our competitive system work.\n  This amendment says that nothing in the farm bill would interfere \nwith the free market by setting prices or doing anything that I think \nall of the proponents of the bill say it will do--that it will protect \nthe free market.\n  So it is a sense of the Senate, and I agree to a voice vote on this, \nbut I encourage my colleagues to add their voice to the free market \nsystem and support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, on behalf of the ranking member and \nmyself, I yield back all time, and we both agree to a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2262) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2187\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 2187.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2187.\n\n    (Purpose: To extend eligibility for certain emergency loans to \n                         commercial fishermen)\n\n       On page 398, line 1, insert ``(including a commercial \n     fisherman)'' after ``farmer''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is an amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Murkowski, Senator Brown, and others.\n  In these very difficult economic times, we have also had a problem \nfor the fishermen of the Northeast and in other parts of the country \nwhere the fishing stocks have been greatly reduced for a lot of \ndifferent reasons, and a lot of fishermen are sitting there with their \nboats, where they are trying to get through the season in order to be \nable to fish in the future, with greatly restricted fishing capacity \nand availability. This is not unlike farmers who wind up with crops \nbeing affected by floods and other disasters, things that take place.\n  All we are seeking is the ability to do away with an inequity in the \nlaw that denies fishermen access to a loan under Federal emergency loan \nstandards for when an emergency arises and they need to have some \nability to stay over.\n  The Congressional Budget Office determined that this amendment has no \nscore. There is no score.\n  We believe commercial fishermen deserve access to the same type of \nassistance commercial farmers and other people in this country get. We \nhope colleagues will do away with this anomaly that denies them the \nability to simply apply, through normal standards, for a loan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we yield back all time. I understand we \ncan proceed with a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2187) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, Senate amendment No. 2187 offered by \nSenator Kerry has now been voice voted onto the farm bill. It is \nunfortunate that this significant change of USDA policy occurred \nwithout a recorded vote.\n  While it may sound innocuous to add commercial fishermen to the list \nof those eligible for USDA emergency farm loans, it is not without its \nnegative implications.\n  Support for commercial fishermen has typically been the \nresponsibility of the Department of Commerce. Thus, USDA has little to \nno experience serving commercial fishermen.\n  Additionally, funding for farm emergency loans is limited. Amendment \nNo. 2187 would further dilute this limited pool of funding and divert \nit from its core mission--assisting our farmers and ranchers.\n  While this amendment may have been voice voted, I would have voted \nnay on this amendment had there been a recorded vote. I hope this is an \nissue that we can revisit and rectify in conference committee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2268\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 2268.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2268.\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the Secretary from making loan guarantees)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. PROHIBITION ON PROVISION OF LOAN GUARANTEES.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, including \n     any amendment made by this Act, no loan guarantee may be \n     provided by the Secretary or any other Federal official or \n     agency for any project or activity carried out by the \n     Secretary.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, as we look at some of the loan \nguarantees--such as Solyndra--that have gone bad, this amendment would \nprohibit loan guarantees for the farm bill. There are many programs \nthat guarantee loans that expose the American taxpayers to millions of \ndollars. This bill would prohibit those guarantees--not prohibit the \nprograms themselves and the crop insurance and things farmers count on \nbut just the liability we put on the American taxpayers. CBO has said \nloan guarantees do cost the taxpayers money. So I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this amendment and save the American taxpayers \nfrom this additional liability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to oppose this amendment. The FDA \nloan guarantees are critical to our farmers, our rural small \nbusinesses, and community banks in small towns across the country. The \nloan guarantee programs help support commercial and farm credit lending \nwhen farmers and ranchers face tough times. It is also an important \nprogram to help beginning farmers and ranchers who don't have a long \nhistory of credit but who are certainly qualified to receive loans to \nstart their operations.\n  We know that the average age of an American farmer is 57 years and \nthat one-quarter of our farmers are 65 years of age or older. If \nagriculture in America is going to survive, we need to have young \npeople engaged in farming. This amendment would make it much harder. So \nI oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Right now, a lot of \nbusinesses are forced into programs they do not want to be a part of. \nAs a lot of us know, a lot of the large corporate farmers, a lot of \nlarge businesses love to form these check-off programs to force the \nsmaller companies to pay into them.\n  This just makes it strictly voluntary, so any company that wants to \nbe a part of this, any farmer who wants to be a part of it, can. But it \nmakes no sense to continue to force small businesses into these check-\noff programs against their will.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis amendment that would prohibit the zero cost check-off programs. \nThese programs are funded by the private industry, not taxpayers. They \nare incredibly beneficial to farmers and businesses who want to help \nmarket their products. For example, the ``Got Milk'' campaign came from \na check-off program used by the dairy industry. The ``Incredible Edible \nEgg'' is another one. No single egg farmer is going to have the \nresources to run a national television ad encouraging folks to eat more \neggs.\n  Let's be clear. This is a program that commodity groups vote on and \nagree to. The ``Got Milk'' campaign happened because dairy farmers got \ntogether, voted, and decided they wanted to go ahead and do research \nand a promotion program. Let's not take the ability for the industry to \ncome together, pool their own money, and market their product.\n  I would urge a ``no'' vote and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. DeMINT. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 10 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I will remind everyone that while it is not taxpayer \nmoney, we are forcing businesses to do things they don't necessarily \nwant to do. My amendment would allow any business to join the check-off \nprogram voluntarily. That is the American way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 20, nays 79, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 138 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--20\n\n     Ayotte\n     Brown (MA)\n     Burr\n     Coats\n     Coburn\n     Cornyn\n     DeMint\n     Graham\n     Hatch\n     Heller\n     Johnson (WI)\n     Kyl\n     Lee\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Paul\n     Rubio\n     Sessions\n     Toomey\n\n                                NAYS--79\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Crapo\n     Durbin\n\n[[Page S4282]]\n\n\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hoeven\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson (SD)\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Manchin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Portman\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kirk\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2276) was rejected.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep \ndisappointment that the Senate will not be considering amendment No. \n2252, the Egg Products Inspection Act Amendments of 2012.\n  Unanimous consent was required for this amendment to be voted on, but \nit is my understanding that there were objections to its consideration.\n  That is unfortunate because this was a bipartisan amendment \ncosponsored by Senators Blumenthal, Scott Brown, Cantwell, Collins, \nKerry, Lieberman, Menendez, Merkley, Murray, Sanders, Vitter, and \nWyden.\n  The amendment was supported by the vast majority of the egg industry, \nand it was supported by the vast majority of animal welfare \norganizations.\n  The major opposition to this amendment came from groups wholly \nunaffected by it.\n  Without Congressional action, the egg industry in California and the \nrest of this Nation is very much in jeopardy. Individual State \nstandards threaten to cripple the industry.\n  That is why I introduced this amendment--to give the industry a \nchance to survive.\n  The amendment would have set a national standard for the treatment of \negg-laying hens and would have established standards for egg labeling.\n  Let me briefly explain the specifics:\n  The size of new and existing hen cages would have had to be increased \nover the next 18 years.\n  The practice of depriving hens of food and water to increase egg \nproduction would have been outlawed.\n  Minimum air quality standards would have been put in place for hen \nhouses, protecting workers and birds.\n  And clear requirements for egg labeling would have been created, so \nconsumers know whether the eggs they buy come from hens that are caged, \nhoused in enriched cages, cage-free or free range.\n  As I said earlier, this bill is strongly supported by the Nation's \nlargest egg producer organization, the United Egg Producers. And it is \nsupported by the largest animal welfare organization, the Humane \nSociety of the United States.\n  After years of disagreement, the Humane Society and the egg producers \ndecided to work together, and they were able to agree on a reasonable \nand practical compromise. The text of this amendment is the product of \ntheir negotiations.\n  The reason for the compromise is clear: The current laws governing \nthe treatment of egg-laying hens and the labeling of eggs vary from \nState to State. This makes it difficult for producers to do business in \nmultiple States.\n  In 2008, California voters passed Proposition 2 with 64 percent of \nthe vote. This initiative requires egg producers to increase cage size \nso that the birds can stand up and extend their wings.\n  Similar initiatives passed in Michigan, Arizona, Washington, Ohio and \nOregon. And there may be more if Federal legislation is not enacted.\n  The result of the varying State laws is that producers will not be \nable to ship eggs freely across State lines.\n  The amendment would have addressed this problem by setting a single \nnational standard that is consistent with the existing State laws. And \nit would have given consumers peace of mind knowing that eggs were \nraised humanely. It should have been a win-win and an example of what \ncan happen when groups decide to work together.\n  But instead, a group of unaffected parties decided to make this \namendment a rallying cry, and they spread mis-information about what \nthis amendment would really do and who it would really impact.\n  I understand that many of my colleagues have heard from these other \nindustries. Even though this amendment will not come up, I still want \nto set the record straight.\n  The first misconception is that this amendment will set precedent \nbeyond egg producers and impact other industries such as pork, beef, or \npoultry.\n  Let me be clear. This amendment applies only to egg producers and is \nthe result of careful negotiations between the only industry that is \nimpacted and animal welfare groups.\n  Regulations governing eggs date back 30 years and have had no effect \non other industries to date. For instance, the FDA has on-farm \nenforcement authority for egg farms but not for meat or poultry farms. \nThis amendment will not change that.\n  Furthermore, the meat industry has insisted on preemption of State \nlaws and emphasized the importance of national standards for decades. \nThis legislation applies the same principle to the egg industry.\n  Another argument I hear is that this bill will hurt small producers.\n  But small producers--farmers with 3,000 birds or fewer--are exempt \nfrom the requirements under this amendment.\n  Even moderate-sized operations, with more than 3,000 birds, have \nbuilt-in protections--most notably the long phase-in period--up to 18 \nyears.\n  Over such a long period, many producers would have replaced existing \ncages due to normal wear and tear. This amendment will just require \nproducers to purchase slightly larger cages in the coming years.\n  Even the smallest companies can plan for an investment 18 years out.\n  This amendment will have positive effects for all producers by \nproviding certainty about the rules with which they must comply.\n  All producers, regardless of size, face a disadvantage when there is \na complicated web of different State regulations.\n  A third misconception is that this amendment is not based on sound \nscience. Nothing could be farther from the truth.\n  The amendment is endorsed by the American Veterinary Medical \nAssociation, the Association of Avian Veterinarians, the American \nAssociation of Avian Pathologists, the Center for Food Safety, and the \nCenter for Science in the Public Interest.\n  Multiple studies demonstrate that larger, enriched colony cages \nresult in decreased mortality, decreased contamination, and increased \negg production.\n  One survey from Feedstuffs magazine found that hen mortality in \nlarger, enriched cages declined by 45 percent compared to conventional \nbattery cages.\n  The survey also found that the number and quality of eggs per hen \nimproved, from an average of 399 eggs to 421 in enriched cages.\n  The weight-per-case of eggs also increased, from 47.93 pounds to 49.4 \npounds.\n  I ask my colleagues to look at the data before jumping to \nconclusions. This amendment is good for animals and good for the \nindustry.\n  Finally, I want to set the record straight with regard to consumers \nand egg prices. A new study released last week by the consulting firm \nAgralytica found that this amendment would not have a substantial \neffect on consumers.\n  Between 2013 and 2030, egg prices are expected to increase only 1 \npercent as a result of this amendment.\n  A 1-percent increase translates to about a penny and a half per dozen \neggs, or one-eighth of 1 cent per egg.\n  The Agralytica study attributes the low impact to the long phase-in \nperiod, giving producers ample time to adjust to the new requirements.\n  The bill has been endorsed by the Consumer Federation of America and \nthe National Consumers League.\n  And it is important to understand that this amendment captures what \nis already occurring with consumer demand.\n  Polls indicate broad support for the provisions in this amendment. \nThe survey found that:\n  Consumers support this bill by a 4-to-1 margin;\n  Consumers prefer a Federal standard over State standards by a 2-to-1 \nmargin; and,\n  92 percent of consumers support the industry transitioning to \nenriched cages.\n\n[[Page S4283]]\n\n  It is not often that we have the opportunity to enact legislation \nthat helps industry, reflects consumer demand, and is supported by a \nbroad coalition of advocates on both sides of an issue. If my \ncolleagues have any doubts about the support for this bill, take a look \nat the list of supporters. As of today it is 13 pages long.\n  We wouldn't have gotten this far if it weren't for the strong support \nand leadership of the United Egg Producers. Without this amendment, the \nlivelihood of the egg producers nationwide will be compromised by the \nconfusing tapestry of State laws.\n  We had the opportunity to fix this problem before more damage is \ndone--so the fact that we are not even going to consider the amendment \nmakes it all the more disappointing.\n  The egg industry was prepared to make these investments, and animal \nwelfare advocates and consumers will approve of the end result.\n  This was a reasonable and widely supported solution to a costly \nproblem.\n  I hope to work with my colleagues on both sides of the issue to have \nthis legislation considered at a later date. The future of the industry \nis dependent on it, and I am confident we will be able to get there.\n  Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              Agriculture\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to engage my colleague, Senator \nStabenow, in a colloquy.\n  I thank Senator Stabenow and the other members of the Senate \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry for their collective \nefforts in passing S. 3240, the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act \nof 2012. This bill promises to save taxpayers money and concentrate \nfunds in the areas in which they will have the greatest impact, making \nthem work better for producers.\n  As the Senator knows, Long Island Sound, LIS, and its watershed \ncontain some of the most important farm, forest, and water resources in \nthe country. The estuary is home to a historically significant and now \nburgeoning aquaculture industry. The Sound provides natural habitats to \nmore than 1,200 species of invertebrates, 170 species of fish, and \nhundreds of species of migratory birds. Commercial and recreational \nshellfishers harvest oysters, crabs, and lobsters from its waters. More \nthan 23 million people live within 50 miles of the Sound. The estimated \nannual value to the local economy of LIS is $8.91 billion. Federal, \nState, and local partners operate together throughout its six-State \nwatershed using formal, shared priorities that provide a strong basis \nfor applying conservation practices to improve soil and water quality, \nfarm and producer productivity, and to restore wetlands and wildlife \nhabitat. The Sound and its watershed are recognized by NRCS as a \nmultistate partnership area. The watershed's major river, the \nConnecticut River, was just designated as the Nation's first Blueway.\n  Is it the Senator's intent to provide a framework where strong \npartnerships between producers and conservation organizations, like \nexist in the Long Island Sound watershed, can succeed by putting forth \nprojects that work to achieve locally or regionally established goals \nand metrics?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank Senator Lieberman for his leadership on \nenvironmental issues facing his State and the Long Island Sound. Yes, \nthat is my intent through the Regional Conservation Partnership \nProgram.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator for her leadership and assistance \nand cooperation in ensuring that the intent of this important bill is \nallowed to be carried out in areas where greatest impact will result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent that Bennet-Crapo amendment No. \n2202, which has been cleared by both sides, be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                Unanimous conset Agreement S.J. Res. 37\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time for \ndebate this evening on the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 37 be in \norder, even though the motion to proceed will not be made until \nWednesday's session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to make a unanimous consent \nrequest that Senator Carper open this debate--and I give thanks to \nSenator Inhofe for allowing that--for 8 minutes, and then Senator \nInhofe will use 15 minutes at his discretion. Then we will go to \nSenator Shaheen for up to 10 minutes. Then we go back to Senator Inhofe \nfor another 15 minutes from his side, and then our side will be Senator \nLautenberg for 10, Senator Merkley for 10, and Senator Whitehouse for \n10.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding that we would have our three \nspeakers after that, but not necessarily restricted to 5 minutes. It \nwill not be much more than that. But since our speakers will be \nspeaking in these three sessions, I would like a little latitude, maybe \n6 or 7 minutes on those three.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Why not give us an exact time. I think it is important. \nSo we are saying instead of 15 minutes of time--I would just say some \nof my people--can the Senator from Oklahoma take the first segment for \n15 minutes--because I know Senator Shaheen is going to be waiting to \nspeak--and then we will give you 20 minutes after that?\n  Mr. INHOFE. For my three who come after Senator Carper, 6 minutes \napiece.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So 18 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. Then we will go to Senator Shaheen for 10 and back to \nSenator Inhofe for 18 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, that would be fine.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. Then the others will have 10 minutes apiece \nafter that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. My thanks to Senator Boxer and to Senator Inhofe.\n  Over the years, I have been privileged to hold a bunch of different \njobs, including newspaper boy, pots-and-pan man in college, naval \nflight officer, and Governor of my State, just to name a few. The most \ncherished and important job I have ever held is that of the role of \nfather. I am blessed with three wonderful sons who make me proud and \nthankful every day.\n  Celebrating Father's Day this past weekend, I was reminded that a \nmajor motivator in my own life has been my love for our boys and my \ndesire to make the world a better place for them. Today, 2 days later, \nI am reminded of just how important this clean air fight is for my \nchildren and for children across the country.\n  Unbeknownst to a lot of us, our children actually listen to what we \nsay. More importantly, they watch just about everything we do. They \nnotice the choices we make and the company we keep. They hear us talk \nabout playing by the rules and treating others the way we would like to \nbe treated. They watch carefully to see if we actually practice what we \npreach--if we play fair, and if we do try to follow the Golden Rule as \nwe go about our lives. They hear us talk about chores, homework, and \nresponsibility, but they watch to see if we actually pitch in and do \nour fair share.\n  It strikes me that much of the country's ongoing efforts to clean up \nthe air pollution is about playing fair and doing our share. My home \nState of Delaware has done our homework and worked hard on that front \nand, as a result, we have made great strides in cleaning up our own air \npollution. Unfortunately, a number of the upwind States to the west of \nus have not made the same commitment to clean air. In fact, 90 percent \nof Delaware's pollution comes from our neighboring States. This \npollution endangers our hearts, lungs, and brains, and it costs us a \ngreat deal in medical bills and in the quality of our lives.\n  Some of this air pollution, such as poisonous mercury, settles into \nour streams and our fish, threatening the health of this generation and \ngenerations to come. That doesn't sound like the Golden Rule to me.\n  Even though the First State is doing its part to protect our air and \npublic health, some of our neighbors are not. Yet those of us who live \nat the end of America's tailpipe end up suffering. It just is not fair.\n\n[[Page S4284]]\n\n  Fortunately, Federal clean air protections established by the Clean \nAir Act have been created to right that wrong. These protections were \nforged by both Democrats and Republicans who believe that playing fair \nand doing our share when it comes to cleaning up America's air is \nprofoundly important.\n  The Clean Air Act, signed by President Richard Nixon in 1970 and \nupdated in 1990 by President George Herbert Walker Bush, was approved \neach time by Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. In fact, \nmany in this Congress on both sides of the aisle supported the passing \nof the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Those Members include my \nfriends, Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe, and me.\n  This landmark law to protect public health and the environment has \nproven time and again to be a success. In fact, I am told the Clean Air \nAct delivers about $30 of health savings for every $1 we invest in \nclean air--not a bad return on our investment. Moreover, the Clean Air \nAct has helped create hundreds of thousands of jobs in new technologies \nas America develops clean air solutions that our businesses can export \naround the globe.\n  The bipartisan vision embodied in our Nation's clean air laws has \nbeen translating into healthier, longer, and more productive lives for \nmillions of Americans.\n  While much of the Clean Air Act has been in place improving health \nfor years, some key aspects of the law have never been implemented. \nThey include requirements to reduce deadly mercury and other toxic air \nemissions from some of our oldest and dirtiest coal-fired plants. These \ntoxic air pollutants are known to cause cancer, neurological damage, \nand other health concerns.\n  One example of particular concern is mercury. Up to 10 percent of \nchildbearing women in this country have unsafe levels of mercury in \ntheir bodies. Today, all 50 States have mercury fish consumption \nadvisories. In fact, there are more fish consumption advisories in the \nUnited States for mercury than for all other contaminants combined.\n  Uncontrolled coal-fired utilities are our largest source of mercury \nin this country. Fortunately, current control technology can \ndramatically reduce mercury emissions and mercury in our local \nenvironments.\n  This is why Senator Alexander, several of our colleagues, and I have \nbeen trying for years to reduce emissions through legislation. It is \nalso why 18 States have their own powerplant mercury standards. Yet, \nuntil recently, we lacked a Federal standard.\n  Last December, after years of delay, the EPA finally implemented--\nunder court order--Clean Air Act protections to require dirty coal \npowerplants to clean up their mercury and air toxic emissions. The EPA \ndid so through something called the mercury and air toxics standards \nrule.\n  By targeting our Nation's largest sources of mercury emissions, this \nregulation requires dirty coal plants to reduce their mercury emissions \nby 90 percent. This will reduce the mercury that contaminates our \nstreams and oceans, pollutes our fish, and harms our children's health.\n  In implementing these long overdue regulations, the EPA has provided \na reasonable and achievable schedule for our powerplants to reduce \nthese harmful emissions. EPA's new standard gives utilities until 2016 \nto comply. The EPA has also made it clear it is willing to give \ncompanies 2 additional years to address reliability concerns if needed. \nDelaware's powerplants have already met these standards. So do half of \nthe powerplants throughout America. Most communities will see great \nbenefits from these rules, and I am told that nationally we will see up \nto $90 billion in public health benefits.\n  As someone who tried for years to work across the aisle to find a way \nto clean up our Nation's powerplants, I welcomed the EPA's decision to \nact to finally address these harmful emissions.\n  Regrettably, some of our colleagues do not share the appreciation \nthat many of us feel for the EPA's efforts to protect public health and \nour environment. They want to prevent these efforts from moving \nforward, despite court orders requiring the EPA to do just that. I find \nit remarkable that some in Congress would seek to prevent the EPA from \nfollowing through on a law passed overwhelmingly by Congress 22 years \nago and signed by a Republican President.\n  The EPA is doing what Congress told them to do over two decades ago. \nIf we let them do their job, their efforts will reduce harmful \npollution and improve the health of generations of children to come.\n  As much as I hate to say it, given my friendship with the author of \nthis proposal, a vote for this Congressional Review Act would delay any \nreal hope we have of cleaning up our largest source of mercury. A vote \nfor the Congressional Review Act signals uncertainty and a lack of \ncommitment--a commitment to make good on the law we passed \noverwhelmingly 22 years ago to protect public health in this country.\n  We cannot afford to delay the mercury and air toxics rule. This is \nthe time to modernize our energy fleet. This is the time to clean up \nour dirtiest, most inefficient plants. And this is the time to clean up \nour rivers, lakes, and streams so that all children can look forward to \nliving healthier lives.\n  So today I rise in strong opposition to this last-ditch effort to \nprevent the EPA from doing its job--a job we should have done--and \nreducing these deadly emissions, and I hope my colleagues will join us. \nMy decision to oppose this effort is not based solely on the fact that \nI am a dad--like a lot of our colleagues here--but knowing that the \nimplementation of this rule will positively impact the lives and health \nof my sons weighs heavily on my mind. It should weigh heavily on the \nminds of all of us.\n  Our children really do hear us when we talk to them and to others. \nThey are watching today to see if we really walk the walk. Whether we \nare Democrats, Independents, or Republicans, we are still mothers and \nfathers, aunts and uncles, grandfathers and grandmothers. So let's \ncontinue to lead the way by following the Golden Rule this day. Let's \ntreat our neighbors as we would like to be treated, and let's work \ntogether across America to keep the Clean Air Act resilient and strong \nand to make our air cleaner. Our children and their children are \ncounting on us.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would ask that the Senator from Nebraska \nMr. Johanns be recognized for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to support S.J. Res. 37. The \nrule addresses emissions from powerplants. However, in my judgment, \nthis rule goes too far, too fast, and tries to achieve too much in too \nlittle time, at too high a cost to our families.\n  Oftentimes, we hear concerns in my office about rules and \nregulations. Too often, those rules and regulations come from the EPA. \nAnd when EPA rules are the topic, sometimes I have to ask: Which EPA \nrule are you talking about? Because, let's face it, the list of EPA \njob-killing regulations is downright dizzying.\n  However, this resolution addresses only one, which hammers coal-fired \nelectricity generation, especially large coal-fired plants.\n  In Nebraska's case, the rule would require the addition of expensive \nnew equipment to control particulate matter and certain exhaust gases. \nWell, how expensive would these additions be? One of our States's \nlargest utilities has estimated they would need to spend about $900 \nmillion to $1.3 billion over the next 3 years to get into compliance. \nSo one might ask, where is that money going to come from? Well, in our \nState, every single penny of these capital expenditures comes directly \nfrom users--essentially every Nebraskan. You see, in our State, the \nState of Nebraska, we are 100 percent public power. That means no \nstockholders, no shareholder equity, no profits to draw down.\n  How quickly would they need to come up with that money? The \ncompliance period is just 3 years. These are major projects, so 3 years \nis not an adequate timeline. Now, 3 years may sound like plenty of time \nto some, but the actual process that needs to occur, all in a specific \nsequence, makes a 3-year timeline especially challenging. Preliminary \nengineering comes first,\n\n[[Page S4285]]\n\nthen financing, then opening the projects for bidding, and bidding, and \nthen determining whether compliance with bidding has occurred before \nyou could even start the project. For public power, there are rules and \nprocedures that control each one of these steps. In other words, there \nis no shortcut.\n  Normally, our utilities try to get these projects done in the periods \nknown as the shoulder months. In Nebraska, these are the months of \nearly spring and early fall--before the summer heat hits the Midwest \nand before the winds of winter knock at our door and take temperatures \ndown. If the compliance schedule precludes the powerplant from using \nthese shoulder months, then the project costs go up because of the need \nto buy power from outside of the system. So what does that mean? It \nmeans we are faced with compliance that is nearly impossible. And the \ncompliance dates keep changing. The cross-State air pollution rule--\nanother rule the EPA has finalized just in the last several months--was \nput on hold by a Federal court after many States affected by the rule \nchallenged the EPA. And we may hear any day now as to whether the court \nwill tell EPA to go back to the drawing board and rewrite the rule.\n  But the main point is that the stream of rules coming out of EPA is \nhuge and compliance is nearly impossible. In Fremont, NE, a Nebraska \ncity manager described it this way:\n\n       Smaller utilities in rural areas . . . will have difficulty \n     in getting vendors and contractors to supply and install the \n     equipment in this timeframe. Being Public Utilities we have \n     to follow a public letting process and cannot just negotiate \n     a design build contract with a contractor as an investor \n     owned utility can.\n\n  So what happens to Fremont's 26,000 residents? Well, they will face \nrate increases of between 20 and 25 percent to cover the compliance \ncosts of this rule, when combined with the requirements of two other \nrules. Increasing electricity bills by one-fourth is huge. It is a huge \nimpact on Fremont families.\n  The city of Grand Island, NE, estimates that the Utility MACT rule \nwill cost $35 million and require 3 to 5 years of planning and \nfinancing and construction.\n  For Hastings, NE, the same sobering outlook--big expense, rushed \ntimeframe, and a worried community trying to figure out how they pay \nfor it. For Hastings alone, the costs of compliance with this rule and \nthe cross-State rule are estimated to be $95 million over 5 years. Now, \nHastings has 25,000 residents. You do not need a degree in economics to \nknow this is an enormous burden for the small businesses, small \nmanufacturers, and households. They will carry the load.\n  So the vote for this resolution is a vote to tell EPA their approach \nis not achievable. It cannot work. It is a vote that means there is \nsubstantial opposition to the rule and the country does not support \nEPA.\n  It is also important to note what this vote is not. No. 1 and most \nsignificantly, this is not a vote against clean air. Everybody in my \nState wants clean air. Everybody wants to comply. They just want some \nclear, achievable rules on a timeline that is reasonable. The Agency \nneeds to go back to the drawing board.\n  No. 2, this resolution does not strip EPA of its power. If the \nresolution passes, EPA would not be barred from trying another rule----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 7 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Let me just close by saying that I hope my colleagues \nwill support us on this resolution.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I now ask that the Senator from Georgia be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Oklahoma, and I \nwould ask the Chair to let me know when I have utilized 4 minutes, \nplease.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so, gladly.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to speak out against the EPA's \nmercury and air toxics standards--known as Utility MACT--and in support \nof the resolution disapproving this rule introduced by my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe.\n  This set of standards--one of the most expensive of its kind ever \nissued by EPA--will cause a rise in electric bills for my constituents \nin Georgia and for Americans all across this country. As our economy \ncontinues to stagnate, we can hardly afford to increase the cost of \nelectricity, which will be an economic burden for individuals and \nbusinesses and will hamper economic recovery.\n  Higher electric bills are especially unwarranted when the regulations \nthat will cause the electricity cost increase are expected to provide \nnegligible benefits for the American public. The poor and individuals \non fixed incomes, such as the elderly, can hardly afford higher \nelectricity bills. These are precisely the groups disproportionately \naffected by Utility MACT.\n  EPA estimates that compliance with this rule will cost $9.6 billion \nannually in 2015, which is more conservative than many industry \nfigures. One electric company in my home State estimates that by 2014 \nUtility MACT could cost them up to $250 million annually to implement. \nThis does not take into account the hundreds of millions of additional \ndollars the company expects to spend on complying with existing \nenvironmental statutes and regulations. Even going by EPA's own \nconservative $9.6 billion cost estimate, studies have shown that the \ncosts will lead to job loss, both directly at utilities and indirectly \nthrough industries and manufacturers affected.\n  I hear every day from businesses of every size in my home State that \nsay the regulatory overreach of this administration threatens the very \nwell-being of their particular business. Utility MACT is yet another \nexample of this overreach.\n  Instead of promulgating a limited rule to regulate mercury and air \ntoxics--known as hazardous air pollutants--as the title ``Mercury and \nAir Toxics Standards'' implies, EPA has extended its reach by focusing \na great deal of attention on particulate matter in these standards. \nParticulate matter emissions, not characterized as hazardous air \npollutants, are already subject to other EPA regulations, so with \nUtility MACT, EPA is going beyond what Congress directed the Agency to \ndo. The extra regulations tacked on to the mercury standard add \nsignificantly to the expected cost of this rule.\n  Furthermore, the standards for new facilities, as set forth by \nUtility MACT, might very well prove to be unattainable. Due to the \nmethodology employed by EPA to gather the data used to set the \nstandards, even certain manufacturers of the emissions control \nequipment say they cannot guarantee their technology will be able to \nachieve the standards in practice. How can we require utilities to \nreduce emissions to such a level that cannot even be guaranteed \nachievable with current technology? It makes no sense. That will spell \nthe end of any new coal-fired plants in the United States, drastically \nreducing our ability to use one of our most abundant domestic energy \nresources, even in more environmentally friendly ways.\n  The cumulative impact of these EPA rules coming down the pipeline, \none after another, causes further concern. Aptly called a ``train \nwreck'' by many, by forcing the retirement of one coal-fired plant \nafter another, these rules will put at risk the reliability of our \nelectric supply system.\n  Some state that a delay in implementation, enacted through \nlegislation or otherwise, will be a sufficient remedy. However, a delay \nwill not address the substantive concerns with this rule as written, \nincluding the significant issue of certain standards being \nunattainable.\n  I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for introducing this disapproval \nresolution and showing leadership on this issue. Over 200 companies and \nassociations have joined the Senator from Oklahoma in calling for \nUtility MACT to be overturned.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution disapproving the \nEPA's Utility MACT rule. By doing so, we take a step toward preventing \nhigher electricity prices and grid unreliability while preserving clean \nair.\n  The point of supporting this Congressional Review Act resolution of \ndisapproval is to force EPA to go back to the drawing board to craft a \nnarrower rule that properly protects human health in a manner that is \nnot outweighed by its cost, that is actually attainable, and one that \nwill not threaten the reliability of our electrical grid.\n\n[[Page S4286]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I ask now that the \nSenator from Wyoming be recognized for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for legislation \nthat will force a partial cease-fire in the Obama administration's war \non coal.\n  If we move forward with Senator Inhofe's resolution of disapproval, \nwe will end one of the most egregious rules promulgated by an \nadministration that, in the words of President Obama, hopes to see the \nprice of electricity necessarily skyrocket.\n  Coal is our Nation's most abundant energy resource. It provides \napproximately half our Nation with low-cost, reliable electricity. In \nmy State of Wyoming, more than 6,800 people are employed directly by \nthe coal industry. They make an average salary of more than $77,000 \neach year, which is $35,000 more than the average wage in the State. \nWhen we count those employed directly and indirectly, nearly 30,000 \npeople in Wyoming depend on the coal mining industry for jobs.\n  Nationwide, the numbers are much larger. The coal industry employs \n136,000 people directly, with an average salary of $73,000 per year. \nFor every coal mining job in the United States, we see 3.5 jobs created \nin another part of the economy. Simply put, the coal industry puts \npeople to work. In an economy that is struggling to recover, the coal \nindustry provides high-paying jobs for workers in Wyoming and in other \nStates such as West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.\n  Coal provides low-cost electricity across the country that can power \nour Nation's manufacturing base. It provides high-paying jobs across \nthe country at a time when our Nation's unemployment rate is at an \nunacceptable 8.2 percent, and the most recent jobs report shows no \nsigns that the economy is recovering. With the tremendous benefits coal \ncan provide, it is so puzzling to me that the administration seeks to \nend our use of this important, affordable energy source.\n  Since being sworn into office, President Obama's rulemaking machine \nreleased rule after rule designed to make it more expensive to use \ncoal. The administration's greenhouse gas standard would make it \nimpossible to build a new coal-fired powerplant in the United States. \nThe stream buffer zone rule would make it more difficult to mine coal. \nThose are just 2 of the 11 regulations the President is considering \nthat would grievously wound the coal mining industry and hurt an \nalready ailing economy. In total, the regulations could cost up to $130 \nbillion to retrofit existing coal-fired powerplants and could, by some \nestimates, lead to shutting down as much as 20 percent of the existing \ncoal-fired powerplant fleet.\n  Today, we have a chance to stop one of those regulations. In \nFebruary, the EPA finalized a standard that requires a strict reduction \nin air emissions from electric generating utilities. It is known as the \nUtility MACT rule. Similar to many of the rules coming from the EPA, \nthe costs of this regulation are great and the benefits are limited. \nEPA estimates that the rule would create between $500,000 and $6 \nmillion in benefits related to mercury reductions, at a cost of nearly \n$10 billion annually for implementation of the rule. The cost-benefit \nratio, assuming the EPA's best-case scenario, is 1,600 to 1.\n  These costs will be passed on to consumers and will result in higher \nelectricity prices. According to the Industrial Energy Consumers of \nAmerica, a nonpartisan association of manufacturing companies with more \nthan 650,000 employees, these increased costs will lessen \ncompetitiveness, threaten U.S. manufacturing jobs, and make our \nelectric grid less reliable. It is everything not to like in a policy--\nall costs, no benefits.\n  National Economic Research Associates has studied the Utility MACT \nrule and found it would cause between 180,000 and 215,000 job losses by \n2015. Further, it found that the Utility MACT rule would increase \nelectricity rates by 6.5 percent on average and by as much as 19.1 \npercent in some areas of the country. An average household could see \ntheir electricity bills go up by at least $400 per year--a cost that \nwill disproportionately impact those with lower fixed incomes, such as \nmany older Americans.\n  This resolution is the best opportunity to begin fighting back \nagainst President Obama's war on coal. By passing S.J. Res. 37, we can \ntake a stand against this administration's goal of higher electricity \ncosts. I plan to vote for Senator Inhofe's resolution and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have used \nthis element of our time. The Senator from New Hampshire will be \nrecognized for 10 minutes, after which time we will be recognized for \n18 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nefforts to nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's mercury and \nair toxics standards or MATS. This far-reaching resolution would \nseverely and permanently undermine EPA's authority to protect our \nNation's air from harmful and dangerous pollutants.\n  In New Hampshire, we have long enjoyed bipartisan cooperation when it \ncomes to crafting policies that ensure clean air, a strong economy, and \nhealthy citizens. We do have coal-fired powerplants in New Hampshire, \nbut they have scrubbers on them to clean up the air. When I was \nGovernor, we passed the pollutant bill to address mercury, and it \npassed with bipartisan support.\n  Nobody appreciates our clean air more than a woman named Lia Houk, \nfrom Henniker, NH. She has lived with cystic fibrosis for the past 40 \nyears. In order to breathe, she must use a nebulizer three times a day \nand has to exercise daily to clear her lungs. When pollution poisons \nthe air, she suffers from chest tightness and lung hemorrhaging that \ncan lead to hospitalization. Pollution also worsens the long-term \neffects of cystic fibrosis, such as lung scarring, and it causes her \ndisease to progress more rapidly.\n  To protect Lia and millions like her, Congress passed the Clean Air \nAct, and it has long been one of our most successful public health and \nenvironmental laws. Yet despite the success of the Clean Air Act, we \nnow face efforts to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from \nregulating toxic air pollutants.\n\n  At issue are the new mercury and air toxics standards, which will \nrequire powerplants to control the pollution that affects Lia and \nothers who suffer from respiratory problems. For the first time, the \nstandards set Federal limits on the amount of mercury, arsenic, \nchromium, nickel, and acid gases that powerplants can release into our \nair. These standards will eliminate emissions of these poisonous \nchemicals from the powerplants by 90 percent by 2015.\n  The new nationwide standards are based on widely available pollution \ncontrol technologies that are already in place at powerplants across \nthe country. They represent a realistic, achievable goal. Yet opponents \nof MATS argue the environmental regulations will hurt the economy. That \nis simply not true. These standards will benefit our health, our \neconomy, and our environment.\n  By removing the largest source of many of these toxins, the new \nstandards will prevent an estimated 17,000 premature deaths and 11,000 \nheart attacks each year. America's children will be spared 120,000 \nasthma incidents and 11,000 cases of acute bronchitis. That is \nparticularly important for us in the Northeast. The Presiding Officer, \nwho is from Rhode Island, knows what this is because we are in the \ntailpipe of the Nation in New England in the Northeast. We get all the \npollution coming out of the Midwest from those dirty powerplants. In \nNew Hampshire, we have one of the highest children's asthma rates in \nthe country because of that pollution.\n  Far from being job killers, these regulations will mean new work for \nthe innovative American companies that supply the equipment needed for \nplants to comply with the law. In fact, a study by the Economic Policy \nInstitute found that enactment of these standards would create a net \ngain of 117,000 jobs.\n  Of course, clean air is also vital to the tourism and outdoor \nrecreation economy, which, in my State, is the second largest industry.\n\n[[Page S4287]]\n\n  All the beautiful sights of our State, from the White Mountains to \nthe Great Bay, can only be enjoyed if our air is free of smog and clean \nto breathe.\n  So as we consider whether to keep the Clean Air Act in place, we \ndon't have to choose between helping people such as Lia or helping our \neconomy. We can and we must do both.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the resolution that Senator Inhofe has \noffered and to continue to protect the health and welfare of our \ncitizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the next speaker will be Senator Hoeven \nfor 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Utility MACT issue.\n  EPA's Utility MACT rule is a clear example of how overzealous \nregulations and a lack of a sensible energy policy are derailing \ninvestment and costing America jobs.\n  I support good, responsible policies to protect human health and \nsafeguard our environment. These rules, however, need to bear the \nqualities of all good rules: They need to be simple, efficient, \nachievable, and affordable. In short, they need to make sense from both \nan environmental and economic perspective.\n  Unfortunately, as written, the Utility MACT rule--and others similar \nto it that the EPA is proposing--fails to find that proper balance. To \nthe contrary, burdensome and complex new rules for the coal industry \nwill not only discourage responsible energy growth but will prompt the \ncomplete shutdown of dozens of powerplants.\n  That will increase energy costs for consumers and businesses and, \nsadly, force thousands of hard-working Americans onto the unemployment \nrolls.\n  Utility MACT alone will require powerplants to install costly \nemission controls by 2015, with a pricetag for compliance of nearly $10 \nbillion annually.\n  Moreover, EPA has made it clear there will only be limited extensions \nto give utilities the time they need to make the changes. We now have \nan opportunity to vote either to retain or reject the Utility MACT rule \nunder the Congressional Review Act.\n  In fact, it is exactly this kind of rule that the Congressional \nReview Act was designed to address, by allowing Congress to review a \nnew regulation and overrule it if that regulation is unfair or \noverreaching.\n  So we can send the EPA back to the drawing board and insist that the \nAgency come up with a plan that is simpler, more affordable and, most \nimportant, that is fairer by taking into account the livelihoods of \nhard-working Americans and their families. That is exactly what we need \nto do.\n  In my State of North Dakota, we have a lot of coal-fired electric \ngeneration. We supply power not only to our State but to the \nsurrounding States as well--Minnesota, South Dakota, Montana, and well \nbeyond. The reality is that we are producing more power, more \nelectricity, and we are doing it with better environmental stewardship \nbecause, in our State, we have created the right legal tax and \nregulatory climate to stimulate that private investment, which is \ndriving the new technology. In fact, we not only produce coal-fired \nelectricity, we convert coal into synthetic natural gas. But we are \nsuccessfully doing that because we are driving the investment that is \nspurring the new technology that is producing more energy. And as we \nproduce more energy, that same technology is also enabling us to do it \nwith better environmental stewardship.\n\n  That is the win that we all seek. That is the win we all seek. \nBecause that is not only about providing more electricity, more power, \nmore energy for this country at a lower cost so that consumers benefit, \nit is also about creating high-quality, high-paying jobs for our \nAmerican workers and, at the same time, providing better environmental \ntechnology through this investment, providing better environmental \nstewardship through this investment in new technologies. That is \nexactly what is happening, because we are empowering the industry to \nproduce more electricity to develop, to grow and, again, to develop the \ntechnology that produces more technology with the better stewardship.\n  That is the direction we need to go, and that is why I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this Congressional Review Act that would require \nEPA to go back and redraft this rule. It is in the interest of the \nAmerican workers whose jobs depend on the coal industry, and, \nultimately, it is in the best interest of Americans who not only need \nthe energy but, again, as we are able to continue to develop the \ntechnology, we produce better and better environmental stewardship.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator, and I now recognize the Senator from \nAlabama for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Inhofe, who \nhas been such a leader on these issues and has contributed so much to \nthe national discussion as we wrestle with the challenges of trying to \nhave affordable energy for Americans to maintain our business \ncompetitiveness and improve the quality of our air and environment. And \nwe can do those things. We have been doing those things, and we are \ngoing to continue to do those things. But this Senate Joint Resolution \n37 dealing with Utility MACT provides us an opportunity to make a \nstrong statement and reject the program the EPA has adopted that will \ndamage this economy, will drive up the cost of energy for every \nAmerican throughout this country, drive up the cost of energy for \nAmerican businesses that are struggling now to hire workers and be \ncompetitive.\n  If we have an advantage on the world market today, every expert tells \nus it is because of a decline in natural gas prices, and we have \ncompetitive electricity prices from coal. So we have competitive \nelectricity prices from our largest source--coal--and we have \nsurprising, wonderful new finds in natural gas that are allowing our \nenergy to be cheaper too. This helps us create jobs and growth.\n  Yet we have within the administration a number of people--and, I hate \nto say, all the way to the top--who seem to believe that cheap energy \nis not a goal, that cheap energy is not something that should be \nbrought forth, I guess because that would make their alternative \nsources--solar and wind and other things--even less competitive than \nthey are today. We will develop those programs. We can seek to advance \nthose programs. But in truth, we should not be mandating these much \nhigher costs on the American people, hammering our economy, which, in \neffect, is a tax increase on the American economy.\n  So this is a $90 billion rule--the most expensive environmental rule \nin our Nation's history. And $90 billion is the amount the EPA \nacknowledges this rule will cost. The Congressional Review Act that \nSenator Inhofe has triggered says we can have this vote, this review of \nany regulation over $100 million, and $90 billion is 900 times larger \nthan $100 million. It is the largest rule in American history. It \nchanges the course of our economy. It is the kind of thing that Members \nwho are elected to answer to the American people should be voting on, \nnot having it done within basically a bureaucratic process, without \nhaving elected individuals engaged in it.\n  But the Congressional Review Act has a fundamental weakness. That \nweakness is that if the Congress votes to overturn an act, the \nPresident can veto it. We have this odd situation where the President \nappoints the bureaucrats. He appoints the head of the EPA. And all the \npeople working throughout the executive branch and for the President, \ndirectly or indirectly--directly, really--produce the regulations the \nPresident desires they produce. They do not produce regulations he does \nnot desire they produce. So the result is that Congress has an awfully \ndifficult time overturning it because the President can veto what we \npass. We need something like the REINS Act that would actually replace \nthis unconstitutional, nontraditional procedure of impacting our \neconomy with monumental regulations and putting that back to the \nCongress so that Congress is required to vote on the regulation.\n  My time, I know, is running out, but I want to reiterate that the \nimpact of the regulations, if not changed, will\n\n[[Page S4288]]\n\ndrive up the cost of energy for every single American and for all \nbusinesses in America. It will achieve only a modest improvement in \nmercury reductions over what President Bush proposed, and it is so \nextreme that it hammers coal processing and energy production in \nAmerica, basically making coal no longer a realistic way to produce \nelectricity in America. That is a huge event that impacts the economy. \nFundamentally, this regulation would say that, yes, we have reduced \nmercury emissions by 50 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, we would reduce the emissions of mercury since \n1990 by 50 percent. Yes, President Bush proposed a very effective, \nsophisticated plan to further reduce those emissions by 75 percent--75 \npercent more. But there were problems with it. The courts found a \nproblem with it. But instead of pursuing the matter in the fashion \nPresident Bush did, the new regulations call for this dramatic 90-\npercent reduction of mercury emissions, far more than we are able to do \ntechnologically and financially, I believe. That is why I salute \nSenator Inhofe for this resolution and I will support him.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. How much time do we have remaining, including the 40 \nseconds we didn't use?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes on the Senator's side.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First, let me comment on something I am glad the Senator \nfrom Alabama brought up because it is very significant. The frailty in \nthe CRA, for a lot of our fellow Members who are not familiar with the \nhistory of that, is that the President can veto it. I am a little \nhopeful in this case, if we are successful, because I wonder if the \nPresident wants to veto, a few months before the election, a bill that \nis going to cost the American people over 200,000 jobs this year, along \nwith all of the other costs they admit.\n  The EPA itself says it will cost $10 billion, but it is going to be \nconsiderably more than that in nearly everyone else's view. So I hold \nthat out as a hope, that even though he would love to veto it, if we \nare successful, I don't think he will do it because he wants to get \nreelected more than he wants to veto this.\n  I would also comment that I think it is worth bringing up that the \nother side had an opportunity to do something about real pollution--and \nwe are talking about NOX, SOX, and mercury, not \nCO2. Remember the Clear Skies Act that was such a successful \noperation? That was back during the Bush administration. That would \nhave mandated the 75-percent reduction the Senator from Alabama talked \nabout in SOX, NOX, and mercury. Those are real \npollutants. But it was held hostage because it didn't include \nCO2. At that time that was the crown jewel of their efforts.\n  So all I can say in this remaining time we have is that everything \nhas been said, although it hasn't been said by everybody, and I am not \ngoing to repeat that and be redundant. But I think the points were made \nby all the Senators who spoke, looking at the economy of this and how \ndevastating this would be in terms of jobs in America. But if you look \nat Utility MACT, it is not about public health, it is about killing \ncoal. And everybody knows that. Everybody knows that. People from coal \nStates are trying to act as if that is not the case, but it is the \ncase. I think we are all very much aware of that.\n  According to EPA's own analysis, Utility MACT will cost $10 billion, \nthough others have it up higher than that. However, if $10 billion a \nyear to implement it is correct, then it will only yield $6 million in \nprojected benefits--health benefits. This is the EPA talking, not me. \nAnd that is at 1600-to-1 ratio. That is not a very good ratio to depend \non.\n  I wish to address the myth that top EPA officials are perpetrating, \nand that is the idea coal is not being killed by the EPA regulations \nbut by the cheaper price of natural gas. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson \nsaid recently it is simply a coincidence that EPA's rules are coming \nout at the same time natural gas prices are low, so utilities are \nnaturally moving toward natural gas. So her message was, don't blame \nthe EPA. The truth is the EPA itself has admitted the agency \ndeliberately and consciously made a decision to kill coal.\n  EPA Region 1 Administrator Curt Spalding was caught on tape saying:\n\n       Lisa Jackson has put forth a very powerful message to the \n     country. Just two days ago, the decision on greenhouse gas \n     performance standard and saying basically gas plants are the \n     performance standard which means if you want to build a coal \n     plant you got a big problem.\n\n  He also went on to say the decision by the EPA to kill coal was \n``painful every step of the way'' because you have got to remember if \nyou go to West Virginia, you go to Pennsylvania--and he could have \nincluded other States in there too, such as Ohio, Illinois and \nMissouri--but he said ``and all those places, you have coal communities \nwho depend on coal.'' And they are going to put those people out. This \nis a very serious attack that is taking place right now, I think, when \nwe saw the attack on fossil fuels, as presented by Region 6 \nAdministrator Armendariz, when he said the truth is EPA's ``general \nphilosophy'' is to ``crucify'' and ``make examples'' of oil companies \nand gas companies.\n  I only bring that up because many people think this is just about \ncoal. No, it is very clear about fossil fuels. This has been a \nrelentless war of this President on fossil fuels; that is, coal, gas, \nand oil, ever since he has been in office. It was the president of the \nSierra Club who said a short while ago, yes, Utility MACT is about \nkilling coal. Fine, we can kill coal, but that doesn't mean we want to \nchange and start using natural gas because it is also a fossil fuel.\n  It may be that over in the House it took Nancy Pelosi 6 months to \nrecognize natural gas is a fossil fuel, but it is. So this is just the \nbeginning. This is the one where they are admittedly trying to kill \ncoal because it is an easier target. In their belief, there are fewer \nStates that are the big producers of coal, so go after them first.\n  I know my time has expired. I only want to say in closing that we \nwill have another opportunity tomorrow. There are many other people \nwanting to be heard who don't want to kill coal and have this dramatic \nnegative effect on our economy, our jobs, and our ability to produce \nthe necessary energy to run this machine called America.\n  If we are dependent upon just under 50 percent for our entire \ngeneration ability on coal, imagine, if they are successful, what is \ngoing to happen to the price of the remaining available fuel? And of \ncourse they would be subject next. So I would urge our people to forget \nfor a short period of time this President's obligation to certain small \ngroups and oppose the Utility MACT.\n  We went through the same thing with greenhouse gases and we fought \nthat battle before, I say to my good friend Senator Boxer from \nCalifornia. At that time, there were many legislative efforts to kill \ngreenhouse gases, and yet every time there was a vote, the people who \nwere answerable to the American people were the ones who voted it down. \nNow there might be, at most, 25 left in the Senate in favor of \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  I urge Members to pass my CRA and let the President decide what he is \ngoing to do about vetoing this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take 3 minutes now, then \nyield up to 15 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey. I would then ask \nmy friend, the Senator from Rhode Island--who is in the chair--to take \nup to 15 minutes, if he would like, and I will sit in the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I just wish to say to my colleague Senator \nInhofe before he leaves, that under this President we have seen more \ndomestic energy production than we have seen probably in decades and \ndecades--more domestic energy production and less reliance on imported \noil than we have seen in decades and decades. So let's not attack \nPresident Obama for not working to ensure that we have the\n\n[[Page S4289]]\n\ndomestic capacity here at home to produce energy, because we are \nproducing it from all sources.\n  The other point I wish to make is that my friends on the other side \nare ignoring the facts. The facts are that for every $1 to $3 that will \nbe invested in clean utilities, we get back $9 in benefits. The \nPresiding Officer has spoken on this quite often, and the fact is there \nare many benefits to doing this.\n  The other point I wish to make--which is very important--is that one-\nhalf of our coal-fired powerplants have already made these important \ntechnology upgrades. That is wonderful news. Why would we reward \ncompanies that haven't done what these others have done, that are \ncontinuing to spew forth the most dangerous chemicals? The list of them \ngoes on and on. But we are talking about mercury, we are talking about \narsenic, lead, and formaldehyde. I will get into that, but if we allow \nthis congressional resolution to pass, why would we be rewarding the \nmost recalcitrant utilities that are not cleaning up when the \ntechnology is clearly there?\n  There is a cost-benefit ratio. Our kids will breathe better. Later on \ntonight, I will spell out how many deaths will be avoided, how many \nasthma attacks will be avoided. We hear a little coughing in the \nChamber today. That is the sound, unfortunately, we hear in classrooms \nall over this country. If we go into a classroom and we ask how many \nkids have asthma, one-third of the kids will raise their hand. If we \nsay: How many of you know someone with asthma or have asthma yourself, \nhalf the kids will raise their hand.\n  So this isn't benign. What my colleague is doing is essentially \npushing forward a resolution that would stop the Environmental \nProtection Agency from doing its job that we asked them to do 20 long \nyears ago when we passed the Clean Air Act amendments.\n  It is my privilege to yield up to 15 minutes to Senator Lautenberg, \nfollowed by the Presiding Officer, Senator Whitehouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank Senator Boxer for her \nleadership in resisting these attempts to be able to permit companies \nto continue to pollute the air, a risk to our children, and marshaling \nthe forces to say no to this.\n  I feel this may be a lesson I learned when I was in business school \nat Columbia: If we spend money here, we might save it there. But if we \ndon't spend it, we are liable to lose something--a child, the child's \nability to function. What kind of a proposition are we looking at? This \nisn't an accounting exercise. We are talking about the well-being of \nour children.\n  I will say, we may have disagreements between our sides, but I \nbelieve Republicans care as much about their kids on their side as we \ndo on ours. But in this debate, they would say they have to take care \nof the power companies and permit them to emit poisonous ingredients \ninto the air. So I think the sentence would be more completely said: \nRather than take advantage of protecting our children, we would rather \ncontinue the profit buildup. It is preposterous when we think about it.\n  We have to continue the standards for powerplants that emit mercury \npollution, which is brain poison for our children. We have to make sure \nwe don't relinquish and permit this contagious material to continue to \nbe put into the air.\n  Under the proposal of our friend from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, \ncompanies should be free to spew toxic air pollution out of their \nsmokestacks, regardless of whether it goes into neighborhoods where our \nchildren play or in the path of their exercise and games.\n  This is a picture we would see. We have all seen it at different \ntimes in our lives. But we have learned something over the years. We \nhave learned we can reduce this threat that comes out of these \nsmokestacks.\n  We have a devil of a time in the State of New Jersey because it is \nfrom States to the west of us from which we get much of the pollution \nin our communities. Even if we had a State's option, fully, we couldn't \ndo much about it if our neighbors to the west permit their companies to \nemit poisons into the air.\n  The standards Senator Inhofe wants to overturn--the Clean Air Act \namendments--were approved by Republicans and Democrats over 20 years \nago, in 1990. Most Americans would be disappointed to learn that \npowerplants have been free to put unlimited amounts of mercury into the \nair that our children breathe. After years of delay and dirty air, the \nnew standards will finally require powerplants to cut mercury \npollution. Mercury is a highly toxic brain poison. Even in low doses, \nmercury can cause damage to fetuses and infants that permanently affect \nthe child's development.\n  Every year, 630,000 babies are born with unsafe levels of mercury in \ntheir blood. Let's be clear about what this means. Mercury is poison, \nand children are being born with it coarsing through their veins. These \nchildren suffer from brain damage, learning disabilities, hearing loss. \nThe mercury they are born with can damage their kidneys, liver, and \nnervous systems.\n  The powerplants that spew mercury also emit pollutants that trigger \nasthma attacks. Unfortunately, I have had the ability to see a child \nwith an asthma attack. It happens to be my grandson. When he is gasping \nfor air, if someone said: How much would you pay to relieve your \ngrandson of the gasping or the trauma that comes with that kind of \ncondition, there is no cost that would be too much. Anyone who has seen \nan asthmatic child wheeze and struggle to breathe knows we would do \nanything in our power to prevent asthma attacks.\n\n  EPA standards prevent 130,000 asthma attacks from occurring each \nyear. Imagine that. We are protecting 130,000 asthma attacks from \noccurring to our kids every year. So why are Republicans proposing to \nerase limits on mercury pollution? We already know EPA's new standards \nwill save and improve lives.\n  EPA estimates this rule would prevent 130,000 asthma attacks, 4,700 \nheart attacks, and up to 11,000 premature deaths. What kind of a \ncalamity is worse than that? There isn't any. Heaven help those \nfamilies who are tortured by learning that the problems they have for \ntheir children's school accomplishments could have been avoided and for \nevery $1 we spend to reduce pollution, we get $3 to $9 in health \nbenefits. A child with pollution in her body is set back from day one \nand is going to carry that disability for her full life.\n  The polluters ignore the cost to American families. These companies \nthink their right to pollute is more important than our kids' right to \nbreathe. I can't believe they are willing to risk the health of a baby \nin their home or their grandchildren's home.\n  They say that cleaning up their act will cut into their profits, but \nwe know clean air isn't just good for our health; it can be good for \nbusiness. For proof, we look no further than in my State of New Jersey \nand our largest utility, Public Service Electric & Gas. They invested \n$1.5 billion to upgrade their powerplants. PSE cut emissions of \nmercury and acid gases by 90 percent or more, and they created more \nthan 1,600 new jobs in the process. That is the real picture. That is \nwhat happens. It is clear what this resolution, as proposed, would do. \nIt would effectively kill any EPA action to reduce mercury now or in \nthe future. It is unacceptable.\n  I say to those people who come from coal States: Clean up the air. \nSpend the money. You are going to spend it one way or another. Wouldn't \nyou rather spend it on doing something that is positive for the \nenvironment rather than risking your child's health? I think there is \nno comparison.\n  We had an unfortunate incident in my family. I had a sister who was \nasthmatic. When she traveled, she always carried a respirator that she \ncould plug into a cigarette lighter, and if she started to feel \nuncomfortable from beginning to wheeze, she could put this on and her \nbreathing would clear up. She had been elected to the school board.\n  She was at a school board meeting and she felt an attack coming on. \nShe got up to go to her car in the parking lot to get some relief from \nher inability to breathe. She collapsed in the parking lot and 3 days \nlater she expired. She was 53 years old.\n  What is the price of a life? This was an adult. What about the life \nof a child, and we compare it to the costs? That is all we have heard \nabout. The other side sounds like a bunch of accountants\n\n[[Page S4290]]\n\nwhen they talk about how much will this cost. How much does it cost for \na child who can't learn? How much does it cost to live life with a \nchild whose body is impaired and they can't function? What is the cost?\n  The cost can't be explained in dollars. The cost is: What is right in \nour society? Do we have the obligation to try and protect the children \nwho live in our country? I think so. Let the companies figure out ways \nto improve the quality of their air emissions. It is pretty simple. If \nthey do, the problem can be solved. But to say no, no, this will cost \ntoo much--I think of a schoolyard full of little kids and I say I would \nlike to ask them: What is it worth to see these little kids sing ring-\naround-the-rosie, and be happy compared to saying to the company, no, \nyour job is to clean up your act. You have time to do it but you must \ndo it. You cannot avoid it any longer.\n\n  It is clear what this resolution would do. It would effectively kill \nany EPA action to reduce mercury now or in the future. That is \nunacceptable. I say to my colleagues: Defeat this measure. Look at your \nchildren, look at your grandchildren, and say to yourself: What will I \ndo to protect her; to protect him; to hear their voices nice and clear; \nto see them learning; to see them growing?\n  What is more important, to protect the powerplant that wants to emit \nmore poisonous air and refuses to do its share? They are going to do it \none way or the other. Look at your children. Look at your \ngrandchildren. I urge my colleagues to defeat this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer). Under the previous order, Senator \nWhitehouse of Rhode Island is recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, it is one thing to say things and it \nis another to say things that are true. Let us review some of the \nthings that have been said on the floor of the Senate today in the \ncontext of this discussion.\n  One of my colleagues said that this rule, which will for the first \ntime require our powerplants to meet mercury emission standards that \nother industries have had to meet, and have successfully met for years, \nis now coming on, to use his words, ``too far and too fast.''\n  The Clean Air Act was passed 30 years ago and, specific to this, in \nthe year 2000 EPA began the process that has culminated in this rule \ndetermining that it would be appropriate and necessary to have a rule \non this kind of hazardous air pollution being emitted by powerplants. \nHere we are in 2012 and we are being told that it is too fast that \nutilities are obliged to comply with a program that was first announced \nas appropriate and necessary in the year 2000. It would seem to me that \na dozen years' notice is enough, particularly where other industries \nhave already met these standards.\n  On that note, the same colleague said that compliance with these \nstandards is ``nearly impossible.'' It is obviously not nearly \nimpossible if other industries have already complied with the standard \nwith which the electric utility industry is being asked to comply. More \nspecifically, this rule sets the mark at a level where the highest \nperforming 12 percent of emitters already are. They are already there. \nSo it is not a question of compliance being nearly impossible. \nCompliance is actually already achieved by the good-behaving and \nresponsible utilities that have put the technology to work to clean up \ntheir exhausts.\n  I have a letter that I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. In this letter, 16 of my colleagues, led by myself \nand the distinguished Chair of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Barbara Boxer, wrote to the President supporting this rule. \nWe described, for one thing, a utility called Constellation, which has \ninvested to add environmental controls and a new scrubber to its \nBrandon Shores facility in Maryland, cutting mercury emissions by 90 \npercent. Also, in addition, it created 1,385 jobs at peak construction, \nnot counting the many more jobs manufacturing those clean air \ntechnologies. So this is not ``nearly impossible,'' this is being done \nregularly.\n  The other remark that was made by this colleague is that the country \ndoes not support EPA on this. To the contrary, actually, public health \ngroups and officials across the country support this: the Academy of \nPediatrics, the Association of Respiratory Care, the Heart Association, \nthe Lung Association, the American Nurses Association, the Public \nHealth Association, the March of Dimes--it is a considerable number of \npublic health supporters.\n  If you want to go beyond the public health community, it is \ninteresting to note that the faith community is very actively \nsupporting our position, everything from the Evangelical Environmental \nNetwork to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, to the General \nBaptist Convention of Texas, to the National Council of Churches USA, \nto the Jewish Council on Public Affairs, to the U.S. Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, and the United Methodist Church. To say that America \ndoes not support the EPA I think is to take a very constricted view of \nAmerica. Perhaps the occupants of the electric utility boardrooms in \nAmerica would be more precise.\n  Some of the folks who support this, interestingly, are not just \nhealth groups, but they are the electric utilities themselves. Half of \nthe fossil fuel electric generation in the country is controlled by \nelectric utilities that support the EPA rule. Let me read some examples \nfrom this same letter.\n  The chairman, president and CEO of Wisconsin Energy said, ``We really \nsee very little impact on customer electric rates or our capital plan \nbetween now and 2015 as a result of all the new EPA regulations that \nhave been proposed . . . . '' Very little impact.\n  The Senior Vice President of Energy Policy at Seminole Electric \nCooperative indicated, ``If the EPA adopts a mercury role as currently \nproposed, Seminole would already be meeting that standard.'' So much \nfor it being almost impossible.\n  Duke Energy's CEO noted, ``I think 3 years is doable,'' not too fast, \ndoable as a compliance timeline. And the CEO of PSEG stated, ``We are \nalso well-positioned to meet the anticipated requirements under EPA's . \n. . regulation.'' ``We believe these regulations are long overdue.'' \nNot coming too fast, ``long overdue.''\n  ``Our experience shows that it is possible to clean the air, create \njobs and power the economy, all at the same time.''\n  Another one of my colleagues said that higher electric bills should \nbe measured, on the one hand, against the negligible benefits on the \nother hand. That was a theme that a number of colleagues adopted.\n  Another one said this was all costs, no benefits.\n  A third said this bill fails to find the proper balance between cost \nand benefit. And a fourth said this rule would be ``hammering our \neconomy, in effect a tax increase.''\n  What are the facts? The facts are that although the rule will cost \n$9.6 billion to implement, because there is better health, because \nthere are beneficial effects of not polluting our country with all of \nthese dangerous chemicals, the benefits are between $37 and $90 \nbillion; $9 billion in costs, $37 to $90 billion every year in savings, \nin benefit to our economy. On the whole, this is a huge economic win \nfor the country. The only place where it is a problem is, again, in the \nboardrooms of the electric utility companies that have not been good \ncitizens, that have not put the scrubbers on, that are trailing the \nrest of the industry and do not want to be forced to catch up to where \nother industries, and half of their industry, now is.\n  If you want to move off, as Senator Lautenberg so movingly did, the \naccounting of this $9 billion in cost versus $37 billion to $90 billion \nin benefits, there are the 11,000 lives that will be saved every year. \nYou cannot put a price on a human life. This will save them.\n  The last point is that the distinguished ranking member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee described a relentless war, and \nwhat he was referring to is an imagined war by the Obama administration \nagainst the\n\n[[Page S4291]]\n\ncoal industry. I think if there is a relentless war out here, and I am \nspeaking now as a Senator from Rhode Island, it is a relentless war of \nthese polluting coal plants against the northeastern States in \nparticular, my State in particular, that carries the burden of all the \nfallout of that exhaust and that pollution that they do not bother to \ntreat at the source so it lands in our State.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks the resolution in support of the EPA mercury \nand air toxic standards for powerplants that was adopted by the U.S. \nConference of Mayors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I will not read the whole thing. Let's just read the \nconcluding paragraph:\n\n       Now, therefore, be it resolved that the U.S. Conference of \n     Mayors strongly supports the EPA's issued Mercury and Air \n     Toxics Standards for Power Plants.\n\n  There were no Federal standards for mercury until now for our \npowerplants. You would think we should have done this by now but--yes, \nwe should have done it by now but at least we are here. At least we \nwill achieve the benefits of $1 in cost for $3 to $9 in savings and in \nbenefits to Americans. We should be celebrating this sensible and yet \nsignificant public health achievement.\n  Instead, we are engaged in a debate that I think is confounded, on \ntheir side--their arguments are confounded by the actual facts.\n  The benefits are staggering, in addition to the 11,000 lives saved, \n4,700 fewer heart attacks, 130,000 fewer cases of children suffering \nasthma attacks, 5,700 fewer emergency visits each year.\n  Let me close by mentioning one specific. Mercury is a neurotoxin. The \nreason that people use the phrase ``mad as a hatter'' is because \nhatters, making hats, used mercury and mercury poisoned them, made them \nmad, affected their brains. It is a neurotoxin.\n  That affects Rhode Island quite considerably. First of all, we are a \nState that is downwind. Every Rhode Islander has heard, as we drive \ninto work on a bright summer weekday morning, the radio warning: Today \nis a bad air day in Rhode Island; children, people with breathing \ndifficulties, seniors should stay indoors today in their air \nconditioning.\n  It is a beautiful day. People have a right to be out of doors on a \nbeautiful day. They should be celebrating, playing, picnics, going to \nthe beach. But, no, stay indoors because there is ozone pollution \nsettling on us from the powerplants.\n  In addition, the mercury comes in and that creates a different set of \nharms in Rhode Island. One harm is that small children should not eat \nany freshwater fish in Rhode Island, according to our health \ndepartment. Here is a wonderful Norman Rockwell picture, sort of an \nemblematic American scene, grandfather is taking his grandson fishing. \nThe excitement as the fish comes up out of the pond--that image in \nRhode Island is shattered by the fact that this small child would not \nbe allowed to eat any freshwater fish that he caught with his \ngrandfather because of this mercury pollution that has bombarded us by \nthese out-of-State powerplants that did not clean up their act.\n  Furthermore, no one in Rhode Island should eat more than one serving \nof freshwater fish caught in our State each month, so if the \ngrandfather caught two fish, he could eat one, for a month, but he \nshould not eat the other because of the health effects of the mercury \nthat has piled up in the bodies of the fish.\n  There are some bodies of water that seem to be more in the gunsights \nof these polluting dirty Midwestern powerplants than others for reasons \nthat nobody can explain. But Quidnick Reservoir, Wincheck Pond, and \nYawgoog Pond in Rhode Island--no one should ever eat any of the fish \ncaught in those three bodies of water because of the mercury \npoisoning. So when we talk about every dollar a utility will spend to \nclean up its pollution being offset by $3 to $9 in benefits, that \nfigure doesn't take into account these intangible benefits. It doesn't \ntake into account the intangible benefit of being able to enjoy the \nemblematic American pastime of taking your grandson or going with your \ngrandfather to go fishing in a pond, to be able to catch something, \nbring it home, fry it up, and have it for supper. The utility polluters \nget to wreck that for free in this equation, but we should not forget \nit in this Chamber.\n\n  There are many aspects of the American way of life that should not \nyield to the bottom line of those polluters that are not willing to \nmeet the same rules that so many of their colleagues already do and \nthat so many industries already do.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                December 16, 2011.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Respectfully, we urge the \n     Administration to finalize the Utility Air Toxics Rule as \n     scheduled on December 16, 2011, and to adhere to the \n     compliance schedule set forth in Section 112 of the Clean Air \n     Act. Our nation has waited far too long for a federal limit \n     on mercury and other hazardous air pollution emitted by power \n     plants.\n       The electric utility industry has been on notice for a \n     decade that the EPA intended to limit its hazardous air \n     pollution. In 2000, the EPA determined it was ``appropriate \n     and necessary'' to set hazardous air pollution standards for \n     power plants, based on the serious health effects of this \n     pollution. Power plants are the biggest emitters of mercury, \n     a neurotoxin that can stunt cognitive development in children \n     and infants. Power plants are also significant emitters of \n     toxic metals--for instance, they emit 62% of all such arsenic \n     pollution in the air we breathe--and acid gases such as \n     hydrochloric acid which can cause respiratory tract ailments \n     and fluid buildup in the lungs. The rule is expected to save \n     up to 17,000 lives per year by cutting this pollution.\n       Plants in 17 states have begun to control for mercury \n     pollution. These projects protect public health, and \n     demonstrate that updating our energy infrastructure triggers \n     investment in new technologies and the creation of tens of \n     thousands of jobs. Consider: Constellation invested $885 \n     million to add environmental controls and a new scrubber to \n     its Brandon Shores facility in Maryland, cutting mercury \n     emissions by 90 percent. This investment created 1,385 jobs \n     at peak construction, and many more jobs manufacturing the \n     clean air technologies; PSEG retrofitted two of its coal \n     facilities and installed scrubbers, creating 1,600 \n     construction-related jobs over two years, and 24 permanent \n     jobs; and AEP retrofitted one of its coal facilities and \n     created more than 1,000 construction-related jobs building a \n     scrubber, and 40 permanent jobs in operations.\n       AEP CEO Michael Morris said this year that when a utility \n     retrofits a plant to comply with the Clean Air Act, ``jobs \n     are created in the process--no question about that.'' Good \n     environmental policy is good economic policy, as the jobs \n     numbers--and the United States' $11 billion trade surplus in \n     environmental technologies--demonstrate.\n       Most electric utilities in this country are ready for this \n     rule. Indeed, operators of half of the fossil fuel electric \n     generation in this country have gone on record on this point. \n     For instance:\n       The Chair, President and CEO of Wisconsin Energy noted \n     that, ``We really see very little impact on customer electric \n     rates or our capital plan between now and 2015 as a result of \n     all the new EPA regulations that have been proposed. . . .''\n       The Senior Vice President of Energy Policy at Seminole \n     Electric Cooperative, Inc., indicated that ``If the EPA \n     adopts a mercury rule as currently proposed, Seminole would \n     already be meeting the standard.''\n       Duke Energy's CEO noted that ``I think three years is \n     doable'' as a compliance timeline for the Utility Air Toxics \n     Rule.\n       The CEO of PSEG stated that, ``We are also well-positioned \n     to meet the anticipated requirements under EPA's HAPs/MACT \n     regulation, which is scheduled to be issued on December 16. \n     We believe these regulations are long overdue. Our experience \n     shows that it is possible to clean the air, create jobs and \n     power the economy, all at the same time.''\n       Some utilities, however, are arguing that this rule will \n     compromise their ability to provide reliable service. We do \n     not believe the facts support this argument. Earlier this \n     month, your Department of Energy released a report finding \n     that even under the most conservative assumptions, utilities \n     could comply with both the Transport Rule and the Utility Air \n     Toxics Rule while providing adequate electric power in each \n     region of the country.\n       Meanwhile, new generation capacity is being built. Over the \n     next four years, utilities are constructing nearly 78 GW of \n     new capacity, including about 38 GW of natural gas. Natural \n     gas prices are dropping rapidly, driving both the \n     construction of new gas-fired plants and the utilization of \n     existing gas capacity. These gas plants are starting to out-\n     compete inefficient coal units on price alone, separate and \n     apart from any Clean Air Act rules.\n       If localized reliability issues emerge, or if a unit needs \n     more time to comply with the Utility Air Toxics Rule, current \n     law and long-standing practice provide off-ramps on a case-\n     by-case basis. Upon request, EPA and\n\n[[Page S4292]]\n\n     the states may grant a unit a fourth year to comply. If the \n     unit needs more time to install controls, or if it plans to \n     retire but needs to stay online to ensure reliability, EPA \n     may enter into legally binding agreements with the utility to \n     provide that necessary time.\n       Given that so many utilities are well-positioned to comply \n     with the Utility Air Toxics Rule, and the flexibility \n     afforded particular units, there is no reason for an across-\n     the-board delay of this important public health measure. We \n     applaud the work that EPA has undertaken to limit dangerous \n     air pollution from power plants, and urge the \n     Administration's approval of a final rule to be in place by \n     December 16, 2011.\n       Sincerely,\n     Sheldon Whitehouse.\n     Patrick J. Leahy.\n     Joseph I. Lieberman.\n     Patty Murray.\n     Frank R. Lautenberg.\n     Benjamin L. Cardin.\n     Jeanne Shaheen.\n     Kirsten E. Gillibrand.\n     Barbara Boxer.\n     John F.

Each year, this translates into as many as 11,000 \n     lives saved, 4,700 heart attacks and 130,000 asthma attacks \n     prevented, and 5,700 hospital visits avoided; and\n       Whereas, the benefits are widely distributed and are \n     especially important to minority and low income populations \n     who are disproportionately impacted by asthma and other \n     debilitating health conditions; and\n       Whereas, clean, healthy air and water are fundamental \n     American rights,\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved that the U.S. Conference of \n     Mayors strongly supports the EPA's issued Mercury and Air \n     Toxics Standards for Power Plants (MATS).\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to thank the Presiding Officer very much for \ntaking the Chair again and for his beautiful statement. I thought the \nSenator definitely debated the issue and took apart the argument that \nmy Republican friends made against a rule that is widely supported by \nthe American people. The Senator cited some of the amazing \norganizations. I will do that again tomorrow in the debate.\n  Just for the sake of the folks who are still working here tonight, I \ndon't plan to go much more than 5 minutes. It has been a very long day \nfor everyone who works here and I respect that.\n  It is not only these amazing groups that are with us that want us to \ndefeat this very dangerous resolution--my colleague named some of \nthem--the American Nurses are among those who understand what health \ncare is about. They see people struggling to find a breath when they \ncome in with these attacks. Also, religious organizations recognize we \nare only as good as the weakest among us. As Senator Lautenberg pointed \nout so eloquently, it is our kids who get the real impact of this many \ntimes as well as adults.\n  What I wish to do in closing out the debate tonight--and we will have \nanother hour of debate tomorrow--is just run through a few charts that \ntell the tale. The first one is: What does this resolution do? Because \nI know people may be following us and saying: What exactly do Senator \nInhofe and his colleagues want to do? They want to repeal the rule that \nis about to go into place and block the Environmental Protection Agency \nfrom implementing the first-ever national mercury and air toxics \nstandards for powerplants. These powerplants are giving off these \npoisons, and these poisons are going into the air.\n  In the case of mercury, we wind up poisoning fish, which was such a \ngreat part of my colleague Senator Whitehouse's presentation. So \npoisons are being spewed into the air from these powerplants.\n  In 1990, by a vote of 89 to 10 and in the House 401 to 25, we passed \nthe Clean Air Act. Those were the amendments. It was signed by George \nHerbert Walker Bush. More than 20 years later, we have a court order \nbecause we didn't do what we were supposed to do. Now President Obama \nis doing the right thing to protect the people by moving forward with \nthis first-ever national standard. We have to defeat this push to stop \nthe Obama administration from doing what we wanted done since 1990 and \nwhat we wanted the then-EPA to do and it has taken this much time to \nget it done. Just as we are on the brink of getting this protective \nrule, which is so cost-efficient--for every $1 to $3, we save $9--they \nwant to turn it around.\n  What is at stake? There are 4,200 to 11,000 additional premature \ndeaths. So when people say what we do doesn't matter, I say look at \nthis. If this rule is repealed, more people will die prematurely. We \nwill have 4,700 heart attacks, 130,000 cases of childhood asthma \nsymptoms, 6,300 cases of acute bronchitis, 5,700 emergency room visits \nand hospital admissions, 540,000 days of missed work due to respiratory \nillness. Again, it is $3 to $9 in benefits for every $1 invested in the \npowerplants, one-half of which have already done the right thing. Half \nthe coal powerplants have done this already. So we are talking about \nensuring that the rest of them do the same.\n  Many companies have addressed their mercury and air toxic emissions. \nWe should thank the coal companies that have already cleaned up their \nact, not reward those that have delayed in installing the pollution-\ncontrol equipment. Anyone on the other side who says there is no \npollution-control equipment that is available and this can't be done \nand it is going to result in increased electric utility rates should \nlisten to the facts. They should talk to the people who already \ninstalled these important mechanisms. They created jobs doing it, and \nas far as electricity prices, there was no impact.\n  I talked about the jobs that are provided. When we clean up these \nutilities, there will be 8,000 long-term jobs and 46,000 short-term \njobs. It is actually a jobs bill when we clean up to current standards.\n  What poisonous emissions does the clean air rule address? I think \nthis is basically where I am going to end it. I am going to mention \nthese things, and they sound scary because they are. Mercury and lead, \nthis is what we are asking them to clean up, and my colleagues say, no, \nkeep on polluting. Mercury and lead damages the nervous system of \nchildren and harms the brains of infants. Arsenic sound scary? It is. \nIt causes cancer and damages the nervous system, kidneys, and the \nliver. My Republican friends say: Oh, it is OK. Who cares? We should \nall care. How about selenium? It harms the reproductive system of \nwildlife. Other heavy metals such as cadmium and chromium cause cancer \nand harm vital organs. Benzene causes cancer and\n\n[[Page S4293]]\n\ndamages immune and reproductive systems. How about this one, \nformaldehyde. It sounds scary. It is scary. It is a carcinogen, and \nthat means it causes cancer--no question about that. Acid gases sound \nscary? They are scary. They damage the heart, the lungs, and the \nnervous system. Imagine breathing in acid gases and what that does to \nour pulmonary system. Toxic soot pollution causes respiratory illness, \nincluding asthma attacks, chronic bronchitis, heart attacks, and \npremature death.\n  Tomorrow I will go into these in greater detail. It is just a \nrhetorical question, but why would anyone in their right mind stand in \nthe way of cleaning up these poisons. They say it costs too much. No, \nit doesn't because the companies that already did it say it is working. \nFor every $1 we invest, we save $3 to $9. So it doesn't cost too much. \nIs it just about doing business as usual? That is fine if all we are \ndoing is something that is benign. This is not benign.\n  My colleague Senator Inhofe attacked the President and said our \nPresident is stymieing domestic energy production when we have the \nopposite truth. We have seen a tremendous increase in domestic energy \nproduction under this President, more than we have seen for decades. So \ndon't blame this President and say he is trying to stymie domestic \nenergy production. He has embraced an all-of-the-above strategy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na paper entitled ``Develop and Secure America's Energy Supplies.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Develop and Secure America's Energy Supplies--Expand Safe and \n  Responsible Domestic Oil and Natural Gas Development and Production\n\n       ``All these actions can increase domestic oil production in \n     the short and medium term. But let's be clear--it is not a \n     long-term solution''--President Obama, March 11, 2010.\n\n\n                             The Challenge\n\n       America's oil and natural gas supplies are critical \n     components of our Nation's energy portfolio. Their \n     development enhances our energy security and fuels our \n     Nation's economy. Recognizing that America's oil supplies are \n     limited, we must develop our domestic resources safely, \n     responsibly, and efficiently, while taking steps that will \n     ultimately lessen our reliance on oil and help us move \n     towards a clean energy economy.\n       Over the last two years, domestic oil and natural gas \n     production has increased. In 2010, American oil production \n     reached its highest level since 2003, and total U.S. natural \n     gas production reached its highest level in more than 30 \n     years. Much of this increase has been the result of growing \n     natural gas and oil production from shale formations as a \n     result of recent technological advances. These resources, \n     when developed with appropriate safeguards to protect public \n     health, will play a critical role in domestic energy \n     production in the coming decades.\n       America's public lands and Federal waters provide resources \n     that are critical to the nation's energy security. To \n     encourage robust exploration and development of the nation's \n     resources, the Administration has offered millions of acres \n     of public land and Federal waters for oil and gas leasing \n     over the last two years. Oil production from the Outer \n     Continental Shelf increased more than a third--from 446 \n     million barrels in 2008 to more than 600 million barrels of \n     estimated production in 2010. Responsible oil production from \n     onshore public lands also increased over the past year--from \n     109 million barrels in 2009 to 114 million barrels in 2010. \n     These increases are occurring at the same time that oil \n     imports are decreasing; for the first time in a decade, \n     imports accounted for less than half of what we consumed.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. It shows how U.S. crude oil production is way up under \nPresident Obama. It is way up. Over the last 2 years domestic oil and \nnatural gas production has increased. In 2010, American oil production \nreached its highest level since 2003 and total U.S. natural gas \nproduction has reached its highest level in more than 30 years. How can \nmy colleagues stand and say this President doesn't like the coal \ncompanies and is trying to push them out of business so we will have \nless energy production? Wrong. What he is trying to do and we are \ntrying to do--those of us who are going to oppose the Inhofe \nresolution--is say we want to see coal continue, but we don't want it \nto spew forth--mercury, arsenic, selenium, other heavy metals, benzene, \nformaldehyde, acid gases, and toxic soot. It is pretty straightforward. \nClean it up.\n  When I was a kid, my mother said: Clean your room. She said: You made \na mess so clean it. I see some of the pages are smiling because their \nmothers say the same to them. What I found as I matured over the years \nis that we need to come back to some of those basics. Clean up your \nmess. They are making a mess. But it is not the benign mess that is in \nsome of the bedrooms of our kids, with toys, papers, and clothes \nscattered around; it is dangerous toxins, and it has to be cleaned up.\n  Tomorrow is an important vote. I hope tonight people will think about \nthis debate because a lot of the things we do here maybe don't have \nsuch a direct impact on people's lives. This has a direct impact. What \nwe breathe and the fish we eat are all related to what is going to \nhappen tomorrow. I hope we will vote no on the Inhofe resolution and \nallow the EPA to do its work which 75 percent of the American people \nsupport. They want clean air, they want clean water, and we want to \nmake sure they get it without interference. Let's vote down the Inhofe \nresolution and move forward with clean air. I think we will all be \nproud tomorrow if we can defeat that resolution.\n  I note the absence of a quorum and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I would like to take a moment to recognize the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and the American Heart Association for \ntheir work to raise awareness about the dangers of cardiovascular \ndisease amongst our Nation's women veterans and service members.\n  VA's dedicated work on cardiovascular disease has successfully \ndecreased the gaps between men and women veterans in heart disease \nprevention outcomes. However, as cardiovascular disease remains the No. \n1 killer of women, I applaud VA and the American Heart Association's \n``Go Red for Women'' campaign for partnering under the First Lady's \nJoining Forces Initiative to raise awareness and promote prevention \namongst our Nation's female veterans. I am pleased to see VA focus its \nefforts on educating women veterans through an online fitness and \nnutrition program and an online support network to connect women with \nother women who share similar experiences.\n  Today, women serve in every branch of the military. Women represent \n15 percent of our Nation's Active-Duty military, and they are the \nfastest growing population within the veteran community. The number of \nwomen veterans is expected to increase to 2 million in 2020 and with \nthis projected increase it is critical that VA remain responsive to the \nunique needs of women.\n  Nearly one in two women, 44.4 percent, will die of heart disease and \nstroke. We must ensure that women receive equal access to VA health \ncare benefits and services. This partnership between VA and the \nAmerican Heart Association is a great step toward ensuring that women \nare educated on the dangers of cardiovascular disease and provided with \nthe resources necessary to prevent it.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the collaboration between VA and the \nAmerican Heart Association to raise awareness and increase prevention \nefforts on an issue that affects so many of our Nation's women veterans \nand civilian women throughout our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/19/senate-section/article/S4293-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4293-S4294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OBSERVING WORLD REFUGEE DAY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President. Abraham Lincoln once spoke of our Nation as \nthe last best hope on earth. On this World Refugee Day--the 11th of its \nkind and the 61st anniversary of the\n\n[[Page S4294]]\n\nUnited Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees--it is \nfitting that we give careful pause to remember that the responsibility \nattached to Lincoln's words does not end at our shores.\n  Across the world, refugees need our assistance and our support. They \nlook to America's voice and leadership to champion their plight--from \nthe dusty plains of northern Kenya to the mountainous confines of \nBurma, Nepal and Southwest Asia.\n  As we look around the world, there are, sadly, numerous refugee \ncrises. In many cases, refugees exchange one set of dangerous \nconditions for overcrowded, unsanitary and even violent camps. \nInstability in Somalia is swelling the ranks of the world's largest \nrefugee complex in Dadaab, Kenya, home to nearly 500,000 people. In the \nSahel, more than 150,000 Malians have fled the conflict to neighboring \ncountries, joining host communities that are already suffering from \ndrought and hunger. To them, daily survival is a gamble.\n  We also know that refugees and displaced populations can be the spark \nfor large-scale violence, and today we face that very threat from the \nmillions displaced from homes across the Middle East. Unspeakable \nviolence in Syria has uprooted an estimated 500,000 people inside the \ncountry and driven tens of thousands more to Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon \nand Iraq. Human security in Iraq continues to be a pressing concern, as \nour partners support hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees in \nneighboring countries and over one million internally displaced \npersons.\n  Of course, there are glimmers of hope. As Burma slowly and steadily \nopens its political system, we will look to the government to provide \nspace for humanitarian action to assist those displaced by years of \nconflict. Have a thought for the Burmese refugee in limbo along the \nborder with Thailand or the young ethnic Rohingya who is denied even \nthe basic identity papers that connote official personhood. They, too, \ndeserve our attention, compassion and support.\n  In South Asia, more than 5.7 million Afghan refugees have returned \nhome in the past decade, one of the UN's most successful voluntary \nrepatriation operations. We must celebrate this achievement, even as we \nrenew efforts to find durable solutions for the nearly 3 million Afghan \nrefugees scattered across the region. In Colombia, where conflict has \ndisplaced an estimated 4 million people, our partners are helping the \ngovernment to provide reparations and land restitution to affected \nindividuals and families. We also continue to support the UN Relief and \nWorks Agency in its efforts to provide assistance to millions of \nPalestinian refugees in the Palestinian territories and throughout the \nregion.\n  Above all, we must remember that these aren't just statistics. The \nplight of the world's refugee and displaced populations is a challenge \nto the humanity of every single one of us. Children who need proper \nnutrients and access to education, women who are at great risk of \nfalling victim to gender-based violence, individuals with psycho-social \nneeds after witnessing devastation--these realities prick our \nconscience from half a world away.\n  Mr. President: Lincoln used to say that he ``tried to pluck a thistle \nand plant a flower wherever the flower would grow . . . `` Despite our \ntrying times, we should remember all those who have planted the seeds \nof hope and opportunity where thistles would otherwise grow, from the \nState Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration and its \npartners in the UN to international, faith-based and non-governmental \norganizations in the field. Let us also recognize the efforts of the \norganizations that provide guidance and services to give refugees \nresettled in the United States the opportunity to rebuild their lives \nhere--and thank the communities across the country, including in my \nState of Massachusetts, who welcome them to their adoptive homes. Their \nlegacy is ours, too. And the next chapter is waiting to be written.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/19/senate-section/article/S4294-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4294-S4295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    REMEMBERING JOSEPH A. LESNIEWSKI\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments \nto commemorate a great Pennsylvanian who passed away on May 23, 2012. \nThose who worked alongside this high-spirited citizen of Erie, PA knew \nhim as a hard worker, those who served alongside him in World War II \nknew him as a selfless soldier, while others who worked with him at the \nUnited States Post Office knew him as a devoted civil servant; still, \nmany more around the world knew this great Pennsylvanian as World War \nII veteran Private Lesniewski, of the 101st Airborne Division, \nimmortalized in the book and HBO series ``Band of Brothers.'' Today I \nwould like to commemorate and take stock of this remarkable life: \nJoseph A. Lesniewski, an influential and inspirational citizen of \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. Joseph A. Lesniewski passed away at a Veterans Affairs Medical \nCenter at the age of 91; he was survived by his wife of 38 years, \nPhyllis Schindley Lesniewski; and his four daughters, two sons, two \nsisters, six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. From Mr. \nLesniewki's work with General Electric, to his service in World War II, \nto his 37 years serving our country at the Erie Post Office, Mr. \nLesniewski embodied the American spirit of dedication to country and \nunyielding resolve during several of our country's most trying times.\n  After graduating from Erie Technical High School in 1940 and faced \nwith a battered world economy, Mr. Lesniewski joined the Civilian \nConservation Corps, a New Deal Program that helped weather the Great \nDepression and achieve the skills necessary for a position as a tool \nand die maker in General Electric's Erie, PA factory. Following the \nbombing of Pearl Harbor, Mr. Lesniewski enlisted in the United States \nArmy in 1942, where he served in the storied 101st Airborne Division \nduring the momentous Battle of Normandy, Operation Market Garden, and \nthe Battle of the Bulge. Mr. Lesniewski and his comrades were later \nimmortalized in historian Stephen E. Ambrose's book, Band of Brothers, \nwhich illustrated the common acts of heroism displayed in World War II \nby our soldiers. Ambrose wrote that Lesniewski took German-grenade \nshrapnel to his neck while alerting his fellow comrades to take cover \nafter he discovered a machine gun nest and an entire company of SS \nsoldiers just yards away. Lesniewki's selfless actions led to the \ncapture of both the machine gun nest and the company of SS soldiers. In \nanother incident, Private Lesniewski disregarded his own safety during \na German artillery barrage and marked the spot where an unexploded \nGerman shell had burrowed itself into the ground. This action helped to \nensure the safety of his fellow soldiers.\n  After helping to keep others alive on numerous occasions, and serving \nas a source of strength and inspiration to the soldiers around him, Mr. \nLesniewski re-entered the civilian workforce in 1945 and served for 37 \nyears at the United States Post Office in Erie, PA. A historian and \nclose friend of Mr. Lesniewski once said:\n\n       Over the years I saw a thousand acts of random kindness \n     come from him. He had a heart of gold. He never stopped \n     giving, as he was proudly involved in numerous charitable \n     causes in his community.\n\n  As a testament to his heroism, Senator John Kerry invited Mr. \nLesniewski to join him at the 2004 dedication of the World War II \nMemorial in Washington, DC.\n  As we commemorate the valiant life of Joseph Lesniewski, we should \nnot forget that our country has survived seemingly insurmountable \nchallenges in our history. We survived these dire times due to the \ndedication to country and unyielding resolve found uniquely in our \ncitizenry, symbolized so clearly through the life of Joseph A. \nLesniewski. Let us not forget the words of Abraham Lincoln at \nGettysburg, ``It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to \nthe unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly \nadvanced.'' So then, with reflection on the life of Mr. Lesniewski, who \nso nobly advanced our country in both military and civilian roles, let \nus continue our dedication to the unfinished work before us: the work \nof building a better country and ensuring that the lives of our \nchildren can and will be better than that of our own.\n\n[[Page S4295]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/19/senate-section/article/S4295-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                REMEMBERING PATRICIA RAE McCOY ROHLEDER\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \nPatricia Rae McCoy Rohleder. An Idaho native, Pat has been an integral \npart of the Idaho agriculture community for many years.\n  Pat had a remarkable 40-year career as a newspaper reporter that \nincluded many years of covering agricultural issues through the Capital \nPress. The value she placed on agricultural production was evident in \nher activity in this field. She was involved in many related efforts, \nincluding the Julia Davis Ag Pavilion project, Idaho Food Producers \nlegislative meetings, and work on the Ag Pavilion Committee. The long \nlist of awards and honors she received for her work includes three \nConservation Writer of the Year honors from the Idaho Association of \nSoil Conservation Districts; two media awards from the Idaho Grain \nProducers Association; an Idaho Farm Bureau award for outstanding \nreporting of agriculture; an honorary life membership received in 2009 \nfrom the Owyhee Cattlemen's Association; and a special award for \ndedication and service to Idaho's agricultural industry received at the \n2010 A. Larry Branen Idaho Ag Summit.\n  In addition to her writing, Pat had many other talents and interests \nincluding sewing, needle arts, playing the piano, and genealogy, and I \nunderstand her favorite title was ``Grandma.'' She was also an active \nmember of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n  Pat's action reflected her values.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and \nlegacy of Joseph ``Perry'' Swisher. A third-generation Idahoan, Perry \ncommitted much of his life to service to our State and Idahoans.\n  Perry was born in Bruneau, IA, and educated at Pocatello High School, \nUniversity of Idaho Southern Branch and Idaho State University. He had \nan extensive career as a journalist and in elected office. This \nincluded his work as the Pocatello News Bureau manager for the Salt \nLake Tribune, editor and publisher of the Intermountain, and assistant \nmanaging editor for the Lewiston Morning Tribune. In the late 1960s \nthrough mid 1970s, Perry owned The Book Arcade in Pocatello. For 7 \nyears, he served as director of special services at Idaho State \nUniversity and was involved in helping low-income and minority students \nsucceed in college. He also served as a member and president of the \nIdaho Public Utilities Commission, as Idaho State representative of \nBannock County, Idaho State senator for Bannock County, and as a member \nof the Pocatello City Council. Perry received many awards and honors \nfor his work and served on a number of boards and commissions.\n  His immense experience in many aspects of the communities he lived in \nand the State contributed to his deep understanding of Idaho and \nIdahoans. Perry was known for his ability to simplify complex issues \nand make them understandable. He was sharp and inquisitive and had a \npropensity for debate and thought-provoking discussions. Perry had a \ncomprehensive knowledge and sense of Idaho history, which he was \nwilling to share if asked. Although his political partisan affiliations \nwere famously known to shift according to the cyclical vagaries of \npolitical thought, his own view of the world remained consistent. His \nview of current events, always stated in the context of Idaho history, \nwas of enormous value to many, including to those in my office. He also \nhad an innate kindness and fabulous sense of humor that made the \nlessons he delivered particularly enjoyable.\n  I extend my heartfelt condolences to Perry's wife of 64 years, Nicky \nSwisher, his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and many \nother family members and friends. Perry was truly exceptional. His \nsteadfast determination and efforts in support of and to better our \nstate will always be remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/19/senate-section/article/S4295-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL D. LEE\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the career \nof Police Chief Michael D. Lee, who is retiring after 34 years with the \nKaysville Police Department.\n  Chief Lee was the eighth officer hired by Kaysville City in 1977. He \nstarted as the first school resource officer for Kaysville and rose \nthrough the ranks becoming a detective sergeant in 1988. He was \nsubsequently promoted to lieutenant over the Patrol Services Division, \nand in 2007 he became the captain of the Investigative Services \nDivision. In 2008, he was named chief of police for Kaysville City and \nhas served the citizens honorably.\n  During his time at the Kaysville Police Department, Lee has helped to \noversee the force's evolution into the 21st century. As new \ntechnologies have become available, Lee has pushed the department to \ncontinue to modernize, acquiring equipment ranging from advanced speed \nradar systems to laptops for patrol cars.\n  Passing the tradition of public service from one generation to \nanother, Lee's son, Jason, has entered into his own law enforcement \ncareer. He protects the public as a patrol sergeant for the Morgan \nCounty Sheriff's office.\n  I join Kaysville Mayor Steve Hiatt and the local community in \ncongratulating Michael D. Lee for his many years of dedicated service. \nI want to personally thank him for protecting and serving so many \nUtahns and bringing honor to a name that we share. His career is a \ntestament to the accomplishments of hardworking police officers \neverywhere, and I congratulate him on his many achievements and 34 \nyears of excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/19/senate-section/article/S4295-4", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/19/senate-section/article/S4295-5", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/19/senate-section/article/S4295-6", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4295-S4296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:23 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 404.

A bill to direct the President, in consultation with the \nDepartment of State, United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, Millennium Challenge Corporation, and the Department of \nDefense, to establish guidelines for United States foreign assistance \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, last week heads of state, key policymakers, \nand foreign aid implementers met in Washington to examine ``Frontiers \nin Development.'' It was my pleasure to provide the conference keynote \naddress Monday in which I pressed for greater transparency in global \nfinancial transactions and investments. This includes both U.S. foreign \nassistance funding and payments that companies make to foreign \ngovernments for oil, natural gas and mineral developments. Fuller \ndisclosure improves accountability to citizens of both our country and \nthe recipient country and would set an important example for other \ncountries to provide more clarity about their own foreign assistance \nprograms. Transparency in energy and mineral payments is already \nrequired for U.S.-listed companies by law in the Cardin-Lugar provision \nof the Dodd-Frank Act, and thanks to American leadership, the European \nUnion is preparing similar legislation. Now, it is timely to enact \nlegislation requiring the U.S. to disclose where and for what purpose \nit provides foreign assistance dollars across the globe. Further, \ntaxpayers and foreign aid recipients have a right to know the impacts \nof these funds.\n  That is why I am introducing The Foreign Aid Transparency and \nAccountability Act, which will require the President to disclose this \ninformation through a publicly accessible website in a timely manner.\n  The U.S. provides assistance through a host of federal agencies \nincluding the Departments of State, Defense and Agriculture, as well as \nagencies including the U.S. Agency for International Development, \nUSAID, and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, MCC. While our Federal \nbudget is available for public review, there is currently no single \nsource required by law where one can review in what amount and for what \npurpose U.S. dollars flow to individual countries and programs. \nPresident Obama early in his administration promised to bring more \ntransparency to our international development programs. But so far, the \nefforts by the State Department, USAID, the MCC and others to display \nthis information through the Foreign Assistance Dashboard have been \ninadequate. There is a meager amount of data on the Dashboard, and it \nis often woefully out of date.\n  My legislation is the identical version to that introduced earlier in \nthis Congress by Congressman Ted Poe of Texas, which now has more than \n50 House co-sponsors. I compliment Representative Poe on the bill and \nappreciate the bipartisan support he has already garnered for it in the \nHouse. I look forward to working to enact the legislation in this \nCongress, bringing greater transparency and accountability to taxpayer \nfunding of foreign assistance programs in a timely manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3310\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \nassistance provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs to women \nveterans, to improve health care furnished by the Department, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President today, as Chairman of the Senate Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, I introduce the Women Veterans and Other Health \nCare Improvement Act of 2012. I am incredibly proud of the women and \nmen who have served or are serving our nation in uniform, and I \nstrongly believe we must do all that we can to honor them.\n  That is why I introduced legislation, which was signed into law as \npart of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of \n2010, which helped to transform the way that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, addresses the needs of women veterans. Among other things, \nthis law required the VA to provide neonatal care, train mental health \nprofessionals to provide mental health services for sexual trauma, and \ndevelop a child care pilot program. VA has an obligation to provide \nveterans with quality care and we have an obligation to make sure that \nVA does so. The legislation I am introducing today builds upon that \neffort to make additional improvements to VA's services for women \nveterans and veterans with families.\n  The nature of the current conflict and increasing use of improvised \nexplosive devices leaves servicemembers, both male and female, at \nincreased risk for blast injuries including spinal cord injury and \ntrauma to the reproductive and urinary tracts. Army data shows that \nbetween 2003 and 2011 more than 600 women and men experienced these \nlife-changing battle injuries while serving in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  As they return from the battlefield, the VA system must be equipped \nto help injured veterans step back into their lives as parents, \nspouses, and citizens. These veterans have served honorably and have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for our great nation. They deserve the \nopportunity to pursue their goals and dreams, whether that includes \npursuing higher education, finding gainful employment, purchasing their \nfirst house, or starting their own family. VA has many programs that \nhelp veterans pursue the educational, career, or homeownership dreams \nand goals that they deferred in service to this country, yet it falls \nshort when it comes to helping severely wounded veterans who want to \nstart a family. These veterans often need far more advanced services in \norder to conceive a child.\n  The Department of Defense and the Tricare program are already able to \nprovide advanced fertility treatments, including assisted reproductive \ntechnology, to servicemembers with complex injuries. However; not all \ninjured servicemembers are well situated to have a child at the time \nthey are eligible for that coverage, and some are no longer eligible \nfor Tricare by the time they are ready.\n  VA's fertility counseling and treatment options are limited and do \nnot meet the complex needs of severely injured veterans. I have heard \nfrom severely injured veterans whose injuries have made it impossible \nfor them to conceive children naturally. While the details of these \nstories vary, the common thread that runs through them all is that \nthese veterans were unable to obtain the type of assistance they need. \nSome have spent tens of thousands of dollars in the private sector to \nget the advanced reproductive treatments they need to start a family. \nOthers have watched their marriage dissolve because the stress of \ninfertility, in combination with the stresses of readjusting to life \nafter severe injury, drove their relationship to a breaking point. Any \nservicemember who sustains this type of serious injury deserves so much \nmore. It is our responsibility to give VA the tools it needs to serve \nthem, and the Women Veterans and Other Health Care Improvement Act is a \nstart at doing that.\n  This legislation also requires VA to build upon existing research \nframework to gain a better understanding of the long-term reproductive \nhealth care needs of veterans, from those who experience severe \nreproductive and urinary tract trauma to those who experience gender-\nspecific infections in the battlefield. A recent Army Task Force Report \nfound that women in the battlefield experience high rates of urinary \ntract infections and other women's health conditions. After a decade at \nwar, many women servicemembers are still at increased risk for women's \nhealth difficulties due to deployment conditions and a lack of \npredeployment women's health information, compounded by privacy and \nsafety concerns. Little is known about the impact that these issues and \ninjuries have on the long-term health care needs of veterans. \nAdditional research will provide critical information to help VA \nimprove services for veterans.\n  VA has come a long way in addressing the unique health needs and \nchallenges that women face. Yet for all of its recent progress, VA can \nand must do more to ensure that women veterans are receiving the care \nthat they need and deserve. Work remains to make VA a friendly \nenvironment for women veterans and veterans with families. Many women \nveterans are single mothers, making it difficult for them to take full \nadvantage of the services that VA offers. The Women Veterans and Other \nHealth Care Improvement Act creates a pilot program that provides child \ncare to veterans seeking readjustment counseling at VA's Vet Centers. \nIt also helps VA ensure that women veterans can get the information \nthat they need in order to access VA health care and benefits.\n  This is not a section by section review of all the provisions within \nthis legislation. However, I have provided an appropriate overview of \nthe major benefits of this legislation and how it would improve the \nlives of our veterans and their families. The promise that we make to \nour veterans is sacred and knows no gender. To honor our veterans, we \nmust honor this promise for each and every one of them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4303]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3313\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers led \nby Major General Gordon Granger reached Galveston, Texas to announce \nthat the Civil War had ended and that slaves had been emancipated.\n  It was a bittersweet day; the news traveled slowly, reaching \nGalveston nearly 2\\1/2\\ years after President Lincoln's Emancipation \nProclamation. But it was a joyous occasion, a triumph of freedom that \nhas been remembered since. In commemoration of that historic day, I am \ndelighted to introduce a Joint Resolution designating June 19 as \n``Juneteenth Independence Day,'' a National Day of Observance.\n  It is a day to reflect on history and to celebrate freedom. To \nremember, in the words of W. E. B. Du Bois, that ``The cost of liberty \nis less than the price of repression.''\n  This resolution offers recognition of the role that Juneteenth \nIndependence Day has played in African-American culture in Texas and \nthroughout the Southwest. Enshrining Juneteenth in our national \nconsciousness will confer the recognition it merits and serve as \ninspiration for all Americans. I am proud to be part of this bipartisan \njoint resolution to commemorate this day that reminds us that in \nAmerica, we are all blessed to live in freedom.\n  United States law provides for the declaration of selected public \nobservances by the President of the United States as designated by \nCongress or at the discretion of the President. I believe that marking \nJuneteenth Independence Day as a National Day of Observance will honor \nfreedom and liberty, something that Americans of all races, creeds, and \nethnic backgrounds can celebrate.\n  This legislation is an important reminder of that extraordinary day \nin 1865, a day that carried liberty across America. My fellow Texan \nBarbara Jordan once said, ``A nation is formed by the willingness of \neach of us to share in the responsibility for upholding the common \ngood.'' There is no plainer common good than commemorating American \nfreedom. I encourage all of my colleagues to join in cosponsoring this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/19/senate-section/article/S4304-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 496--OBSERVING THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF \n                      JUNETEENTH INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nCornyn, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \nBegich, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Warner, Mr. Webb, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. Casey, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. \nSchumer) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

ENCOURAGING LOCALLY AND REGIONALLY PRODUCED FOOD.\n\n       (a) Commodity Purchase Streamlining.--The Secretary may \n     allow a school food authority with low annual commodity \n     entitlement values, as determined by the Secretary, to \n     substitute for the allotment of the school food authority for \n     commodities commonly referred to as ``USDA Foods'' if--\n       (1) the option is requested by the eligible school food \n     authority;\n       (2) the Secretary determines that the option will reduce \n     Federal and State administrative costs; and\n       (3) the option will provide the eligible school food \n     authority with greater flexibility to purchase locally and \n     regionally produced foods.\n       (b) Farm-to-school Demonstration Projects.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish not less \n     than 10 farm-to-school demonstration programs under which \n     school food authorities, agricultural producers producing for \n     local and regional markets, and other farm-to-school \n     stakeholders collaborate with the Agricultural Marketing \n     Service to obtain food for school meals from local \n     agricultural producers rather than through other agricultural \n     and food programs of the Secretary.\n       (2) Requirements.--\n       (A) In general.--A demonstration program under this \n     subsection shall, to the maximum extent practicable--\n       (i) facilitate and increase the purchase of unprocessed and \n     minimally processed locally and regionally produced \n     agricultural commodities and products to be served in school \n     meal programs;\n       (ii) test methods to improve procurement, transportation, \n     and meal preparation processes;\n       (iii) assess whether administrative costs can be saved \n     through increased school authority flexibility to source \n     locally and regionally produced agricultural commodities and \n     foods; and\n       (iv) undertake rigorous evaluation and share information \n     about results, including cost savings, with the Department of \n     Agriculture, school food authorities, agricultural producers \n     producing for local and regional markets, and the general \n     public.\n       (B) Plans.--The Secretary shall require demonstration \n     project participants to provide plans that detail compliance \n     with this subsection.\n       (3) Duration.--The Secretary shall determine the \n     appropriate period of time for each demonstration program.\n       (4) Coordination.--The Secretary shall coordinate among \n     relevant agencies of the Department of Agriculture and \n     nongovernmental organizations with appropriate expertise to \n     facilitate the provision of training and technical assistance \n     necessary to the successful implementation of demonstration \n     programs under this subsection.\n       (5) Diversity and balance.--In establishing the \n     demonstration programs under this subsection, the Secretary \n     shall, to the maximum extent practicable, ensure--\n       (A) geographical diversity;\n       (B) that at least \\1/2\\ of the demonstration programs are \n     completed in collaboration with school food authorities with \n     relatively small annual commodity entitlements, as determined \n     by the Secretary;\n       (C) at least \\1/2\\ of demonstration programs are completed \n     in rural or tribal communities; and\n       (D) equitable treatment of school food authorities with a \n     high percentage of students participating in the free or \n     reduced price lunch program under the Richard B. Russell \n     National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2460.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3314 introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3314) to specifically authorize certain funds \n     for an intelligence or intelligence-related activity, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Vice Chairman Chambliss and I are \nintroducing a bill today to authorize funds included in the fiscal year \n2012 Defense Appropriations Act that were not previously authorized.\n  Last year, the classified annex to the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act, 2012, division A of the conference report on H.R. \n2055, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, added three funding \nlines for two separate intelligence programs. While those programs are \npart of the National Intelligence Program, these additional funds were \nplaced in a separate budgetary account, the Military Intelligence \nProgram.\n  The additional funds for these items included in the defense \nappropriations conference annex were not included in the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2012, Public Law 112 87, which \nauthorized the National Intelligence Program budget. Neither were the \nadditional funds for these items included in the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2012, Public Law 112 81, which \nauthorized the Military Intelligence Program budget.\n  This created a situation in which funds for an intelligence program \nwere appropriated but not authorized in statute. Section 504(a)(1) of \nthe National Security Act states that funds may be obligated or \nexpended for an intelligence or intelligence-related activity only if \nthose funds were specifically authorized by the Congress for such \nactivities.\n  As a result, the additional funds appropriated for these items have \nnot been specifically authorized as required by section 504 and, \ntherefore, may not be obligated or expended for these intelligence \nactivities.\n  Vice Chairman Chambliss and I have no substantive objections to \nexpending the appropriated funds for these specific programs. However, \nwe hold strongly to the principle that intelligence funds must be \nauthorized if they are to be spent--this is one of the major purposes \nof the annual intelligence authorization bills.\n  We have discussed this matter with the Director of National \nIntelligence James Clapper and the Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, \nand have agreed to seek passage of this legislation to permit them to \nspend these funds for the purposes identified in the 2012 Defense \nAppropriations Act.\n  The bill we are introducing today is very simple and quite short. It \nspecifically authorizes the increased funding for these specific items \nto the extent that they are in excess to the amounts authorized in the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012.\n  For reasons of classification, I can't describe the nature of these \nintelligence programs on the Floor. Any Member, however, is welcome to \ncome to the Intelligence Committee office and receive a briefing on the \nprograms and why the funding is important.\n  I believe this legislation is necessary as a technical correction to \npermit funds already appropriated to be obligated and expended. I \nappreciate the work and cooperation of my Vice Chairman Senator \nChambliss on this matter and hope this legislation will move quickly to \nenactment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I further ask that the bill be read three \ntimes, and the Senate proceed to a voice vote on passage of the \nmeasure.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate?\n  If not, the bill having been read the third time, the question is, \nshall the bill pass?\n  The bill (S. 3314) was passed, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4308]]\n\n                                S. 3314\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I further ask that the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelating to the measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week people all across our Nation are \nengaging in the oldest known observance of the ending of slavery--\n``Juneteenth Independence Day.'' Although passage of the 13th \nAmendment, in January 1863, legally abolished slavery, many African \nAmericans remained in servitude due to the delayed dissemination of \nthis news across the country.\n  It was in June of 1865, that the Union soldiers landed in Galveston, \nTX, with the news that the war had ended and that slavery finally had \ncome to an end in the United States. This was 2\\1/2\\ years after \nPresident Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, which was \nissued on January 1, 1863, and months after the conclusion of the Civil \nWar.\n  This week and specifically on June 19, when slaves in the Southwest \nfinally learned of the end of slavery, the descendants of slaves have \nobserved this anniversary of emancipation as a remembrance of one of \nthe most tragic periods of our Nation's history. The suffering, \ndegradation and brutality of slavery cannot be repaired, but the memory \ncan serve to ensure that no such inhumanity is ever perpetrated again \non American soil.\n  Today, I am very pleased that the Senate has unanimously adopted a \nresolution, S. Res. 496, recognizing the historical significance of \nJuneteenth Independence Day to the Nation. The resolution, which I \nsponsored along with Senators Hutchison, Cardin, Landrieu, Cornyn, \nSherrod Brown, Boxer, Stabenow, Harkin, Begich, Durbin, Wicker, Leahy, \nBill Nelson, Casey, Warner, Akaka, Webb, and Lautenberg, expresses \nsupport for the observance of Juneteenth Independence Day, and \nrecognizes the faith and strength of character demonstrated by former \nslaves, that remains an example for all people of the United States, \nregardless of background or race.\n  All across America we also celebrate the many important achievements \nof former slaves and their descendants. We do so because in 1926, Dr. \nCarter G. Woodson, son of former slaves, proposed such a recognition as \na way of preserving the history of African Americans and recognizing \nthe enormous contributions of a people of great strength, dignity, \nfaith, and conviction--a people who rendered their achievements for the \nbetterment and advancement of a Nation once lacking in humanity towards \nthem. Every February, nationwide, we celebrate African American History \nMonth. And, every year on June 19, we celebrate Juneteenth Independence \nDay.\n  Lerone Bennett, Jr., writer, scholar, lecturer, and acclaimed \nexecutive editor for several decades at Ebony magazine, has reflected \non the life and times of Dr. Woodson. Bennett tells us that one of the \nmost inspiring and instructive stories in African American history is \nthe story of Woodson's struggle and rise from the coal mines of West \nVirginia to the summit of academic achievement:\n\n       At 17, the young man who was called by history to reveal \n     Black history was an untutored coal miner. At 19, after \n     teaching himself the fundamentals of English and arithmetic, \n     he entered high school and mastered the four-year curriculum \n     in less than two years. At 22, after two-thirds of a year at \n     Berea College [in Kentucky], he returned to the coal mines \n     and studied Latin and Greek between trips to the mine shafts. \n     He then went on to the University of Chicago, where he \n     received his bachelor's and master's degrees, and Harvard \n     University, where he became the second Black to receive a \n     doctorate in history. The rest is history--Black history.\n\n  In keeping with the spirit and the vision of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, I \nwould like to pay tribute to two courageous women, claimed by my home \nState of Michigan, who played significant roles in addressing American \ninjustice and inequality. These are two women of different times who \nwould change the course of history.\n  The contributions of Sojourner Truth, who helped lead our country out \nof the dark days of slavery, and Rosa Parks whose dignified leadership \nsparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the start of the civil rights \nmovement, are indelibly etched in the chronicle of the history of this \nNation. Moreover, they are viewed with distinction and admiration \nthroughout the world.\n  Sojourner Truth, though unable to read or write, was considered one \nof the most eloquent and noted spokespersons of her day on the \ninhumanity and immorality of slavery. She was a leader in the \nabolitionist movement, and a groundbreaking speaker on behalf of \nequality for women. Michigan has honored her with the dedication of the \nSojourner Truth Memorial monument, which was unveiled in Battle Creek, \nMI, on September 25, 1999. In April 2009,\n\n[[Page S4309]]\n\nSojourner Truth became the first African American woman to be \nmemorialized with a bust in the U.S. Capitol. The ceremony to unveil \nTruth's likeness was appropriately held in Emancipation Hall at the \nCapitol Visitor's Center. I was pleased to cosponsor the legislation to \nmake this fitting tribute possible. Sojourner Truth lived in \nWashington, DC for several years, helping slaves who had fled from the \nSouth and appearing at women's suffrage gatherings. She returned to \nBattle Creek in 1875, and remained there until her death in 1883. \nSojourner Truth spoke from her heart about the most troubling issues of \nher time. A testament to Truth's convictions is that her words continue \nto speak to us today.\n  On May 4, 1999, legislation was enacted which authorized the \nPresident of the United States to award the Congressional Gold Medal to \nRosa Parks. I was pleased to coauthor this tribute to Rosa Parks--the \ngentle warrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate the \nhumiliation and demoralization of racial segregation on a bus. I was \nalso pleased to be a part of the effort to direct the Architect of the \nCapitol to commission a statue of Rosa Parks, which will soon be placed \nin the U.S. Capitol, making her the second African American woman to \nreceive such an honor.\n  Her personal bravery and self-sacrifice are remembered with reverence \nand respect by us all. Over 55 years ago, in Montgomery, AL, the modern \ncivil rights movement began when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat \nand move to the back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this \ncourageous woman captured the consciousness of not only the American \npeople, but the entire world. The boycott which Rosa Parks began was \nthe start of an American revolution that elevated the status of African \nAmericans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader who \nwould one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the \nReverend Martin Luther King, Jr. In addition, the overwhelming majority \nof my colleagues in the Senate joined me in sponsoring legislation \nauthorizing the Congressional Gold Medal to be presented to Dr. King, \nposthumously, and Coretta Scott King in recognition of their \ncontributions to the Nation. Companion legislation was led in the House \nby Representative John Lewis.\n  We have come a long way toward achieving justice and equality for \nall. We still however have work to do. In the names of Rosa Parks, \nSojourner Truth, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \nand many others, let us rededicate ourselves to continuing the struggle \nof civil rights and human rights.\n  I am also pleased to join Senator Hutchison and other members of the \nSenate in sponsoring another measure introduced today in recognition of \nJuneteenth Independence Day, which will require further action in the \nSenate. It is a Joint Resolution requesting the President to issue a \nproclamation each year designating Juneteenth Independence Day as a \nNational Day of Observance, encouraging Americans of all races, creeds, \nand ethnic backgrounds to celebrate freedom and the end of slavery in \nthe United States.\n  In closing, I would like to pay tribute to the Juneteenth directors \nand event coordinators throughout my State of Michigan. They have \nworked tirelessly in the planning of intergenerational activities in \nobservance of Juneteenth, heading up a wide range of activities over \nseveral days in Detroit, Flint, Holland, Lansing, Saginaw, and other \nareas around the State.\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am in support of this resolution \nwith Senator Boxer congratulating the Los Angeles Kings on their 2012 \nStanley Cup Championship. I would like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the players, staff, and fans for obtaining professional \nhockey's ultimate prize.\n  The Los Angeles Kings have won the Stanley Cup for the first time in \nthe 45-year history of their franchise. Since 1967 the Kings have \nproudly represented the Los Angeles community with unwavering \ncommitment. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I stand today to congratulate the 2011 \n2012 National Hockey League champions, the Los Angeles Kings. This past \nseason the Kings demonstrated remarkable skill, teamwork, and \ndetermination in capturing the franchise's first Stanley Cup.\n  Thanks to an outstanding roster of seasoned veterans and promising \nyoung players, the Kings hoisted the Stanley Cup for the first time in \nthe 45-year history of the franchise. On their historic run, the Kings \nbecame the first No. 8 seed to win the NHL championship. On their way \nto the finals, the Kings knocked off the first seed Vancouver Canucks, \nthe No. 2 seed St. Louis Blues, and the No. 3 seed Phoenix Coyotes \nbefore capturing the Western Conference title. Despite their low seed, \nthe Kings were dominant in each of their series, taking a 3-to-0 lead \nin each and never facing an elimination game.\n  The Kings continued their dominance in the finals against the New \nJersey Devils by once again taking a three-games-to-none lead in the \nseries. The Devils were able to stay alive in games 4 and 5 to force \nthe series to go to six games. However, in game six the Kings once \nagain showed their prowess winning by a score of 6 to 1 and cementing \ntheir first championship.\n  Throughout the season, the Kings were a model of hard work, \ndedication, and consistency. It is my pleasure to congratulate all \nmembers of the Kings organization who worked tirelessly to bring this \nhard fought victory to Los Angeles. As the Los Angeles Kings and their \nfans celebrate their first Stanley Cup victory, I commend them on a \ntruly remarkable and memorable season and wish them more success in \nfuture seasons.\n\n                              S.
