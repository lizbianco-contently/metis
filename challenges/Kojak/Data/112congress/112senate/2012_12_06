Mr. President, we Democrats have been saying for more than \n4 months it is time for the House to pass a middle-class tax cut, which \nwe approved here in the Senate in July. As the days until the country \ngoes over the fiscal cliff tick by, more and more Republicans have \njoined our chorus. They realize the Republican leaders' unwillingness \nto compromise sooner has put them in a real bind. So reasonable \nRepublicans are asking their House leadership to allow a vote on the \nSenate-passed legislation. What was once a trickle has become more of a \nflood.\n  Last week, Republican Representative Tom Cole said it was time to \ngive middle-class families certainty that taxes won't go up by $2,200, \non average, on January 1.\n  Then Tim Scott, Republican, a conservative Republican from South \nCarolina, admitted the Senate's middle-class tax cut would surely pass \nthe House since it will take only 26 moderate Republican votes to \nensure passage.\n  I don't agree with columnist David Brooks--on occasion I don't agree \nwith him, perhaps most of the time I don't agree with him--but no one \ncan ever dispute the brilliance in writing of this columnist for the \nNew York Times. He is a great journalist. He writes so well\n\n[[Page S7644]]\n\nand explains things so well. I have great admiration for him.\n  He wrote yesterday, ``Republicans have to realize that they are going \nto have to cave on tax rates.'' That is the way it is, ``they are going \nto have to cave on tax rates.''\n  Then on Tuesday, the day before yesterday, the senior Senator from \nMaine, Olympia Snowe, urged House Republican leaders to end the \nsuspense for middle-class taxpayers. They shouldn't have to wonder, \nSenator Snowe said, whether ``we will ultimately raise taxes on low- to \nmiddle-income people.'' I assure them, we won't raise taxes on the \nmiddle class and the poor. That is what Olympia Snowe said.\n  On Wednesday, Senator Susan Collins joined her colleague from Maine, \nagreeing the idea of ending the suspense for the middle class ``has \nmerit.''\n  Yesterday it seemed every practical Republican left in Washington was \nsuddenly willing to say out loud what we have known for weeks: The only \nremaining option is for the House to pass the Senate bill. Dozens of \nHouse Republicans signed onto a letter urging Speaker Boehner to take \nthe last exit before the cliff.\n  Neither President Obama nor Democrats in Congress have been ambiguous \nabout our proposal to provide economic security for 98 percent of \nAmerican families and 97 percent of small businesses, while asking the \nwealthiest 2 percent to contribute a little more to stop this runaway \ndebt.\n  Now even a dyed-in-the-wool conservative such as Senator Coburn from \nOklahoma has endorsed the Democratic approach. Here is what he said:\n\n       I know we have to raise revenue. I would rather see the \n     rates go up than eliminate tax credits and deductions that \n     benefit the middle class.\n\n  He has been heavily involved in everything that has happened the last \nseveral years in Washington dealing with what to do with the debt. When \nhe joins in, that is significant, so it is apparent how this will end. \nThe only question is when will it end. How long will Speaker Boehner \nmake middle-class families wait for relief, and how long will he force \nthe financial markets to wait for certainty? The longer he delays, the \ngreater the risk to our economy.\n  So, John Boehner, who is my friend, I urge you, you don't have to \nlisten to me. Listen to your own caucus. Listen to prudent members of \nyour own party and around the country. We can argue whether to give \nmore unnecessary tax breaks to the wealthy tomorrow. We can discuss \nresponsible ways to reduce our deficit next week. We can reform our Tax \nCode next year, but we must give economic certainty to the middle class \nnow, today. Democrats agree, Independents agree, the majority of \nRepublicans agree, and the American public agrees by a huge margin. \nEven dozens of CEOs from major corporations, whose personal taxes would \ngo up under our plan, emphatically agree. I have been saying for weeks \nthe only people who aren't on board are the Republicans in Congress, \nbut now even they are crying out for compromise. I only hope my friend \nJohn Boehner is listening.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Yesterday afternoon I came to the floor and offered \nPresident Obama's proposal on the fiscal cliff to show that neither he \nnor Democrats in Congress are acting in good faith in these \nnegotiations.\n  With just a few weeks to go before a potentially devastating and \nentirely avoidable blow to the economy, the President proposed a plan \nthat members of his own party won't even vote for. So I think it is \nsafe to say at this point that the President actually isn't interested \nin a balanced agreement, he is not particularly interested in avoiding \nthe fiscal cliff, and he is clearly not interested at all in cutting \nany spending.\n  What the President is interested in, as we learned yesterday, is \ngetting as much taxpayer money as he can, first by raising taxes on \nsmall businesses that he believes are making too much money, and then \non everybody else. This is not so he can lower the debt or the deficit \nbut so he can spend to his heart's content. For months the President \nhas been saying all he wants is to raise taxes on the top 2 percent so \nhe can tackle the debt and the deficit.\n  However, yesterday he finally revealed that is not his true intent. \nBy demanding the power to raise the debt limit whenever he wants by as \nmuch as he wants, he showed what he is after is assuming unprecedented \npower to spend their dollars without any limit at all.\n  This isn't about getting a handle on deficits or debt for him. It is \nabout spending even more than he already has. Why else would he demand \nthe power to raise the debt limit on his own? And by the way, why on \nEarth would we ever consider giving a President who has brought us 4 \nyears of trillion-dollar unchecked deficits the authority to borrow? He \nis the last person who should have limitless borrowing power.\n  Look, the only way we ever cut spending around here is by using the \ndebate over the debt limit to do it. Now the President wants to remove \nthat spur to cut altogether. Of course, it gets in the way of his \nspending plans. Well, I assure you it is not going to happen. The \nAmerican people want Washington to get spending under control, and the \ndebt limit is the best tool we have to make the President take that \ndemand seriously. The American people want us to fight to cut spending. \nIt is a fight they deserve and a fight we are happy to have.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. President, I indicated to the majority leader that I was going to \npropound the following consent. I am prepared to ask for consent to \nallow the Senate to vote on the President's debt limit proposal. I \nwould ask this either as an amendment to the Russia PNTR measure we \nwill vote on this afternoon or as a freestanding bill, if that is \npreferred. Therefore, I now ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nto vote on an amendment, which is the President's debt limit extension \nproposal that I just described, prior to the passage of the Russia PNTR \nbill today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I have been thinking how \nbest to describe what has been going on here on Capitol Hill the last \ncouple of weeks.\n  Every morning I get up, the first thing I read is the sports page. I \nam disappointed in the sports page from the Washington Post. It is not \nnearly as good as it used to be, and the New York Times is not very \ngood either, but I read them. There is always some good news on the \nsports page. Then I go to the front page to get some of the bad news. I \nfollow sports no matter what it is--basketball, football, baseball, \nwhatever it is--and I have watched very closely.\n  It is not one of my favorite teams, but it is really fun to watch the \nNew York Jets. Coach Ryan has a problem. He has three quarterbacks: \nSanchez, Tim Tebow, and he has a guy by the name of McElroy. He can't \ndecide who their quarterback is going to be. That is the same problem \nthe Republicans are having. Romney is gone, but he is still in the \nbackground. We have McConnell and we have Boehner. Who is the \nquarterback, Mr. President? Who is the quarterback?\n  My friend talks about the trillions of dollars of debt. We just had \nan election. The people overwhelmingly know why we have this debt. The \npolling right before the election showed that the vast majority of the \nAmerican people realized the debt was caused by George Bush. That is a \nfact.\n  We will have another jobs report out tomorrow. We had a little \nproblem because of what happened with Hurricane\n\n[[Page S7645]]\n\nSandy, but we still have created about 100,000 new jobs. Private sector \njob growth has been significant. We are approaching--let's see, it must \nbe about 4 million jobs now that have been created. That doesn't nearly \nmake up for what was lost during the Bush years, but we are making \nprogress.\n  People in America realize we can no longer have the top-down economy \nthe Republicans so loved during the Bush years and what they wanted to \ncreate again with Governor Romney.\n  I would be happy to take a look at the proposal my friend the \nRepublican leader has shown us if we could come up with something like \nwe did when they created this other furor by refusing to increase the \ndebt, where we had an ability to come here and have a couple of votes \nto determine if we were going to increase it. If that is what they want \nto do again, I would be happy to seriously take a look at that and \nreport to the White House and my caucus, but until then I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my friend indicates that there is some \nconfusion about who the quarterback is on the Republican side. Of \ncourse, that is quite common when you don't have a White House. But \nthere is no doubt about who the quarterback is on the Democratic side. \nThe quarterback on the Democratic side is the President of the United \nStates. Unfortunately, he keeps throwing interceptions, and we are \nmoving backward and backward and backward away from the goal line. We \nhave $4 trillion in annual deficits, and my friend from Nevada still \nwants to blame that on George Bush? And now the President is asking for \nunlimited--unlimited--authority to borrow whenever he wants to for \nwhatever amount he wants? If the majority leader supports that \nproposal, I would hope we could work together and get a vote on it to \ngive his Members a chance to express themselves as to whether they \nthink that is a good way forward for our country--to give this \nPresident or any other President unlimited authority to borrow as much \nas he wants at any time he wants from the Chinese or anybody else. That \nis the question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, of course, as I said, I will be happy to \nlook at the proposal by my friend, but the President doesn't want to do \nanything other than what we have done before, and that is where we are \nnow, and that is why I would be happy to take a look at his proposal, \nbecause if it is what we did last summer, I would be happy to take a \nlook at that and move forward.\n  Mr. President, it is not only we Democrats, but we have a long line \nof Republicans who, as I outlined early on, are recognizing that we \nneed to immediately make sure the middle class and the poor are taken \ncare of without their taxes being increased. We have Representatives \nCole, Scott; David Brooks, a columnist from the New York Times; \nSenators Snowe, Collins, and Coburn; and a long list of Republicans \nsaying let's move on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7645-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to associate \nmyself with the majority leader's remarks. We do need to extend the tax \ncuts for the middle class as soon as possible. That is clearly the \nmessage the American people sent on November 6 in the nationwide \nelection we held.\n  I also wish to respond to the comments and the conversation between \nthe two leaders over the debt ceiling limit. It is important to \nrecognize that when we raise the debt ceiling, all we are doing is \nkeeping faith with what Congress has already appropriated, what \nCongress has already made clear we would spend on behalf of our country \nin all the various ways the Federal Government operates. We cannot \nafford to have a situation such as we had August before last where we \ndallied and literally shot our economy and ourselves in the foot by not \nextending the debt ceiling. We saw the rating agencies lower our \nnational rating for the first time in history. There is a way to do \nthis, to have a mechanism in place so we never again get in a situation \nwhere the debt ceiling becomes a point of contention and literally \nhurts our economy.\n  So, again, I want to say that the majority leader is on track. Let's \nextend these middle-class tax cuts right now and bring some certainty \nand help our economy grow. The majority leader is on point when he \nshared the numbers. I think we have seen about 5 million jobs created \nafter approaching literally the great recession when President Obama \nfirst took office. So let's get that job done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7645-4", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7645-S7646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WIND PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I have come to the floor this \nmorning, as I have for many mornings, to talk about the wind energy \nindustry and the importance of tax credits. And this is another job I \nwant to see us get done as soon as possible--to extend the wind \nproduction tax credit. It expires in less than a month.\n  This tax credit has been vital for job creation and for our American \nmanufacturing. Literally, the PTC--the production tax credit--has \nencouraged the creation of tens of thousands of good-paying middle-\nclass jobs, and it has led to millions in capital investment in States \nsuch as Colorado. In fact, 48 States have a wind energy industry \npresence. Along with the capital investments, what we have seen is the \ndevelopment of thousands of megawatts of clean renewable wind power. \nAnd if we let this PTC expire, the stakes are very high.\n  I have come to the floor 24 times to speak to the importance of the \nPTC and the benefits it provides for families and businesses in every \nState across the Nation. I am here because the wind PTC is a critical \ninvestment in and a downpayment toward a clean energy future--a future \nat risk if we don't act and act soon. It is not too late to act. It \ntruly isn't. And to give us more motivation, to point out what is at \nrisk, I wish to focus today on the State of Minnesota and direct my \nremarks to their wind energy industry.\n  Minnesota, as we know, is the Land of 10,000 Lakes. Although \nMinnesota's namesake may be its water, it has become a leader in the \nwind energy industry and a compelling example of the positive effects \nthe PTC can have in a State. Let me share some numbers to make the \npoint.\n  As of 2011, Minnesota ranks fifth nationally for the most installed \nwind capacity, with over 2,700 megawatts, and it trails only Illinois, \nIowa, California, and Texas. You can see all the blue areas on the map. \nThose are areas in which there is installed wind operations. In fact, \nwind energy meets 12.7--I will round that up to 13 percent of the \nState's energy needs. This ranks fourth among all States. That means \nthey are powering through the wind energy industry the equivalent of \n770,000 Minnesota homes, and that number is going up. It is growing.\n  We know through our two colleagues from Minnesota that Minnesotans \ntake pride in everything having to do with Minnesota, and well they \nshould. And they are taking pride in being in the forefront of wind \npower growth. Since 2003 Minnesotans have purchased 1 billion kilowatt \nhours of energy through Windsource, which is Minnesota's voluntary \ngreen power program. It means over 20,000 residents and about 240 \nbusinesses pay a little extra on their electric bill to support wind \nenergy and show their commitment to a clean energy economy. I know this \nworks because we have a similar program in Colorado. Excel also has a \npresence in Colorado, and they offer Windsource to Coloradans.\n  Now, Minnesota's prominence as a wind power State has been aided by \nthe fact that it also has a successful wind manufacturing industry, and \nthose manufacturing facilities in Minnesota have created hundreds of \ngood-paying jobs and new investments. Federal incentives, including the \nPTC, have\n\n[[Page S7646]]\n\nplayed a crucial role in making Minnesota the wind leader it is today.\n  If that isn't enough, I want to highlight further the substantial \nbenefits this crucial industry has had on Minnesota.\n  No. 1, the wind industry accounts for 3,000 good-paying jobs for \nhard-working Minnesotans, including jobs at the State's 16 wind \nmanufacturing facilities. You can see all these green circles, and \nthose green circles are where those manufacturing facilities are \nlocated. The workers at these plants and the facilities themselves help \nsupply and maintain wind projects that contribute $7.6 million annually \nin property taxes. Those projects, in fact, provide local communities \nwith funds to help improve schools, roads, and all the other crucial \nservices local governments provide.\n  Furthermore, Minnesota's strong manufacturing industry has supported \nrapid growth in the wind capacity of the State. Let me share those \nnumbers with you. In 2011 the State added 542 megawatts of wind power \ncapacity, the fourth-most of any State. So extending the PTC is crucial \nto continuing Minnesota's growth in wind energy and making progress \ntoward a clean energy economy. In fact, the Minnesota utility, Northern \nStates Power, will have close to 1,900 megawatts of wind in their \nenergy portfolio by the end of 2012. And listen to this: In 2011 the \nutility got more electricity from wind than it did from natural gas.\n  I know many of us understand what the future could hold, based on \nwhat experts are telling us, and we know that wind and natural gas will \nbe partners going forward.\n  There is a synergy between wind and natural gas. This stands out as \nan important milestone for Northern States Power. This company's \ninvestment in wind energy has helped reduce carbon dioxide emissions by \nan estimated 3.1 million tons. So the leadership of companies such as \nNorthern States Power demonstrates that when we invest in clean energy, \nwe are creating jobs and strengthening our energy security at the same \ntime.\n  I want to close with a couple of comments more broadly. Minnesota is \nnot alone in its success, but these gains and the thousands of jobs \nthat the PTC supports are at risk if we don't act. During the summer \nand the fall work period, we saw the effects of not extending the \nproduction tax credit. Companies such as Vestas in Colorado announced \nlayoffs and pulled back capital investments.\n  It is pretty simple. Production tax credit equals jobs. We need to \npass it as soon as possible. Enough is enough. If we don't extend it, \nwe are going to see a very significant continuation of these job \nlosses.\n  So let's find a way forward. Let's work together. Let's extend the \nPTC. The longer this extension is delayed, the quicker success stories \nfrom States such as Colorado and Minnesota could disappear. We simply \ncannot let this happen. Let's extend the PTC as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7646-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7646-S7647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              RUSSIA PNTR\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is considering a \ncritical bill this week to establish permanent normal trade relations \nwith Russia. I should have borrowed my friend's sign that says ``PTC \nCreates Jobs,'' which may very well be an accurate equation, but PNTR \nalso will equal jobs. We can compete given the opportunity to compete, \nand that is what these trade relationships are all about. This \nlegislation overwhelmingly has passed the House. It is going to have \nstrong bipartisan support in the Senate, and I believe it will pass \ntoday and needs to pass today.\n  Russia joined the World Trade Organization in August of 2012. Since \nthat time, our exporters--U.S. companies--have not been able to take \nfull advantage of the fact that they have this new way to get to the \nRussian market because we haven't granted permanent normal trade \nrelationships to Russia.\n  Since all the other major WTO members already have that permanent \nrelationship, they have had a real advantage since August of last year, \nas they can move forward immediately and compete and make agreements \nthat American companies can't make. American companies are the only \ncompanies losing market share after Russia joined the World Trade \nOrganization--and not because they are not as competitive. But until we \ndo what we need to do here today, they will be working at a real \ndisadvantage.\n  In addition to securing a level playing field for American companies, \nwe also need to replace the Jackson-Vanik policy with something that, \nfrankly, has now more real-world potential and real-world \nunderstanding. Russia is clearly not the Russia of Soviet days, but we \nstill have reasons to be concerned about individual freedom of \nexpression in Russia. We need to express that concern. That is why I am \nin support of a portion of this bill that Senator Cardin and Senator \nKyl have fought for during this whole discussion and now have in this \nbill, in the House bill--the portion where we look at the terrible \ntreatment and ultimate death of Sergei Magnitsky.\n  This provision will ensure that those who were complicit in those \nactivities and in his ill-treatment and death don't get a free pass. It \nsends messages to other countries that while we want to trade with \nthem, we also want to continue to speak strongly for the rights of \nindividuals, no matter where they are, to speak up against their \ngovernment.\n  Normalizing trade relations with Russia is also an important move to \nmy State and, I assume, all our States. I know in Missouri we exported \n$86 million to Russia in 2011, and exports are up 6 percent already \nfrom that year since we started 2012. Worldwide, Missouri exports more \nthan $12.3 billion in goods and services--or at least we did in 2010--\nand almost half of that was exported to countries where we have free-\ntrade agreements. We need to continue to do that. Nearly 300 Missouri \ncompanies supported 32,000 jobs that were driven by exports. So 32,000 \npeople in Missouri have jobs because of trade, and a lot of that trade \nis in our hemisphere.\n  I want to come back to that in a minute. I am concerned on the \nRussian agreement that Russia has failed to agree to bring its animal \nhealth and food safety measures in line with the WTO agreement on the \napplication of sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures, called the SPS \nagreement. I am going to continue to monitor this situation to ensure \nthat American agricultural exports--and pork would be a good example of \nthis--don't face market access barriers in Russia.\n  Free trade has to be fair trade. Free trade doesn't work if it is not \nfair trade. If it is fair trade and free trade, American workers and \nAmerican companies can and do actively and positively compete all over \nthe world. In fact, we have a little bit of trade imbalance these days, \nand I think we should be concerned that 57 percent of it is in energy. \nIf we become more energy self-sufficient, we could easily reduce our \ntrade imbalance by 50 percent. If we just got North American energy as \nour focus for energy, we could only be more secure, and we would also \nhave a better trade relationship.\n  This legislation we are dealing with today, the Russia PNTR, builds \non the progress we made last year with the passage of the three free-\ntrade amendments. Many of us on this side worked closely with our \nfriends on the other side and the White House to get these long \nnegotiated deals passed. In the 6 months since our free-trade agreement \nwith South Korea took effect, trade between our two countries has \nincreased by over $30 billion--a $30 billion increase in 6 months.\n  As we are trying to figure how to grow our economy, the export world \nand free trade is one of the places we can have the most speedy \napplication of what we do to grow our economy. Thirty billion dollars \nin Korea alone.\n  American exports to Columbia have increased 20 percent since that \nfree-trade agreement took effect. The ratification of the Panama Free \nTrade Agreement just went into effect a few weeks ago, but that enables \nAmerican firms to fully participate in the economic opportunities that \nwill occur with the expansion of the Panama Canal and the continued \ngrowth of that economy. What happens there is critical to us.\n\n  This agreement, I have said already, has passed the House and I think \nit will pass the Senate today. There are other\n\n[[Page S7647]]\n\nthings we can and should do. We need to work with the President, and \nthe President should be working with Republicans and Democrats who are \nfriends of trade to do several things. One would be trade promotion \nauthority. We used to call this fast track. This is where the \nadministration can negotiate an agreement, and then the House and \nSenate either vote yes or no on that agreement. It is the only way to \nget agreements done in the world we live in today.\n  Right now, the administration has no realistic way of passing trade \nagreements through the Congress. The President needs to work with \nCongress so that we will give him the authority. He needs to ask for \nit, and he needs to want it so we can have these agreements. This gives \nour trading partners the confidence they need to make the concessions \nthat you make in negotiation and know that the agreement is going to be \nthe agreement. It is either going to be that agreement or no agreement \nat all.\n  Since the TPA lapsed in 2006, we haven't negotiated a single new \nfree-trade agreement. If that doesn't tell us how important it is that \nwe move back to a way to get these agreements done, I don't know what \nwould.\n  Second, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. These negotiations seem to me \nto be languishing right now and need senior administration attention in \norder to gather the steam they need. A strong Trans-Pacific Partnership \nis the most effective way to consolidate our leadership in that part of \nthe world.\n  At a time when China is aggressively moving into east Asia, we also \nneed to look at the Philippines. Senator Inouye and I have a bill that \nwould strengthen our relationship with the Philippines called the SAVE \nAct. I would like to see the administration work with the two of us to \nsee what we could get done to have that relationship that has been so \nstrong and has lasted so long become even closer as we figure out how \nto trade with that economy in a way that makes them more stable and \ncloser friends of the United States. Frankly, we will benefit, our \nworkforce will benefit from that agreement.\n  There is a Trans-Atlantic Free Trade Agreement that puts us in a \nbetter situation to trade with the European Union. This should be one \nof the easiest agreements we have ever done because we have two mature \neconomies trying to trade with each other. The normal negotiations \nabout labor and environment and other things that sometimes take so \nlong in these agreements, frankly, shouldn't take long. The Presiding \nOfficer has spent a lot of time with our NATO partners, and they would \nbe the same partners that would be our EU trading partners if we will \nmove forward there.\n  Finally, we need fresh trade policies with the Americas. We now have \ntrade agreements with six countries that were part of the Dominican \nRepublic CAFTA agreement with Mexico, Canada, Panama, Colombia, Chile, \nand Peru, and we have a trading preferences agreement with Haiti. But \nwe really need to look to see what we can do to trade in this \nhemisphere, improve our economic relationship with the South American \ngiant country and giant economy of Brazil.\n  Your best trading partners should be your neighbors. Certainly, \nCanada and Mexico have proved that. When we send Canada $1, they \ntraditionally send us back somewhere in the neighborhood of $1. Right \nnow it is about 91 cents. In our trade with Mexico, Mexico now sends us \nback, a year ago probably--and this number continues to grow--75 cents. \nThat is why on the energy front, when we deal with them, it makes a \ndifference. So they have proven that your neighbors should be your best \ntrading partners.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. We need to expand the economic partnerships to our \nneighborhood. The Western Hemisphere needs more attention. Trade makes \nsense for America. Trade creates jobs. Trade creates opportunity. I am \nglad we are voting on this trade agreement today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7647-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7647-S7652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n\n                             Olympia Snowe\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, many of our colleagues will be leaving us \nat the end of this Congress, and I wish to take time this morning to \npay tribute to some of my colleagues, particularly those with whom I \nhave worked most closely. Of course, I must start with my colleague and \nfriend from Maine, Olympia Snowe.\n  In ancient Sparta, there was a saying that roughly translated as \nthis: It seems all the world knows what is the right thing to do, but \nit is only the Spartans who will do anything about it.\n  As my friend, colleague, and senior Senator from Maine, Olympia \nSnowe, ends her service in the Senate, I rise to pay tribute to this \ndescendent of that legendary civilization. Olympia is a true leader who \nhas always devoted her considerable intellect, energy, and commitment \nto doing what was right for Maine and for America. Olympia Snowe has \ndedicated her life to public service: 18 years in the Senate, preceded \nby 16 representing Maine's Second Congressional District, plus 5 in the \nMaine legislature adds up to a remarkable record of commitment to our \nNation and the great State of Maine.\n\n  But that span of nearly four decades tells us only part of the story, \nfor Olympia has truly set the gold standard for public service. From \nthe State house to the U.S. Capitol, Olympia has built an outstanding \nreputation as an informed, thoughtful, and effective legislator. She \ncan always be counted on as a leader with integrity who pursued \nsolutions and who had no interest in just scoring partisan political \npoints. It is Olympia's character that has made all the difference.\n  The private acts of public figures can tell us a lot about their \ncharacter, so I wish to share with my colleagues this morning a story \nabout Olympia Snowe that I witnessed personally. There was a Republican \nfundraiser going on one night and I was arriving late, driving up in a \ncar. People were streaming out of the fundraiser and each of them was \npassing by a man who was on crutches, with only one leg, clearly \ndestitute, clearly down on his luck, who was asking for money. \nEverybody but Olympia Snowe passed him by without a word, as if he were \ninvisible. Olympia went over to this destitute man on crutches, with \none leg, and she not only handed him some money but she took the time \nto talk with him. I think that tells us so much about who Olympia Snowe \nis--her kindness to this individual, when everyone else was passing him \nby, her kindness to him when no one was watching, her kindness to him \nwas a private act that told all of us so much about her character.\n  With her retirement from the Senate, Olympia Snowe will join the \npantheon of great leaders our State has produced: Margaret Chase Smith, \nEd Muskie, George Mitchell, and Bill Cohen. All of them, similar to \nOlympia, exemplify the principle that public office is a sacred trust.\n  Olympia's inspiring record of service is but part of an even more \ninspiring life story. Several times, from childhood on, Olympia has \nbeen visited by tragedy that would have caused most people to become \ndiscouraged, disheartened, and negative. But each time Olympia rose, \ntranscended her personal tragedy, and was more determined than before \nto succeed and to contribute to a better life for others. Her well-\ndeserved popularity among Maine people transcends party lines and is \ntestament to her strength and her spirit.\n  The people of Maine and America are grateful for her many years of \nservice. I am grateful for her leadership and her friendship. I know \nOlympia Snowe will continue to influence national policy for many years \nto come.\n\n\n                             Joe Lieberman\n\n  Mr. President, we have a tradition in the Senate of referring to our \ncolleagues on the Senate floor during debate as ``my friend from this \nState'' or ``my friend from that State,'' and oftentimes the word \nfriend just means colleague. But there is a fellow Senator whom I call \nfriend in the truest sense of the word. That person is the senior \nSenator from Connecticut, my dear friend Senator Joe Lieberman.\n\n[[Page S7648]]\n\n  When Joe Lieberman announced earlier last year that he would not seek \nreelection to the Senate, he called himself a lucky guy for having had \nthe opportunity to serve his State and his country. I would contend it \nis we in this Chamber and the people throughout Connecticut and across \nour Nation who are the ones who are truly fortunate for Joe Lieberman's \nlifelong commitment to public service, including his 24 years in the \nSenate.\n  For more than a decade, it has been my privilege to serve with Joe as \nthe leaders of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. Regardless of who has been chairman and who has been ranking \nmember, ours has been a partnership. Indeed, I will never forget when I \nwas losing the chairmanship because of the change in control, Joe \nleaning over to me and saying: Don't worry, Susan, all that will change \nis that you will pass me the gavel.\n  It was typical of his thoughtfulness and generosity, and it is not \ncoincidental that ours is the only committee in the Senate where we do \nnot sit with Republicans on one side and Democrats on the other but \ninstead are interspersed because we recognize, given our important \nmandate, that we must work together in a bipartisan and, indeed, a \nnonpartisan way.\n  During the time Joe has been the chairman and that we have worked \ntogether, the committee has established a well-deserved reputation for \nbipartisanship, for thoroughness, and--most important--for getting \nthings done. I know the American people have been so frustrated with \nthe gridlock that has prevented action on so many issues facing our \nNation. For the most part, we do not see that kind of stalemate on our \ncommittee and that is a tribute to the leadership of Joe Lieberman. \nThat reputation for our committee--of accomplishment and \nbipartisanship--is the work of many hands, but Joe Lieberman's \nfingerprints are all over it. Joe has always based his leadership on \nhis unwavering belief that the great challenges America faces--such as \ncombating terrorism, putting our fiscal house in order, and defending \nfreedom--transcend party lines.\n  The success our committee has achieved in helping to safeguard our \nNation is the result of that nonpartisan--some might say independent--\nspirit that guides him. Those successes are many, from the landmark \nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act to providing the tools \nthat strengthen our first responders, to our extensive investigations \ninto the flawed response to Hurricane Katrina, the fatal communication \nfailures in the Fort Hood terrorism case, and our current scrutiny of \nthe attacks in Benghazi, Joe Lieberman has always put country first. \nHis actions are guided by deeply held principles and aim toward \nprogress. He has demonstrated his willingness, time and again, to risk \nhis political career to do what he believes is right for America.\n  Joe brings the same dedication to everything he does. Working with \nhim on the Armed Services Committee, I know firsthand how devoted he is \nto our men and women in uniform and the deep respect he has for their \nservice and their sacrifice. His leadership in bringing about the \nrepeal of the discriminatory don't ask, don't tell law was nothing \nshort of extraordinary, and it gives me great personal pride to have \nassisted him in achieving that important victory for justice. It was \nvintage Joe Lieberman. He did what was right. He never gave up. He got \nthe job done.\n  Throughout his many years of dedicated service, Joe has demonstrated \nthe kind of character America needs and the American people deserve. It \nis not by coincidence that the PowerPoint slide show I present to \nstudents throughout Maine includes a photograph of Senator Joe \nLieberman at work. The young pupils of today who will be the leaders of \ntomorrow could have no better role model than this leader of \nintelligence and integrity.\n  A wonderful fringe benefit of working so closely with Joe for so many \nyears has been the opportunity I have had to get to know his wonderful \nwife Hadassah. She is a person who also demonstrates remarkable \nstrength and compassion. Her devotion to community service spans a \nrange of issues, from advocating for women's health and breast cancer \nresearch to providing women with opportunity through microfinance \nprograms.\n  The integrity and decency Joe brings to public service stands on the \nunshakable foundation of his deep faith. It is telling that his \nretirement announcement included these wise words from Ecclesiastes: \n``To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under \nheaven.''\n  In closing, I offer my dear friend this traditional Jewish blessing: \n``May you live 120 years.''\n  While none of us expects to attain the longevity achieved by the \nprophet Moses, I am confident the gratitude of the American people for \nthe service of Senator Joe Lieberman will be everlasting.\n\n\n                                Jon Kyl\n\n  Mr. President, in reflecting on Senator Jon Kyl's service to this \ninstitution and to our Nation, I am reminded of these words by Abraham \nLincoln. He said:\n\n       Character is like a tree and reputation like a shadow. The \n     shadow is what we think of, the tree is the real thing.\n\n  Jon Kyl is the real thing. During 18 years in the Senate, preceded 8 \nby in the House, Jon has built a reputation that is a perfect image of \nhis character. National magazines have named him one of America's 10 \nbest Senators, one of the world's most influential people, and one of \nour Nation's hardest working lawmakers.\n  His unanimous election in 2008 as our Republican whip and his \nrecognized leadership on the great challenges of our time throughout \nthe Senate reflect the esteem in which he is held on both sides of the \naisle. These accolades confirm what we who have had the privilege of \nworking closely with Jon know from experience. He is intelligent, he is \ninformed, and he is fair. He is dedicated to the people of Arizona and \nexemplifies the principles that are the foundation of our Constitution \nand of our country.\n  Of all the words that have been used to describe Jon Kyl, these five \ndescribe him best: As good as his word. Jon has been an invaluable ally \nin the great challenge of defending America against terrorism, a \nchallenge he recognized and worked hard to address long before the \nterrorist attacks of more than a decade ago.\n  As the leader of the Judiciary Committee, he worked hard to \nstrengthen our intelligence capabilities and was at the forefront of \none of the most crucial antiterrorism issues, tracking, exposing, and \ncutting off financial networks that bankrolled terrorism. Combating \nthis financing was one of our earliest and greatest antiterrorism \nsuccesses, although work continues today, and it was Jon Kyl who played \na key role.\n  Arizona, similar to Maine, has a long international border. The \nAmerican people fully understand the importance of borders that are \nclose to our enemies as they remain always open to our friends. Jon is \ndedicated to providing those who protect our borders with the \npersonnel, the training, and the technology so America can continue to \nwelcome with compassion those seeking a better way of life while \nturning away those who would do us harm.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, Jon Kyl has been one of the \nSenate's most diligent fiscal watchdogs. He has a sharp eye for \nwasteful spending. He is dedicated to reining in deficit spending, \nreforming our Tax Code, and making government more accountable.\n  Jon Kyl understands the challenges that confront America, and he also \nempathizes with the challenges that confront American families. His \nrecord is one of strong advocacy for our most vulnerable citizens, \nincluding victims of crime, children, and our seniors.\n  Jon often compares his work in the Senate to that of a teacher. \nWhether addressing constituents or colleagues, he strives to educate \nwith facts, with evidence, and with the truth. None of us has ever \nheard Jon try to win an argument by belittling or berating an opponent. \nIt is simply not in his character to do so.\n  It has been said that a politician thinks of the next election and a \nstatesman thinks of the next generation. This statesman from Arizona \nexpresses his philosophy of government and the obligation of government \nleaders this way:\n\n       We owe future generations the chance to live their dreams, \n     to be successful, and--most important--to achieve true \n     happiness by their own efforts.\n\n\n[[Page S7649]]\n\n\n  Senator Jon Kyl's commitment to the security of our Nation, to fiscal \nresponsibility, and to helping those in need have earned him a \nreputation that is worthy of his character.\n  The people of Arizona and America are grateful for his service. I am \nthankful for his guidance over the years and for his friendship. We \nwish him all the best in the years to come.\n  Mr. President, there is one more tribute I would like to give this \nmorning if there is time remaining. Could the Chair inform me if we are \nunder a time agreement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                             Richard Lugar\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in his 36 years of service in the Senate, \nRichard Lugar has established a reputation as an extraordinary leader \non such issues as foreign relations, national security, energy policy, \nagriculture, and economic growth. He is the Senate's most senior \nRepublican and the longest serving Member of Congress in Indiana's \nhistory.\n  Senator Lugar has established a well-deserved reputation as a true \nstatesman. At a time when the coarsening political discourse across our \nNation and in Congress is a growing concern, Dick Lugar is a shining \nexample of civility and mutual respect we must regain if our Nation is \nto meet the challenges that lie ahead.\n  Thirty-six years in the Senate is a part of Dick Lugar's long time of \nservice. After attending Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, Dick \nvolunteered for the U.S. Navy in 1957, eventually serving as an \nintelligence briefer for the Chief of Naval Operations. As the two-term \nmayor of Indianapolis, beginning in 1968, he was a trailblazer in \nunifying local government, setting his city on a remarkable path of \neconomic growth and prosperity as well as efficiency. As mayor, he \nserved three terms on the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental \nRelations and as president of the National League of Cities. It is \nevident Dick Lugar always rises to the top of any organization because \nhis colleagues recognize his extraordinary capability and his \noutstanding leadership.\n  Dick's life experiences and character have served the people of \nIndiana and our country so well. He has been the leader in reducing the \nthreat of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. What better \ntribute or legacy could anyone leave the world than to reduce the \ninventory of these dangerous weapons. The bipartisan partnership he \nforged in 1991 to destroy these weapons of mass destruction in the \nformer Soviet Union has resulted in the deactivation of more than 7,500 \nnuclear warheads that once were aimed at the United States.\n  As chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Dick Lugar has led the way \nfor reforming our Federal farm programs and has promoted research \nadvancements and increased export opportunities that have generated \nhigher net income for America's family farms. Through the Lugar Energy \nInitiative, he has combined his foreign policy and agricultural \nexpertise to promote policies to spur economic growth.\n  In the dark days following the attacks of September 11, 2001, Senator \nLugar set forth a set of principles to guide our Nation in these \ndifficult times. The Lugar doctrine calls upon the United States to \n``use all of its military, diplomatic and economic power--without \nquestion--to ensure that life threatening weapons of mass destruction \neverywhere are accounted, contained and hopefully destroyed.''\n  In addition, the Lugar doctrine asserts that America should encourage \ndemocratic institutions and decrease reliance on foreign energy \nsources.\n  These accomplishments, and so many more, stem from a profound \nintellect combined with character. There is nothing I love more than to \nhear Dick Lugar give a tutorial on any country in the world, and he can \ntalk knowledgeably and teach us about any country in the world. That is \nthe depth of his experience, his knowledge, and his expertise.\n  Dick has also always been a voice of reason in the Senate. No matter \nhow bitter the debate, he has always stood by his values and engaged in \nthoughtful discussions that result in solutions. That is why his advice \nhas so often been sought by Presidents, military leaders, Cabinet \nSecretaries, Governors, and so many of his colleagues, including me.\n  As Dick Lugar returns to the private life he left behind so many \nyears ago, his advice will continue to be sought after and I hope \nheeded. His knowledge and insight will still be valued, and the example \nof his decency and civility he has set throughout his life should guide \nus all. The people of Indiana and America are grateful for his service, \nand I am so grateful for his friendship and guidance over the years we \nhave served together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, as our office is winding down from my Senate \nterm beginning this week, the field offices in Virginia ceased their \nfunctioning, and it is going to be my pleasure later on today to host a \nlunch for all my staff and to thank them for the work they have done. I \njust want to take this opportunity to talk about why I have said so \nmany times since I came to the Senate that my greatest legacy will be \nthe work of our staff.\n  When I first came to the Senate, people were asking: Will you be \nremembered for the GI bill if you get it done--which we did--or maybe \nsome great transportation project or something of that sort? I said: \nNo, the most important thing a leader can do is to bring good people \naround him or her and to work them to the full extent of their capacity \nand then to provide them the opportunity to grow professionally in the \nspirit in which we have worked together.\n\n  It is not going to surprise the Presiding Officer or anyone else when \nI say the greatest learning experience for me in that regard was when I \nserved as a rifle platoon and company commander in the U.S. Marine \nCorps. When we were in training to go to Vietnam, we got a lecture from \na battle-hardened lieutenant colonel who fought as an enlisted marine \nin World War II, rifle platoon commander in Korea, and then as a \nbattalion commander in Vietnam.\n  One of the things he said to us was, You may carry a side arm, you \nmay carry a 45 pistol, you may carry an M-16 rifle, but a Marine \nofficer is only successful if he fights with his marines. It is the \nsame concept here. A person is no better as a leader than the people he \nor she leads. We worked hard on our staff for 6 years to find the most \ntalented people in America, to work them to their full capacity, to \ninstill in them my personal views of the principles of leadership and \nthe philosophy of governance which are at the core of what I wanted to \nbring to the Senate, and I believe we did that.\n  We started with Paul Reagan and Kathy Wilmoth. Paul Reagan, my chief \nof staff, is a veteran with 25 years of Democratic politics and \ngovernance inside Virginia. He worked for Congressman Rick Boucher. He \nworked for Jim Moran as his chief of staff. He worked for two other \nMembers of Congress, and he had been the communications director with \nMark Warner when he was Governor. We were what some people would call \nthe political odd couple early on. Paul was a master of every detail \ninside Virginia politics. My experience for many years had been on the \nnational level of policy. We worked very hard to screen every single \napplicant to make sure these were people who met the standards we were \ntrying to put into place.\n  Kathy Wilmoth, in my view, is something of a legend here. She became \nour office director. She knows every Capitol Hill policeman. She \nprobably knows every person sitting here working on the Senate floor. \nShe is an absolute gold star administrator. Before she came to work for \nus, she worked for Senators John and Lincoln Chafee. When I was a 25-\nyear-old marine, I worked on Senator John Chafee's staff when he was \nSecretary of the Navy. I know I am biased, but I would challenge anyone \nto rebut that we have had the best run staff on Capitol Hill.\n  We set up a communications shop. We had Jessica Smith and Kimberly \nHunter, two very talented and invaluable communicators, who understood \nthe job was not simply to respond to media requests but to proactively \nexplain what we were doing, what our purposes were, what our goals \nwere, and what the philosophical approach we were taking happened to be \nto local and national media rather than simply entertaining interview \nrequests and those sorts of things.\n\n[[Page S7650]]\n\n  On the State level, we were able to have Conaway Haskins and Louise \nWare. They set up the State administrative structure. We were \nconstantly able to listen and respond to the needs and to the opinions \nof people throughout this extraordinarily complex demographic \njurisdiction that is the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  Sometimes we forget about what happens on these phones in our offices \nwhen we are off in our meetings. The people who have run our phones and \nhave done our casework at times have astounded me. We go back to the \nvotes on health care reform. We know all the debates that were going on \nhere. We took a count in our office, and we received--just in our \noffice--226,000 pieces of advice just on health care reform; in fact, a \ntotal of 300,000 pieces of communication on that debate of which \napproximately 50.1 percent of the people who called in to us may have \nbeen happy with the eventual vote that I took. But I could walk out of \nthe office when that was going on and I could see the young people on \nthose phones and see how battered they often were, from the advice \nwhich, quite frankly, wasn't always pleasantly given.\n  With respect to casework, I had the great pleasure and unique \nexperience when I was 25 years old, on the Secretary of the Navy's \nstaff, of how to do casework. It opened my eyes to how many people \nthere are in this country who simply don't know how to open the door to \nget their needs solved by the government that has set its requirements \non them. I did this for John Chafee when he was Secretary of the Navy, \nand I did it for John Warner when he was Secretary of the Navy. I \nstrongly emphasized to the people who handled our casework what an \nimportant job it was they were doing.\n  In the time we have been in the Senate, our staff has resolved more \nthan 40,000 personal cases. More than 40,000 people who had not known, \nin many cases, even how to approach their government have received \npersonal assistance that has helped them solve other problems in their \nlives. In fact, Andrea Trotter, JoAnn Pulliam, Debra Lawson, Gwen \nSigda, and Debby Burroughs are on our staff, and each one of them \nresolved more than 3,000 cases during the time I have been in the \nSenate.\n\n  On legislative and political issues I would say that before I came to \nthe Senate, I made promises on the campaign trail and we kept those \npromises. The greatest achievements, in my view, during this term were \nmade right out of our office, not because we were responding to the \nsuggestions of some committee work or from the executive branch saying \nthey wanted something, but because we continually made suggestions to \nthose committees and to the executive branch about what we thought \nneeded to be done.\n  My first day in office I introduced a new GI bill. I had talked about \nit for years. The logic was very simple. These people who had been \nserving since 9/11 deserved the same chance at a first class future as \nthose who had served during World War II. Within 16 months, with the \nstrong support, by the way, of Leader Reid, we were able to pass this \nlegislation, the most important piece of veterans legislation since \nWorld War II.\n  Most of that effort, again, came directly out of our office from the \nwork of people on our personal staff, led by Mike Sozan, who at that \ntime was our legislative director and has since moved on to be the \nchief of staff for Senator Mark Udall.\n  We said during my campaign and after I got here that the United \nStates desperately needs to reform its criminal justice system. We have \n5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's \nprison population. If we ask the average American, two-thirds of them \nwill tell us they feel less safe in their own community than they did a \nyear ago. It is not a political issue. To me, it has always been a \npersonal issue, a leadership issue. I was warned when I first started \nraising this issue in Virginia 7 years ago that this could actually \nkill my political campaign. It didn't. People responded.\n  So since I was not on the Judiciary Committee, we worked on this \nlegislation to create a national commission to examine all the aspects \nof the criminal justice system, and we did it right out of our office, \nwith Doug Ierley being the point person for the entire country to get \nthis debate going in a way that it hadn't been debated before. We met \nin our own office with more than 100 different organizations in our \nconference room. We had a bill a little more than a year ago that \nreached the floor of this Senate.\n  I would ask the Presiding Officer or any of my other colleagues when \nis the last time they have seen a criminal justice bill endorsed by--I \nhave two pages of organizational endorsements--the National Sheriffs \nAssociation, the Marijuana Project, the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, the ACLU, and the \nSentencing Project. We got a buy-in from across the philosophical \nspectrum for a mere $14 million commission where we could receive the \nadvice from the experts in this country on an issue that we have not \nreceived their advice on since the 1960s.\n  One of the great disappointments of my time here has been the fact \nthat this simple, sensible piece of legislation was filibustered. We \ngot 57 votes on it. For some reason, the people on the other side of \nthe aisle decided this shouldn't happen. We did get four votes from the \nother side of the aisle. Even the National Review, which is one of the \nmost conservative magazines in the country, said filibustering this \npiece of legislation was ``insane.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this time \nthe endorsers of that legislation for the historical record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Criminal Justice Bill Endorsements\n\n       Innocence Project; National Sheriffs' Association; NAACP; \n     ACLU; Fraternal Order of Police; American Bar Association; \n     International Association of Chiefs of Police; Sentencing \n     Project; Families Against Mandatory Minimums; National \n     Association of VOCA Assistance Administrators; American \n     Probation and Parole Association; National Association of \n     Evangelicals; American Society of Victimology; Colorado \n     Organization for Victim Assistance; International Community \n     Corrections Association; International Organization for \n     Victim Assistance; Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD); \n     National Association of Crime Victim Compensation Boards; \n     National Center for Victims of Crime; National Children's \n     Alliance.\n       National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center; \n     National Organization for Victim Assistance; The Renee \n     Olubunmi Rondeau Peace Foundation; Legal Action Center; \n     Correctional Education Association; Middle Atlantic States \n     Correctional Association; Mennonite Central Committee; Safer \n     Foundation; Just Detention International; Justice Policy \n     Institute; Law Enforcement Against Prohibition; Union for \n     Reform Judaism; Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights; Church \n     of Scientology; United Methodist Church, General Board of \n     Church and Society; American Humanist Association; National \n     Advocacy Center of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd; Healing \n     Communities Prison Ministry and Prisoner Reentry Project; \n     Marijuana Policy Project; Citizens United for the \n     Rehabilitation of Errants (CURE).\n       National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws; \n     Corporation for Supportive Housing; National Employment Law \n     Project; United Church of Christ/Justice and Witness \n     Ministries; National African American Drug Policy Coalition, \n     Inc; American Probation and Parole Association; Women of \n     Reform Judaism; Students for Sensible Drug Policy; The \n     Fortune Society; Black Law Enforcement in America; \n     Therapeutic Communities of America; National Treatment \n     Accountability for Safer Communities; National Association of \n     Criminal Defense Lawyers; The Leadership Conference on Civil \n     and Human Rights; National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People; National Association of Social Workers; \n     NETWORK--A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby; Community \n     Action Partnership; Safe Streets Arts Foundation; November \n     Coalition; TASH--Equity, Opportunity and Inclusion for People \n     with Disabilities; Drug Policy Alliance; American Civil \n     Liberties Union; National Council of La Raza; National \n     Association of Evangelicals; National Alliance of Faith and \n     Justice; The Episcopal Church; National Gay and Lesbian Task \n     Force Action Fund.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. We have had a lot of discussion over the last 6 years about \nthe so-called pivot to Asia. I will say as someone who has spent a \ngreat deal of time in and out of east Asia that this pivot was heavily \ninfluenced by the actions, again, taken directly out of our office. We \nlooked for people to come and work with us who had expertise and the \nintellect to work not only on the Hill, not only with Members of \nCongress, and not only with the State Department, but with our \nembassies around the world, with foreign leaders, with validators, to \ntake a different approach and to refocus the energy of the United \nStates on this most vital part\n\n[[Page S7651]]\n\nof the world. David Bonine, Marta McLellan Ross, Gordon Peterson, and \nPhilip Brady were among them.\n  Our many visits to this part of the world sometimes included five \ncountries in 2 weeks, traveling solely via commercial air rather than \nwith military codel support, and included repeated meetings with the \ntop leadership of countries such as Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, \nSingapore, Indonesia, and Burma, all of which represent the future of \nthe United States in terms of trade, security, and cultural growth in \nthe coming decades.\n  With respect to Burma, it was a great moment for me to be able to sit \ndown with and see Aung San Suu Kyi, recognized by the Congress a month \nor so ago, coming to this country as an elected member of their \nParliament. We began the change in that relationship directly from our \noffice based on work I had begun and become interested in over a period \nof 6 years before I was elected to the Senate.\n  I am very proud to say we laid the groundwork for a historic visit in \n2009 from inside our office--often, I would say, against the will and \nagainst the advice of our own State Department. We used validators. We \ntalked to people we knew in the region. I became the only American \nleader ever to meet with GEN Than Shwe, the leader of the military \njunta, to express my belief that we could work forward and have a \ndifferent relationship. We met with Aung San Suu Kyi. I hope those who \nhad some doubts about the wisdom of opening this relationship now can \nsee the benefits as we are seeing the political situation beginning to \ntruly change in Burma.\n  We worked heavily with Japan. This is a critical yet often overlooked \nrelationship. It involved an effort to resolve basing issues on Okinawa \nthat don't always get the attention they deserve in the Congress but \nhave at times absolutely paralyzed the political debate inside Japan. \nIronically, I first began working on these issues as a military planner \nin 1974 after I left the Marine Corps and was in law school. Our staff \nhas met--and I have been a part of most of these meetings--with more \nthan 70 delegations from Japan, in our office, organized and conducted \nby our staff.\n  In Korea, we led an effort to bring Democratic Senators onboard to \nsupport the critical free-trade agreement that is so important not only \nto our bilateral relations but to the signals of the United States in \nthat part of the world, and we began what I believe is something of a \npioneering effort to get Korea and Japan to come together at the table \nto realize their common security interests.\n  As to Vietnam, I have visited and worked inside Vietnam for 18 out of \nthe last 21 years in addition to having served there as a marine, I \nwould say.\n  I fought in Vietnam because I believed in the importance of that \ncountry to our relationships in Asia. I have spent a great deal of \nenergy for more than 30 years now in an effort to heal the final wound \nof that war, which is the relationship between our Vietnamese community \nhere in the United States and the government inside Vietnam.\n  We have worked in Thailand, Singapore, Laos. I was the first American \nSenator to visit Laos in 7 years, the first Member of Congress to visit \nCambodia in 2 years when we visited Indonesia. We worked hard on the \nsovereignty and maritime issues in the South China Sea. We initiated \nand sponsored two important Senate resolutions regarding China's recent \naggression in the South China Sea. Again, we initiated this from the \nstaff members in our office.\n  I could go on. Let me just say that the other areas--important \nareas--that our staff has worked on in the past 6 years include our \npioneering work in economic fairness, the need for stronger programs in \nthe area of adult education, the efforts from inside our office to \nencourage a full spectrum of energy development, the preservation of \nCivil War battlefields, and the vital need to rebalance the \nconstitutional relationship between the Congress and the Presidency, \nwhich I have pursued in both administrations that have been in office \nwhile I have been a Member of the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, at this point, because I really will not have time to \nlist all of the contributions by my staff members, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the names and the positions of my staff members be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Kathryn M.

So to my staff, a heartfelt thanks, and to each of those \nwho have served with us, I say again, thank you for your contributions \nto our staff and, most importantly, to our country. And I say also \nagain that I will continue to expect great things from you in the \nfuture. You are my legacy. Never forget that the people you might have \nthe honor of leading as you move forward in your careers, wherever you \nend up, will someday become your legacy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The senior Senator from \nNew Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to first, of course, commend the \nSenator from Virginia for his great leadership here in the Senate on a \nwhole range of issues. He has served with great distinction here, and \nit has been an honor for me to serve with him. So I congratulate him on \nthe various issues he discussed and the various issues he has worked \non. I have had the good fortune to work and support his efforts on many \nof those issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7652-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7652-S7653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            WORK TO BE DONE\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to speak \nabout what needs to be done before we leave town, before we shut down \nthis session of the Congress. In my view, Congress needs to do five \nthings before the end of the year to head off difficulties for our \neconomy.\n  First, as many have said, the House needs to take up and pass the \nmiddle-class tax cut--a bill that was already passed here in the \nSenate. That is the first item. That has been given a lot of attention.\n  Second, both Houses of Congress need to head off most if not all of \nthe scheduled sequester. I hope we are able to do that.\n  Third, Congress should pass the tax extenders bill that was reported \nout of the Senate Finance Committee this summer, and that is going to \nbe the subject of most of my comments this morning.\n  Fourth, the Congress should repeal the SGR. This is the law that \ngoverns the rates of reimbursement to providers under the Medicare \nProgram. Unless we repeal that law, we will have to once again patch \nthe law, as we have done for many years now, with a so-called Medicare \ndoc fix. I think the time has come to go ahead and repeal the law.\n  The fifth item I want to mention is that Congress needs to give the \nPresident the power to raise the debt ceiling. At the same time, \nCongress should retain Congress's right to disapprove of that increase. \nBut Secretary Geithner has made a proposal to the Congress that I \nbelieve makes good sense. It is based upon the arrangement that was \nagreed to that Senator McConnell had put forward in the 2011 debt \nceiling crisis that we all lived through.\n  Obviously, this is a significant to-do list. I do not intend to speak \nabout all of these items. I would like to focus my remarks on the need \nfor Congress to pass the extenders package of tax provisions. I think \nthis has gotten too little attention. It deserves to be dealt with as a \nmajor component of the response to the so-called fiscal cliff. This is, \nin fact, the Family and Business Tax Cut Certainty Act of 2012.\n  While I hope the negotiations to avert the fiscal cliff are \nsuccessful, in my view, we should not wait for a grand bargain in order \nto finish our work on this important tax extender legislation.\n  Tax extenders are different from the other fiscal cliff issues for \nthree basic reasons. Let me describe those reasons.\n  First, tax extenders are much less contentious than the other end-of-\nyear problems that need to be resolved. The tax extender bill on the \nSenate calendar has strong bipartisan support. In August the Finance \nCommittee approved it by a large margin. We had support from six \nRepublicans, including the ranking member, Senator Hatch. All 13 \nDemocrats supported it. I believe many more Republicans will vote for \nthis legislation if it is brought up for consideration here in the \nSenate.\n  The bill consists entirely of tax cuts. It should not be difficult to \nget Senators to vote for tax cuts, right before Christmases especially. \nMost of these tax cuts have solid bipartisan support. Many of these tax \ncuts will help the economy and will help the middle class. For example, \nthe bill includes the deduction for tuition expenses, which is a $4.2 \nbillion tax cut for college students and their families. It includes \nthe deduction for State and local sales taxes. This is a $4.4 billion \ntax cut, mainly for people who live in States that do not have an \nincome tax, States such as Alaska and Florida and Nevada and Tennessee \nand Texas and South Dakota and Washington and Wyoming. It includes an \nincrease in the section 179 expensing limits. This is a $2.4 billion \ntax cut for small businesses. And it includes an extension of the \nproduction tax credit for wind energy. This is a tax credit which has \nbipartisan support. It has helped create thousands of jobs.\n  The production tax credit for wind energy is a vital component of our \nNation's energy policy. Its extension is crucial to taking advantage of \nour domestic energy resources and fostering a vibrant and globally \ncompetitive industry.\n  In just the several short years the wind industry has enjoyed this \nproduction tax credit, wind installations have grown immensely and \nmanufacturing facilities have grown to where today we have over 400 of \nthese manufacturing facilities that have sprung up around the country. \nThe United States now has over 50,000 megawatts of wind capacity and \nthe wind resources to grow that industry substantially more.\n  My home State of New Mexico has the 10th best wind resources in the \ncountry, and has built close to 800 megawatts of capacity. While \ntraditional fossil fuel plants use significant amounts of water to \ngenerate electricity, wind facilities use almost none--meaning that by \npromoting the development of wind power, we can conserve even more of \nthat precious resource.\n  The production tax credit for wind is set to expire in 3 weeks, as \nthese other provisions are as well. With it, tens of thousands of jobs \nwill be lost. In fact, most wind-related companies have already begun \nto lay off employees. Orders for new turbines and gearboxes have fallen \noff significantly, and new wind installations are expected to decline \ndramatically in 2013 unless Congress takes action.\n  Uncertainty comes from many places for those who are in the business \nworld. Congress should not continue to add to that uncertainty. \nInstead, we should extend the production tax credit for wind and extend \nthe other expiring provisions passed by the Senate Finance Committee on \na bipartisan basis.\n  A second reason the tax extenders are different from other issues \nrelated to the fiscal cliff is that we have a tax extenders bill that \nhas already been voted on in committee. By contrast, none of us know \nhow the disagreements about the Bush tax cuts or sequestration will be \nresolved. Those negotiations are yet to conclude. But the tax extenders \nbill has already been negotiated in the Finance Committee. The \ncommittee agreed to omit provisions costing billions of dollars. It \nmodified other provisions to make them work better or to scale back on \nthem. The Finance Committee approved this bill by a vote of 19 to 5.\n  That level of support means the Family and Business Tax Cut Certainty \nAct, or something close to it, is the tax extender bill the Senate is \nlikely to pass this year. Six Republicans voted for it in committee. We \nwould need just one more Republican vote to overcome a filibuster.\n  Some Senators believe tax extenders should only be approved as part \nof a plan to do comprehensive tax reform. I would agree that each tax \nextender and each tax expenditure should be examined again during \ncomprehensive tax reform. Each should be made permanent or phased out \nbased on that review. But realistically, the Congress will not make \nthose decisions before the end of this year. Tax reform will take the \nbetter part of a year to accomplish or perhaps even longer. We will \nneed to pass an extenders bill before then, and we have one before us \ntoday that is worthy of being passed.\n  A third reason we should pass the tax extenders package now and not \nwait\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\nuntil the eleventh hour is that waiting could force the IRS to delay \nthe tax filing season by 10 weeks or more for millions of Americans. In \nfact, we are at the eleventh hour. I should amend my comments to make \nthat point very clear. This need for the IRS to delay the tax filing \nseason is because the bill extends many provisions that expired at the \nend of 2011. They need to be extended for 2012 before people file their \ntax returns beginning in January of 2013. After Congress acts--if it \nacts--the IRS needs weeks to finalize tax forms and instruction books \nand to program computers to process the returns.\n  The IRS tells us that the alternative minimum tax, which is part of \nthis tax extender package, would cause the biggest delay in the filing \nof new returns because of the number of tax credits and deductions that \ninteract with the alternative minimum tax.\n  In 2010, when Congress waited until December to patch the alternative \nminimum tax, 10 million taxpayers had to delay their filings the next \nyear. In 2007, after another eleventh-hour patch, 13 million taxpayers \nwere delayed. Both the patches in 2007 and 2010 were enacted in \nDecember. So if we do not patch the AMT--alternative minimum tax--until \nJanuary, the consequences will be even more severe.\n  At some point, IRS would have to choose between two options.\n  Its first option is to postpone the filing season for anyone who \ncould be subject to the AMT and hope that Congress enacts a patch. \nBetween 30 million and 60 million people would have to wait to learn \nhow much tax they owe or whether they will get a refund.\n  The second option is for IRS to proceed with the filing season \nwithout the AMT patch. This option is even worse. It would mean 28 \nmillion more taxpayers would be subject to the AMT, and they would have \nto pay $98 billion more in tax for 2012. These are middle-class \nAmericans. Without the patch, the AMT will apply to individuals who \nearn more than $33,750 in 2012 and couples who earn more than $45,000. \nWithout the patch, 46 percent of couples filing joint returns would owe \nalternative minimum tax, instead of six percent if we enact the patch.\n  This would be a disaster for the middle class. This is the risk we \nare taking if we delay passing tax extenders.\n  I urge my colleagues to take up and pass this important legislation, \nsend it to the House so they can do the same, and send it to the \nPresident before this Congress finishes its work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in this day and age, there is simply no \ndenying that our economy is very much a part of a global economy and \naffected by it. Gone are the days when businesses relied solely on \ngrowing their customer base for domestic markets. Today, 95 percent of \nthe world's consumers live outside the United States, and we are \nproducing for those consumers as well as domestic ones.\n  One action that would help our economy improve at a faster rate would \nbe to increase trade opportunities overseas for American businesses and \nfarmers. Increased trade helps create jobs, increase incomes, and \nexpand opportunities for innovation.\n  As we have seen over the course of history and also repeating what \nPresident John F. Kennedy often spoke about, free and fair trade helps \nall boats rise;\n  That is to say, countries willing to lower their trade barriers and \nallow fair and competitive trade will see growth in their economies.\n  However, history also shows even among nations with good relations, \ntrade disputes still arise. That is why we need a forum to settle \ninternational disputes such as the World Trade Organization does. The \nWTO allows American businesses a place to take complaints against \nunfair trade barriers and have a judicial result.\n  For 19 years Russia has worked toward entry into the World Trade \nOrganization. Now they are in the World Trade Organization. I support \nRussia being in the World Trade Organization. As the world's eleventh \nlargest economy with over 140 million citizens, it is obviously an \nimportant market for U.S. businesses and farmers looking to expand \ntheir overseas markets.\n  Some of Iowa's heavy equipment manufacturers are already exporting \nmillions of dollars of equipment to Russia.\n  Agricultural equipment manufactured in facilities all around Iowa is \nbeing used by Russian farmers as they look to increase their \nagricultural efficiency and productivity.\n  The World Trade Organization accession process afforded us an \nopportunity to address Russian tariffs against our products. In the \naccession agreement, Russia has agreed to lower its tariffs for these \nconstruction and agricultural equipment products. That obviously means \nincreased exports and an increase in good American jobs.\n  By far the largest percentage of Iowa exports to Russia consists of \ngrains, meats, and other agricultural products being produced by Iowa's \nfarmers. Russia's accession into the WTO has been an important issue \nfor our pork producers, for our cattlemen, and for our grain farmers. \nIowa's farmers are some of the best in the world. They are truly \nhelping to feed the world. Expanding opportunities in overseas markets \nis vital to the future of American agriculture. Russia has been and I \nthink will continue to be an important market for our farmers. But it \ndoes not come without its challenges.\n  Russia has repeatedly raised barriers to the U.S. imports based upon \nrestrictions not supported by sound science. So now I am going to tell \nyou about some problems I have with Russia, even though I want Russia \nto be in the WTO and I want this legislation to pass so it can be fully \nimplemented.\n  I will share some things we have problems with regarding Russia. Let \nus take pork exports as an example. In 2008, U.S. pork sales to Russia \ntotaled over 200,000 metric tons. Since that time exports have fallen \nnearly 60 percent due to Russia's reduced import quota and questionable \nsanitary and phytosanitary restrictions. I am pleased our trade \nnegotiators were able to negotiate a satisfactory tariff rate quota for \nour pork. But this administration under President Obama has fallen \nshort in its obligations to stand with U.S. farmers on these sanitary \nand phytosanitary standards; in other words, standing up for using \nsound science instead of some illegitimate reason for keeping our \nproducts out of Russia.\n  I have communicated time and again what I expected of this \nadministration because they have to negotiate for us. In June 2011, I \nled a bipartisan letter with Senator Nelson of Nebraska and 26 other \nSenators to Ambassador Kirk requesting his negotiators follow the steps \nwe have taken during consideration of past WTO accessions. I referred \nto China and Vietnam as examples for this administration to follow. \nWhen these countries joined the WTO, we used these opportunities to \nobtain firm sanitary-phytosanitary commitments from those countries \nthat went beyond the WTO sanitary-phytosanitary agreement. In \nparticular, we obtained further commitments in areas of meat inspection \nequivalence.\n  In addition, in June of this year, I sent another bipartisan letter \nwith Senator Nelson of Nebraska and 32 other Senate colleagues to \nPresident Obama again laying out our request that he stand for American \nfarmers and demand more of the Russian Government on sanitary-\nphytosanitary issues which would very much benefit our agriculture \nproducts going into Russia.\n  As we know, this administration did not use the accession process to \nfully address these crucial issues so they have to be addressed outside \nof this process where we do not quite have the leverage we would \notherwise have. That is why I requested language that is in this \nlegislation to require our trade negotiators to keep working with these \nunfair trade barriers and report to Congress on their progress. Our \nfarmers are some of the very best in the world. We cannot allow their \nproducts to be discriminated against based upon arbitrary nonscientific \nand unjustifiable reasons.\n  In addition to the concerns I repeatedly raised on sanitary-\nphytosanitary issues, there are other issues at stake with Russia. It \nis a shame that we are handling this bill in a lameduck session when \ntime is so limited. This bill should have been debated at a time\n\n[[Page S7654]]\n\nwhen the Senate could more fully evaluate the current course of our \nrelationship with Russia.\n  Russia continues to cause challenges in regard to Syria, Iran, and \nother regions of the world where the United States and our allies are \ntrying to do what is right in the name of human dignity and also in the \nname of national security. I am concerned with Russia's own human \nrights issues. That is why I am very glad the Magnitsky provisions are \nin this bill.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I remain \ntroubled by the lack of progress Russia has made on protecting \nintellectual property rights. Furthermore, Russian officials need to \nstep up their efforts in combating cyber crimes. There continues to be \na large number of cyber attacks that originate from within Russia's \nborders.\n  All that being said, I realize having Russia in the WTO is a very \npositive step. One of the goals of international trade is to build upon \nrelationships between nations. Having Russia in the WTO fold will \nhopefully benefit our nations as we work together on so many issues \nthat concern us, plus, as I have stated before, having the WTO forum \navailable to help our businesses and farmers when disputes arise is \nimportant.\n  I have said I want Russia in the WTO. I have said there are good \nopportunities for us there. I just spoke as to why I think there are \nproblems with Russia that need to be worked out. President Putin is not \ngoing to pay any attention to what I say, but I want him to know these \nare issues of the re-Sovietization of the country and I do not like it. \nI favor this bill; I favor working with Russia. But they are becoming \nmore of a problem. I look forward to hearing from our trade negotiators \nin the not too distant future on their progress in getting Russia to \nremove the unjustifiable barriers to our agricultural products.\n  Furthermore, as President Obama looks toward other trade initiatives \nin the future, I hope this accession process will be a lesson. This \nprocess could have been better, in other words, using the leverage the \nUnited States has during these accession negotiations to get a lot of \nthese disputes settled as we did with China and Vietnam that we have \nnot fully done with Russia.\n  The President has called on Congress to pass this legislation for \nsome time. But his lack of consultation with Congress and disregard for \nthe concerns raised by this Senator and other Members has only served \nto delay this whole process. We cannot keep approaching trade issues in \nthis fashion. This administration needs to have real and substantive \nconsultation with Congress.\n  Furthermore, when there are opportunities to stand for American \nbusinesses and farmers against unfair trade barriers such as the \nsanitary and phytosanitary issues in Russia, the President needs to \nseize that opportunity the same way it was seized in the case of \nVietnam and in the case of China's accession.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from Florida \nis recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7654-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7654-S7656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FISCAL CLIFF\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I want to speak to the issue that is beginning \nto considerably irritate the American people, and that is they cannot \nbelieve that in Washington the two parties cannot get together to come \nto an agreement on avoiding the fiscal cliff. It is as if some are in \ndenial that there was an election and the President won reelection, and \nthat a whole bunch of us won reelection to the Senate and to the House. \nIt is as if the ideological rigidity is still as rigid and doctrinaire \nand that the lessons people were telling us about bipartisanship, that \nthey demand bipartisanship--it is as if the parties and their leaders \ndid not understand that is what the American people were demanding.\n  And here as the drumbeat grows louder, we approach December 31 and \nfalling off the fiscal cliff. There is an easy fix, whatever your \nideology and your approach. It can be hammered out next year when we \nare doing major things such as a rewrite of the IRS Tax Code, and all \nthat that can portend in producing revenue, by making the Code more \nstreamlined and in the process get rid of a lot of the underbrush and \nloopholes, and utilize that revenue to lower rates. But that is for \nanother day after long deliberation on reforming an issue that has \ngotten so complicated it is out of control, and that is the Tax Code. \nYou cannot do that in the next few days. That is what needs to be done \nin the committee process of the Congress.\n  What easily can be done is recognize that the President won, produce \nrevenue with the upper 2 percent paying a little more, and eliminate \nthe sequestration, which is $1 trillion of cuts over the next 10 years \nthat were never intended to go into effect after the original $1 \ntrillion which a year-and-a-half ago went into effect. This \nsequestration was intended to be the meat cleaver hanging over the \nheads of the supercommittee to get them to come to a bipartisan \nagreement.\n  Of course, a year-and-a-quarter ago, they deadlocked six to six and \nthus that is why we are facing this sequestration--$\\1/2\\ trillion of \ncuts in defense, $\\1/2\\ trillion of cuts in nondefense discretionary \nspending. Most everybody thinks they should not go into effect. So let \nus, for right now, before December 31, help eliminate the \nsequestration. Let's reintroduce all of the tax cuts for 98 percent of \nthe American people, and then let's prepare, in a deliberative way, to \nreform the Tax Code and go about the process of streamlining and \ncutting spending as the new Congress unfolds. That is what I wanted to \nshare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to address the same subject and I \ncertainly share the views of the Senator from Florida that we have got \nto solve this so-called sequester problem because, as the Secretary of \nDefense has said, it would be disastrous for the Defense Department to \ntake another $\\1/2\\ trillion hit to its budget after already committing \nto do so.\n  We have required under our Budget Act that the Defense Department \nreduce spending by about $487 billion over the next 10 years. To add \nanother \\1/2\\ trillion to that would, in fact, as Secretary Panetta \nsaid, be disastrous. So I appreciate the comments of my colleague.\n  Let me speak to the President's proposal specifically that was made \nat the beginning of the so-called negotiations here. His offer would \nincrease taxes by more than $1.6 trillion on individuals, on investment \nincome, small businesses, under the estate tax, farms and estates, and \nAmerican energy producers.\n  As President Reagan said many years ago, if you tax something, you \nget less of it. When you have to pay more taxes to engage in certain \nactivities, you tend not to engage in those activities.\n  What is happening now in the market is a perfect example. A lot of \npeople are of the view that capital gains taxes are going to go up, so \nthey are selling their shares of stock or property now in order to pay \nthe tax on the gain at the lower rate this year rather than the higher \nrate next year.\n  Tax rates should not be a factor in business decisions that are made. \nAt least, raising taxes, as we will see in a moment, is a very big wet \nblanket on economic activity and economic growth. When we are in a \nsituation where economic growth is clearly less than 2 percent, it is \nnot the time to raise taxes. As the President himself said almost \nexactly 2 years ago, when we decided to extend the tax policy that is \ncurrently in effect and had been for many years before that, to allow \ntax rates to go up would be--and this is his quotation--``a blow to the \neconomy.''\n  So if it was true then, it is even more true today because the GDP \ngrowth is less today than it was 2 years ago when he made that correct \ncomment. But the result of his proposal here to raise taxes by $1.6 \ntrillion would, in fact, reduce the economic growth, would result in \nfewer jobs, would result in less investment and, therefore, slower \ngrowth in many major sectors of the economy.\n\n[[Page S7655]]\n\n  To show you how unserious his offer was, when the Republican leader \nyesterday asked unanimous consent to have a vote on it, he said, well, \nthe President made his offer. I have put it into legislative language. \nLet us have a vote on it. The Democratic leader said, no, we don't want \nto do that and he objected, and it is clear why, because not only would \nit not receive Republican votes, it wouldn't receive Democratic votes.\n  In particular, let us understand why. A lot of our colleagues here on \nboth sides of the aisle appreciate the impact on small business from \nraising tax rates. That is why there is a lot of difference of opinion \non the Democratic side, as well as the view on the Republican side that \nthis is not the right way to raise revenues if you were going to do it. \nYou don't raise it on the backs of small business. The plan the \nPresident has proposed would hit small businesses directly.\n  Why is that the case? Because unlike corporations, which pay their \ntaxes as corporations--they pay the 35-percent corporate rate--\nindividual rates are the basis under which most small businesses pay \ntheir taxes. These are so-called flowthrough entities. Most of the \nsmall businesses, owned by an individual and maybe a couple members of \nhis family--for example, your local plumbing business or air \nconditioning business, whatever it might be--pay their taxes as \nindividuals.\n  When you raise the top individual rate or the second marginal rate or \nyou raise capital gains rates or the estate tax rates, you are directly \nhitting those small business people. They employ millions of Americans. \nIn fact, about a quarter of all workers today are employed in small \nbusiness.\n  Over half, about 53 percent exactly, of this so-called flowthrough \nincome is the money these small businesses earn. So when you raise the \ntop two brackets, rates, or you raise the capital gains rate, for \nexample, you are directly impacting these small businesses' ability to \ncapitalize their businesses to hire more workers, to buy another pickup \ntruck or whatever it might be. That is why we have said if you want to \nraise more tax revenues, there is a better way to do it than by raising \nthe rates that would directly apply to these small business people.\n  Let me put this in perspective for you. According to the Office of \nManagement and Budget figures, government spending has exceeded 24 \npercent of the GDP since 2009. That is well above the historical \naverage, so we are spending way more than we ever have. But, according \nto CBO, tax revenues, the money the government brings in, are projected \nby 2016 to exceed 18 percent of GDP to get to 18.6 percent of GDP by \n2022. That is above the historical average of revenues. So we are \nspending way more than our historical average. Also, in a relatively \nshort period of time our revenues, because of the economy, as well as \nour tax rates, will produce more than the average revenue to the \nFederal Government.\n  It is clear we are bankrupt, not because we are not going to have \nenough revenues but because we are spending too much. The question is, \nis it fair to send small businesses the bill here for this excessive \nspending?\n  Even if we did believe President Obama would dedicate new revenue \nfrom tax increases to help pay down the deficit--and I don't believe \nthat--new revenue extracted from the top two brackets would only fund \nthe government for about a week, a little less than a week. So that is \nclearly not the answer.\n  When the President says, well, we need to ask the wealthy to pay a \nlittle more, let us parse that for a second. You are not asking them to \ndo it; if you pass the law, the IRS will come after you if you don't. \nThis is not a pleasant request. This is the IRS saying you have to pay \nmore money to the U.S. Government, and the President always likes to \nsay, a little more.\n  Well, it is not so little if your tax rate now goes up to almost 40 \npercent. If you are a small businessman and you have to pay 40 percent \nto Uncle Sam, you are probably not going to be able to grow your \nbusiness. You might not be able to stay in business. You certainly \nare not going to be able to hire more people. That is not little to \nthem. It is little to funding the U.S. Government.\n\n  What the President says these small businesses and others are going \nto have to pay, as I said, only funds the government for a little less \nthan a week. It doesn't solve our deficit problem. It doesn't begin to \nsolve our deficit problem.\n  Have you heard the President talk about reducing spending? No. He \ndoesn't want to talk about that. It is as if he says the whole answer \nto our problem here is to ask the wealthy to pay a little bit more.\n  Well, in terms of the Federal budget, it is a little bit more. It is \nnot going to help very much. Where are you going to get the rest of the \nsavings? That is what we ought to be talking about here.\n  Then, as I was talking about before, it is how you do it that matters \na lot. He should stop pursuing tax rate increases, as I said, and \nrevisit the comments he made a year ago. Here is what the President \nsaid. ``What we said was give us''--to ``give us''--that is a nice way \nof saying we are going to make you pay more in taxes. ``Us,'' I gather \nhere, is the U.S. Government.\n\n       What we said was give us $1.2 trillion in additional \n     revenues, which could be accomplished without hiking taxes, \n     tax rates, but could simply be accomplished by eliminating \n     loopholes, eliminating some deductions and engaging in a tax \n     reform process that could have lowered rates generally while \n     broadening the base.\n\n  He is right about that. If you want to get $1.2 billion or 800 \nbillion, which is the offer the Speaker of the House has made, in new \ntax revenues, you can do that without touching tax rates. What you \ncould do is to put a cap on the amount of money the wealthy people in \nthis country receive in the way of deductions for various things that \nthey do, the taxes they pay to State and local government. They have \ngot a big mortgage on a second home or something such as that. You \ncould limit the amount of money that can be taken in special exemptions \nand credits and deductions and receive that revenue that way rather \nthan by raising rates. The President said so. He is right.\n  Speaker Boehner is saying, all right, Mr. President, you won the \nelection, you want more taxes, we are willing to do that. We don't want \nto do it, we think it will hurt the economy, but we are willing to do \nit.\n  But to minimize the damage on the economy, at least do it through \neliminating these loopholes, these so-called deductions, credits, and \nspecial provisions. Don't try to do it by raising tax rates because \nthat directly hits the small businesses you are trying to help create \njobs right now.\n  Here is what small businesses care about. They spend a lot. As I say, \nyou have a dad, his two sons, maybe mom does the accounting for the \nfirm and so on; they have to be concerned about the estate tax. Those \nsmall businesses spend a lot of money trying to plan around paying the \nestate tax. On January 1, if we don't do anything, there is only $1 \nmillion exempted. If you have a small business with a bunch of trucks \nand equipment and the like, you are going to have far more than $1 \nmillion in assets in the business. The same thing for a farm.\n  What happens is that rate goes up to 55 percent. The amount exempted \nis only $1 million. So everything above $1 million you are paying 55 \npercent on.\n  I can personally tell you the stories of small business people in \nPhoenix who have had to sell their business because they didn't have \nthe money to pay the taxes. The business, the one I am thinking of \nright now, a printing company, is out of business now. It used to \nemploy 200 people. It used to make a lot of contributions to charity in \nour community. No more. They are out of business. The employees are \ngone. The contributions to charity are gone. That is what happens when \nyou don't care about the estate tax rate. So we should care about that. \nIt shouldn't have to go up.\n  On capital gains, as I said, it is the same thing. A lot of people \nare cashing out now because they fear there is going to be a higher \nrate later. For larger businesses, we see some enormous dividends being \npaid this month. It may not be possible to pay those dividends starting \nin January when the dividend rate would skyrocket--close to 40 percent \nif we don't do anything. These are not things that help business and \njob creation.\n  What I would ask my colleagues to think of, if you are not willing to \nvote\n\n[[Page S7656]]\n\non the President's plan, at least listen to what he said a year ago \nwhen he said we can raise this tax revenue. We don't have to raise tax \nrates. We can do it by closing some of these loopholes.\n  He was right about that. If we are going to have to raise revenues, I \nwould suggest that is the way to do it--at all costs avoid raising tax \nrates, which would, as he said a year ago, be a blow to our economy.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WALKER TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n  THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA AND TERRENCE G. BERG TO BE UNITED \n       STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Mark E. \nWalker, of Florida, to be United States District Judge for the Northern \nDistrict of Florida, and Terrence G. Berg, of Michigan, to be United \nStates District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 15 \nminutes of debate, equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will finally be allowed to \nvote on the nominations of Judge Mark Walker to fill a vacancy on the \nU.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida and of \nTerrence Berg to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Michigan. It has taken far too long \nfor this day to come but I congratulate these nominees and their \nfamilies on their confirmations.\n  After this vote, the Senate remains backlogged with 20 judicial \nnominations reported by the Judiciary Committee, including 15 \nnominations from before the August recess. They should be confirmed \nbefore the Senate adjourns for the year. If the Senate were allowed to \nact in the best interests of the American people, it would vote to \nconfirm these nominees and reduce the judicial vacancies that are \nplaguing our Federal courts.\n  Senate Republicans are establishing a new and harmful precedent of \nstalling judicial nominees on the Senate Executive Calendar who are \nready for final action by insisting that they be delayed into the \nsucceeding year. They held up judicial nominees three years ago, they \ndid it two years ago, they did it last year, and they are doing it \nagain. They have found a new way to employ their old trick of a pocket \nfilibuster. They stall nominees into the next year and force the Senate \nto continue work on nominees from the past year for the first several \nmonths of the new year. They delay and delay and push other \nconfirmations back in time and then cut off Senate consideration of any \nnominees.\n  By way of example, last December, Senate Republicans refused to \nconfirm a single nominee before the end of the year. It then took us \nuntil May of the following year to confirm the 19 nominees they stalled \nfrom the previous year's Calendar, and we achieved that only after the \nMajority Leader was forced to file cloture on 17 nominees. The fact is \nthat the Senate has been allowed to confirm only 19 nominees who were \nreported this year by the Senate Judiciary Committee. That is by far \nthe lowest total for a presidential election year since 1996, when \nSenate Republicans, who were then in the Majority, would only allow 17 \nof President Clinton's nominees to be confirmed.\n  These delays in filling judicial vacancies are harmful to our \nNation's courts and to the American people they serve. The Senate \nshould be taking action on all the pending nominees so that we can make \nreal progress for the American people and reduce the damagingly high \nnumber of judicial vacancies. Federal judicial vacancies remain near \n80. By this point in President Bush's first term we had reduced \njudicial vacancies to 28. There were more than 80 vacancies when the \nyear began. There were more than 80 vacancies this past March when the \nMajority Leader was forced to take the extraordinary step of filing \ncloture petitions on 17 district court nominations. And there are still \ncurrently near 80 vacancies today.\n  Those who argue that it would be ``unprecedented'' to confirm long-\nstalled nominations because they have delayed them into this lameduck \nsession are wrong. They say that because there were no lameduck \nconfirmations in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, or 2008, we should \ntherefore not confirm these nominees, and we should allow nearly a \ndozen judicial emergency vacancies to remain unfilled. They have \nomitted some important facts. What they fail to acknowledge is that \nthey have delayed action on 17 of these nominees since before the \nAugust recess. In 1984, 1988, 1992, and 1996--the first four of their \npurported examples--there were no lameduck sessions. Those are not \nprecedents supporting their contentions seeking to justify their \ncurrent obstruction.\n  In 2000 and 2008, in keeping with Senate tradition, the Senate had \ndone its job and had confirmed all pending nominations and cleared the \nCalendar. There were no pending judicial nominees to be given a final \nconfirmation vote by the Senate in those years. Those are not precedent \nfor the current Republican obstruction. Following the example from \nthose years would have meant confirming all the nominations reported \nbefore the August recess long before this post-election lame duck \nsession.\n  The fact is that from 1980 until this year, when a lame duck session \nfollowed a presidential election, every single judicial nominee \nreported with bipartisan Judiciary Committee support has been \nconfirmed. That is the precedent that Senate Republicans are now \nbreaking. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, \nno consensus nominee reported prior to the August recess has ever been \ndenied a vote--before now. That is something Senate Democrats have not \ndone in any lameduck session, whether after a presidential or midterm \nelection.\n  Senate Democrats allowed votes on 20 of President George W. Bush's \njudicial nominees, including three circuit court nominees, in the \nlameduck session after the elections in 2002. I remember, I was the \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee who moved forward with those votes, \nincluding one on a very controversial circuit court nominee. The Senate \nproceeded to confirm judicial nominees in lame duck sessions after the \nelections in 2004 and 2006. In 2006 that included confirming another \ncircuit court nominee. We proceeded to confirm 19 judicial nominees in \nthe lame duck session after the elections in 2010, including five \ncircuit court nominees.\n  That is our history and recent precedent. Those who contend that \njudicial confirmation votes during lame duck sessions do not take place \nare wrong. I urge them to reexamine the false premises for their \ncontentions and I urge the Senate Republican leadership to reassess its \ndamaging tactics. The new precedent they are creating is bad for the \nSenate, the Federal courts and, most importantly, for the American \npeople.\n  Moreover, arguments about past Senate practices do not help fill \nlongstanding vacancies on our Federal courts, which are in dire need of \nadditional assistance. Arguments about past Senate practice do not help \nthe American people obtain justice. There are no good reasons to hold \nup the judicial nominations being stalled on the Senate Executive \nCalendar. A wrongheaded desire for partisan payback for some imagined \noffense from years ago is no good reason. A continuing effort\n\n[[Page S7657]]\n\nto gum up the workings of the Senate and to delay Senate action on \nadditional judicial nominees next year is no good reason.\n  It is past time for votes on the four circuit nominees and the other \n15 district court nominees reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nWhen we have consensus nominees before us who can fill judicial \nvacancies, especially judicial emergency vacancies, it is our duty to \nthe American people to take action on those nominations. Doing so is \nconsistent with Senate precedent, and it is right. Let us do our jobs \nso that all Americans can have access to justice.\n  Today, we will vote on two consensus nominees who were stalled for \nmonths for no good reason, and are finally receiving a vote. Judge \nWalker is nominated to fill a judicial vacancy on the U.S. District \nCourt for the Northern District of Florida. He has served as a state \ncourt judge since 2009, and previously spent 10 years in private \npractice. After law school he clerked for Judge Emmett Ripley Cox on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and Judge Robert L. \nHinkle on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. \nThe nonpartisan ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nunanimously rated him well qualified--its highest rating. Judge \nWalker's nomination has the bipartisan support of his home state \nSenators, Democratic Senator Bill Nelson and Republican Senator Marco \nRubio.\n  Terrence Berg is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on \nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Since \n2011, he has served on detail in the Professional Misconduct Review \nUnit, in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General at the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice. He previously served as interim U.S. Attorney \nand First Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Michigan \nand has received many awards for his service as a Federal prosecutor. \nAfter graduating from law school he clerked for the Honorable Anthony \nA. Alaimo in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nGeorgia, and has spent most of his career as a Federal prosecutor. His \nnomination has the support of his home state senators, Senator Levin \nand Senator Stabenow.\n  The Judiciary Committee reported both nominations by voice vote--\nJudge Walker was reported six months ago, and Mr. Berg was reported \nfive months ago. After the Senate is finally allowed to confirm them, \nwe need to move on to consider and confirm the rest of the nominees who \nhave been stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar so that all \nAmericans will have better access to justice.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak on my time, without delaying the \nvote, as in morning business on another critical matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Violence Against Women Act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken on this subject many times on \nthe floor. The people who are affected by violence against women have \nwondered why the Congress has delayed so long on the Violence Against \nWomen Reauthorization Act, the bill we passed here in the Senate. If \nsomeone is a victim of violence, that person can't understand such \ndelays. So I think it is time for the Senate and the House to come \ntogether to pass the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization \nAct. The other body needs to do what we did overwhelmingly in this \nSenate.\n\n  Earlier this week, I read in the Burlington, VT, Free Press the story \nof Carmen Tarleton. She is a woman from Thetford, VT. Thetford, VT, is \na small, quiet, beautiful little town in our State.\n  Five years ago, Carmen's estranged husband broke into her home, he \nbeat her with a baseball bat, and he poured industrial strength lye on \nher, severely burning a great deal of her body and nearly blinding her. \nHer doctors said she had suffered the most horrific injury a human \nbeing could suffer. Today she is still disfigured and continues to \nexperience pain from these injuries of 5 years ago. She is currently \nawaiting approval for a procedure that could help her get a face \ntransplant. Despite this, Carmen is courageously sharing her story in a \nbook that she has written called Overcome: Burned, Blinded, and \nBlessed.\n  Stories such as Carmen's remind me that every day we do not pass VAWA \nmore people are suffering.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \narticle to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Burlington Free Press, \n                             Dec, 3, 2012]\n\n                Lye Attack Victim Writes of Forgiveness\n\n                            (By Lisa Rathke)\n\n       Montpelier, VT.--While Carmen Tarleton lay in a hospital \n     bed, burned, beaten and disfigured by her estranged husband \n     with injuries that doctors called ``the most horrific injury \n     a human being could suffer,'' she had vivid dreams.\n       In one of the most memorable, dozens of doors stretched \n     around her. ``Life is a choice,'' a voice said. And then the \n     words appeared one at a time in white across a dark movie \n     screen: LIFE IS A CHOICE.\n       Tarleton carried that lesson with her through her ongoing, \n     daunting and remarkable recovery after her ex broke into her \n     Theftord home five years ago, beat her with a baseball bat \n     and poured industrial- strength lye on her, burning most of \n     her body.\n       Tarleton, who at age 44 continues to undergo surgeries and \n     awaits a possible face transplant, has written a book that \n     will be published in March called ``Overcome: Burned, Blinded \n     and Blessed.'' She hopes it will speak to abuse victims and \n     others.\n       ``I think I can help a whole bunch of people, not just \n     domestic violence people,'' she said in a recent interview \n     with The Associated Press. ``I think I can help a whole bunch \n     of people wherever you are in your life.''\n       Despite her suffering, she says she's in a better place \n     than she was before the attack.\n       ``I'm so much more blessed than I was then,'' she said.\n       The book starts with Tarleton's decision at 28 to move \n     across the country from her native Vermont to Los Angeles, \n     with her two children in tow, to work as a nurse at a UCLA \n     hospital. There she met Herb Rodgers, whom she eventually \n     married. The family moved back to Thetford, where her \n     marriage started to unravel--in part over Rodgers' \n     dishonesty, Tarleton said.\n       Tarleton recalls what she now says was a premonition. One \n     evening when she was about to leave for her night shift at \n     the hospital, her 12-year-old daughter was sobbing in \n     bedroom. When she asked what was wrong, her daughter said, \n     ``Something really, really bad is going to happen to you.''\n       Eight months later, it did. Rodgers is serving a minimum of \n     30 years in prison for the June 2007 attack.\n       When she set out to write the book three years later with \n     only limited vision in one eye, she stalled when it came time \n     to explain what Rodgers had done to her that night. She had \n     to coach herself through it.\n       ``Alone at my magnifying machine, I felt physically ill \n     with what I was doing,'' she wrote. ``The experience of \n     reliving that night, trying to capture every detail as \n     vividly as I remembered it, was sickening. Halfway through, I \n     let my pen drop and rushed to my bedroom, the edges of my \n     limited vision blackening.''\n       It took her two days to write it. It was scary, but it was \n     what she wanted to do, she said.\n       She talked out the rest of the book and recorded it. She \n     hired Writers of the Round Table Press to write it all down, \n     including dialogue she had recalled.\n       ``I was paying attention, because some of it I couldn't \n     forget if I wanted to,'' she said.\n       She writes about facing Rodgers in court, how she dealt \n     with being blind and disfigured, her pain, the help she has \n     received from her community, family and friends, and how she \n     came to forgive the man who maimed her so she could get on \n     with her own life.\n       ``That's where I feel people get stuck because we don't \n     have a segment of our society that says just because this \n     terrible thing happened to you it doesn't have to ruin the \n     rest of your life,'' she said. ``And I want to be the example \n     of that because it doesn't.''\n       Publishing the book was a no-brainer for Writers of the \n     Round Table Press, which helped Tarleton write it, said vice \n     president David Cohen.\n       ``Taking that kind of experience and turning that energy \n     into something positive and wanting to go out there and \n     effect change with as much as she had to overcome, to me was \n     just striking,'' Cohen said.\n       As she awaits approval for a procedure that could help her \n     get a face transplant, she looks forward to feeling well \n     enough to speak publicly again about her ordeal to help \n     others. She has had several recent surgeries to install a \n     catheter in her chest and was sick last winter with \n     hyperthyroidism.\n       ``When life gives you a big negative situation like I'd \n     been through, if you can get through that, you can really \n     find all of the blessings and all of the positive things that \n     can come out of that,'' she said. ``And I found so much that \n     I would not go back.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Presiding Officer was a \nstrong supporter of this bill--the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act, as many of our colleagues were on both sides of \nthe aisle. We tried to keep this a nonpartisan bill--even beyond\n\n[[Page S7658]]\n\nbipartisan, a nonpartisan bill--because certainly my experience has \nbeen that violence occurs not because a woman is a Republican or a \nDemocrat or an Independent. Violence against women occurs in all \nstratum, in all categories.\n  Senator Crapo and I put together our bill after listening to victims \nand the professionals who work with them every day. We did not want \nprovisions in our bill included to score political points. They were \nthere to address the urgent needs of vulnerable victims. That was the \none thing we wanted. This wasn't a Democratic or Republican bill, this \nwas to address vulnerable victims.\n  One key provision in our bipartisan bill would allow tribal courts \nlimited jurisdiction to consider domestic violence offenses committed \nby non-Indians against Indian women on tribal lands. On this, I relied \non the experiences of Senator Crapo and others who come from States \nwhere there are tribal lands. As we went into this and talked to the \nleaders of various tribes from around this country, I heard that \nviolence against Native women is not only appalling, as we knew, but it \nhas become an epidemic. It has been reported that almost three in five \nNative women have been assaulted by their spouses or intimate partners. \nMuch of the violence is committed by non-Native Americans--non-Indians.\n  Federal and State law enforcement may be hours away and lack the \nresources to respond to these cases, while tribal courts lack \njurisdiction to consider these cases. So what happens? The perpetrators \nare, in effect, immune from the law. The worst part about it is they \nknow they are immune from the law. So the jurisdiction provision in the \nSenate Leahy-Crapo bill would be a significant step toward addressing \nthis horrific problem, but it would also ensure that no abuser is above \nthe law. As the President said yesterday in a speech to the Tribal \nNations Conference: ``With domestic violence so prevalent on \nreservations, we're pushing Congress to restore your power to bring to \njustice anyone--Indian or non-Indian--who hurts a woman.''\n  Even though our tribal provision is limited and guarantees \ncomprehensive rights, House Republicans have objected to it. So I come \nto the Senate floor to report to my colleagues what I hope is a \nbreakthrough on this issue in this important bill. Two conservative \nHouse Republicans, with leadership positions in the Republican House \nmajority, have introduced a reasonable, middle-ground position \nregarding tribal jurisdiction.\n  Representative Issa of California and Representative Cole of Oklahoma \nhave introduced the Violence Against Indian Women Act, H.R. 6625. Their \ncosponsors include Republicans from North Carolina, Minnesota and \nIdaho. They all have tribes within their states and are concerned about \nthe violence our Senate bill is trying to combat. The Issa-Cole bill \nincludes a provision that allows defendants to remove a case to Federal \ncourt if any defendants' rights are violated. This modification should \nensure that only those tribes that are following the requirements of \nthe law and providing full rights can exercise jurisdiction, and that \ndefendants can raise challenges at the beginning of a case.\n  Some in the House Republican leadership have expressed a ``just say \nno'' approach to any grant of tribal jurisdiction, but the House \nRepublican leadership should give serious consideration to this \nRepublican proposal so we can move forward and protect thousands of \nvictims, non-Native Americans and Native Americans.\n  The National Congress of American Indians has sent a letter and urged \nSenator Crapo and me to take a serious look at the Issa-Cole \nprovisions. We are. I have consulted with Senators on both sides of the \naisle regarding this proposal so we can find a way forward. I urge the \nHouse Republican leadership to do so as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nNCAI letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 National Congress\n\n\n                                          of American Indians,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 30, 2012.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael D. Crapo,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Crapo: The National \n     Congress of American Indians (NCAI) is pleased to hear that \n     serious efforts may be under way to resolve the impasse \n     between the Senate and the House on the Violence Against \n     Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA). Enhancing the safety of \n     Native women is one of NCAI's highest priorities, and we \n     support immediate passage of a strong, inclusive VAWA bill \n     that contains key protections for Native women, including \n     those contained in Section 904 of the bipartisan Senate VAWA \n     bill that passed earlier this year (S.1925).\n       Section 904 takes small but historic steps to overcome the \n     systemic barriers that prevent equal access to justice for \n     Native women by giving tribes limited authority to prosecute \n     domestic violence and dating violence at the local level. \n     NCAI commends the two of you for your leadership on this \n     provision. We strongly support Section 904 as it stands in \n     S.1925, but we understand the legislative process. A \n     reasonably modified version of Section 904 would be vastly \n     preferable to the current situation on tribal lands.\n       Tribes understand and support protecting the rights of \n     criminal defendants. That is why we support reasonable \n     improvements to Section 904 that would further achieve those \n     ends. For example, tribes are currently urging consideration \n     of a removal provision like that in the bill recently \n     introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives \n     Darrell Issa and Tom Cole. The provision in the Issa/Cole \n     bill would give criminal defendants in tribal court the right \n     to remove prosecutions to federal court for consideration of \n     any constitutional infirmities. It is a concept based loosely \n     on the recently enacted 28 U.S.C. 1455--a federal procedure \n     currently on the books (and sponsored by House Judiciary \n     Committee Chairman Lamar Smith) that permits federal removal \n     of state court criminal cases. We urge you to take a serious \n     look at the Issa/Cole proposal in the coming days.\n       It is the strong hope of tribal leaders that Section 904 \n     will rarely need to be used, but there are several reasons \n     why this provision is so critical. First, it would create a \n     very important and much needed deterrent that is currently \n     lacking, given the absence of tribal jurisdiction over non-\n     Indian domestic violence offenders. Second, serious offenses \n     will most likely continue to be referred for federal \n     prosecution because tribes are far from eager to incur the \n     costs of additional prosecutions and incarcerations. And \n     third, given the long history of the inadequate federal \n     response to crime in Indian country--particularly in \n     misdemeanor-level domestic violence cases--it is imperative \n     that tribal governments have the tools to intervene early and \n     often to protect Native women and prevent the escalation of \n     violence.\n       Under the current scheme, non-Indian perpetrators in Indian \n     country are often shielded from accountability at the expense \n     of the safety of Indian women. Section 904 would help reverse \n     this trend. This provision is essential to the safety of \n     Native women, and NCAI cannot support any VAWA bill that does \n     not contain some form of it (see attached NCAI Resolution \n     #SAC-12-038).

Mr. President, already, eight House Republicans have \nendorsed this approach in a letter to Speaker Boehner urging passage of \nour VAWA legislation with this compromise. I am reaching out to them \nand to members of both parties in both houses of Congress asking them \nto consider how we can bridge differences and get VAWA reauthorization \nlegislation enacted to meaningfully address the brutal violence on \ntribal lands.\n  I remain committed to finding solutions to all the areas of \ncontention between the House and the Senate on VAWA. We ought to be \nable to pass legislation that includes provisions addressing the \nviolence on tribal lands and the need to protect immigrant women and \nthose who have not had access to services because of their sexual \norientation or gender identity. I believe we can find acceptable \nversions of the Senate bill's new protections for students and other \nkey provisions. I am reaching out to the House Republican leadership. I \nlook forward to their seizing this opportunity provided by these senior \nHouse Republicans to work with me and Senator Crapo and the 68 Senators \nfrom both parties who voted for the Leahy-Crapo VAWA bill last April. \nIf we can complete our work and send this bill to the President before \nwe adjourn this year, he will sign it. Because with every day, every \nweek, every month that goes by there are more horrific accounts of \ndomestic and sexual violence. Whether it is a victim in Thetford, VT, \nor Kansas City, we owe it to them to come together to find a \ncompromise.\n  I have said this before several times: I still have nightmares from \nthe domestic violence crime scenes I saw as a prosecutor in Vermont. I \nbecame a prosecutor at a time when many of the laws were changing--\nsearch and seizure laws, Miranda laws, and so forth--and I would go \nwith the police to crime scenes to give them advice on what the new \nlaws might mean. A lot of times those scenes were at 2 or 3 o'clock in \nthe morning. Many times we would see battered women, sometimes women no \nlonger alive. I had nightmares from those. But I remember the police \nnever asked: Is this an immigrant? Is this woman gay or straight? Is \nthis woman Native American? They just wanted to stop the crime from \nhappening again, and this legislation would give them a lot of tools so \nthey can do that. The thought that our inaction could lead to more \nscenes such as those I saw would be tragic.\n  Congress must act now to protect victims of rape and domestic \nviolence. I am optimistic we can move together now that several House \nRepublicans support a compromise position on tribal jurisdiction. I \nlook forward to hearing from the House Republican leadership.\n  Mr. President, I know we are going to vote at 12, so I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me first thank Senator Leahy and \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee for the hearing they held on Terry \nBerg's nomination for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Michigan. I know how hard Senator Leahy works to get these judges \nand their judicial nominations to the floor, and we are deeply \nappreciative for all the efforts over all the years--indeed, may I say \ndecades--of my good friend Senator Leahy.\n  I think every member of the Judiciary Committee who had the chance to \nread the record or to be there during the hearing will agree Mr. Berg \nis an outstanding nominee for our district court bench. I will not go \nthrough all his background. Mr. Berg's qualifications are \nextraordinarily impressive. He will make an excellent addition to the \nEastern District Court. He is going to serve with great distinction, \nand all of us--and I know I speak for Senator Stabenow as well in terms \nof strongly supporting this nomination--thank our colleagues for \nbringing this nomination to the floor and for the strong support it got \nin the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr LEVIN. Mr. President, Terrence, or ``Terry'' Berg, whom the \nPresident has nominated to the federal bench in the District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Michigan, received a ``Well Qualified'' rating \nfrom the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary. He graduated from the Georgetown University Law Center, and \nthen went on to clerk for U.S. District judge. His career has been \ndedicated to public service. Since 2003, he has worked at the United \nStates Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan where he \nhas worked on various cybercrime issues, has supervised criminal, \ncivil, and administrative divisions, and has handled a full fraud case \ndocket, including theft of trade secrets, mortgage fraud, health care \nfraud, corporate fraud and other white collar crime cases. During this \ntime, he received the Assistant Attorney General's Award for \nDistinguished Service and the Director's Award for Superior Performance \nin a Managerial or Supervisory Role.\n  Prior to that service, Mr. Berg worked for the Michigan Attorney \nGeneral where he established and supervised the State's first computer \ncrime prosecution unit. He also served at the U.S. Department of \nJustice here in Washington as a Computer Crime Fellow. He has also \nserved as an adjunct professor at the University of Detroit Mercy \nSchool of Law and the Wayne State University Law School.\n  Mr. Berg has served on the Catholic Lawyers' Society Board of \nDirectors, American Constitution Society and the State Bar of Michigan \nCommittee on Judicial and Professional Ethics and has published \nnumerous articles on cybercrime.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Judge \nWalker on his confirmation vote today. He has been waiting patiently \nsince he was voted out of committee in June, and the Northern District \nof Florida will be well served by his confirmation.\n  A Florida native, Judge Walker was born in Winter Garden.\n  He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Florida \nwhere he graduated first in his class.\n  He earned his law degree at the University of Florida as well.\n  He has clerked for Justice Stephen Grimes of the Florida Supreme \nCourt and Judge Robert Hinkle of the Northern District of Florida.\n  He served as an assistant public defender of Florida's Second \nJudicial Circuit from 1997 to 1999, before then spending a decade in \nprivate practice where he specialized in civil litigation and criminal \ndefense.\n  And since 2009, he has had an outstanding record as a circuit judge, \nliving in Tallahassee.\n  We have another district judge nomination pending on the Senate \ncalendar as well.\n  Judge Brian Davis would fill a judicial emergency for the Middle \nDistrict of Florida, and I urge my colleagues to take up this vote as \nsoon as possible.\n  I hope the Senate can work to eliminate the backlog of nominees \npending on the floor.\n\n[[Page S7660]]\n\n  Even nominees with the support of both home State Senators are being \nheld up.\n  The high level of judicial vacancies across the country puts at risk \nthe ability of all Americans to have a fair hearing in court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate proceeds \nto consideration of H.R. 6156, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6156) to authorize the extension of \n     nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations \n     treatment) to products of the Russian Federation and Moldova \n     and to require reports on the compliance of the Russian \n     Federation with its obligations as a member of the World \n     Trade Organization, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we will soon be voting on whether to \nestablish permanent normal trade relations--otherwise known as PNTR--\nwith Russia and Moldova and to update human rights legislation on \nRussia.\n  We have to take many difficult votes in this Chamber, but this is not \none of them. In fact, this is a rare opportunity to pass a good bill on \nwhich we all can agree.\n  PNTR is good for U.S. jobs. Russia is a fast-growing market. When \nRussia joined the WTO in August, it opened its markets to the other 155 \nmembers of the WTO who have PNTR with Russia. PNTR will give U.S. \nfarmers, ranchers, businesses, and workers new opportunities in Russia \nand new jobs at home.\n  Our competitors in China, Canada, and Europe are now taking advantage \nof these opportunities because they have PNTR with Russia. They already \nhave it. We are the only WTO member missing out on these opportunities. \nIf we now pass PNTR, we could level the playing field and compete. If \nwe compete, we will win. We will sell more beef, we will sell more \naircraft, we will sell more tractors, and we will sell more medical \nequipment. Our banks and insurance companies will grow. PNTR will give \nour knowledge industries greater protections for their intellectual \nproperty, and our farmers will have new tools to fight unscientific \ntrade barriers. If we pass PNTR, American exports to Russia are \nexpected to double in 5 years. This bill has strong enforcement \nprovisions to help ensure that American farmers, ranchers, businesses, \nand exporters get the full benefit of PNTR. This bill has strong human \nrights provisions. Senator Cardin's Magnitsky Act punishes human rights \nviolations in Russia and helps to address the corruption problems \nRussia now faces.\n  In July, the Finance Committee voted unanimously, 24 to 0, in favor \nof PNTR legislation. Last month, the House of Representatives passed \nthe PNTR legislation now before us with 365 ``yes'' votes. Now we need \nto act to pass this bill that supports U.S. jobs. Let's take advantage \nof this opportunity to take a good vote on a good bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of giving U.S. workers and businesses a \nchance to compete and vote in favor of the PNTR.\n  I thank my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch. He is a great person, \nand we have worked very closely. The two of us have worked together, \nand we made a good team to get this legislation passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I want to praise the distinguished \nchairman of the committee. He has done a wonderful job, and, of course, \nhe has been a pleasure to work with.\n  This bill marks an important step forward in our relations with \nRussia and Moldova. Once this bill is signed into law, our workers, job \ncreators, and farmers will be able to take full advantage of Russia and \nMoldova's accession to the WTO.\n  The bill includes strong enforcement provisions to ensure that Russia \nlives up to its international trade obligations. Finally, this bill \nwill help advance human rights and the rule of law in Russia.\n  Today's vote would not be possible without the combined efforts of \nmany dedicated public servants. First, I would like to thank the staff \nat the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Many of them toiled for \nyears to bring Russia and Moldova into the WTO, often at great personal \nsacrifice.\n  I also would like to take a moment to thank my colleagues for all of \ntheir hard work in helping to craft this bill. An open and transparent \ndialogue was critical to our success. And I would particularly like to \nagain express my appreciation to all the Republican members of the \nFinance Committee who worked with me and my staff in good faith to \ndevelop a strong enforcement package which will address many of the \nconcerns we all have regarding our bilateral trade relations with \nRussia.\n  Finally, I would like to thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nBaucus, and his wonderful staff because he and his staff have had a \ngreat willingness to work with us to make sure our concerns were \naddressed in the bill. At the conclusion of my remarks I will provide \nfor the Record a list of names of staff members from both our offices.\n  The process we undertook in the Finance Committee is emblematic of \nhow the Finance Committee should work. It is my sincere hope this will \nbe a model for future legislation. Working together, I am confident we \ncan continue to develop policies to grow our economy through \ninternational trade and, hopefully, help advance the rule of law around \nthe world. This is a good package that deserves our strong support. I \nurge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I believe we have to do more in the international trade world. \nEarlier, due to the efforts of the distinguished chairman, Senator \nBaucus, and his staff and my staff, we were able to get the Korean, \nColombian, and Panamanian treaties through. These were steps in the \nright direction for all of these years, and to have this happen is \ngoing to be a wonderful thing, I think, for our country and for Russia \nitself, and it certainly is going to help us go down the line in doing \nwhat is best for our own trade.\n  One of the other special things that is in this is it is going to \ncause Russia to have to live up to some international trade and \ninternational intellectual property laws. We in this country believe in \nobeying those laws, and I have to say Russia, India, and China have \ninvaded intellectual property in areas they shouldn't have. Hopefully, \nthis type of agreement, PNTR, will help alleviate that problem.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join Senator Baucus and I in voting for \nthis very important bill. Again, I thank staff on both sides for the \nwonderful work they have done and the Trade Representative in his \noffice, as well, for the wonderful work they have done.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                          Human Rights Abusers\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, we are about to take a momentous step \nforward in promoting human rights abroad thanks to my good friend from \nMaryland. Here is a bill that promotes a robust trade relationship \nwhile at the same time using this relationship to advance a very just \ncause: punishing past human rights abusers and inhibiting would-be \nhuman rights abusers.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I couldn't agree more with my friend from Oregon. As some \nof my colleagues know, I am the original sponsor of Sergei Magnitsky \nRule of Law Accountability Act, the standalone bill that then became \nthe human rights title in this combined PNTR bill. I am enormously \nproud of the work we have done on the bill, and I\n\n[[Page S7661]]\n\nthink it has real potential to not only hold people accountable who \nhave committed past human rights abuses, but also potentially to \nprevent future human rights abuses from occurring. Those who are \nresponsible for gross human rights abuses such as torture or \nextrajudicial killings, whether as private citizens or within organs of \nthe State, now know that we, our markets, and our financial system will \nremain closed to them if they do so. These are real material \nconsequences.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I am very glad that my friend from Maryland has drawn \nattention to the forward looking provisions in this bill. It is crucial \nthat while the Secretary of State makes the initial determination as to \nwho should be on this list of gross human rights abusers, this is not \nthe end of the story. On the contrary, there is a continuing oversight \nprocess built into the bill, along with requirements for ongoing \nupdates to the list of human rights abusers. In fact, the chairpersons \nand ranking members of appropriate congressional committees may request \na written response from the Secretary of State as to whether a \nparticular individual has met the threshold required for addition to \nthis list. So whether a person's human rights are being violated \nbecause he or she is a dissident journalist, or a member of an ethnic \nminority group, or LGBT, or simply a citizen exposing wrongdoing, the \nperpetrators will now face real risks and real scrutiny that they did \nnot face before.\n  Mr. CARDIN. That is exactly right. Those who violate the human rights \nof such citizens through torture, extrajudicial killings, or other \ngross violations of international human rights will come to our \nattention. And I look forward to working with my friend from Oregon to \nhelp maintain this vigilance and oversight in the years to come.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. As do I.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to speak on the Russia and \nMoldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law \nAccountability Act that is currently before the Senate. As a cosponsor \nof Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law and Accountability Act, I am very \npleased to see this important human rights legislation move forward, \nand I want to commend Senators Cardin, McCain, and others who have \nworked so hard on this bill for getting us to this point.\n  The bill that we are considering today would repeal the so-called \nJackson-Vanik amendment with respect to Russia, which my colleagues \nknow tied trade relations to the right of free emigration, and replace \nit with a tough new law to impose sanctions on Russians deemed to have \ngrossly violated human rights.\n  The bill is named after Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old lawyer who \ndied on November 16, 2009, in Matrosskaya Tishina Prison in Moscow. He \nwas jailed in 2008 after exposing a massive tax fraud by officials of \nRussia's Interior Ministry. While in jail, he became ill but was denied \nmedical treatment; he was brutally beaten and left to die. This bill is \nclearly targeted to go after the perpetrators of human rights \nviolations in Russia, including those involved in the death of Sergei \nMagnitsky, and would require the President name and sanction those \nindividuals, subject to a waiver for national security interests. Those \nlisted by the President could be denied visas to enter the United \nStates and have their assets frozen by the U.S. Treasury Department.\n  Just yesterday the Washington Post ran a large spread detailing the \ncurrent state of political affairs in Russia. I want to read an excerpt \nfrom that article:\n\n       Since his return to the presidency in March, (President \n     Vladimir) Putin has relentlessly demonstrated his \n     determination to quell dissent.\n       In an apparent attempt to scare off demonstrators, 17 \n     protesters are being prosecuted for their part in a May 6 \n     rally on the eve of Putin's inauguration, accused of \n     attacking police officers. One has already been sentenced to \n     4\\1/2\\ years in prison.\n       A newly passed law defines treason so broadly that some \n     Russians are afraid that even associating with foreigners \n     could put them at peril. The penalties for slander and \n     violations of rules governing rallies have been toughened. As \n     of Nov. 21, nongovernmental organizations that receive money \n     from abroad must register as foreign \n     agents . . .\n       . . . One by one, opposition leaders have come under \n     intense pressure. Alexei Navalny, the anti-corruption \n     blogger, has been charged with bribery in a recently \n     resurrected three-year-old case. Sergei Udaltsov, a socialist \n     leader, has been charged with plotting mass disorder.\n       One of his associates, Leonid Razvozzhayev, accused Russian \n     authorities of abducting him in Ukraine, where he was seeking \n     asylum. On Nov. 22, Russian investigators said they would not \n     investigate the case because Razvozzhayev had not presented \n     convincing evidence that he had been spirited out of Ukraine.\n       In September, Gennady Gudkov, like Putin a former KGB \n     agent, was stripped of his parliamentary seat after he \n     aligned himself with protesters.\n\n  The article goes on to detail further acts of intimidation by the \nRussian Government aimed at voices of dissent. It makes clear that \ndespite all of the talk of a ``reset'' in U.S.-Russia relations, this \nis not a regime that shares our values when it comes to democratic \nfreedoms and other human rights.\n  Over the last several weeks, there have been news reports that the \nKremlin has claimed this bill in some way infringes on Russian \nsovereignty. That is simply not the case. The bill does not require the \nRussian Government to take any action against human rights abusers it \ndoes not want, but it does say that those abusers may not enter the \nUnited States or access our financial system. This bill reaffirms our \nvalues, and makes a clear statement that the United States stands for \ndignity, respect, and the rule of law when it comes to internationally \nrecognized human rights.\n  Finally, I do want to say a few words about the trade facilitation \naspects of this bill. By repealing Jackson-Vanik with respect to Russia \nand Moldova, this bill will ensure that U.S. businesses and their \nemployees will be able to realize the benefits of Russia's and \nMoldova's membership in the World Trade Organization. With respect to \nRussia, these benefits include additional market access for U.S. \nservice providers and civil aircraft; improved intellectual property \nenforcement; consistent science-based sanitary and phytosanitary \nmeasures; and new dispute settlement tools to enforce WTO rules.\n  Last year, Maine exported $14 million worth of goods to Russia, \nincluding $8.1 million worth of aircraft parts and $5 million worth of \ncattle. Granting Russia PNTR can help cement this trade relationship by \nproviding U.S. businesses more certainty that their investments will be \nprotected. A Peterson Institute for International Economics study \nestimates that the volume of U.S. exports of merchandise and services \nto Russia could double from $11 billion in 2011 to $22 billion over \nabout 5 years as a result of granting Russian permanent normal trade \nrelations, or PNTR.\n  Additionally, the bill includes strong reporting requirements on \nRussia's compliance with its WTO commitments and directs the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to develop a plan for action on areas where Russia does \nnot live up to its WTO requirements.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I come to the floor today in support of \napproving permanent normal trade relations with Russia.\n  Over the past several years, I have often come to the floor in favor \nof free-trade agreements and other efforts to expand market access for \nU.S. exports. This legislation is yet another one of those \nopportunities. This vote to repeal a 1970s trade law and recognize \nRussia as a member of the WTO will result in increased export \nopportunities for U.S. manufacturers, farmers, and ranchers. Increased \nexports lead to increased job creation.\n  Russia is the world's ninth largest economy, with a population of 142 \nmillion and a growing middle class. Russia is already a significant \ntrading partner importing over $10 billion annually from the United \nStates. In just a 5-year period, Nebraska's exports to Russia increased \nfourfold. In fact, in 2011 alone, total exports of goods from Nebraska \nwere valued at $154 million.\n  I believe we have the opportunity to continue this impressive trend \nby recognizing Russia as a WTO member. A vote in favor of this \nlegislation will level the playing field for U.S. job creators looking \nto take advantage of these growing export opportunities. This is \nespecially true for Nebraska's\n\n[[Page S7662]]\n\nequipment and machinery manufacturers. My State has a reputation for \nproducing some of the most sophisticated irrigation equipment in the \nworld.\n  Acknowledging Russia's membership in the WTO will reduce tariffs on \nthis technology from 10 percent to 5 percent--allowing U.S.-based \ncompanies to compete more effectively with others around the globe. \nAdditionally, other agriculture equipment and machinery manufacturers \nin Nebraska and elsewhere will see tariffs reduced or eliminated. \nCurrently, these tariff rates are up to 25 percent. They will \neventually drop to an average well below 10 percent when Russia meets \nall of its WTO commitments. This is a big deal beyond any single state \nor sector.\n  Total U.S. agricultural exports to Russia are forecast at more than \n$1.4 billion for 2012, and this further opens the doors of opportunity. \nHere is another example: As part of the WTO accession process, Russia \nis required to lower its tariffs on U.S. beef products to 15 percent. \nAdditionally, Russia must allow a greater volume of frozen beef \nimports. The quota will nearly triple: from approximately 22,000 tons \nin 2010 to 60,000 tons. Meat production is a big part of our \nagricultural economy--in my home State and in our country--so this is \nnoteworthy.\n  Now, our agricultural producers will be the first to tell you that \nthey don't think Russia always plays fair in the world of exports. They \nsay Russia sometimes offers unjustifiable reasons to block our \nproducts. The fact is, Russia has a less-than-stellar record on \nestablishing predictable, science-based import standards. So our \nproducers have not always had reasonable access to its markets.\n  As Secretary of Agriculture, I relentlessly negotiated with Russia \nand other trading partners to grant the same access to their markets \nfor our agricultural products as we granted to their products. This \nseems fair, right? They should offer us the same access we offer them? \nBut based on Russia's track record on U.S. meat exports, especially \npork and poultry, I continue to have concerns. That is part of the \nreason I have decided we should recognize their membership in the WTO.\n  The WTO has been an important tool for the United States to level the \nplaying field for our products in the international trading system. \nRussia will be obligated to apply international food safety standards. \nThis should mean more certainty and predictable market access for U.S. \nagricultural products. And these obligations will be enforceable \nthrough the use of WTO dispute settlement mechanisms.\n  Integrating Russia into a rules-based trading system and providing \nthe means to enforce those rules will further strengthen the ability of \nU.S. businesses to export products to Russia. But this is an area where \nwe will need to show great vigilance. As Russia implements its trade \ncommitments, the administration must ensure that Russia does not revert \nto its old ways on trade. Further delay in repealing Jackson-Vanik \nwould only hurt us.\n  On August 22, Russia formally joined the WTO after a lengthy process. \nOver 150 other nations have already taken action and are reaping the \nexport benefits. The United States has been left in the dust. Until we \nact, we cannot enjoy the lowered tariffs, increased market access, \ndispute settlement process, and other benefits of Russia's membership \nin the WTO. Thus, we should vote to repeal Jackson-Vanik and accept \nRussia as a permanent trading partner.\n  The move ensures that American businesses are not disadvantaged and \nlosing market share to their competitors. Russia already has access to \nthe U.S. market, so additional delay on PNTR only hurts our workers and \ncompanies. Delaying action will only result in the delay of job \ncreation and more lost opportunities for American manufactures, \nfarmers, and ranchers.\n  Our efficient export system, including handling, processing and \ndistribution of our goods and agricultural products, creates millions \nof U.S. jobs. At a time when we face some very serious challenges in \nour country related to debt, deficit, and unemployment, it makes sense \nto unlock this door of opportunity. Thus, I support removing \napplication of Jackson-Vanik and intend to vote for PNTR with Russia. \nThis status would help to level the playing field for U.S. exporters.\n  I encourage my colleagues to consider the economic impacts of this \nbill on our Nation's manufactures, farmers, ranchers, and other job \ncreators, and I look forward to voting to support normalizing trade \nwith Russia.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today I wish to thank my colleagues for \ntheir support of legislation granting permanent normal trade relations \nto Russia and Moldova. This legislation allows U.S. businesses to take \nfull advantage of trade opportunities in Russia and Moldova following \ntheir accession to the World Trade Organization. Legislation \nnormalizing our trade relations with both these countries has taken \nyears to complete. It is important to note that, while the WTO \naccession process opened the door for U.S. businesses to take greater \nadvantage of trade with Russia, we have created a number of new \nenforcement mechanisms which, in this, will, I very much hope, hold \nRussia accountable for meeting their international obligations.\n  This process and its success would not have been possible without the \nleadership our chairman, Senator Baucus. I deeply appreciate his \nwillingness to work with me to address the many concerns I and our \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee had with Russia's accession \npackage. It is truly a pleasure to be working with someone so fully \ncommitted to opening markets and securing new opportunities for U.S. \nworkers and job creators in the international marketplace. I hope our \nwork together on this bill will be just the beginning of a long and \nfruitful partnership.\n  I would like to acknowledge a few of the many people who helped make \nthis a successful process. First, I would like to recognize the efforts \nof the U.S. Trade Representative's Office who assisted in the very long \nprocess of assembling the Russia WTO accession. Special recognition \nmust go to Elizabeth Hafner, Director for Russia and Eurasia; Catherine \nField, Deputy General Counsel for Negotiations, Legislation and \nAdministrative Law; Cecilia Klein, Senior Director for WTO Accessions; \nStephanie Murphy, Director for Agricultural Affairs; Scott Pietan, \nDirector for Industry Trade Policy; and Thomas Fine, Director for \nServices Trade Negotiations. I would also like to recognize former \nmembers of the USTR Office who dedicated many years to this process, \nincluding Dorothy Dwoskin, Matt Rohde, and Chris Wilson, who all served \nas former Assistant United States Trade Representative for the World \nTrade Organization and Multilateral Affairs, as well as the current \nAUSTR, Mark Linscott.\n  Senator Baucus staff was instrumental in helping us advance this \nprocess and craft today's bill. I would like to thank them for all of \ntheir efforts. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Russ \nSullivan, the majority staff director of the Finance Committee; chief \ninternational trade counsel Amber Cottle; international trade counsels \nBruce Hirsh and Lisa Pearlman; trade advisors, Chelsea Thomas and Hun \nQuach; international trade analyst, Rory Murphy; and their detailee \nfrom Customs and Border Protection, Heather Sykes.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize my dedicated and hardworking \nstaff. In particular, I would like to thank the staff director of my \nFinance Committee staff, Chris Campbell; my chief international trade \ncounsel, Everett Eissenstat; international trade counsels Paul DeLaney \nand Greg Kalbaugh; our detaliee from Customs and Border protection, \nRichard Chovanec; our detailee from the Department of Commerce, Steven \nGarrett; and our international trade staff sssistant, Rebecca Nasca. \nThey worked tirelessly to help prepare this bill for our consideration, \nand I am grateful for their hard work and dedication.\n  We can all be proud of this bill. It provides significant new tools \nto battle corruption within Russia while at the same time enabling U.S. \nworkers and job creators to take full advantage of Russia's membership \nin the World Trade Organization. I look forward to President Obama \nsigning it into law as soon as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Utah. He is a \ngood man. I also thank staff who helped put this bill together. Amber \nCottle, on my side, and Everett\n\n[[Page S7663]]\n\nEissenstat, who works for Senator Hatch, worked very hard. They lead \nvery good, trained teams, I might add. They are very talented, able \nfolks.\n  I see this too as a vote to help propel us to the next level of trade \nexpansion. One is the TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is being \nworked on by the United States and other Asian countries. I think it is \na dramatic opportunity for growth.\n  Second, working with Europe, the potential free-trade agreement with \nEurope, there has been a lot of interest in Europe joining the United \nStates and reducing barriers to trade. It is a great opportunity that \nwe should take advantage of. Obviously, that raises another question, \nwhich is trade promotion authority. Next year Congress and I will work \nto get trade promotion authority passed so we can include these trade \nagreements and help American companies and, equally importantly, help \nAmerican consumers because American consumers and American workers are, \nfrankly, helped dramatically by properly negotiated trade agreements \nwhen it is in the best interests of the United States.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for all she does too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Madam President, this morning Senator McConnell came to the \nfloor. He made a serious offer dealing with the debt ceiling--one of \nthe most important issues facing this country. As I said, it is a \nserious offer. I have not personally read it. My staff looked at it, \nand it is important enough that I would like to have a vote on it this \nafternoon. I need to have a caucus and explain to my troops what this \nis all about. If we can work something out with Senator McConnell, I \nwould like to have a vote sometime this afternoon. I do need to have a \ncaucus. We have another vote right now, and if my Republican colleagues \nthink there is not a chance of having a vote this afternoon--I can only \ndo it by unanimous consent. If someone is going to object to it, they \nshould do it now and we will arrange another time to address this \nissue.\n  So the issue is that Senator McConnell has made a proposal on how we \nhandle the debt ceiling, and we have to get permission from my \nRepublican colleagues as to whether we can have a vote on it this \nafternoon at a time that would be as convenient as possible. I don't \nthink we need a lot of time to debate it. We have done that lots of \ntimes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, how about 1 p.m.?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I know there are airplanes that people \nwant to leave in, but this is very important. This vote will end at \nabout 1 p.m. I scheduled the caucus for 1:30 p.m. There is no reason we \ncouldn't start the caucus at 1:05 p.m. We can move it up.\n  I need some direction from my Republican colleagues. So if I hear no \none yelling no, then we will go ahead and schedule this as soon as we \ncan this afternoon, to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I know there are those on my side \nwho would also like to have a conference to talk about this. Could we \nhave an indication as to the timeframe of the vote?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, to my friend from Texas, the conference we \nwill have won't take very long--half an hour, maybe 45 minutes. I am \nsure we could finish that by 1:45 p.m. or something like that, and we \ncould have a vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7663-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7663-S7664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE SESSION--Continued\n\n\n                  Vote on Nomination of Mark E.

Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, what \nwe are talking about is a perpetual debt ceiling grant, in effect, to \nthe President. Matters of this level of controversy always require 60 \nvotes. So I would ask my friend, the majority leader, if he would \nmodify his consent request to set the threshold for this vote at 60?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, what we \nhave is a case of Republicans in the Senate once again not taking \n``yes'' for an answer.\n  This morning, the Republican leader asked consent to have a vote on \nhis proposal. Just now I told everyone we are willing to have that \nvote, an up-or-down vote. But now the Republican leader objects to his \nown idea. So I guess we have a filibuster of his own bill. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, what just transpired deserves a word. \nSenator McConnell came to the floor this morning and offered a change \nin law that would help us avoid the kind of obstruction and the kind of \nshowdowns that we have had in the past over the debt ceiling. In fact, \nthe idea was not new. It was his original idea that has been the law of \nthe land and followed. He offered and challenged Senator Reid to bring \nthis matter for consideration in the Senate.\n  Senator Reid just agreed to it. He said he would bring this to a vote \nin 20 minutes, and we would decide, up or down, whether the debt \nceiling problem would be resolved once and for all under Senator \nMcConnell's proposal. Then Senator McConnell objected--objected--\nsaying: No, no, we need 60 votes.\n  For those who do not follow the Senate, 60 votes is the equivalent of \na filibuster vote--breaking a filibuster vote. So this may be a moment \nin Senate history when a Senator made a proposal and, when given an \nopportunity for a vote on that proposal, filibustered his own proposal. \nI think we have now reached a new spot in the history of the Senate we \nhave never seen before.\n  I am going to ask the Parliamentarian to look into this. I do not \nthink this has ever happened before. But it calls into question whether \nthis was the kind of offer that one would consider to be good faith--if \nSenator Reid offered a vote on it, and Senator McConnell said, no, it \nhas to be 60, it has to be a filibuster-proof vote.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my colleague, the distinguished assistant majority \nleader, yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Is it also correct, basically, if we had voted, we \nwould have guaranteed we would not place the country again in a \nsituation of defaulting on our bills; that we would send a message that \nwe can work together--the fact that we were willing to accept the \nRepublican leader's proposal and be willing to send a message that as a \nSenate we want to make sure we have fiscal stability, we are paying our \nbills, that this could be one step forward in making sure we can \nresolve the fiscal issues for the country? Isn't that the Senator's \nview of this as well; that, in fact, it would be an important message \nabout stability?\n  I also have to say, I share the Senator's amazement that the leader \nwould, in fact, object to his own proposal and now be filibustering his \nown proposal that we were willing to accept as a bipartisan, good-faith \neffort for the country. Didn't he just take us in a wrong direction?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I say in response to the Senator from \nMichigan, the Senate Republican leader, Senator McConnell, has such a \nstrong appetite for the filibuster that we have seen 386 or 387 \nfilibusters in the last 6 years, and now he has decided another good \nidea is to propose a bill and then filibuster your own bill. I do \nbelieve that is history in the making. But that is why this appetite \nfor the filibuster in the Senate has to change.\n  What an abuse, that we cannot have a majority vote on something the \nRepublicans proposed and the Democrats were prepared to vote for. This \nwould have been a true bipartisan measure, good news--maybe leading the \nnews--across America. It really is unfortunate.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the assistant majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will yield, I have business here and then he \nwill get the floor right back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7664-3", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7664-S7672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRANSACTION ACCOUNT GUARANTEE PROGRAM EXTENSION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, we saw what happened here--the minority \nleader filibustering his own bill. He should have trusted his first \ninstincts. Imagine if we would have passed the minority leader's \nresolution: The markets would have been jubilant, stocks\n\n[[Page S7665]]\n\nwould have gone up, one of the great specters hanging over our \neconomy--that we would not raise the debt ceiling--would have been \ngreatly mitigated in terms of damage and danger. We could move on to \nthe real issues of dealing with the fiscal cliff and dealing with our \ndebt situation and not have a debt ceiling hanging out there as a \ndiversionary but dangerous issue.\n  But for some reason--inexplicable--the minority leader, the \nRepublican leader, changed his mind. Now he said on the floor, well, \nimportant measures deserve 60 votes. But when he brought it up earlier, \nhe acted as if he was in favor of it. He was offering it. Now, of \ncourse, he is saying, no, he is going to object to his own resolution. \nI wish he would reconsider.\n  Again, using the debt ceiling as leverage, using the debt ceiling as \na threat, using the debt ceiling as a way to achieve a different agenda \nis dangerous. It is playing with fire. Yet, with the opportunity to \ntake that off the table, reassure the markets, the minority leader \nblinked. I do not know why. It is hard to figure out the strategy that \nhe is employing. But we would hope on this side of the aisle--and I \nthink I speak for all of us--that he would reconsider and, perhaps, \nearly next week let us vote on his own resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Facing Challenges\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, today I would like to speak on several \nimportant issues pending before the Senate--issues that I believe are \nrelated.\n  I want to speak first about the recent proposal to change the rules \nof the Senate with a simple majority vote.\n  Second, and related, I want to talk about the need for consensus and \nbipartisanship to address our Nation's pressing challenges; \nspecifically, the fiscal cliff that we face.\n  We must, and in fact we can, find consensus and agreement. We have \ndone it before. We have done it in building a good solid farm bill \nwhich actually found $23 billion in savings toward the deficit. We did \nit in passing a strong highway bill that will strengthen our Nation's \ninfrastructure. We did it most recently this week in working through a \nlarge and complex Defense authorization bill that will keep our Nation \nsafer and more secure in these perilous times.\n  It will take more of this kind of cooperation and consensus building \nto address the very real and substantial challenges facing our Nation \ntoday. That is why I am deeply concerned about a proposal floated \nrecently by some Members of the majority regarding the rules of the \nSenate. They propose to change the nearly 100-year-old Senate rule that \nrequires a two-thirds majority to change the operating rules of the \nSenate.\n  Our colleagues in the majority are proposing to use a simple majority \nvote to make the change. That is the issue here. The issue is the \nmanner in which they plan to do it. Once the precedent of changing a \nrule with a simple majority vote is established, 51 Senators could \nchange the rules to suit their own convenience. In other words, they \nwant to break the rules in order to change the rules.\n  That would be a big mistake. That would be, as the majority leader \nhimself said in his own book, the death of the Senate. Votes that \nrequire a supermajority serve a very valuable function in the Senate. \nThey encourage consensus, they encourage bipartisanship, and they make \ncertain that the minority has a voice in the lawmaking of this body.\n  In recent history, both Democrats and Republicans have held the \nmajority. In fact, it was not that long ago that the Democrats \nthemselves were adamantly opposed to changing the rules of the \nfilibuster. They argued that doing so could bring an end to a century-\nold tradition of bipartisan consensus building in the Senate and \ndiminish the influence of minority voices. The reality is, we are now \nat a point in our history when bipartisanship and consensus is exactly \nwhat we need.\n  Laws passed by a narrow majority will only fuel greater partisanship \nand greater divisiveness. We need both parties working together so that \nwhen we are done we can say, this is a plan the American people can \nagree on. That is the kind of approach we need to address the economic \nchallenges that are posed by the fiscal cliff. We need bipartisanship \nand we need consensus building.\n  With bipartisan consensus, I believe we can avert the fiscal cliff \nlooming before us and put our Nation on a sustainable fiscal path. To \ndo anything less could put our Nation and our future at risk. In little \nmore than a month, nearly $400 billion in tax increases will combine \nwith sequestration; more than 100 billion in mandatory across-the-board \nspending cuts over 1 year, to drag our Nation over the so-called fiscal \ncliff.\n  What those tax increases mean to the average American family of four \nearning $50,000 a year is over $2,000 in higher income taxes. Add to \nthat expiration of the alternative minimum tax patch new taxes mandated \nby the Federal health care bill, and the reinstatement of the death \ntax, which will impact the next generation of farmers, ranchers, and \nsmall business owners, and Americans will see the largest tax increase \nin the history of our country.\n  If all of this happens, the Congressional Budget Office predicts the \nNation's economy will shrink next year, and the unemployment rate could \nrise again. In other words, we go back into recession. I believe we can \navoid the fiscal cliff and address our massive deficit. But that \nrequires doing three essential steps: reforming our Tax Code, reforming \nentitlement programs, and better controlling our spending. We can get \nadditional revenue by reforming our Tax Code. That means closing \nloopholes and limiting deductions.\n  By closing loopholes and limiting deductions, we can make the Tax \nCode simpler and fairer to stimulate growth in our economy. Markets get \nthe kind of certainty they need to invest, to grow, and to hire. It is \na growing economy, a growing economic base that creates more jobs and \nrevenue, not higher taxes.\n  The simple fact is we must make America a great place to do business \nagain. Our progrowth strategies in my home State of North Dakota have \nbroadened our economic base and raised revenue without raising taxes. \nThat has resulted in the lowest unemployment rate in the Nation, \ngrowing personal income, and, rather than a deficit, a budget surplus.\n  In addition to progrowth tax reform, we also need to start a fair and \nthoughtful process to reform entitlement programs. If we do not, they \nwill not be sound and solvent for future generations. For example, \nMedicare's Hospital Service Program is in serious financial trouble. In \na report this spring, the Medicare trustees cautioned that the trust \nfund that covers the program's hospital services will be depleted and \nconsequently insolvent by 2024.\n  The fact is, we can accomplish entitlement reform in a way that does \nnot change programs for people at or near retirement, yet ensures that \nthose promises will be there for our children and grandchildren down \nthe road when they need them. Republicans and Democrats should be able \nto come together, as should older and younger Americans, because \nthoughtful entitlement reform is in everybody's interests.\n\n  Finally, we need to control our spending. Our Federal deficit for the \nfiscal year 2012 was $1.1 trillion. Our national debt is now more than \n$16 trillion. That is unsustainable. More revenues from tax reform and \neconomic growth, combined with entitlement reform and controlling \nspending, will reduce our deficit and our debt. There is no question we \ncan do it. For example, we can help make a downpayment on our deficit \nreduction right now by passing the farm bill we put together in this \nChamber.\n  The farm bill version we passed with broad bipartisan support in the \nSenate would save $23 billion over 10 years. The House version, which \nhas been passed out of committee and is now pending on the floor, would \nsave $35 billion. Passing a good farm bill can be part of the solution \nfor the fiscal cliff.\n\n[[Page S7666]]\n\nThe reality is, solving our Nation's fiscal problems is achievable. We \ncan find real budget savings in a far more thoughtful way than doing it \nthrough sequestration: Reforming our Tax Code, reforming entitlement \nprograms, and better control of our spending will work.\n  Add a measure of good-faith bipartisanship and we can get our Nation \ngrowing again. We can get people back to work. For the sake of our \ncountry, we need to do it and we need to do it now.\n\n\n                       Honoring our Armed Forces\n\n                  Sergeant First Class Darren M. Linde\n\n                      Specialist Tyler J. Orgaard\n\n  I rise today to honor the lives of two North Dakota soldiers who were \nkilled in action on Monday, December 3, in southern Afghanistan while \nserving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. SFC Darren M. Linde \nand SPC Tyler J. Orgaard were both members of the North Dakota National \nGuard assigned to the 818th Engineer Company.\n  Their unit had been tasked with an important but dangerous mission. \nThey were conducting a route clearance operation when their vehicle \nstruck an IED on Monday, fatally injuring both men and wounding SPC Ian \nPlacek, who is currently undergoing medical treatment in Germany. We \npray for his full recovery.\n  Today we honor the lives of Sergeant First Class Linde and Specialist \nOrgaard. Our thoughts and our prayers are with their families and their \nfriends as well.\n  Sergeant First Class Linde of Devils Lake, ND, led a distinguished \nmilitary career since enlisting in North Dakota National Guard in 1990. \nDuring the course of his career, he served with the North Dakota \nNational Guard as well as the United States Army and the Montana \nNational Guard. He earned several recognitions for his valor, including \nthe Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, and Army \nGood Conduct Medal. Since 2009, he worked as a full-time instructor \nwith the North Dakota National Guard's 164th Regional Train Institute, \nCamp Grafton Training Center in Devils Lake.\n  Sergeant First Class Linde was a devoted and selfless leader as well \nas a committed family man. He enjoyed spending time with his family and \nfriends. He is survived by his wife Adrienne and four children.\n  Specialist Tyler Orgaard of Bismarck, ND, joined the North Dakota \nNational Guard shortly before his 2001 graduation from Bismarck Century \nHigh School, where he was a member of the Century Patriots wrestling \nteam and began competing in the Impact Fighting Championships. He was \npassionate about training in mixed martial arts. His family and friends \nknew him to be an extremely disciplined, hard-working man who served \nhis country with great pride.\n  This was Specialist Orgaard's first overseas deployment. For his \ncommendable service, he has been awarded the Bronze Star Medal, Purple \nHeart, Army Good Conduct Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal.\n  Specialist Orgaard is survived by many loving friends and family \nincluding his parents, Josephine and Jesse Orgaard. For the service and \nsacrifice of these brave men, we offer our thanks. We pledge to honor \ntheir lives through our commitment to supporting our troops and \nveterans and by remembering their lives of service.\n  My wife Mikey and I also join our fellow North Dakotans and Americans \nin extending our deepest sympathy to the families of Sergeant First \nClass Linde and Specialist Orgaard. We recognize that these men have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our Nation. We will remain \nforever grateful for their selfless service and commitment to defending \nthe principles of liberty and justice that continue to guide our \ncountry.\n  May God bless and continue to watch over their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Senator DeMint\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I wanted to be recognized for 10 minutes \nto talk about the decision by Senator DeMint to leave the Senate next \nyear. But I wish to say to my friend from North Dakota, all of us have \nin our prayers the loss of our soldiers there and all of the soldiers \nwho have been in a tough, long, hard war.\n  I met with Jim DeMint this morning. To say I was stunned is an \nunderstatement. Jim indicated to me that he will be retiring from the \nSenate next year and taking over the presidency of the Heritage \nFoundation, one of the great conservative think tanks here in \nWashington.\n  My reaction for the people of South Carolina is: You have lost a \ngreat, strong conservative voice, someone who has championed the \nconservative cause and represented our State with distinction, \nsincerity, and a great deal of passion. On a personal level, I have \nlost my colleague and friend. Jim and I have known each other for \nalmost 20 years now. I think we have done a pretty darn good job for \nSouth Carolina, at times playing the good cop, the bad cop, but always \ntrying to work together. What differences we have had have been \nsincere.\n  That is the word I would use about Senator DeMint. He sincerely \nbelieves in his causes. He is a conservative voice that people in our \nparty look to for leadership and guidance. What he has done over the \nlast 4 to 6 years to build a conservative movement to get people \ninvolved in politics, such as Marco Rubio, whom Jim helped early on in \nhis primary, I think is going to be a great legacy. From a State point \nof view, we have lost one of our great champions. Jim and Debbie have \nraised four wonderful children. They have great grandkids. I know Jim \nis looking forward to staying involved and pushing the conservative \noutside the body. He was an effective voice in the Senate, whether you \nagreed with Jim or not. He really did strongly and passionately \nadvocate for his positions and did it very effectively.\n  Jim made the Republican Party, quite frankly, look inward and do some \nself-evaluation. Conservatism is an asset, not a liability, as we try \nto govern this country in the 21st century. I look forward to staying \nin touch with Jim and to working with him at the Heritage Foundation to \nsee what we can do to improve the fate of our country so we will not \nbecome Greece.\n  No one is more worried about this Nation's unsustainable debt \nsituation than Senator DeMint. I have seen him evolve over time as \nsomeone who could not sit quietly anymore, who had to take up the \ncause.\n  In the 2010 election cycle, he was one of the strongest voices we had \nthat we had lost our way in Washington. I know Jim to be a very kind, \nsincere man. He is an individual who is a joy to be around.\n  But when it comes to what is going on in America, I think Jim \nunderstands that if we don't make some changes and make them quickly, \nwe are going to lose our way of life. That is what has driven him above \nall else. He is trying to keep this country the land of the free and \nthe home of the brave, where people's hard work is rewarded--not \npunished--where we have a chance to come from nowhere to be anything, \nincluding President of the United States. Jim is right to say our debt \nis unsustainable, that Washington does too much, and there is a better \nway.\n  I will look forward to working with Jim in the private sector. From a \npersonal point of view, we have had a great ride together. It has been \nfun, it has been challenging, and I think we put South Carolina on the \nmap in different ways at different times. To people back in South \nCarolina, I hope if they get to see Jim anytime soon, say thank you. \nBecause whether they agree with Senator DeMint, he was doing what he \nthought was best for South Carolina and the United States.\n  At the end of the day, that is as good as it gets. Because if someone \nis doing what they truly believe in and not worried about being the \nmost popular or people getting mad at them, then one can do a good job \nin Washington. To the people back in South Carolina, everything Jim has \ntried to do has been motivated by changing the country, making South \nCarolina the best we could be at home.\n  So if you get a chance, run into Jim anytime soon or in the coming \ndays, please say thank you because he did his job as he saw fit. He did \nwhat he thought was best, and he didn't worry about being the most \npopular or taking on people when he thought he was right.\n  I can tell you this. When it comes to me, he has always been a \nfriend, somebody I could count on personally. We\n\n[[Page S7667]]\n\nenjoyed our time together. I was stunned this morning. Jim has an \nunlimited bright future in the private sector. I will say more next \nyear when his time comes to an end.\n  But on behalf of all of us in South Carolina, I wish to say to Jim \nand Debbie, thank you very much for taking time away from your family, \nfighting the good fight, and pressing issues you passionately believe \nin. I wish to thank Jim and Debbie both for being my friends. You all \nboth mean a great deal to me, and I am confident the best is yet to \ncome for both of you.\n  On behalf of the people of South Carolina, great job, well done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will associate my remarks with Senator Graham and say \nhow much I have appreciated working with Jim DeMint. He is courageous, \ndetermined, and principled. He has a vision for America, and he has \nadvocated for it every single day. He stood, sometimes alone, to \nadvocate for those views. He is smart, he is intelligent, and he is \ngood. It has been my pleasure to work with him and actually to support \nhim.\n  I have consistently felt his values and views were beneficial to \nAmerica, and we can all disagree sometimes about how to accomplish \nthem, but we can't just go along all the time. Sometimes we have to \nrock the boat, and he was willing to do that. I so much have enjoyed \nworking with him.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  I wished to share a few thoughts, as ranking Member on the Budget \nCommittee, concerning the proposal that the President has made through \nSecretary Geithner toward fixing the fiscal cliff that has been talked \nabout so much. I just want to say, sadly, that the facts disprove what \nthey have alleged their plan would do.\n  We have looked at the numbers. There is no real mystery about this. \nThere are gimmicks and manipulations in the way they have expressed \nwhat they intend to accomplish that I think are beyond the pale and the \nAmerican people need to know it is not accurate.\n  This would not be possible if we had the plan on the floor so it \ncould be voted on in the light of day. But we all know what the plan \nis, the scheme is, the strategy is. It is to meet in secret and then \nplop down on the floor of the Senate, at the last hour, some sort of \ncoerced agreement that all Senators--like lemmings--are supposed to \nvote for.\n  We are supposed to expect that the American people will believe the \nagreement is what the President says it is, but that is not, in \nreality, what is occurring. Secretary Geithner met with Senate and \nHouse Members last week to present a proposal, and the President made a \nnumber of claims. He says the proposal Secretary Geithner made will fix \nour debt. He said his proposal will make our debt ``stable and \nsustainable.''\n  Both of those claims are untrue. He also claimed his proposal \ncontains $2 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases--not so.\n  Secretary Geithner has been around a while. He knows these numbers \naren't accurate. It is disappointing to me to see him come in with so \nmuch bluster. In an interview yesterday he said: We are going to go off \nthe cliff unless Republicans agree to what we demand, and we can't have \na debt ceiling anymore. To have to debate that causes controversy. We \ndon't want a debt ceiling anymore. Those were basically, as I heard him \nhubristically suggest, nonnegotiable positions. The plan called for \n$1.6 trillion in new taxes, twice what the President asked for in the \ncampaign. He asked for $800 billion during the campaign. Now he wants \n$1.6 trillion in new taxes.\n  So far, even with $1.6 trillion in new taxes, there is more than $1 \ntrillion in spending increases. Far from fixing our debt, our debt will \ngrow over the next 10 years by nearly $9 trillion. That is almost $1 \ntrillion a year, on average. It goes up in the last number of years.\n  So we remain on an unsustainable course with our debt continuing to \nsurge out of control. We are projected, based on our debt now, to have \nour interest payment on the money we borrowed exceed the defense budget \nin just 7 years. These are facts.\n  Spending under that plan would increase $1 trillion above the levels \nagreed to in the Budget Control Act, as signed into law. We agreed to \nthe Budget Control Act 16 months ago, in August 2011, and we raised the \ndebt ceiling and agreed to reduce spending. We raised the debt ceiling \n$2.1 trillion and agreed to reduce spending $2.1 trillion. The \nPresident's plan would take out over $1.1 trillion of those spending \nlimitations that are in current law. I repeat, spending will increase \nmore than $1 trillion above the already projected growth in spending.\n  Our spending is growing. It is not decreasing. It is already \nprojected to grow, but the President's proposal is to have it grow even \nfaster than the law currently calls for.\n  I don't believe the numbers I have presented can be disputed. They \ncan spend, and they can say things and mix up baselines and confuse the \nAmerican people, but the plan he has outlined does just what I \ndescribed. It is not much different from the budget the President \nsubmitted this last February. As a matter of fact, it is very similar \nto it. What did that budget do? It increased taxes by $1.8 trillion, \nand it increased spending by about $1.4 trillion.\n  So this is the kind of path we are being asked to take. I don't think \nthe American people would agree to that.\n  There are other increases in spending other than the elimination of \nthe $1.2 trillion sequester cuts that were agreed to last year. For \ninstance, more than $170 billion has been in new spending, arises from \nmore stimulus spending and as an unpaid for increase in Medicare \nreimbursements, the doc fix, that is going to be due and will cost $394 \nbillion. That is almost $400 billion that is not currently funded--and \nwill have to be funded--that they have ignored, they have left it out \nof the budget, which makes it look $400 billion better than it is.\n  We have to count that money. Together, that is almost $1.8 trillion \nin new spending. But the only cuts that the White House offers are $600 \nbillion in mandatory spending reductions, basically cutting the \nproviders of Medicare, it appears to us. In other words, the doctors \nand the hospitals that already took a cut to fund ObamaCare will now be \nasked to take another $600 billion in cuts. They tell the seniors: \nDon't worry. We are not cutting your Medicare. We are just going to cut \nproviders.\n  But at some point, we have to understand these reductions to \nproviders can damage their ability to provide care. A hospital has to \nstay open. Doctors have to make a living. A lot of them are considering \nretiring early because it is so difficult to operate under the Federal \nprograms.\n  The bottom line is that the proposal that is out there calls for a \nhuge tax increase, $1.8 trillion they are now saying. And this money is \nbeing gobbled up with new spending.\n  I try to be precise and operate from a known spending baseline; \nspecifically, the Budget Control Act baseline we agreed to 16 months \nago. The President's plan clearly contemplates this.\n  The $1.2 trillion in sequester cuts would be eliminated. That is more \nthan half the cuts we agreed to last year. They would be eliminated.\n  There would be one reduction. The Medicare reimbursement cuts of $600 \nbillion would reduce spending. That would still mean that net spending \nhas gone up $600 billion. The doc fix, as I just mentioned, is another \n$400 billion, so it adds $1 trillion. There is about $200 billion in \nstimulus spending that is over $1 trillion, and we have an $800 billion \ntax increase. If the President got that, which is what he originally \nasked for, then we would end up with more debt than if we didn't have \nthe $800 billion tax increase.\n  If he gets $1.6 trillion in new taxes--which will not happen, in my \nopinion--but if he were to get that, it would reduce the debt two-\nthirds of that amount, plus maybe three-fourths would be used to fund \nnew spending and only one-fourth to deal with our current challenges.\n  I would ask the American people, when they read what Congress was \nconsidering--and we have heard the President advocate more taxes--did \nthey not assume that money would be used to reduce the deficit we have \nso we may put our country on a sound financial path? Or did they at \nleast not assume it could be used to save Social Security, which is \nalready drawing money from the General Treasury, so we have\n\n[[Page S7668]]\n\nenough money to pay recipients? Or did they not think that maybe the \nmoney was going to be used to strengthen Medicare and keep that program \non track so it will not go into bankruptcy?\n  Is any of that accomplished by the President's proposal? No. He \nproposes no fix to Social Security, no fix to Medicare, and no real \nreduction in debt. In fact, if we end up with $1.6 trillion in tax \nincreases over 10 years, we can expect the deficit to go up about $8.6 \ntrillion instead of $9 trillion. That would be the only impact on the \ndebt because most of the new money would be used for new spending.\n\n  So I am worried about this. I don't think the leader of our Nation, \nthe one person elected by people all over the country, should be laying \nout a program to the American people that does not honestly deal with \nthe debt threat we face, and does not honestly explain to the American \npeople how we are on an unsustainable course, as every expert has said, \nand does not honestly talk with the American people about why Medicare \nis in trouble, why Social Security is in trouble, and what we need to \ndo to fix them. Our President will not even talk about that, and when \nsomebody talks about it in a serious way, they get attacked by the \nWhite House. This new budget doesn't do anything about those issues.\n  So I think this is not good leadership. I know Senator McConnell and \nSpeaker Boehner have pleaded with the President to talk about these \nlong-term, systemic problems.\n  Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the debt are \ntogether almost 60 percent of what we spend in this country, and they \nare growing at three times the rate of inflation. This is \nunsustainable. This is what Erskine Bowles, the man the President chose \nto head his debt commission, has warned us about. In fact, the House \nproposal indicated they would accept an $800 billion tax increase as a \ngood-faith attempt to reach out to the President, based on what Mr. \nBowles had proposed. They basically call it the Erskine Bowles plan. \nThat is what he suggested, how the tax rates wouldn't go up, but the \ndeductions would be eliminated. You would have a simpler, more flat tax \nsystem. You would bring in $800 billion more in revenue, and they would \nuse this revenue to help reduce our deficit. That is the kind of plan \nthat is serious. But the President has hammered the House plan. \nSecretary Geithner says it is unacceptable. But it is the Erskine \nBowles plan. That is what it was, and it was a serious, good-faith \nattempt to reach out and deal with this crisis.\n  I don't believe we need tax increases--any--but if we do, we have to \nask ourselves, Where are we going to apply them? What are we going to \ndo with them that puts the country on a sound path for the future so \nour children are not having ever larger amounts of debt accruing every \nmonth, every year that goes by?\n  Again, if the President's plan was accepted and the $1.6 trillion in \nnew taxes were imposed, which I don't believe will happen, we would \nhave virtually no reduction in the total debt accruing over 10 years. \nThat does not change the debt course of America. It does not deal with \nthe danger that exists. The spending path we are on is in the red zone. \nThe tachometer spending needle is over in the red zone.\n  Mr. Bowles told us at our Budget Committee hearing 2 years ago that \nwe are facing the most predictable debt crisis in our country's \nhistory. He said we have to get off this unsustainable path. So the \nHouse has basically taken his suggestions and worked with them.\n  I understand that earlier today there was a discussion about raising \nthe debt ceiling. The Constitution clearly gives Congress the power to \nregulate the debt of America, and we have to pass legislation to raise \nthe amount--the ceiling or the limit--on how much we can borrow. We are \nat $16 trillion-plus now, and we are about to reach the debt limit \nagain early next year. The President doesn't want to have to deal with \nthat again because last time we came up against the debt ceiling--\nAugust a year ago--the President had to reduce spending. It is the only \ntime we have actually done anything. We reduced spending by $2.1 \ntrillion out of what was projected to be $47 trillion in total \nspending.\n  So August a year ago, the country was on track to spend $47 trillion \nover the next 10 years. Once the agreement was reached and $2.1 \ntrillion was saved, we were on a course to spend $45 trillion instead \nof $47 trillion. Now, America is not going to sink into the ocean if we \nreduce spending that much. It is still an increase--a very substantial \nincrease. Debt would have accrued over the next decade. Instead of $11 \ntrillion, it would have been $9 trillion. So we go from $16 trillion, \nto $25 trillion, to $26 trillion in new debt to the country. That is \nall that limit did. I believed it did not go nearly far enough, and \nthat was a concern of mine, but the agreement was at least a step. The \nPresident's plan eliminates the sequester and does not pay for it with \ncuts elsewhere. So it actually increases spending because it backs off \nthe agreement we reached just last year.\n  Madam President, I believe the American people have a right to be \nunhappy with us. And it absolutely is not true that if we take the \ncurrent law baseline, the President's proposal cuts spending $2.50 for \nevery $1 of tax increase. In fact, there is no spending reduction, \nreally. There are only spending increases. No net reductions properly \naccounted for occur in the plan Secretary Geithner laid out, and that \nis true with the President's budget too. The budget the President \nsubmitted last year is very similar to this current proposal. It \nincreases spending, it doesn't reduce spending.\n  So we need to know that we are being asked to permanently raise tax \nrates in America and permanently use that money on new spending \nprograms, leaving Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Defense \nDepartment on the same dangerous course they are on today. I think we \ncan do better.\n  I hope the American people will look at these numbers, maybe call the \nWhite House, call their Members of Congress, and say: Look, if you have \nto raise taxes--and I think most Americans don't think we need to--be \nsure you use this money wisely. Don't start new programs when we are \ngoing broke now. Don't start new programs when we don't have money to \nfund Social Security, don't have money to fund Medicare, don't have \nmoney to fund Medicaid. Don't start new spending programs when we don't \nhave the money to take care of the ones we have.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            The Debt Ceiling\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, before I speak on the subject matter of a \nbill I have submitted for introduction, Protecting and Preserving \nSocial Security Act, I wish to comment on two issues that came up for \ndebate or discussion earlier today. One was on the debt ceiling.\n  It is somewhat frustrating because at one point I thought for sure we \nwere going to vote on a debt ceiling issue that would bring certainty \nand some predictability to the markets and to the economy and not hold \nthat issue hostage, as was done a couple of years ago by some. But some \nthreatened today to hold the good faith and credit of this country \nhostage in these debates on the budget.\n  The minority leader came forward and proposed an idea which seemed \nlike a pretty good one to me--it obviously was a pretty good idea to \nhim because he brought it forward. I have only been here 4 years, but \nfrom my understanding of history, when a debt ceiling issue comes \nbefore us as a single item, it only requires 51-plus votes. For the \nfirst time I can recall since I have been here and prior to that time, \nthat has changed midway through. They have now said: No, we didn't \nreally mean that. We don't want to really deal with the debt. We told \nyou we did, but we don't, so we are going to make you have a 60-vote \nthreshold.\n  People back in Alaska are fed up with these kinds of games, this \nshowmanship to try to one-up the other side. This debt issue was a \nchance to do something to create certainty and predictability in the \nmarkets for the next several months and ongoing, ensuring that the \nmarkets would not have to\n\n[[Page S7669]]\n\nworry about our credit rating, the good faith and credit of this \ncountry on the debts we owe, that they would be covered no matter what, \nwhich is a good thing. That helps us not only in our domestic markets \nbut across the globe.\n  What we saw was just some more shenanigans or showmanship or an \nattempt to get some good headlines. I don't think there are any good \nheadlines for the minority here because it basically showed they were \nnot sincere about the issue of the debt. So now we are back at it \nagain, and I am a little frustrated again.\n  I would request that the minority leader reconsider his position, \nthat he would bring that piece of legislation forward. I am ready and I \nknow many of my colleagues on this side are ready to vote for that. I \nthink it would be incredible to show bipartisanship on making sure we \nhave debt certainty in this country so people are not worrying about \ntheir government's payment on its debt.\n  Again, I didn't come here to speak on that, but I felt compelled to \nbecause I am somewhat frustrated about it.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Also, I will mention one other thing. I know Senator Hoeven--and I \nconsider him a friend--is working hard on the farm bill. I support the \nfarm bill. It is ready, but it is on the House side. We are patiently \nwaiting for them to bring it forward. I hope they do. It has deficit \nreduction reforms, making sure real farmers are getting the benefits \nthey need, the insurance they need, and ensuring that we are still \ndoing incredible things with our farming communities all across the \ncountry, including Alaska. So I hope the House does something over \nthere that will help reduce the deficit and help take care of our \nfarmers.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  Mr. President, today I came to the floor to discuss a subject the \nPresiding Officer cares greatly about; that is, protecting and \npreserving Social Security. I have a piece of legislation that I call \nthe Protecting and Preserving Security Act, which I introduced Tuesday. \nThe bill backs up our country's longstanding guarantee that Social \nSecurity will be there not just for today's generation but for our \ngrandchildren and their grandchildren.\n  The bill has two major components. One changes the way the cost-of-\nliving increases are calculated to make Social Security benefits more \naccurate and fair. The other component adds decades of solvency to the \nprogram by asking wealthier Americans to pay just a little more.\n  Today's COLA--the cost-of-living adjustment--does not take into \naccount the increasing and rising medical costs faced by seniors or the \ndisabled. This means their Social Security checks lose value over the \nyears because costs go up more quickly than the benefits. But there is \na solution, and again I credit the Presiding Officer because he talks \nabout this a great deal in caucus and here on the floor.\n  The solution has been around for years. In the 1980s, the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics developed what is known as a CPI-E, the Consumer Price \nIndex for Elderly Consumers. The index more accurately reflects the \nspecific needs and purchases of seniors, unlike the current formula. My \nbill requires the Social Security Administration to use the CPI-E to \ncalculate the Social Security benefits.\n  The second goal of the Protecting and Preserving Social Security Act \nis to make the system fair and more financially solvent. It does so by \nmaking sure everyone, even the wealthiest Americans, pays into the \nprogram all year long.\n  A lot of people don't know what the current law does. Under the \ncurrent law, contributions to Social Security will be capped once a \nperson's income hits $113,700 throughout the year. That is it. No \nmatter how much more they earn, they stop contributing to Social \nSecurity for the rest of the year. So let me make sure that is clear.\n  An example I like to use is us here in Congress. We make $174,000. \nAbout the middle or end of September, when we hit $113,000 of income, \nafter that point we no longer contribute to Social Security. So that \nmeans anyone making over $113,000, after that fact they no longer \ncontribute to Social Security. To me, this is an unfair system. So my \nbill gradually lifts that cap. It also says the more one puts into the \nprogram, the more they will eventually get out of it.\n  We are working with the Social Security Actuary to get a final \nnumber, but it is fair to say that by lifting the income cap on \ncontributions, this bill will extend the solvency of the Social \nSecurity trust fund for generations. We estimate at least a minimum of \ntwo generations.\n  A few weeks ago, back home in Anchorage I joined a group of seniors. \nI presented this piece of legislation to them at the Anchorage Senior \nCenter. As she loves to describe herself, a young woman from Alaska \nstood up--an 81-year-old Korean war Navy veteran--Beverly was there \nbecause the majority of her modest income comes from Social Security, \nand she wanted to know how this proposal would strengthen that lifeline \nfor her and thousands of Alaskans.\n  In fact, one in nine Alaskans receives Social Security. With my \nState's population of those 65 and older expanding rapidly, Social \nSecurity will continue to play a key role in supplementing a decent \nliving. If Social Security were not there for the elderly Alaskans, \none-fifth of them would live below poverty. It is vital for our State, \nit is vital for all our States, and for this whole country.\n  I have no illusions this bill is going to pass in the final weeks of \nthe 112th Congress, but I wanted to get it into the mix. I wanted to \nmake sure people get the bigger point.\n  I would say to my Presiding Officer, who says this well, and my \nfriend from Oregon, who is on the Senate floor also, as we talk about \nthe deficit that has taken center stage right now, we want to highlight \none very clear thing: Social Security has not contributed, is not part \nof, and never will contribute to the deficit. So those who like to \nmeddle and try to combine it with this deficit talk are just playing \ngames with our seniors and disabled in this country.\n  It is a separate issue. It is not impacting the Federal deficit. And \nI know some like to meld it in because then they like to talk about \ncuts and--their favorite line--privatize, which really means seniors \nand the disabled get a lot less in the future. They will not get the \nguarantee that they paid into.\n  Also, I want to give credit to Congressman Ted Deutch, who has a \nsimilar measure on the House side. Both plans may be difficult to pass, \nbut we are going to continue to push forward, and we will not be alone. \nA coalition of over 300 national and State organizations have already \nendorsed our bill. Together they represent 50 million Americans. They \nare onboard because this bill modernizes Social Security without \ncutting benefits.\n  Let me repeat that because I know some will say there must be some \nbenefit reduction there. It will enhance Social Security. It will \nensure it continues without cutting benefits because the program plays \na vital role in the economy and security of America's working families.\n  Most of us, including myself, started contributing to Social Security \nas teenagers. To those who send me e-mails--I just read one recently--\nwe do pay Social Security as Members of Congress. I know people don't \nthink we do, but we do. I saw one on our newspaper blog--I should \ninform my press people, I responded to that without their knowledge. I \nwanted to make sure that individual knew we pay. I have been paying \nsince I was a teenager, and I still pay today.\n  It is important that when people get to retirement or some tragedy \nstrikes, Social Security is there to help make ends meet. I am proud of \nthe leaders of the past who have fought and had the foresight and \nwisdom to create Social Security.\n  Nowadays, some in Washington like to call Social Security an \nentitlement. If by that it means it is a government handout, they are \nflat wrong. Americans paid for and earned their Social Security. The \nbenefits are modest. No one is getting rich off Social Security, but it \ndoes provide an important foundation. The values that underlie Social \nSecurity are American values. It rewards hard work. The longer one \nworks, the more they earn under Social Security, the higher their \nbenefits.\n  The program reflects the best of America: hard work, personal \nresponsibility, human dignity, and caring for our parents, our \nchildren, our spouses, our neighbors, and ourselves. It also assures \nthat those who work long and\n\n[[Page S7670]]\n\nhard at low and moderate wages receive a larger return on their \ncontribution. It is financially prudent and conservative.\n  Regardless, many people worry that Social Security is going to be \nbroke. But here are the facts based on the annual report of the Social \nSecurity Board of Trustees. To remind everybody, we get that annual \nreport, a section of it. We see it every year. It projects the \nprogram's financial status over the next 75 years.\n  The latest trustees report issued in April said Social Security ran a \nsurplus--a surplus--of $69 billion last year. The report also says the \nprogram can continue to pay all benefits, on time and in full, through \nthe year 2033. After that its shortfall is modest, but it is a \nmanageable shortfall. And, as I said a minute ago, it should not \ntrigger talk of benefit cuts, raising the retirement age, or \nprivatization.\n  Instead, the modest revenue increases in my bill will go into effect \ngradually and make Social Security solvent for decades longer, all \nwithout adding to the deficit. We can do this. We can protect and \npreserve the promise of Social Security for generations to come.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                             The Big Issues\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, just following up on the comments of my \ncolleague from Alaska, he has laid out some very important thoughts \nregarding the farm bill, regarding the debt ceiling, and regarding \nSocial Security. I applaud him for coming to the floor and sharing his \nthoughts with our colleagues and with the American public.\n  These are big issues that we are wrestling with in the Senate. The \nfarm bill is something that was passed on a bipartisan nature through \nthe Senate. It is over in the House. It will have to come back through \nhere. We had a proposal from the Republican leader put forward this \nmorning that we were ready to vote on and that he objected to himself \nat the last second.\n  The debt ceiling is an important issue because it involves paying the \nbills on the decisions that have already been made and implemented by \nthe U.S. Government. It is not about spending more; it is about paying \nthe bills on the spending that has already taken place. And it should \nbe debated and discussed and addressed because failure to have the \nresponsibility that every family should have--to pay their bills once \nincurred--poses significant issues for our Nation. We saw that with the \ncredit rating downturn. We certainly have seen that with the impact on \nthe confidence that there was in the American system.\n  So it should be debated. These big issues need to be debated and \ndecided. But this Senate often fails to ever get onto a bill to start \nwith because there is something called a motion to proceed in which we \nhave to raise the question: Should we address this topic? And time and \ntime again, we have seen the minority, acting in a partisan fashion, \nsay: No, we don't want to debate. They have used what is referred to as \nthe silent filibuster to object and say: No, we don't want to debate \nthat issue before the American public. We don't want to debate it with \nour colleagues. We don't want to wrestle with this complex topic.\n  Should we get onto a bill, we then see amendments treated in the same \nfashion, subjected to a 60-vote majority. In fact, that was the premise \nthat the minority leader, the Republican leader, put forward in a \nchange of heart just a few minutes ago, saying he had a proposal, that \nhe reached agreement. But at the last second he decided it should be \nsubject to a supermajority vote.\n  That is exactly what we have seen day in and day out, in increasing \nfashion, which has prevented this body from not only addressing the big \nissues across our country but even the regular issues of standard \nappropriations bills. We have 13 such bills that should come to this \nfloor each year to be debated, to be decided, and to be amended, and we \ndon't get to them. Why don't we get to them? Because the entire year is \nconsumed by the silent filibuster strategy of the minority.\n  Let me give a picture of what I am talking about. This is a chart \nthat shows the number of filibusters launched as an average per year \nover the preceding decades.\n  Now, I first came to this room when I was 19 as an intern for Senator \nHatfield, and I sat up in the staff gallery and covered the Tax Reform \nAct of 1976. I watched this body raise amendment after amendment, \ndebate it, decide it on a simple majority basis, and proceed to enact \ntax reform.\n  Well, in the 1900s through 1970s there was an average of one silent \nfilibuster per year. Just one. Under the rules, this type of objection \nconsumes a week because once the objection is made to unanimous consent \nto hold a majority vote, then a motion must be filed--a motion by the \nmajority that wants to proceed. So they get 16 signatures, and that \ntakes a little bit of time. Then once that motion has been filed--and \nthat is called a cloture motion to close debate--then it takes 2 days \nto get to a vote.\n  The vote has to happen a day after an intervening day. So 2 days are \ngone. Then, if 60 Members say, yes, they want to close debate, then we \nhave to have 30 hours of debate time before we can actually get to a \nfinal vote. So a whole week is taken up by that process.\n  In the 1970s, the average grew to 16 per year. That is 16 weeks \nwasted per year. In the 1980s, it grew to 21 per year average. Now we \nare getting to well over one-third of the number of weeks in the course \nof the Senate year. Then we go to the 1990s. We are up to 36 such \nsilent filibusters taking up 36 weeks. We get to the decade 2000 \nthrough 2009, and an average of 48--or almost 1 per week--starting to \nsqueeze out any ability to address the big issues facing America.\n  Then, since I came in 2009, we have had an average of over 60 per \nyear, more than 1 per week. The result of this last 2 years was the \nmost dysfunctional legislature in decades; big issues facing America, \nthis floor, and this forum of deliberation paralyzed by the continuous \nuse of the silent filibuster on every issue. Essentially what this \nsilent filibuster has done is convert this to a supermajority body. Not \nonly that, converted it to a body that spends its entire year just \ntrying to get to the vote as to whether we can have a final vote. That \nis the level of dysfunction we have reached.\n  No wonder that public opinion of the Senate has plummeted. No wonder \nthe frustration across this Nation has built that in silence, out of \npublic sight, the minority has strategically thwarted the ability of \nthis body to debate issues.\n  Over the course of time we see a period where this body has been run \nby Republicans and run by Democrats, so every minority has used this in \nan increasing fashion over time. This is not simply a Republican-\nDemocratic issue or Democratic-Republican issue. This is an issue of a \nsystematic change of culture where it was understood that the Senate \nwas a simple majority as envisioned under the Constitution. Both Adams \nand Madison spoke eloquently to what a supermajority could do to \ndestroy this body. Now their words resonate from the past because we \nare seeing it happen right before us today.\n  In this situation, doesn't it make sense for us to adjust the rules \nand reclaim the ability to be a body that deliberates and decides? That \nis what many of us are proposing be debated in January. When we start \nthe new 2-year period we should have a major debate on the floor of the \nSenate about how to make this body fulfill its responsibilities to the \nAmerican people. Our responsibility is not to come here and throw sand \nin the gears of deliberation. Our responsibility is to come here, study \nthe issues, debate them on this floor, reach thoughtful positions, \nadvocate for those positions, and propose that those solutions that \nhave the strongest support go forward. That does not happen if the \nentire year is wasted with the silent filibuster strategy we have \ntoday.\n  So what can we do to address this situation? Quite a bit. Let's start \nwith the very place that a bill begins, which is the motion to proceed. \nThis is a motion to say let's come and debate the farm bill. Let's come \nand debate the Defense authorization bill. Let's come and debate a \nspending bill for Health and Human Services. When that motion was made \nin the past, it was rarely filibustered. This is a chart that\n\n[[Page S7671]]\n\ngoes back to 1971. From 1971, here, through 1982, that entire decade, \nwe had 18 cases where the motion to proceed was filibustered--18 over a \ndecade, plus.\n  In fact, during the previous 40 years there had only been a dozen \ntimes the motion to proceed was filibustered. Why is that? Because \nthere is no inherent logic in saying in order to facilitate debate I am \ngoing to block debate, because that is what it is when you have this \nsilent filibuster putting up this 60-vote hurdle to get onto a bill to \nbegin with. So it makes sense for a simple majority to be able to \ndecide let's go to a bill, let's debate it.\n  What we see over time here is a huge change. By 2007-2008, we had 57 \nsilent filibusters, out of public sight, to prevent bills from being \ndebated on this floor; the next year, 31 objections, 2009-2010, that 2-\nyear period. The next 2-year period we are in now, we are already up to \n42 times.\n  Clearly we need to return to the culture where the filibuster about \nan issue so close to your heart or so important to your values or so \nvital to your State that you would object and say I am going to stand \nin the way; as a matter of principle I am going to stand in the way of \na bill that does damage to my core principles or to the vital interests \nof my State--that might happen a couple of times in a career.\n  That is not what we have now. What we have now is routine obstruction \non every single act, which mires us in lost time and prevents us from \naddressing issues facing America.\n  Let's return to that situation when the motion to proceed was not \nfilibustered. Let's make it like the motion to proceed to a nomination, \nin which we basically say no, you cannot filibuster that. You have a \nresponsibility to advise and consent, to get nominations to the floor. \nIf the majority says we will come here and debate it, we will come here \nand debate it. That is a simple change that takes care of a lot of the \ngrowth in the obstruction that wastes the Senate's time and prevents it \nfrom acting.\n  A second proposal is to get rid of the silent filibuster on starting \na conference committee. Let me lay out the scenario for you. The House \nhas passed a bill. The Senate has passed the same bill in a slightly \ndifferent version. The two bodies say let's meet and talk about this. \nLet's work out a common position we can send back. That is a conference \ncommittee. Why would anyone object to starting the conference committee \nto negotiate between two bills, slightly different, that have been \npassed by the two bodies?\n  One could say, is that their only opportunity to make a statement \nabout things that might happen in the conference committee? The answer \nis no. Because if the conference committee comes to a proposal, then \nthey send it back to the two bodies and at that point it is debatable \nand it could be filibustered. That opportunity is there. So we have \nthree motions necessary to establish a conference committee, and \nbecause all three can be filibustered, this silent filibuster--not \nstanding and taking any public position, this silent objection--we have \nvirtually given up the use of the conference committee. I don't think \nyou can find a State legislature in this Nation that has so tied its \nhands that it cannot even hold a conversation between a State House of \nRepresentatives and a State Senate. They cannot even hold a \nconversation. That is how dysfunctional we have become here.\n  That was never part of the argument for let's have extended debate \nand let's be a cooling saucer, a thoughtful body. No, that is just a \nrule: Let's waste the entire time of the Senate and preclude the \npossibilities of even having a conversation, a negotiation with the \nHouse. We should eliminate the silent filibuster on motions to get to a \nconference committee.\n  Let's talk about another area. One of my colleagues from Minnesota, \nAl Franken, has proposed that instead of having 60 votes to end debate, \nwe should have 41 to extend debate. Why does that matter? First, in \nterms of the framing of the issue, it really is the minority saying we \nwant more debate. By this I don't mean minority party, I mean 41 from \neither party coming together and saying we want more debate. In that \ncase the vote should be 41 votes required to extend debate.\n  That has a practical impact. It means that somebody who is absent \nfrom this Chamber does not count automatically on the side of extending \ndebate. It is 41 of those who are here, 41 of the 100 who are saying \nyes, we must go forward with more debate. That is a very reasonable \nproposal. It changes the framing to understand that it is the \nminority--not the Republican minority but the minority of 51 from both \nsides of the aisle comes together and says: Yes, we want more debate. \nThey make an affirmative vote of 41. That makes sense.\n  Then let's talk about the talking filibuster. I have been referring \nthroughout this discussion that we are facing silent filibusters. \nIndeed, when I considered running for the Senate I came here and talked \nto the majority leader about it, and after discussing the possibility \nof running I said: Mr. Majority Leader, while I am here there is just \none thing I must say because citizens in Oregon are so frustrated about \nthis, and he kindly said yes, go ahead, tell me what it is.\n\n  I said, it is this: If a minority is arguing for more debate, then \nmake them debate. Make them stand on the floor and make their case, \nbecause all we see is a quorum call back home. All we see is the Senate \nwasting its time.\n  The majority leader put his head in his hands like this and he said: \nLet me explain the way the rules are written. He explained to me what I \nhave been explaining to all of you, that it is not required under the \nrules to take the floor when you object to a simple majority. When you \nvote for more debate, you are not required to debate. This is a \nsurprise. This is the opposite of what ordinary citizens, myself \nincluded, believed across America. Why was that? Where did our belief \ncome from?\n  I can tell you it came from this: When this body believed in its \nconstitutional role to make decisions and to make decisions by a \nmajority vote as envisioned by our Founding Fathers, it considered an \nobjection to a simple majority vote to be a huge deal, a deal in which \nif you were going to make that objection you would have the courage of \nyour convictions to come to this floor even if the rules didn't require \nit, you would come to this floor and you would make your case before \nyour colleagues and try to persuade them of your point of view, and you \nwould make your case before the American public.\n  It is folks back home who would have a chance to weigh in on whether \nyou were a hero for carrying the torch on an important issue or you \nwere a bum because your arguments didn't hold water and you were \nobjecting, keeping the U.S. Senate from addressing an important \nnational problem.\n  That era where the social contract was that you would have the \ncourage to stand before your colleagues--that era is gone. Since the \nrules do not require you to stand, it has become the practice to use \nthe silent filibuster to kill bills in the dark of night with no case \nbeing made before your colleagues, no case being made before the \nAmerican people.\n  It is also true that Hollywood has helped cement the notion that a \nfilibuster involves standing before this body with the courage of your \nconvictions. Here we have a scene from the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes To \nWashington.'' He was trying to stop a land grab where a boys camp \nshould be. He knew what was being done was wrong and he said he is \ngoing to take the floor and he is going to stand before his colleagues \nand the American people and he is going to do so as long as he could \nstay standing because it was an important principle that was being \nviolated with an inappropriate land grab back home.\n  The American public is hungry for this kind of courage, that if you \nbelieve a simple majority is not in the interests of America because of \nthe gravity of an issue, you will stand on this floor and make your \ncase. That is what the talking filibuster proposes. It says that at the \ntime you have a vote on any debate, if a majority of this body says \nyes, we should end debate and go forward, but a supermajority of 60 is \nnot yet there--so the vote is between 51 and 59--that says there is \nstill a substantial minority of 41 or more who want to have more \ndebate, then they have to debate. It is as simple as that. They cannot \nbasically go off on vacation while there is a quorum call. Instead, at \nleast one person has to stand on this floor and make the argument.\n\n[[Page S7672]]\n\n  Wouldn't it be an incredible difference if instead of these silent, \nhidden filibusters paralyzing this body, Senators who chose for \nadditional debate had to make a stand before the American public? They \nhad to make their case and the public could weigh in on whether they \nwere heroes or they were bums? In that case, maybe we would get those \n60 votes.\n  Let me give an example. We had a case in which we had an act called \nthe DISCLOSE Act on the floor of the Senate. The DISCLOSE Act simply \nsaid that for all campaign donations, the source must be disclosed. It \nwas based on a premise that had been argued by many on both sides of \nthe aisle over many years, and it was this: that disclosure is the \nsunlight that disinfects the political process. If voters know that ad \nbeing put up on the air is being done by a certain industry--even \nthough they claim to be the Blue Skies Industry, maybe they are the \nPolluted Water Industry--the citizens should know. If that ad that \nclaims to be from Americans for Healthy Lives is actually being put on \nby an industry that is poisoning people, citizens should have the right \nto know. This is the DISCLOSE Act. Not only under current practice is \nsecrecy allowed, but foreign donations are allowed. Foreign companies \nare allowed to put unlimited secretive funds into the U.S. system. Who \nwould defend that on the floor of the Senate? The answer is no one. We \ndidn't have those who wanted more debate willing to debate it. No, they \nwanted to obstruct it in silence because they knew the American people \nwould not approve of the fact that they were arguing for secrecy on \nunlimited sums of secret funds in American campaigns.\n\n  That was before this last election cycle when in election after \nelection we saw super PACs funneling vast fortunes into the primaries \nfor the Presidency, into Senate races, and into House races. They were \nfunneling the money in, and no one knew where it came from. Now, some \nof the contributors to those super PACs did disclose that they \ncontributed to the super PACs. They bragged about it. But when the \nmoney went from the super PAC to the State, their name was not attached \nto it. Nobody knew what funds went to which State. It was basically an \nattack by vast pools of dark money.\n  If we had the talking filibuster and folks had to rise on this floor \nand defend this secrecy and these foreign donations, then we would have \ngotten the 60th vote to close debate and we would have a better system \nto date.\n  How about pay equity for women? How about pay equity? I think we \nwould have had the public weigh in if they could have seen it was being \ntorpedoed by the silent, hidden filibuster. Now there are folks--and I \nhave heard them over the past few weeks--who say: Oh, this strategy of \nasking people to talk is a way to suppress the views of the minority. \nIsn't that absurd? Doesn't it just make you smile that a requirement to \nmake a case before colleagues can be framed as a situation where our \nviews are being suppressed? No, quite the contrary. We are issuing them \nan invitation--this affects people on both sides of the aisle--to come \nforward and make their case publicly. Don't kill these bills with this \nhidden maneuver in the dark of night. If they have the courage of their \nconvictions, they should come and make their case. If they don't, then \nlet the process proceed. That is the talking filibuster.\n  I would like to applaud others who have put ideas forward that are \nsimilar. Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey had a bill that said--where I \nam talking about after the cloture vote, he said: Well, let's require \npeople to talk during the 30 hours before the cloture vote in order to \nsee if nobody wants to take the floor. Let's shorten that 30 hours. \nThat is worthy of debate.\n  We have a responsibility for this body to debate in a transparent, \naccountable fashion and to make decisions so our public can see it. \nThat is what the talking filibuster does.\n  I encourage my colleagues to come to the floor and share their \nthoughts. If they are against making their case before the American \npeople, then have the courage to come to the floor and say: I don't \nlike this idea because I don't want to have to make my case in front of \nmy colleagues.\n  I invite my colleagues to come to the floor and say to the American \npublic: I am going to vote against the talking filibuster because I \ndon't want the public to see that I am killing bills in the dark of \nnight.\n  Have the courage to come and debate the issue now and in the future \nbecause the American people are looking at us with extraordinary levels \nof frustration. They know there are big issues facing our Nation.\n  Right now we are talking about the fiscal cliff. Well, the fiscal \ncliff has many components. It may be broken into many different bills \nthat come before this body. We need to get rid of the motion to proceed \nso we can get those bills to the floor to debate them. We need to make \nsure that if a group says: Let's block this bill from a final vote, \nthey express their views accountably before the public. It is the least \nthat should happen.\n  The Senate is headed out for the weekend. We will be back next week, \nand I ask for the American public to weigh in and to think about the \nfact that this hidden process is hurting our ability to address the big \nissues facing America. I ask my colleagues to wrestle with that.\n  It is my hope that folks will hold those conversations with the \npublic back home. I have done so in every county of my State through my \ntownhall meetings. I hold one in every county every year. I have raised \nthis issue of whether or not, when folks vote for debate, they should \nbe required to debate, they should be required to make their case and \nnot to kill bills in the dark of night. Whether it is a progressive \ncounty or a conservative county, people believe in transparency and \naccountability, and they want to see their Senators making their case \non this floor. Let's make it so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7672-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       INTERNET PUBLICATION OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE FORMS\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the fiscal cliff \nthe country will face on January 4. We are beyond the point of the \nelection, and there is 4 weeks until the date of the fiscal cliff. As \nRepublicans have been pointing out on this floor, Congress must act \nsoon to take on the numerous expiring tax provisions and the sequester. \nI believe President Obama must provide leadership in those efforts. I \nhave seen very little so far.\n  Last week I came to the floor to speak about the fiscal cliff and \nsome of the concerns I continue to have and hear about as I travel to \nWyoming just about every weekend. I just got back from there a few days \nago, and people are very concerned about the direction of the country \nand what may happen to all Americans on January 1.\n  Last week on the floor, I spoke about the President's proposal to \nraise taxes on people making more than $200,000 a year. In terms of \nspending next year, that tax increase would pay for just 6.8 days of \nwhat Washington will spend. So the whole proposal the President \ncontinues to make is basically enough to fund the government for not 52 \nweeks but 1 week alone. The tax increases President Obama is now trying \nto push\n\n[[Page S7673]]\n\nthrough will really do almost nothing to reduce our national deficit \nand nothing to reduce our national debt.\n  The White House and Democrats in the Senate are focused only on tax \nhikes while they continue to ignore the real drivers of our debt, which \nare the out-of-control entitlement programs of Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid. Until we find a way to do meaningful \nentitlement reform, no amount of tax revenue will be able to match the \nincrease in entitlement spending.\n  Well, instead of leading the conversation, the President continues in \nhis campaign mode, going around the country to try to sell his tax \nhikes. The President and the Democrats in Congress are willing to go \nover the fiscal cliff in order to get those tax hikes. Rather than \nnegotiate in good faith, they are willing to try to spend their time \ntrying to convince the American people that it is someone else's fault. \nGoing over the fiscal cliff will mean another recession, and this one \nis squarely on the shoulders of President Obama. It will mean \nunemployment spiking back up over 9 percent. It will also mean a whole \nhost of tax increases even beyond the higher tax rates Washington \nDemocrats want so badly. Americans are also facing big increases on the \ndeath tax and the alternative minimum tax, also known as the AMT. Both \nof these taxes will go up January 1 unless Democrats work with \nRepublicans and take action to stop the increases that are already \nscheduled to occur.\n  Now, there is bipartisan agreement that these taxes should not be \nraised. There is bipartisan agreement that these taxes will do great \ndamage to middle-class families, family businesses, and family farms. \nAny effort to stop these harmful tax increases is being held up by the \nPresident's insistence on raising tax rates--not just raising more \nrevenue through tax reform and economic growth but specifically raising \ntax rates.\n  Let's take a look at the death tax. Today this tax, also known as the \nestate tax, is set up at a top rate of 35 percent, with an exception \nfor the first $5.1 million in the estate's value. Well, those are the \nlevels that Congress set and the President agreed to in 2010. There was \na Republican House of Representatives, a Democratic Senate, as well as \na Democratic President in the White House. That was in 2010. Those \nlevels are now set to jump dramatically to a top rate of 55 percent, \nwith an exemption for just the first $1 million. Now, $1 million sounds \nlike a lot of money until we start looking at a situation of family-\nowned businesses and family farms. For instance, farmers and ranchers \nhave a lot of assets, such as land, buildings, and livestock. Those \nthings are worth a lot of money for the purposes of calculating the \nvalue of someone's estate, but they are not liquid assets--they cannot \njust spend a tractor.\n  Once a mom or dad dies in the farm family, the IRS wants the death \ntax paid within 9 months. The tax is calculated on those big valuations \nfor the farm or ranch property and has to be paid in cash. Often, the \nonly way for a family to pay the tax is to start selling off parts of \nthe farm. Families who have farmed for generations are forced to make \nlife-changing decisions regarding their future, and they have to do it \nvery quickly. They may have to sell land or livestock at a time when \nprices are low because the tax bill is due immediately. If we don't act \nin Congress, this tax is going to hit more family farms, and it will \nhit them much harder, taking a much larger portion of the farm just to \npay the taxes.\n  When we take a look at this chart, talk about crushed by the death \ntax in terms of the number of small businesses and the number of family \nfarms that will be hit under the estate tax in 2012 as opposed to what \nis going to happen in 2013, it is a huge increase in 2013 as they find \na different way to calculate the death tax, and the same is true with \nfamily farms. So the number of family farms that will be hit by this \ndeath tax will jump from just under 100--the current limits--to about \n2,400 farms next year. That is an enormous increase and an enormous \nburden on those farm families.\n  The same thing holds true for other small family businesses, such as \nthe local restaurant, the grocery on the corner, or the local auto body \nshop. Again, these are small businesses that may have assets that are \nworth a lot but are not easily turned into cash to pay a tax bill.\n  Where I live in Casper, WY, most of the businesses we have are small \nbusinesses, such as the drycleaner, the florist, the car wash. A lot of \nthose small businesses are run by families. Maybe it has been in the \nfamily for a couple of generations, and they want to pass their \nbusiness down to the next generation, but when Washington comes looking \nto take its 55-percent cut, which is what is going to happen on January \n1, that business will be forced to sell off assets or maybe just sell \nout entirely.\n  When we look at the chart again, we can see that under the limits we \nnegotiated in 2010, just 200 small business estates are hurt by the \ndeath tax. Starting next year, it jumps to about 2,700 small \nbusinesses. Just like with family farms, we are not talking about big, \nfaceless corporations. We are not talking about what happens when the \nfounders of Walmart die. We are talking about what happens when the \nowner of a small family business dies. If these death tax increases go \ninto effect, a lot of the sons and daughters are not going to be able \nto keep the family business their parents worked so hard to build and \npass along. Democrats and Republicans agree this would be a terrible \nblow to a family farm or to a small family business.\n\n  There is so much we talk about when it comes to uncertainty, and just \nthe uncertainty about what is going to happen next year under the death \ntax is very stressful for many families across the country who are \nrunning their own small businesses and their own small farms or \nranches. At the very least, we should extend the current limits worked \nout in the 2010 compromise. President Obama should not be holding up \nthat commonsense solution so he can satisfy his left-based agenda for \nunrealistically insisting on raising tax rates.\n  The other tax increase that is set to hit American families very hard \nvery soon is the alternative minimum tax. The Presiding Officer will \nrecall the AMT tax was created in 1969 and that occurred when some \ndiscovered there were 155 people all across the country--only 155 \npeople--who had made a lot of money but didn't pay any taxes on it, and \nwe know why. It was because of various tax loopholes. Congress could \nhave done something to close those loopholes but, instead, Congress \ncreated a whole separate tax scheme. Then, to make matters worse, they \ndidn't index the income limits for inflation. So Congress comes along \nevery year and enacts a patch to keep the tax from hitting the middle \nclass. The problem is we still have done nothing to patch the AMT for \nthis year.\n  I have another chart about the millions of people who will owe the \nAMT come next April. In 2011, 3 million people paid the AMT. It was \ndesigned because of 155 people who didn't pay taxes. Now we will have \n31 million Americans who will be hit by the tax for the tax year 2012 \nif nothing is done to patch the problem. So if we don't do something \nsoon, the AMT will hit an additional 28 million taxpayers this year for \na total of $92 billion. That is the extra tax American families face \nwhen they file their 2012 taxes by April 15 of next year. These aren't \nthe privileged few who are taking advantage of special loopholes the \ntax was intended to catch. These are 28 million taxpayers who normally \nnever have to deal with the AMT. It is going to hit middle-class \nfamilies in every State, more than 31 million taxpayers total across \nthe country.\n  We can debate whether it was ever a good idea to enact the AMT a \nnumber of years ago, but we certainly should all agree the AMT is about \nto hit a whole lot of people who should never have had to worry about \nit in the first place. Those people are going to have to pay the IRS an \naverage of $3,200 more in taxes--that is what the IRS is going to \nexpect--by April 15. Most of these people have no idea they are going \nto get caught in this AMT trap, and they have no idea how big a check \nthey are going to have to write. These are middle-class, hard-working \nfamilies who will get hit by additional taxes. Why? Because we can't \ntake the simple step of patching the AMT as we always do.\n  Again, there is bipartisan agreement that we need to enact this \npatch, but it is being held up as part of the fiscal cliff \nnegotiations.\n\n[[Page S7674]]\n\n  The President has made his offer. He wants to increase taxes, add \nmore stimulus spending, ignore the entitlement spending that is the \ntrue driver of our debt, and hold campaign-style rallies around the \ncountry to try to convince people it is not his fault if we go over the \nfiscal cliff. President Obama clearly enjoys campaigning, but the \nelection is over. It is time for him to stop campaigning and to start \nleading. This means giving up his stubborn insistence on raising tax \nrates and instead focusing on raising revenue through tax reform and \neconomic growth. It means doing something on these fundamental issues \nof tax policy that both sides agree on. That way American families will \nnot get hit with these massive tax increases.\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7674-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7674-S7675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CREATING ECONOMIC CERTAINTY\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, for the last few days the Senate has \nworked as the Senate should work. We have had amendments. We have had \nboth sides working to find solutions; the Defense Authorization Act, \nthe Russia trade agreement, a bipartisan vote on each of those. In \nfact, every time we have approached legislation that way this year, we \nhave actually gotten something done. The FAA extension, the \nTransportation bill, the postal reform bill, the farm bill, and now the \nDefense bill all came out of committee, all had amendments, all had \ndebate, and they all had a bipartisan vote that passed the bill. That \nis the way I think the Senate should work. I would like to hope it can \nwork that way as we approach the end of the year and as we try not to \ngo over the fiscal cliff.\n  They call it a cliff for a reason. I think a lot of people are acting \nas though right below the cliff there must be a fiscal ledge, but I \ndon't see the ledge we are going to fall onto. I think we are actually \ngoing to--if we go over the cliff, there will be some harm that is \ndone.\n  If we are going to take a balanced approach focusing on job creation, \nwe have to do the things that get spending under control as well as the \nthings that might produce more revenue. Nobody in the President's party \nhas yet endorsed the $1.6 trillion tax package he has talked about--or \nI don't think there is a growing demand to have the permanent debt \nlimit increased. I also don't think there is any chance Congress will \nlook at the Constitution and decide the President, on his own, can \nborrow money.\n  A number of people who have looked at the fiscal cliff all come up \nwith bad conclusions. In July of this year, a study by Ernst & Young \nwarned that raising taxes on the top 2 percent would destroy 700,000 \njobs. Nobody has challenged that in any significant way. What if it is \n500,000 jobs? What if it is 350,000 jobs or what if it is more than \n700,000 jobs? This is not what we should want to do.\n  This study also says that raising those taxes will decrease wages by \nalmost 2 percent and reduce economic growth by 1.3 percent in an \neconomy that is barely growing 1.3 percent. If we go totally off the \ncliff--that was the proposal of just the tax rates for the so-called \ntop 2 percent. If we go totally off the cliff, the CBO--the \nCongressional Budget Office--says the consequences will be even much \nworse than that. In fact, they say we definitely would put the country \ninto a recession.\n  Just last month, the Congressional Budget Office warned that with the \npopulation aging and health care costs per person likely to keep \ngrowing faster than the economy, the United States cannot sustain the \nFederal spending programs that are now in place. That is why a lot of \npeople are talking about entitlement reform and think we need to look \nwhere the money is and figure out how to reform these programs so we \ncan be sure these programs last.\n  Programs that are based on how the population looks have to change as \nthe population changes. Medicare was put in place in 1965. The average \nperson who reaches 65 lives 5 years longer now than they did in 1965. \nThat, of course, has a big impact on all the projections as to how this \nprogram would work in 1965 that was put in place, and we need to look \nat that. That is why Erskine Bowles, the former Chief of Staff of \nPresident Clinton, said just last week:\n\n       Democrats must move on entitlements in cliff deal. . . . We \n     are going to have to reduce the cost of entitlement programs.\n\n  Senator Conrad, the chairman of the Budget Committee, said, we \n``absolutely need'' to enact ``fundamental reform'' in our entitlement \nprograms. He was warning that Social Security is ``headed for \ninsolvency.''\n  Senator Durbin said ignoring entitlement reform is not a \n``responsible approach.''\n  We do not want to eliminate these programs, but we want to be sure \nthey last, and this is a good time to look at both revenue and \nspending. Surely, if this Senate works as the Senate should work, we \ncan find out how to do both those things.\n  My friend from Wyoming just talked about the death tax, the estate \ntax. For all the reasons he mentioned, this is another tax we need to \nlook at doing something about before it goes back to the taxable levels \nof 10 years ago. There are 2 million family farms or farms and ranches \nin the United States--2 million--and 98 percent of them--almost 2 \nmillion--are owned by individuals, family partnerships, and family \ncorporations. To any extent this is corporate agriculture, it is only \ncorporate agriculture because a family decided that was the best way to \nstructure what they owned as a family--98 percent of those 2 million \nfarms.\n  Cropland prices have gone up more than most things over the last few \nyears, though nobody's bank account, if a person is a family farmer, \nreflects that. A person's financial statement might reflect that, but \ntheir bank account doesn't reflect that unless that person decided they \nwere going to sell part of the farm. What we don't want to do is make \npeople sell the farm or ranch or continue to have a little piece of the \nfarm or ranch and more likely sell a piece of it and that \nmultigeneration of family farms, in most cases, the person who dies and \ntheir family is impacted by the death tax, can very likely become the \nlast farming generation.\n  At a time when we need to focus on job creation, the Joint Tax \nCommittee estimates that the increase in the estate tax would cost the \ncountry over 1 million jobs. Senator Barrasso talked about the State of \nWyoming. In the State of Missouri, we have the second highest number of \nfarms in the Nation. They are not the second biggest in many cases but \nthe second highest number.\n  We have over 100,000 individual farms. The American Farm Bureau says \nthat right now, with the tax that is in place, 1,100 of those farms \nwould be subject to the estate tax or the death tax--1,100. If we go \nback to the 2000 levels of $1 million, which would be taking us over \nthe cliff--as going over the cliff would have us do--15,000 Missouri \nfamilies would be affected at some point in the future by the estate \ntax. The difference in 1,100 and 15,000 is 13 times as many families \nwould have to worry about this tax, and it becomes the motivating \nfactor of how they run their farm rather than how they can pass their \nfarm or ranch along to the next generation. I don't have the number in \nfront of me, but when I looked at those numbers earlier in the year, I \nthink it was about nine times as many small businesses in my State \nwould be affected by the 2000 levels as would be affected if that same \nestate was taxed at today's levels.\n  We have people stepping forward on this from both sides of the aisle. \nI recently discussed this issue with the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus from Montana, who has spoken out about \nprotecting farmers and ranchers in his State who want to pass their \nproperty along to their children. I told him I would do anything I \ncould to help him maintain the estate tax levels we have now, though \nboth he and I are in support of legislation that would eliminate the \nestate tax. That would be my preference. But very often in a democracy \nwe don't get our preference. We try to figure out what we might be able \nto accomplish that is not quite all we would want to accomplish. \nKeeping this year's level would be important.\n  Senator Landrieu from Louisiana called the estate tax at this year's \nlevels of estate tax ``a make or break issue'' and called it \n``inherently unfair.''\n  Senator Pryor from Arkansas has stressed the need for ``stability'' \nso\n\n[[Page S7675]]\n\nfamilies can plan. Whatever we do with these tax policies, as much as \npossible, we need to do them in a permanent way. This business of going \n1 year at a time or 2 years at a time on the estate tax--if someone's \nfamily has a taxable estate event this year, it is not a big deal; if \nthey have it in January, it is devastating. We don't need to continue \nto have that.\n  This shouldn't be a partisan issue. It is about protecting families \nand the things they have put together, often working side by side as a \nfamily. We need to work across the aisle on this issue and other \nissues.\n\n\n                             Rules Changes\n\n  One of the issues that right now is making that harder than it needs \nto be is this discussion of the rules changes. Some people want to \nchange the historic role of the Senate which is designed to foster \ncompromise and debate as we had this week on the Defense bill, or like \nwe had as the Russian trade bill came to the floor.\n\n  Instead of reaching across the aisle, this kind of discussion about a \nrules change is an attempt to build a wall.\n  Now, every time this discussion happens, the minority always appears \nto say the same thing.\n  Senator Reid, the majority leader, pledged, in December 2006, ``to \nrun the Senate with respect for the rules and for the minority rights \nthe rules protect'' when he became the leader.\n  He said:\n\n       The Senate was established to make sure that minorities are \n     protected . . . and I am going to do everything I can to \n     preserve the traditions and rules of this institution that I \n     love.\n\n  In 2005, then-Senator Obama said:\n\n       If the majority chooses to end the filibuster . . . then \n     the fighting and bitterness and the gridlock will only get \n     worse.\n\n  In that same year, 2005, Senator Schumer said breaking the rules \nwould ``change the whole balance of power and checks and balances in \nthis great Senate and great country.''\n  And Senator Durbin warned in 2005 that what was then called the \nnuclear option would ``really destroy our system of checks and \nbalances.''\n  Everyone will rush and say: Well, the Republicans talked about doing \nthis then. That is why these people were making these comments. But the \npoint is, the Republicans did not do it. The Republicans did talk about \nit in the majority, and they listened to the minority. They listened to \nthe arguments about the Constitution, and they did not do it. What you \ntalk about may be important, but what you do is really important.\n  Hopefully, Democrats will look at this again and decide they do not \nwant to do it. The Senate rules say it takes 67 Senators to change the \nrules. I believe that is what the Parliamentarian will rule in the next \nSenate if this comes up. Then, if you are going to do it with less than \nthat, you have to immediately vote to overrule the Parliamentarian and \nbreak the rules to change the rules.\n  It does not sound like, to me, that is the way to solve problems or \nto work together, particularly in a Congress where the Senate is \ncontrolled by one party and the House is controlled by the other. What \ngood does it do to force things through our system that cannot possibly \nget to the President's desk?\n  The Senate operates differently from the House of Representatives for \na reason. I was in the House. I liked the House. The House is run by \nthe majority. That is the way the Constitution intended it. They have \n2-year terms, and every year after the election, it was envisioned that \nthe House of Representatives would be more responsive to what voters \nthought they wanted to do that day. But it was also envisioned that the \nSenate would serve as the reason you had to think for a while about \nthis. It would not just be one election, but usually in the Senate it \ntakes a couple of elections where people have verified: No, we want to \nchange course. And changing course in a country as great and as big and \nas diverse as ours is a big decision. The Constitution works that way \nfor a reason.\n  This is a hornet's nest that I do not think we need to kick over. Our \nNation's Founders knew what they were doing. Let's let the House be the \nHouse and the Senate be the Senate. Let's continue to have a reason for \ntwo different legislative bodies. If all we are having is a House that \nworks like the House and a Senate that works like the House, we have \nsignificantly minimized the great genius of the Constitution.\n  Allowing the minority party to exercise its rights to debate and \namend legislation should be the rule, not the exception. I hope the \nSenate, which is led by Democrats today, and will be next year, will \nstop this debate and start figuring out what we can do together to \nsolve problems, just like we have done this week with the Defense bill \nand the trade bill; just like we have done in this Congress with, as I \nsaid to start, with FAA and Transportation and postal reform and the \nfarm bill--all of which came out of committee, were open to wide-\nranging amendments, had a bipartisan vote, and reached the kind of \nlegislative conclusion that the Constitution envisioned and the people \nwe work for have every right to expect.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7675-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7675-S7676]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COLLEGE PRICING TRENDS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the College Board recently released its \nannual report on trends in college pricing. What the report found was \nmore students in debt with higher amounts of debt than ever before.\n  The biggest offenders? No surprise, for-profit colleges. Study after \nstudy continues to show that for-profit college students fare far worse \nthan their peers who graduate from public or private nonprofit \ncolleges.\n  For-profit college students have more debt and oftentimes they \ngraduate with worthless degrees and no way to even repay their debt.\n  The College Board report found that for-profit institutions accounted \nfor 12 percent of all students enrolled in 2008-2009, 28 percent of \nthose who entered repayment of their loans in fiscal year 2009, and 47 \npercent of those who defaulted on their loans by the end of September \n2011. Madam President, 12 percent of students; 47 percent of the \ndefaults--for-profit schools.\n  Why? They charge too much. The kids get too deeply in debt. The \ndiplomas are worthless or the kids drop out of school because they \ncannot afford to finish.\n  Another report recently released by the Institute for Colleges Access \nand Success found that for-profit college students take out more \nprivate student loan debt than their peers.\n  Private student loans are tough. They are burdensome. They do not \ncome with any of the consumer protections that Federal student loans \ncome with, such as flexible repayment plans or loan forgiveness for \npublic service. Private loans are most prevalent at for-profit \ncolleges--there is money to be made on these kids--where 64 percent of \ngraduating students at the for-profit schools have private loan debt.\n\n  One constituent recently contacted my office about his experience at \na for-profit college. He attended the International Academy of Design \nand Technology, a for-profit college in Chicago owned by the Career \nEducation Corporation, one of the major league for-profit colleges.\n  His parents did not have the means to pay for his education but \nhelped him out by cosigning his loans. Now the student and the parents \nhave $103,000 in student loan debt. One of the loans has a 13-percent \ninterest rate and his balance continues to rise.\n  This young man--young man--would like to finish his degree, but he \ncannot afford to. He cannot borrow any more money. He is too deeply in \ndebt. How about that for a dilemma? Madam President, $103,000 in debt, \nno degree, he cannot borrow the money to get a degree.\n  Many of these students find out these for-profit courses they took \nare worthless. They do not transfer anywhere. The diplomas themselves \nturn out to be worthless, and many employers just laugh at them. You \nwould never know that from the advertising these for-profit schools \nengage in.\n  I had a group of students in my office this morning. They are from \nArchbishop John Carroll High School--not too far from the Capitol. They \nare students who know a little bit about being wooed and enticed by \ncolleges and universities. We talked about this. They\n\n[[Page S7676]]\n\nare just being inundated by these schools trying to sign them up.\n  These young people are 18, 19, 20 years old. How are they supposed to \nknow that this so-called college is a joke, that it is a sucker school \nthat basically will drag them in, heap debt on them, and then toss \nthem? They all remembered an ad that I remember from television in town \nthat I thought was the worst.\n  For-profit colleges put out an ad that had a pretty young girl. She \nlooked like she was 19 or 20 years old, and there she was lounging in \nher bedroom saying: You know, you can go to college in your pajamas. \nThey try to get them in this mindset that this is just a click away, a \ndegree is just a click away--as long as you sign up for the debt.\n  I think these students are starting to catch on to the fact that they \nare being enticed into impossible situations.\n  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Quarterly Report on Household \nDebt and Credit revealed that total consumer debt fell again in the \nthird quarter. Sounds like good news--but not for student loans. All \nother types of consumer debt besides student loans has been decreasing; \nthat is, mortgages, auto loans, even credit card debt. Meanwhile, \nstudent loan debt has been growing every quarter for the last 10 years.\n  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York calculates that 11 percent of \nstudent loans are now at least 3 months delinquent. And it is not just \nthe young people. It is their parents, their brothers and sisters, even \ntheir grandparents who are trying to show a little kindness, be \nhelpful, who cosigned for these deadly private student loans at these \nfor-profit schools. It could be people who graduated years before who \nare still making payments--people in their forties, fifties, and \nsixties who end up with student loan debt.\n  One of these people is Eileen Cruz. Eileen took out loans to help her \nsons pay for college. She said she educated her sons to the highest \nstandards, as most parents dream they will do someday. But now she says \nshe feels she is being punished for having done what parents are \nsupposed to do--send their kids to college.\n  She goes on to compare student loan debt to mortgages, but unlike a \nmortgage she cannot refinance it. She is stuck. People like Eileen Cruz \nare putting off major life decisions--health care, dental decisions, \nretirement--because of student loan debt they incurred for their kids.\n  Ana McNamara is another borrower who contacted my office when she \nstarted to feel hopeless about her student loans. Ana is nearly 45 \nyears old and owes more than $200,000 in student loans. How about that? \nShe did what you are suppose to do. She went to college. She worked her \nway through school. She had to take out some loans to help pay the \ncost.\n  After graduating, she said: I need to go to law school. She took out \nsome more loans. When she graduated, her total loan balance was \n$90,000. That is pretty tough. She thought it was manageable though. \nWith interest rates up to 9 percent, though, her balance kept growing \nfaster than she could pay off the loan.\n  Now she says she does not have anything on the Earth but student \nloans. She says she will never have anything to call her own because \nher credit is ruined, ruined because she went to college and law \nschool, borrowing too much money to do it. She cannot even qualify for \na car loan she is so deeply in debt. She believes no matter how hard \nshe works she will never be able to pay off her loans.\n  I guess this is a good point in this presentation to remind \neverybody, student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy--no matter \nhow bad it gets. When you are so deep in debt you cannot imagine \ngetting out of it, you cannot get relief in court. Why?\n  Well, we decided, years ago--maybe 50 years ago--that government \nloans would not be dischargeable. There were a few, perhaps anecdotal \nstories, Apocryphal stories, maybe, about doctors graduating from \nmedical school, then declaring bankruptcy, and walking away from their \ngovernment loans.\n  Well, we took care of that. We said: You cannot discharge government \nstudent loans in bankruptcy. Then, about 5 years ago, the for-profit \nschools came in and said: Count us in too. Let's make sure they cannot \ndischarge our loans either--which, of course, means the for-profit \nschools get the money and the student never ever can escape the debt.\n  Ana McNamara does not think now that she should have even gone to \ncollege. She says it was a big mistake that destroyed her life.\n  What a somber message to hear from a person who originally thought \ncollege was part of the American dream, as most of us were taught.\n  The cost of college is increasing five times faster than inflation. \nIt is not just the for-profit schools, it is across the board. Many \nfor-profit colleges and universities are charging top dollar, many of \nthem from the people who can least afford it. They will accept anybody, \nanybody who can sign on the dotted line that they are a college \nstudent.\n  Students often borrow from the private sector rather than from the \nFederal Government, which means the terms of their loans give them \nlittle protection. These factors and others have led to a national \nstudent debt crisis. For people who really have no other option, as I \nsaid earlier, bankruptcy is no relief.\n  We need to do something about this. This for-profit college industry \nis a national disgrace--to think that they siphon off $30 billion a \nyear in student assistance. If it were a Federal agency, the for-profit \nschools in America would be the ninth largest Federal agency, they take \nin that much money from the Federal Government. They use our money, \ntaxpayers' money, to advertise their worthless schools and worthless \ndiplomas. Everywhere you turn you see their advertising.\n  Young people are lured into it. They do not know any better. Who can \nblame them? It is tough to keep up. You have to believe if the Federal \nGovernment is going to give me a loan to go to school here, this must \nbe a decent place. Not true. It is our fault. We need accreditation \nthat counts. We need to hold these schools accountable for what they \nare doing to these students. We need to put a limit on the amount of \nmoney they can force these kids into borrowing. We need to put some \nskin in the game so if these kids cannot get a job after they get out \nof the college, the schools themselves bear some responsibility for the \ndebt that is left behind.\n  We seriously, seriously need to look at this bankruptcy exemption. \nThis is awful, to think that somebody in their 30s or 40s is $200,000 \nor $300,000 in debt with a worthless diploma from a for-profit school. \nCongress needs to take a look at this issue. We cannot ignore it.\n  We also need to find some relief for Ana and the countless others \nwhose futures are held back by student loan debt and who cannot find a \nway out. This is not a simple problem; there will not be a simple \nsolution. But for those Americans who have nowhere to turn but \nbankruptcy, we should at least provide reasonable and realistic relief \nfrom private student loans. As I said to these students as they were \nwalking out, and I am sure they were stunned this morning: Be ever so \ncareful. These schools will say, you know, it is going to cost $40,000 \na year in tuition, but because we like you, it is only 20. Think about \nsigning up for $20,000 in debt, unless it is a school that is really \nworth the money. That, of course, is an important decision each family \nand student must make.\n  I will put in a plug here. For many students who are not quite sure \nwhere to turn, start with a community college. These are affordable; \nthey are local; they have a variety of courses. Learn a little bit \nabout college and yourself before you plunge into debt for something \nthat may not pay off.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7676-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7676-S7677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTREME WEATHER/CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I met with Jo Ellen Darcy, the Assistant \nSecretary for the Army Corps of Engineers. She came to my office last \nweek to discuss the low levels of water on the Mississippi River. This \nweek the National Weather Service reported the river was 4 feet below \nits average water level at this time of year. I saw it last Friday when \nI drove over the bridge going from Lambert Airport in St. Louis headed \nhome to Springfield.\n  If the level keeps decreasing, the river may become too shallow for \nbarge traffic to pass between St. Louis, MO,\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\nand Cairo, IL. The Mississippi River is a critical transportation \nartery for essential commodities, so the financial impact if the river \nshuts down could reach far beyond the Midwest.\n  The low water levels are the result of this summer's devastating \ndrought that has been continuing to plague many States in the United \nStates. It has been the worst drought in more than half a century in \nthe Midwest. As of last month, over 60 percent of the United States was \nexperiencing drought conditions still. In my State of Illinois, over 90 \npercent of the land is still ``abnormally dry'' or worse.\n  Economists now predict that the drought will cost the government over \n$12 billion in aid to farmers and ranchers. This is in addition to the \ncost of destruction caused in late October by Hurricane Sandy, the \nlargest hurricane to ever form in the Atlantic basin. It is estimated \nthat Sandy will cost almost $80 billion in Federal funding for the \nreplacement of homes, infrastructure, and buildings.\n  Combined, the drought and Sandy will cost the Federal Government tens \nof billions of dollars at a time when we are talking about our debt. It \nis the job of Congress and the administration to help these Americans \nin time of need. Make no mistake about it, we should, we will. But we \nneed to be honest about how we plan for disaster spending. According to \na report by the GAO in September, there have been over 540 disaster \ndeclarations in the last 8 years requiring over $90 billion in Federal \naid. It is time we face facts and state the obvious: Weather is getting \nworse. Extreme weather events are happening with increased frequency \nand intensity.\n  I held a hearing last year to talk about this issue, to examine \nwhether the Federal Government is prepared for this. The answer is no. \nI did not bring in the environmentalists, did not even bring in the \ngovernment employees. I brought in the insurance industry, the people \nwho write casualty policies, who are probably more attuned to the \nweather than anybody. They said many more disastrous weather events \nwill follow, all of them more expensive.\n  The Federal Government needs to rethink how we protect Federal assets \nand provide disaster assistance to communities on a more regular basis. \nMany are saying that 100-year weather events are now happening every 2 \nor 3 years. But as we debate climate change and global warming, the \nmajority of Americans view the recent extreme weather events as \nevidence the problem is no longer vague or distant. Many have likened \nthe effects of climate change to those of steroids in baseball. While \nno one can say that a given home run hit by a player using steroids was \nthe result of the drug, you can attribute the overall increase in the \nbatting average and the number of home runs a player hits during a \nseason to be linked to the use of steroids.\n  Similarly, though the cause of a single weather event cannot be \ndirectly traced to climate change, extreme weather events do serve as a \nwakeup call that an environmental crisis of global proportion is \noccurring.\n  I find it incredible how little we talk about this. When I think \nabout our responsibility in the Senate and Congress, we are almost \nafraid to bring it up because it is controversial, because some on the \nright are in complete denial that anything is going on here. The rise \nin global temperatures has led to rising sea levels, warmer air and, as \na result, more extreme weather. It has also led, at the same time--that \nis why some of this sounds so contradictory--to a decline in the size \nof the Great Lakes. Lake Michigan is losing water--you can see it on \nthe shoreline--at the same time as we say the oceans are rising.\n  The National Climatic Data Center just reported that October was the \n332nd month in a row of above-average global temperatures. That is over \n27 years of warming temperatures. Is that fair warning? I think it is. \nDuring the last decade, the United States has experienced twice as many \nrecord high temperatures as record lows, and scientists project that \nrecord highs will outnumber record lows 20 to 1 by the year 2050.\n  In May, NOAA reported that America had just lived through the hottest \n12 months ever recorded. Even before Sandy and the droughts this year, \nthe United States was still recovering from extreme weather events of \nlast year. In February of last year, Chicago was shut down with 2 feet \nof snow and 60-mile-an-hour winds when a blizzard hammered the city. It \ncaused 36 deaths, stranded 1,500 people on Lake Shore Drive, which I go \nback and forth on every day. I still find it hard to imagine: 1,500 \npeople stuck on Lake Shore Drive. It resulted in $3.9 billion in \nlosses.\n  April was the wettest April in 116 years in the Midwest, forcing the \nMississippi and Missouri Rivers to flood thousands of square miles. \nThis is 2011 I am talking about.\n  There were 326 tornadoes in May throughout the Midwest and Southern \nUnited States, resulting in the deadliest May since 1933.\n  Wildfires burned 3 million acres of property across the Western \nStates causing over $1 billion in damages, and Hurricane Irene \ndevastated the Atlantic coast, causing $4.3 billion in damages, a very \nsmall amount compared to Sandy but significant still for those \naffected.\n  Nationwide, the financial consequences of weather-related disasters \nand climate change hit a historic new high last year. U.S. disasters \ncaused over $55 billion in damages. Federal, State, and local \ngovernments are paying out more every year in damages and lost \nproductivity. So the question is, as a government, what are we going to \ndo about this? Is this the new normal?\n  The insurance and defense sectors have looked at the scientific data. \nThey are changing their operations. They are preparing for worse and \neven bigger losses.\n  Insurance commissioners in California, New York, and Washington now \nrequire companies to disclose how they are working to plot the effects \nof climate change and their responses. Congress may be in denial, but \nthe real world, the private sector, is not. As the government is the \nultimate insurer of millions of Americans in the crop insurance and \nNational Flood Insurance Programs, we have to get serious about \naddressing the cause and effects of climate change and the solvency and \nfuture of these important programs.\n  Computer models suggest that the storms and heat waves we are seeing \nwill become stronger and more extreme in the future, causing even \ngreater damage. Congress can no longer afford to ignore this issue.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7677-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7677-S7680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FISCAL CHALLENGES\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, this is a critical moment. Over the next \nfew weeks, serious choices must be made about how our Nation spends its \nmoney, about our national budget. At its heart, a budget is a statement \nof balance. A budget shows the world what we care about, what we \nprioritize, what we invest in, how we intend to build our future. \nEveryone who comes to this Chamber comes with their own values, \nrepresenting their own State. But each of us also knows we have to find \na way to bridge those divides to work together to solve the enormous \nfiscal challenges we face as a Nation. That means addressing the more \nthan $500 billion in automatic spending cuts, tax increases, and other \nfiscal changes all scheduled to take place at the beginning of the next \nyear and known collectively as the fiscal cliff.\n  We find ourselves at the edge of this cliff because of our shared \nbeliefs that deficits matter and that we can't keep spending money we \ndon't have. As it stands today, our deficit and debt are unsustainable. \nLast year we ran a budget deficit of well over $1 trillion, and now we \nhave a national debt that exceeds $16 trillion. If we don't get these \nnumbers under control, interest payments will inevitably skyrocket, \ntaking up a larger and larger percentage of our budget until they crowd \nout other critical, progrowth investments in our country's \ncompetitiveness and the essential social safety net that puts a circle \nof protection around the most vulnerable in our country. I don't \nbelieve either one of us wants to put those two vital things at risk.\n\n[[Page S7678]]\n\n  When a budget is so out of balance we have to take a hard look at \nboth the money coming in and the money going out. The only way to get \nback on track, in my view, is to address both sides of this equation--\nrevenue and spending. We have to find a balanced solution that combines \ntough spending cuts with reforms to our Tax Code that bring in more \nrevenue while also ensuring fairness to taxpayers. I believe there is \nreal momentum for this kind of big, balanced, bipartisan solution for \nthe first time in a long time.\n  We have seen some courageous Republicans in both the House and Senate \nrecently stand and say that revenue has to be on the table and a few \neven that an increase in tax rates for the wealthiest Americans may be \nnecessary to get a budget deal that moves us forward. They know what we \nall know--that, frankly, even the most drastic across-the-board \nspending cuts, like the kinds contained in the sequester that will kick \nin in January, won't save enough to close the budget gap. At the same \ntime, across-the-board, meat ax cuts to domestic programs violate some \nof our basic American values by failing to protect the most vulnerable \nin our society, those who I believe our values call us to put a circle \nof protection around, even in this most difficult recovery.\n  Risking public safety, for example, by cutting funding for police and \nfirefighters or leaving families out in the cold this winter by cutting \nheating assistance to low-income seniors--these are not American \nvalues. They are not the best way to solve our fiscal challenge. The \ntruth is that those programs specifically have already been cut more \nthan I would ever have liked to have seen. The Budget Control Act \npassed last year made a dramatic $1 trillion in spending cuts over the \ncoming decade, which fell like an ax on some community-based programs \non which Delaware families depend and which I used as county executive, \nin partnership with our community, to fight for the disabled for \naffordable housing and for low-income heating assistance programs.\n  So let's not let this moment pass us by. Let's instead seize the \nopportunity before us and start finding areas where, across the aisle \nand between the Chambers of the Senate and the House, we can agree. One \nof those areas of agreement is the need to extend tax cuts for the \nmiddle class, for families and small businesses still working their way \nout of the deep hole of the financial collapse of 2008 and still making \ntheir way through this recovery.\n  No one from either party, from the House, the Senate, or any State in \nthis country, wants to raise taxes on middle-class families and small \nbusinesses and families like Deborah's.\n  Deborah is a single mother in Wilmington, DE--my hometown--who is \nworking a full-time job and a part-time job on top of that just to make \nends meet. She wrote to my office, concerned about tax increases and \nthe fiscal cliff. She said that ``the middle class is the heart and \nsoul of this country--what keeps it going--what else can we be hit \nwith? I know that I cannot take on any more financially.''\n  So my first call today is let's give Deborah and families like hers \nin Delaware and around the country the certainty, before we end this \ncalendar year, of knowing their taxes will not go up in 26 days when \nthe calendar turns to 2013. One way to do that is for the House to take \nup and pass legislation this body has already considered and passed in \na bipartisan way that would extend the Bush-era tax cuts for 98 percent \nof families and 97 percent of small businesses while also achieving \nnearly $1 trillion in debt and deficit reduction.\n  This bill extends tax cuts that would otherwise expire for all \nAmericans who earn income and for all small businesses that earn \nrevenue but just on the first $200,000 of individual income or $250,000 \nin family income.\n  Tax rates on income over and above $\\1/4\\ million a year would revert \nto the levels of the Clinton administration, the time of enormous \neconomic growth and prosperity.\n  This one step would blunt the impact of the fiscal cliff for the vast \nmajority of Americans and give them the certainty they so badly need. \nIt would also be a serious downpayment on meaningful deficit reduction \nand ensure that our budget more closely reflects our values, our \nfundamental belief in the American dream and that if you work hard, you \ncan still get ahead.\n  Leading Republicans in the House and the Senate, including Senator \nSnowe and Congressman Cole, have urged the House to move forward and \npass this bill to provide badly needed security and certainty to \nmiddle-class families before the end of this year. I join their call, \nbut let's not stop there. Let's keep going and find additional areas of \ncompromise and constructive common ground to provide the business \ncommunity with the certainty they need to plan the deployment and \ninvestment of capital so they can get Americans back to work. This \nwould provide the market with certainty to sustain this recovery, while \ncontinuing to invest in our future. This would help families who need \nto know their budget future and need to be able to have confidence to \ntake risks, to invest in growth. They want to educate their children, \nto buy a larger home, to take care of their children and their parents. \nTo find the kind of balanced, bipartisan, long-term solution we need is \nto find a solution to all of these problems.\n  It is only by coming together over the next few weeks--not as \nRepublicans and Democrats but as Americans--that we can avoid a fiscal \ncalamity that was entirely predictable. This is the result of a decade \nof unresolved budget fighting in this Chamber. For both parties, simply \nblaming the other side and waiting for the next election to give us a \nstronger mandate is no longer a tolerable or sustainable path forward. \nWorking together is not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength.\n  Americans have faced tough times before, but our strength has always \nbeen our unity and our ability to come together. It is my hope, my \nprayer, that faced with the challenge of the impending fiscal cliff, we \ncan do it again.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to enter \ninto a colloquy with the senior Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Would my colleague yield?\n  Madam President, I want to follow up--we are supposed to talk about \ntomorrow being Delaware Day, if I could do that. But I wish to follow \nup on Senator Coons' remarks on the fiscal cliff.\n  A friend of mine who has done a lot of research on the fiscal cliff \nsays that if you look at domestic and discretionary spending, that is \nnot really the overwhelming problem as far as why we continue to have a \nbig budget deficit. The problem is really twofold. One of those is that \nif you look at revenues as a percentage of GDP, historically when we \nhave been in budget, the revenues as a percentage of GDP, at least in \nthe last 10, 15 years, revenues have been about 21 percent of GDP. \nToday they are about 15, 16 percent of GDP.\n  But the other big driver in our deficit situation going forward is \nhealth care costs. It is health care costs, including Medicare and \nMedicaid. While we have to be smart enough to try to figure it out \nwhile being humane about caring for older people and the poor who count \non Medicaid and Medicare to some extent, we have to focus on how to get \nbetter health care results for less money. That is what we have to \nfocus on--how to get better health care results for less money. There \nare a lot of good ideas for doing that. Some of them are actually part \nof the health care law for our country.\n  So it is revenues, and the other key here is better health care \nresults for less money. We need to make sure that we have focused on \nMedicare and Medicaid in a humane way and that we do so in a way that \ndoesn't harm, doesn't hurt, is not mean-spirited to those who depend on \nthose programs.\n  At the same time, we need to preserve those programs for the coming \ngenerations. For the pages down here--how old are you guys? Fifteen, \nsixteen years of age? Several of you are nodding your heads. We want to \nmake sure these programs are still around when you are 65, 66, 67 or \nolder. That is what this is for. It is sort of a P.S. to the wonderful \ncomments of my colleague from Delaware.\n  What is tomorrow in Delaware, I ask the Senator?\n  I seem to forget. What is this all about?\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, as anyone who has looked at the beautiful\n\n[[Page S7679]]\n\nDelaware flag knows--and it flies in our offices and hallways here--it \nhas a date emblazoned on the bottom--December 7, 1787, and that is \nknown as Delaware Day. That is the day when Delaware became the first \nState to ratify the Constitution. So to celebrate Delaware Day, we do \nsome things together, don't we?\n\n  Mr. CARPER. And we have fun doing them. One of the things we are \ngoing to do--a great idea from a brandnew Senator to Delaware about a \nyear ago--is to have a ``Taste of Delaware.'' In fact, we are doing \nthat this afternoon. It is not something paid for by the Federal \nGovernment but sponsored by our Delaware State Chamber of Commerce, as \nI recall, and others of its members to sort of be able to show off some \nof the finest of our State, and some of them pretty tasty, as it turns \nout. So we are looking forward to a lot of people coming by and \nenjoying that.\n  Mr. COONS. We are looking forward to doing that in just a few \nminutes, actually. We have Dogfish Head Beer, we have Grottos pizza, \nand Capriotti subs, and dozens of restaurateurs and breweries and \nwineries from across Delaware--in age-appropriate settings--who will \nmake available some of the finest of what Delaware has to offer. So it \nis my hope members of staff and our colleagues will join in the \ncelebration of Delaware Day.\n  One of the questions folks who are listening might have is: What \nabout Delaware are you celebrating? It is, in my experience--and I \nbelieve my colleague's--a State that is not just the First State \nbecause of a wonderful accident of history, where we were the first \nState to have the vision and the courage to sign the Constitution, to \nratify it, but it is also a State that has a nearly unique culture--a \nculture of respect, of innovation, of education, and of civility. It is \na place that has a special, even a unique political culture, one that \nis at times the polar opposite of what I have seen here--forgive me, \nMadam President--in the last 2 years. Delaware, much like New \nHampshire, feels and seems like a small town that is, through the magic \nof federalism and the Connecticut Compromise and the Continental \nCongress, a State with two Senators.\n  One of the things I am proudest of about my State--and Senator Carper \nknows this well--is a tradition that just celebrated its 200th \nanniversary. It is the epitome of what we call the Delaware Way. It is \na tradition that happens 2 days after every election. It is called \nReturn Day, and it happens in Georgetown, which is the county seat of \nour southernmost county, Sussex County. What happens 2 days after the \nelection--or the first thing that happens, because there are a lot of \ndifferent pieces to it--is we all gather out at a local farm, and two \nby two--ark rules--the candidates who ran against each other in the \ngeneral election get into horse-drawn carriages and ride--slowly--down \nthe main streets of Georgetown where crowds of thousands come out to \nsee the candidates, who just days before were engaged in vigorous \npolitical combat, being polite, being friendly, and waving to the \ncrowds.\n  What happens after that, I ask Senator Carper?\n  Mr. CARPER. We have this beautiful center of Georgetown, with all \nthese beautiful old brick buildings, courthouses and other buildings, \nand as we gather there in the circle of Georgetown--and the Senator may \nhave said this and I just missed it--but the town crier comes out on \nthe balcony of the courthouse and he has on his top hat and his tails \nand he announces the results of the election 2 days earlier. This is \nThursday after the election. He calls out the results of the election 2 \ndays earlier just for Sussex County, DE, where about a sixth of our \nState's population lives. He calls out the results of everything from \nPresident, Vice President, all the way down to justice of the peace or \nsheriff. And when he finishes, we have a couple of short speeches on \nthe platform there in front of thousands of people, maybe a patriotic \nsong or two, and then the leaders of parties, Democrat, Republican, \nmaybe Libertarian chairman, take a hatchet--a pretty big hatchet--and \nthey grab it, each holding on, and they put it down in a glass aquarium \nhalf full of sand. And then someone brings in some buckets of sand, \nmaybe from Rehoboth Beach or Dewey Beach, and they cover up and \nliterally bury the hatchet.\n  Some of my colleagues from New Jersey said: If we had a ceremony like \nthat in our State, and we buried the hatchet, it probably wouldn't be \nin the sand. It would be in the anatomy or some part of the body of our \nopponents. But we do it in the sand. And then we have maybe a \nbenediction, and we go off and eat, and people open their homes for a \nreception. So as the day carries on and the Sun sets in the west, the \ntravails and the passions of the election begin to dissipate and people \nstart to think and refocus not on how do we beat our opponents' brains \nout but how do we work together to govern our State.\n  It is a wonderful tradition. We have talked about this before. I \nthink we could use a return day for our country. It certainly works in \nour State. It has a very civilizing effect on all our campaigns.\n  Mr. COONS. Whether it is the reception in the morning, the long \ncarriage ride through the middle of Georgetown, the speeches on the \npodium, the announcement of the results, the literal burying of the \nhatchet, or the receptions that go on all afternoon and into the night, \nthe experience of Return Day for me--and I believe for my colleague \nSenator Carper--has been one of reconciliation, one of moving past the \nelection and then forward toward the challenge of making decisions \ntogether for the people we represent.\n  Everybody shows up--the winners and the losers. It is only the sorest \nof losers who don't show up and only the most arrogant of winners who \ndon't show up. So, frankly, it is almost always everybody. In the \nelections I have been blessed to stand in and be successful in for the \npeople of Delaware, the Return Day is a great end to the campaign \nseason and beginning of our season of service to the people of \nDelaware.\n  So as we go from the floor now to the reception in honor of Delaware \nDay, I want to say how grateful I am to serve with my senior Senator, \nwho has always been personally a model of the civility, of \ngraciousness, and of the service that marks the Delaware Way and marks \nDelaware Day which we celebrate officially tomorrow but which we kick \noff tonight with a reception.\n  Mr. CARPER. I would add to that this is a commitment to civility that \nSenator Coons and I share, and it is also one that our Congressman John \nCarney certainly does, and winning in races before him, Mike Castle. If \nyou think of all of those--Castle with a ``C'', Carney with a ``C'', \nCoons with a ``C'', and Carper with a ``C''--people say what is it with \nthe letter ``C'' and the State of Delaware? If I can, before I close \nhere, I want to roll back in time about the economy of our State. \nPeople say what do you all do there? How do you provide for your \nliving, your income? I would say the economy of our State is pretty \nmuch founded on the letter ``C.'' It includes corn. We started off by \ngrowing corn. Then chickens. There are a whole of lot of chickens \nthere. For every person in Delaware, there are 300 chickens. For anyone \nlistening and wondering what to have for dinner, chicken would be good. \nWe have chemicals--the DuPont Company. A poor impoverished French \nfamily came to Delaware over 200 years ago and established what I call \nthe DuPont country club. They didn't have many members. They figured \nthey needed to establish some jobs so people could join their country \nclub, so they started a chemical company, and a power company, and now \nthey have quite a successful science company in our State--for over 200 \nyears. We have cars. We have built a lot of cars over the years for GM \nand Chrysler. We are home to corporations of over half the New York \nStock Exchange, half the Fortune 500. Credit card businesses are in our \nState. The coast of our State is the site of the Nation's summer \ncapital--Rehoboth Beach and a bunch of other places. So the letter \n``C'' has been pretty big.\n\n  People say: Well, why do they call you the First State? Well, we are \nactually the first colony that threw off the yoke of British tyranny on \nJune 15, 1776 and at the same time said to Pennsylvania, take a hike, \nwe want to be a State on our own. And then 225 years from tomorrow, to \nbe exact, we were the first State to ratify the Constitution.\n  We have the best beaches in the country. Last year I think there were \nfour five-star beaches in America, with\n\n[[Page S7680]]\n\ntwo of them in Delaware--Rehoboth and Dewey Beach. We have the best Air \nForce base, we think, in the world. We were first in Ph.Ds per capita. \nWe have, I think, the finest Judiciary--acknowledged year after year \nafter year as the finest judicial system in the States. We have the \nbest financial controls and cash management system. We have had triple \nA credit rating since--what was that guy's name as Governor, Carper or \nsomething? We continue to have that kind of credit rating. So we are \nproud of being first.\n  What is our State motto? ``It is good to be first.'' And we attempt \nto be first in a whole lot of ways. Some things you don't want to be \nfirst in, and we want to be last in those. But we are proud of what we \nare first in--first in civility.\n  As Senator Coons said, this all goes back to Return Day. When you \nannounce your candidacy for election, whether it is for the U.S. Senate \nor as sheriff, you know at the end of the campaign--2 days after the \ncampaign--you are going to be in Georgetown, DE, in a horse-drawn \ncarriage or maybe an antique car with the man or woman you were running \nagainst, their family, your family, and surrounded by friends and \nsupporters and thousands of other people. And I think it has a very \ntempering effect on the nature of our campaigns, a wonderful effect.\n  That is one of much that we are proud of in our State. We are lucky \nto be Senators from this State, but this is a State that works and \nfocuses on results. This is a State where we govern from the middle, \nwhether the Governor is DuPont or Castle or Carper or Markell. And \nwhether the Senator is Carper or Coons or Biden or Kaufman, we govern \nfrom the middle. We are a State where Democrats and Republicans \nactually like each other. We just want to get things done and do what \nis right for our State.\n  With that in mind, we hope some of our friends and neighbors can join \nus later today in the Russell Building up on the third floor. We will \nmake a toast to Delaware and enjoy some sarsaparilla and some other \ngoodies as well.\n  It is a great joy to serve with my friend.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank my colleague.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Let me be the first to congratulate my two colleagues \nfrom Delaware on Delaware Day. Have a happy Delaware Day.\n  We have a lot of great things in Colorado, but I am not going to try \nto outcompete you on beaches this afternoon. We don't have a lot of \nthose. I do think it puts me in mind of something, and that is our \nconstitution. Delaware, as Senator Coons mentioned, was the first State \nto ratify the Constitution of this great country. My State didn't \nbecome a State until nearly a century later. We are the Centennial \nState as a result of that.\n  That constitution that enabled generation upon generation of \nAmericans had a preamble which said: to secure the blessings of liberty \nfor ourselves and our posterity. It is important in these days of these \nbudget discussions to remind ourselves they didn't stop with \nthemselves. The document doesn't stop with ourselves. It is about \nourselves and our posterity. That is what we are talking about here \nwhen we are involved in this budget discussion. These aren't decisions \nthat are about ourselves, these are decisions that are about the next \ngeneration of Americans and the generation after that. And it is time \nfor us to do our job. It is time for us to walk back from this fiscal \ncliff and come up with a comprehensive plan. We know what the outlines \nof that are today, and we need to stop playing political games in this \nholiday season and get this work done, not for ourselves but for our \nposterity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7680-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TROOPS TO TEACHERS\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, as you know, I have been to the floor \nmany times in the last several years to talk about the dysfunction that \nreigns in this place too often. But today I am here on a happier \noccasion because I want to celebrate an accomplishment, a bipartisan \naccomplishment that I think is very important. We were able to work \ntogether earlier this week to improve and expand something called \nTroops to Teachers. Nothing makes a greater difference to student \nlearning than great teaching. Our teachers are critical to our kids' \nsuccess and, to a greater extent, our country's competitiveness in the \neconomy.\n  America's future depends on our ability to recruit and retain great \nteachers. And by the way, we are falling down on the job. Fifty percent \nof the people who go into teaching leave the profession in the first 5 \nyears, which means we don't have the benefit of the experience they \nhave gained over that period of time. And I will save for another day \nwhat we need to do about this, but for today's purposes let me observe \nwe have done almost nothing--virtually nothing--as a country to change \nthe way we think about recruiting teachers, retaining teachers, \ninspiring teachers in this country since we had a labor market that \ndiscriminated against women and gave them two professional choices, one \nbeing a teacher, or a nurse.\n  Thank goodness, those days are long gone. But we have not modernized \nour system to make it as attractive to people as it needs to be if we \nare serious about educating the next generation of Americans. I believe \nit is our duty in that context to ensure we support new and existing \npathways to the teaching profession. We should be making it easier, not \nharder, for those who want to serve our country in America's \nclassrooms. Troops to Teachers is one of those undertakings. It has \nbeen recruiting and placing veterans and service men and women in \nclassrooms around the country since 1994. It brings veterans and \nservicemembers into some of the hardest-to-serve areas in our country.\n  But in Colorado and across the United States we have school districts \nnear military installations that have not been eligible to participate \nin Troops to Teachers. These barriers send exactly the wrong message. \nIf veterans want to make a difference in a student's life, they should \nbe able to teach where they are needed most. That is why in 2009 I \nworked with Senator McCain and his staff to introduce legislation to \nmake it easier for veterans to participate and continue their service \nin our classrooms.\n  These changes to the program will increase the number of schools \neligible to participate by 49 percent. In Colorado alone, that means it \nwill open over 1,000 of our schools to veterans and servicemembers who \nwant to participate. As someone who has spent a lot of time in the \nclassrooms as a former superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, the \nbenefits of Troops to Teachers for our students are crystal clear to \nme.\n  When he talks about this program, Senator McCain often mentions his \nEnglish teacher--Mr. William B. Ravenel--an Army veteran who served \nwith General Patton in World War II. Because there is no way I could \nsay it better, I wish to quote my friend from Arizona.\n\n       Every child should be blessed with a teacher like I had, \n     and to learn at institutions with high academic standards and \n     codes of conduct that reinforce the values their parents try \n     to impart to them. Many students do have that opportunity. \n     But too many do not. And government should be concerned with \n     their fate.\n\n  I could not agree more with Senator John McCain. Our military is the \nstrongest in the world not because of our weapons or our tanks but \nbecause of the men and women who choose to serve. Troops to Teachers \nenlists their talents, their drive, their commitment to help make \nAmerica's system of public education once again the driver of the \nAmerican dream.\n  I am glad to have done this bipartisan work with Senator McCain to \npass this amendment, and I wish to thank Senator McCain and his staff \nwho worked so hard to get this over the finish line.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Senator Webb for his leadership on \nthis initiative, as well as Chairman Levin and the staff of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7680-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7680-S7681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CUBA TRADE EMBARGO\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate voted to grant \npermanent normal trade relations to Russia by a vote of 92 to 4, and I \nstrongly supported that bill.\n\n[[Page S7681]]\n\n  To extend PNTR to Russia, we had to repeal an out-of-date policy that \nwas adopted during the Cold War; that is, the Jackson-Vanik amendment. \nI wish to speak briefly on the Senate floor this afternoon about \nanother out-of-date policy of the Cold War that I believe should be \nended; that is, the trade embargo on Cuba.\n  I have spoken about this many times in the past. Along with Senator \nPell, Senator Dodd, and many others, I argued against the Helms-Burton \nAct in 1996.\n  For the past 50 years, our country's policy toward Cuba has been \nessentially stagnant. The core element of our foreign policy--which is \nthe embargo--was authorized in a proclamation signed by President \nKennedy on February 3, 1962; that is, 51 years ago. At that time, \nPresident Kennedy justified the embargo by citing the `` . . . \nsubversive offensive of Sino-Soviet Communism with which the Government \nof Cuba is publicly aligned. . . . ''\n  He also stated his willingness to \n``. . . take all necessary actions to promote national and hemispheric \nsecurity by isolating the present Government of Cuba and thereby \nreducing the threat posed by its alignment with the communist powers.''\n  It is an understatement to say President Kennedy's rationale is from \na different era. The Cold War is over. The ``subversive offensive of \nSino-Soviet Communism'' has been turned back. What remains of the \nCommunist powers he was referring to are now our major trading \npartners. We have now extended permanent normal trade relations to \nRussia, which was, of course, the principal Communist power to which \nPresident Kennedy was referring, and neither Cuba nor those Communist \npowers pose a threat to national or hemispheric security today.\n  The world has changed. It is long past time that we change our policy \ntoward Cuba. The embargo should have been lifted decades ago. It does \nnot serve our national interest. It does not make our country safer. It \ndoes no good for the people of Cuba whom we claim to want to help. They \nwould have better jobs and better lives if they could do business with \nthe United States, which is the biggest economy in the world. The \nembargo does not help their families in the United States. Until \nrecently, their families in the United States were severely restricted \nin how often they could visit and how much money they could send back \nto their relatives. It is ironic that for so long our policy for \nopposing the repression of freedoms in Cuba has included restricting \nthe freedom of Americans to travel to see their families in that \ncountry.\n  As I have said before, I deplore the repression of the Castro \nbrothers' government. The United States should support the efforts of \nthe Cuban people to fight for their basic rights, and they need our \nhelp. Earlier this year, Amnesty International issued a damning \nassessment that said:\n\n       The Cuban government wages a permanent campaign of \n     harassment and short-term detentions of political opponents \n     to stop them from demanding respect for civil and political \n     rights. The Cuban government should release all political \n     prisoners.\n\n  The Cuban Government should also release Alan Gross, the American who \nhas been jailed for more than 3 years now for distributing telephones \nin Cuba. As I understand it, he is in poor health and a humanitarian \nparole is more than justified.\n  When we hear about the Cuban Government's policies toward people--the \nrepression of their basic freedoms, the persecution of political \ndissidents--it is understandable to want to punish the government and \nto weaken it so it collapses. We have to ask ourselves if our goal is \nto punish the Cuban Government or, instead, to help the Cuban people. \nOur goal should be to help the Cuban people.\n  Further, we have to ask ourselves whether continuing the embargo will \naccomplish that goal. In my view, the answer is clearly no.\n  It defies belief and 50 years of historical evidence to think that \ncontinuing the embargo will result in the toppling of the Castro \nregime. That regime has survived 50 years of sanctions. Fidel Castro is \n84 years old. Raul Castro is 81 years old. It is much more likely that \nold age and ill health will end their rule rather than the embargo \nending their rule; nor will continuing the embargo into a sixth \ndecade--which is what we are now in danger of doing--result in the \nrelease of Alan Gross or political prisoners in Cuba or a sudden shift \nto democracy.\n  A better approach is to build relationships between the people and \nbusinesses in the United States and the people and businesses in Cuba. \nInteraction is a more powerful driver of change than isolation. We \nshould allow more travel, we should allow more communication, and we \nshould allow more commerce.\n\n  I wish to be clear that ending the embargo would not mean we agree \nwith the Cuban Government's policies, nor does it mean we must stop \nadvocating for basic freedoms and democracy in that nation. We need to \nbe clear-eyed about the human rights abuses in Cuba. But the United \nStates, as the only remaining superpower in the world, should be able \nto balance these goals. It is the approach we have taken with China. It \nis the approach we are taking with our vote today with Russia.\n  I wish to point out that as in Cuba, there are significant concerns \nabout human rights and democracy in Russia. In fact, the legislation we \nvoted on to expand our economic ties with Russia includes sanctions \ntargeted at people who commit human rights violations. Those provisions \nare, of course, called the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law and \nAccountability Act. They were authored by Senators Cardin, Kyl, McCain, \nand others. We could take a similar approach with Cuba, expanding \neconomic ties while continuing to put pressure on those responsible for \nrepressing basic rights and basic freedoms.\n  Ultimately, because of the web of sanctions legislation that has been \nenacted over the years, only Congress has the authority to fully lift \nthe embargo. But until Congress is willing to end that embargo, I hope \nthe President will act.\n  The President has substantial authority to loosen the restrictions on \ntravel and commerce. President Obama has already taken important steps, \nfor example, by removing restrictions on family travel and authorizing \nlicenses for the sale of communications equipment. I urge the President \nto make maximum use of the authorities he does have to relax sanctions. \nIt should have been done long ago. I hope it can be done soon.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about my friend \nand colleague Senator Jim Webb. He has made a decision not to run for \nreelection which, for me, is very sad, but it is truly not a good deal \nfor the State of Virginia or our country. Jim Webb has served one term \nin the Senate. He accomplished more in that one term than most do in a \nlifetime. I repeat, I am very sorry to see him leave.\n  Jim is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, a highly decorated \nMarine. He was an infantry officer and served with distinction in \nVietnam, and that is an understatement. He did serve with \ndistinction. He earned a Navy Cross, which is the second highest \ndecoration in the Navy and Marine Corps. He got that for heroism in \nVietnam. He was awarded a Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, two Purple \nHearts.\n\n  He, of course, wanted to be in the military all of his life, but when \nhe returned from Vietnam he could not do it anymore. His injuries from \nthe war prevented him from doing that. He attended Georgetown Law \nSchool where he graduated with distinction, served 4 years with \nPresident Reagan as Assistant Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the \nNavy. He was the first Naval Academy graduate to serve as the civilian \nhead of the Navy. He is also an author, having written six books, a \nfilmmaker, screen writer. He even won an Emmy.\n  Long after Jim Webb left the Marine Corps, and despite his many \ncivilian\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\naccomplishments, he remains a marine at heart. He is a marine through \nand through. He learned the tradition of service at home, although home \nchanged often with his father's duty station. Jim's father was an \nofficer in the U.S. Air Force and a pilot during World War II.\n  Jim's son, Jimmy Webb, a marine who served in Iraq, continued that \ntradition of service. Although Jim Webb was a vocal opponent of the \nIraq war, he was incredibly proud of his son's service as a soldier in \nbattle-torn Iraq. Every day of his 2006 campaign, Jim Webb wore his \nson's combat boots. It was a tribute not only to Jimmy, his boy, but to \nall people who have been sent into harm's way, he said.\n  I met Jim Webb in my office not far from here as a result of Senator \nBob Kerrey asking me if I would spend some time with him. I was happy \nto do so. I will never forget that meeting, just the three of us in the \nroom. Those of us who worked with Bob Kerrey know he is and was such a \nvibrant person. He was almost mischievous, I guess you could put it. \nYou could just tell he had a little touch of differentness.\n  When he brought Jim in to visit with me I learned very quickly they \nwere both warriors--Bob Kerrey, a Navy Seal, recipient of the Medal of \nHonor, and Jim Webb, as we said, Navy Cross, a Silver Star, two Bronze \nStars, both veterans of the Vietnam war.\n  As we sat talking, it was obvious they were both fighters, warriors. \nJim certainly proved that in his 2006 campaign. The reason Bob wanted \nme to visit with him is because Jim Webb had decided he wanted to run \nfor the Senate. What did I think of it?\n  I probably told Jim what a lot of people told him: You want to run \nfor the Senate? The election is right upon us.\n  He said, I want to do that.\n  Not many believed he had any chance of winning. He believed he could, \nBob Kerrey believed he could, but he ran because he wanted to and, boy, \ndid he run hard.\n  For me, though, it did not settle in my mind until the night before \nthe election. There was an event in Alexandria, VA. It was a cold \nNovember night. I stood with Jim on that stage. I realized then that he \ncould win. People were lined up for blocks. ``Lined up'' was the wrong \nword--people covered blocks. Every open space as far as you could see \nwas filled with people.\n  President Clinton was there. I was there. They didn't come to see me, \nof course. They came to see not President Clinton, they came to see Jim \nWebb because he was doing the impossible. He had captivated the voters. \nHe was unafraid. He spoke his mind. And what a smart man.\n  I marvel at the intelligence of Jim Webb, his ability to learn and to \nexpress his ideas. As I said, he captivated the voters. That is really \nwhy he won the race he should not have been able to win.\n  Once he was elected, he was a marvel to watch. He believed he could \nchange the world. He did change several corners of the world. Let me \ngive one example. He was a new Senator and he came to me and said, I \nhave an idea. Jim Webb is not a person who just focuses on an idea and \nwalks away from it. When Jim Webb came to see me, he had the \nlegislation he had drafted. It was not sent to some bill drafter to \nhave him look it over, he drafted the legislation himself. What did he \nwant to do? He wanted to introduce a post-\n9/11 GI Bill Of Rights. What he wanted to do was expand educational \nbenefits for military families and he brought our commitment to our \nveterans to the standard enjoyed by World War II veterans. He was just \na freshman Senator.\n  After spending about an hour with him with facts and figures and the \nactual legislation, I said sign me up. I will do whatever I can to help \nyou with it.\n  A brandnew Senator passed this major piece of legislation. He built a \ncoalition of veterans and Democratic and Republican Senators to fight \nfor this legislation. Since this legislation became law in 2008, more \nthan 750,000 veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and their \nfamilies have used the program to access the education they deserve.\n  Jim, who speaks Vietnamese, has also helped shape our country's \nforeign policy in other places. He played a key role in Burma where he \nsecured the rights of democracy activists such as Aung San Suu Kyi, who \ncame and visited us a month or so ago.\n  Jim Webb is a unique individual in so many different ways. He has \nvisited many of the places where the battles were fought in World War \nII. He went to those islands and spent time walking to see what the \nveterans had gone through in a war prior to the one in which he was \ninvolved. He actually did that. It was physically hard, but he wanted \nto do that and he did it on his own.\n  Robert Kennedy said:\n\n       Few will have the greatness to bend history itself; but \n     each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and \n     in the total of all those acts will be written the history of \n     this generation.\n\n  Jim Webb should be proud of his part--it was not a small part--in \nwriting the history of his generation. He did it in the battlefields in \nVietnam. He did it in the Pentagon. He did it here in the Senate.\n  I do not know what is ahead for Jim Webb, but we have not heard the \nlast of him. He has a wonderful, beautiful wife and wonderful children. \nHe left his mark on the Senate and he will never be forgotten, even \nthough he served here one term. I am really sorry his Senate career was \nnot longer, but I am gratified it was so productive.\n  I congratulate Jim Webb and express on this Record how much I admire \nhim and what a strength he has been to me. He was a strength to me on \nthe health care bill. He has given me wonderful information on \nimmigration--which I have spent a lot of time on. I have read some of \nhis books. I have not read them all but I read a couple of them. He is \nsomebody I will miss very much and I will always consider Jim Webb \nsomebody who made me a better person.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Sheriff Hickman made 21st century \nimprovements to office computers, patrol cars, and provided resources \nfor additional training for officers and staff.\n  In addition, he continuously strived for opportunities to learn the \nnewest methods available to law enforcement officers in programs \noffered by the University of Arkansas division of Criminal Justice \nInstitute and to help meet the needs of rural communities during the \nRural Executive Management Institute.\n  His efforts helped bring nearly $\\1/2\\ million in Federal grants for \nschool resource officers, a domestic violence officer, radio and camera \nequipment for area schools, and law enforcement services in Boone \nCounty. Sheriff Hickman made safety improvements a priority.\n  He has a true passion to making sure the people of Arkansas.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a true \nAmerican hero. During a parade honoring our veterans on November 15, \n2012, in Midland, TX, four of veterans lost their lives when their \nfloat was tragically struck by an oncoming train. Sixteen other \nveterans were also injured.\n  That day, SFC Tommy Shoemaker was among the veterans being honored \nfor their service, and his float was directly ahead of the one struck. \nUpon witnessing this tragedy, SFC Shoemaker jumped from his float that \nwas traveling 40MPH. He, his fellow veterans, and other soldiers began \nimmediately assisting those injured. Prior to ambulances arriving, they \nprovided CPR and life-saving aid to stabilize those injured. SFC \nShoemaker's selfless act of heroism not only saved lives but also is a \ntestament to the special forces training he received.\n  SFC Shoemaker entered the military in 1986 and later served in the \nArmy Reserves in Monroe, LA, and also the Mississippi National Guard. \nIn 2004, he was deployed to Afghanistan as part of an Embedded \nTransition Team. Unfortunately, his convoy unit was attacked twice in \n2005 and again in 2006, the last a combination of road side bombs and \nan ambush.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \ninformation to foster youth on their potential eligibility for Federal \nstudent aid; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we currently have over 400,000 children in \nour foster care system due to abuse or neglect by their biological \nfamilies, with 104,000 eligible for adoption. Tragically every year \nnearly 28,000 of these children age out of our foster care system with \nno place to call home. On average, foster children spend over 3 years \nin the system and around 16 percent languish in the foster care system \nfor over 5 years. Only around 3 percent start college and even fewer \nfinish their degree. We must continue working to connect children in \nour foster system to a safe, loving, and permanent home while also \ndoing more to address their educational outcomes.\n  I am greatly concerned that too many of our Nation's foster youth are \nunable to appropriately access critical Federal programs that provide \nassistance to help increase their educational opportunities. Higher \neducation can hold the key to a future of stability and it is \nunacceptable that many foster youth who are eligible for higher \neducation funds, such as Education and Training Vouchers, ETV, and \nsupport through the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, \nare never told about these programs.\n  This is why I have worked with my colleagues to introduce a \nbipartisan bill to direct the Department of Education to fully utilize \nthe Free Application for Federal Student Aid, FAFSA, as a tool to \nnotify foster youth of all Federal funds which may be available to \nsupport their pursuit of higher education, and include information \nspecifically for foster youth on their agency website.

Res. 611\n\n       Whereas, 21 years ago, the Wreaths Across America project \n     began an annual tradition, during the month of December, of \n     donating, transporting, and placing Maine balsam fir holiday \n     wreaths on the graves of the fallen heroes buried at \n     Arlington National Cemetery;\n       Whereas, since that tradition began, through the hard work \n     and generosity of the individuals involved in the Wreaths \n     Across America project, more than 350,000 wreaths have been \n     sent to more than 800 locations, including national \n     cemeteries and veterans memorials in every State, and to \n     locations overseas;\n       Whereas the mission of the Wreaths Across America project \n     to ``Remember, Honor, Teach'' is carried out in part by \n     coordinating wreath-laying ceremonies at Arlington National \n     Cemetery as well as veterans cemeteries and other locations \n     in all 50 States;\n       Whereas the Wreaths Across America project carries out a \n     week-long veterans parade between Maine and Virginia, \n     stopping along the way to spread a message about the \n     importance of remembering the fallen heroes of the United \n     States, honoring those who serve, and teaching the people of \n     the United States about the sacrifices made by veterans and \n     their families to preserve our freedoms;\n       Whereas, in 2011, wreaths were sent to more than 700 \n     locations across the United States and overseas, 180 more \n     locations than the previous year;\n       Whereas, in December 2012, the Patriot Guard Riders, a \n     motorcycle and motor vehicle group that is dedicated to \n     patriotic events and includes more than 250,000 members \n     nationwide, will continue their tradition of escorting a \n     tractor-trailer filled with donated wreaths from Harrington, \n     Maine, to Arlington National Cemetery;\n       Whereas thousands of individuals volunteer each December to \n     escort and lay the wreaths;\n       Whereas December 10, 2011, was previously designated by the \n     Senate as ``Wreaths Across America Day''; and\n       Whereas the Wreaths Across America project will continue \n     its proud legacy on December 15, 2012, bringing approximately \n     125,000 wreaths to Arlington National Cemetery on that day: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates December 15, 2012, as ``Wreaths Across \n     America Day'';\n       (2) honors the Wreaths Across America project, the Patriot \n     Guard Riders, and all of the volunteers and donors involved \n     in this worthy tradition; and\n       (3) recognizes the sacrifices our veterans, members of the \n     Armed Forces, and their families have made, and continue to \n     make, for our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/06/senate-section/article/S7687-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 61--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n   A CARBON TAX IS NOT IN THE ECONOMIC INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. VITTER (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Coats, Mr. \nCoburn, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Heller, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, \nMr. Johanns, Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin, Mr. Lee, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \nMoran, Mr. Risch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Thune, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Cochran, and \nMr. Wicker) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S.
