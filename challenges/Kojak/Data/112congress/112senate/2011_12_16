Mr. President, I hope we are drawing to a close. We are \nnot certain; there are still some unresolved issues. But the Omnibus \nappropriations bill is moving forward, and it will fund our government \nfor the remainder of this fiscal year. It has been a long and arduous \nprocess.\n  We started by passing three appropriations bills in the Senate, then \nwhen we tried to call the next three we ran\n\n[[Page S8694]]\n\ninto opposition. So the Appropriations Committee, on which I serve, had \nto sit down and try to craft nine separate spending bills and put them \ntogether into one. It was a long and involved and difficult process \nwith the Financial Services Subcommittee which I chair.\n  Included in that committee jurisdiction are the Securities and \nExchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. These \nare the two government agencies responsible for watching Wall Street \nand the major financial institutions markets across America. We are \ndoing our best to not only restore America's confidence in some of \nthese institutions that have been shaken by the recession but also to \nmake certain it never happens again. There is resistance, primarily \nfrom the banking community and some financial institutions that don't \nwant regulation even after the embarrassing failures of the last \nrecession and the need for a Federal Government bailout.\n  We need to make certain that at the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission there are \nadequate funds for them to do the job. I will tell my colleagues \nhonestly that the underfunding of the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission is a serious mistake--serious. MFA Global has been the \nsubject of repeated hearings on Capitol Hill as to what went wrong that \nled to the eighth largest bankruptcy in the history of the United \nStates. Innocent people across America and the world have lost money. \nSome of them have lost their savings because of wrongdoing by someone--\nwe still don't know who. But the agency responsible for monitoring this \nactivity, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is facing a \nmodest--almost immodest--increase in appropriations this year when they \ndesperately need more.\n\n  This is an agency which had a budget of about $200 million in the \nlast year. The administration had asked for $300 million for this year. \nWe will be lucky to come up with anything in the range of $215 million. \nThat is a 7- or 8-percent increase in an agency which desperately needs \nmore not just for personnel--and they need the best professionals--but \nalso for computer technology to keep up with the volume of trades \ntaking place and to monitor activity so as to avoid embarrassment and \nexploitation.\n  This notion by many on the other side of the aisle that we can starve \nthese agencies and somehow end up with a stronger economy is completely \nupside down. The strength of the American economy, whether we are \ntalking about Wall Street or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the \nChicago Board of Options Exchange, is in the fact that we are guided by \nthe rule of law. We encourage and put into law standards of \ntransparency, and we have oversight that is adequate to the job. This \nyear's appropriations bill falls short of that mark.\n  I am also troubled by other provisions in this bill again this year \nconsidered by my subcommittee. Too many Members of Congress, especially \nin the House of Representatives, clearly have missed their real calling \nin life. What they wanted to be was not a Member of Congress but a \nmayor. So in their frustration they decided they will be a Congressman \nfrom their district back home and a surrogate mayor for the District of \nColumbia.\n  Over 800,000 American citizens and taxpayers live in this great city. \nThey have nominally had home rule for decades. Yet time and again, year \nafter year, they are subjected to those would-be mayors from all around \nAmerica who impose standards on this city that they would never suggest \nin their own hometowns. It becomes a social experiment, primarily for \nthe rightwing.\n  One of the programs each year that becomes a source of controversy is \nthe needle exchange program. This program of exchanging needles and \nsyringes is the bridge to those who are addicted to bring them out of \ntheir addiction into a healthy situation. Why would we do this in the \nDistrict of Columbia? Because the incidence of HIV/AIDS infection in \nthis city is the highest in the United States of America. That is the \nreality of life on the streets of Washington--a reality which those who \nhave opposed this program refuse to acknowledge.\n  The medical professionals step forward and say: Do this. We can help \nmake this a cleaner, healthier, safer city if you do it. Time and time \nagain, some folks stand in the House and say: Oh, we are just going to \nget rid of this and show that we are opposed to intravenous drug use.\n  Well, I am opposed to it too, but I know that in addition to strong \nlaws we need thoughtful, commonsense solutions such as the needle \nexchange program that is supported by medical organizations. The fact \nthat this is not taking place in the way it should is an embarrassment, \nand I am sorry this will be included in one part of this appropriations \nbill.\n  Before we leave, we need to do two things in addition to funding our \ngovernment. We need to make certain the payroll tax cut which benefits \n160 million Americans continues after December 31. This is a lifeline \nto many struggling families, and it is a way to insert into our economy \nthe spending power of 160 million families buying goods and services \nthat plays out into even more economic activity--more jobs and \nprofitability. That is a must. The President insists on it. He has \ncrossed America making that case. We cannot leave town without doing \nit. We are working on the final details today, and we should close that \nas quickly as possible to make certain there is no gap in this coverage \nof this payroll tax cut.\n  Secondly, the maintaining of unemployment insurance benefits is \nabsolutely essential for millions of Americans who are out of work.\n  The amount of money they receive in UI benefits will allow them to \nkeep their families together not just during this holiday season but \nfor the months to come, so that while they are searching for a job they \nare able to make basic payments so they do not lose their homes--at \nleast have a roof over their heads--and provide for the basic \nnecessities of life for their struggling families.\n  I cannot believe this has become a political football. I can still \nrecall a time--not that long ago--when Republican and Democratic \nPresidents would renew unemployment benefits without question, without \ndemand that it be paid for, because they knew it was essential. It was \nas caring and needy as disaster aid is, and now it has become a \npolitical football.\n  We need to extend these unemployment benefits before we leave town. \nWe have to get that done. The President has insisted on it, and he is \nright. We know now, with our high unemployment rate coming down slowly, \nthat we still need to provide this assistance to families. Were we to \ncut off these unemployment benefits, in my home State of Illinois, \n148,000 people would lose their benefits--148,000 people. What a happy \nholiday they would have, knowing that on January 1, the benefits would \nno longer continue.\n  Let's get this job done. Let's go home at least with the clear mind \nthat we have met our obligation to this economy and to the unemployed \npeople across America, that we have funded our government, and that we \nwill return next year and, I hope, find a more congenial and bipartisan \nenvironment to work in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Presiding \nOfficer for taking a few moments so I can make my statement. I also \nthank my friend, the Senator from Illinois, for his comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8694-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8694-S8695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL WORKERS\n\n\n                              John Merlino\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was heartened to hear the comments the \nmajority leader made, that we are close to an agreement to make sure we \ndo not put the American people or the great Federal workers through \nanother one of these eleventh-hour fire drills, where we get to the \nbrink of the precipice of shutting down our Federal Government.\n  It is in that spirit that I rise because, as many know, over the last \nyear and a half or so I have come regularly to the floor of the Senate \nto continue a tradition that was started by Senator Kaufman from \nDelaware, where we recognize the contributions of great Federal \nemployees.\n  Today, I am pleased to honor another exceptional--exceptional--\nFederal worker, Mr. John Merlino.\n\n[[Page S8695]]\n\n  Mr. Merlino is the Senate assistant legislative clerk, working on the \nlegislative team of the Office of the Secretary of the Senate.\n  Mr. Merlino began his Senate career in 1994 as a Senate doorkeeper. \nHe then joined the Secretary's legislative staff and has performed many \nof its functions, including the constitutional task--the constitutional \ntask--of maintaining the Senate Journal.\n  Another of Mr. Merlino's main responsibilities is to call the roll \nduring votes and quorum calls. More important, he is also one of those \nspecial workers on the dais who have been known at times to actually \nkeep new Members, as they preside over the Senate, awake during long \nstretches in the chair.\n  He is always ready with a good sports quip and is known as a person \nwho goes above and beyond the call of duty. As a matter of fact, I know \nit was his birthday yesterday and I have been planning this speech for \nsome time and I wanted to make sure it coincided with that important \ndate for him.\n  The Secretary of the Senate, Nancy Erickson, noted that in addition \nto his hard work and attention to detail--this is a quote--``It is his \ngreat sense of humor that helps many of us keep smiling, especially \nduring the Senate's late [night] legislative sessions.''\n  A small cog in the greater legislative process, Mr. Merlino is a \nmember of an often unrecognized but dedicated team that keeps the \nSenate running smoothly and one that is charged with ensuring \ncontinuity of operations no matter what the situation.\n  In fact, Mr. Merlino recently entered the history books. During a pro \nforma session held at the Postal Square Building immediately following \nthe earthquake in August, Mr. Merlino, unknowingly, became one of only \ntwo people, along with Senator Coons, to have spoken during the only \nofficial session of the Senate convened outside the Capitol Building \nsince 1814. The last time the Senate met outside the Capitol Building \nfor such a session was when the British troops burned the Capitol \nduring the War of 1812. So again, Mr. Merlino took his role in the \nhistory books of this great institution.\n  I hope my colleagues--and I know the Presiding Officer, again, by \nexpelling me from the chair this morning to allow me to make this \nstatement--will join me in honoring Mr. Merlino, a fellow Virginian, \nfor the excellent work he and the legislative team do each and every \nday and for their commitment to public service.\n  It is in that sense of Mr. Merlino's commitment to public service \nthat I know the Presiding Officer joins me in this and that we get our \nwork done today, so we can give this team--and the literally couple \nother million Federal workers across the country--the sense that we are \nnot going to shut down the government, that they are going to be able \nto go into the holiday season with the recognition that the government \nwill continue operating, but, more important, that so many of us \nrecognize the great work they do to keep this country moving forward.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and again thank my good \nfriend, Mr. Merlino, for his good work.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk (Mr. Merlino) proceeded to call the \nroll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask my friend to yield for a colloquy between the \nRepublican leader and myself?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, Senator McConnell and I have just finished a \nmeeting. We are making good progress on being able to handle the issues \nthat everyone knows are outstanding. We are not there yet, but we are \nvery close.\n  There will be votes tomorrow. There could be votes this afternoon \nalso. I would also say, because this is a question that people will \nask, the House is going to pass their bill around 3 o'clock--that is \nthe omnibus, around 3 o'clock. Time is not always exact. There is a \nruling from this White House and its predecessors that if one House \npasses a spending bill, as we are doing here, and there is a \npresumption that it will pass in the other body, the time is extended \nfor 24 hours. So everyone does not have the worry about the government \nclosing tonight.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me echo the remarks of the majority \nleader. As he has indicated, the administration takes a view that if \nthe final appropriations bills pass one House this afternoon--we could \nhave that vote today or it could be tomorrow--but the administration, I \nam told by the majority leader, takes the view that it has passed one \nHouse, there would not be a government shutdown. So I think everybody \nshould be reassured that that is not going to happen. The conference \nreport has been signed and we are moving toward completing the basic \nwork of government through next September 30 very shortly.\n  On the second issue, the majority leader and I are making significant \nprogress in reaching an agreement on a package that will have \nbipartisan support, I hope. I think we are going to get to that place. \nAnd I share his view that good progress is being made.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to discuss \na case that was argued a few weeks ago before the Supreme Court, Hall \nv. the United States. This case involves a specific provision that I \nauthored which is contained in the 2005 bankruptcy reform law. \nThroughout the litigation in this case, my statements supporting the \nprovision--in other words, the statements that were said here on the \nfloor of the Senate and in committee report were discussed in these \ncases at length.\n  I want to take a few minutes and walk through the history and intent \nof this provision so people hear it straight from this author's mouth, \nmeaning from this Senator.\n  At its core, the case Hall v. the United States is about statutory \ninterpretation. The statute at issue is 11 U.S.C. (a)(2)(A), which was \na farm bankruptcy provision added to the Bankruptcy Code in 2005.\n  Before I get into the discussion about the case, I wish to explain \nwhat this particular provision does and why it needed to be added to \nthe Bankruptcy Code. Congress enacted Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code \nin 1986, which was subsequently made permanent in 2005. Chapter 12 \nallows family farmers to use a bankruptcy process to reorganize their \nfinances and operations. It is a proven success as a leverage tool for \nfarmers and their lenders. It helps a farmer and the banker sit down \nand work out alternatives for debt repayment. Not long after it became \nlaw in 1986, we began to hear about what worked and what did not work \nfor farmers who were reorganizing in bankruptcy.\n  One problem we learned arose when a debtor farmer needed to sell \nassets in order to generate cash for reorganization. A farmer may need \nto sell portions of the farm to raise cash to fund a plan and pay off \nhis creditors. However, in this situation, we are usually dealing with \nland that has been in the family's hands for a long time. This means \nthe cost basis is probably very low. So once a farmer filed bankruptcy \nand then tried to sell a portion or all of the land, he would be hit \nwith a substantial capital gains tax. This creates problems, because as \noriginally drafted, Chapter 12 required full payment of all priority \nclaims under Section 507 of the Bankruptcy Code. The only way to avoid \nthis requirement was if the holder of the claim agreed that its claim \ncould be treated differently.\n  Thus, when a farmer sold his land which resulted in large capital \ngains, the IRS would have a priority claim against the bankruptcy \nestate. I wish to take a moment to explain the concept of bankrupt \nestates, which may be\n\n[[Page S8696]]\n\na bit confusing. When an individual or corporation files for \nbankruptcy, an estate is created. The estate consists of property that \nis liquidated for the purpose of paying creditors. So in the case of \nfarmers filing a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 12, the farm assets \nare the property of the estate.\n  According to section 541(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code, the proceeds \nof the sales of those assets are also property of the estate. So the \nsituation farmers faced was that the IRS held a large priority claim \nagainst the bankruptcy estate.\n  Let me take a minute to talk about claims against the estate to \nunderstand how we got to where we are today. In this situation, we are \ndealing with a claim that is based on taxes owed. The Bankruptcy Code \nsays that taxes incurred by the estate are administrative expenses. An \nadministrative expense essentially receives top priority when \ndetermining who gets paid what. Thus, the effect this had was that the \nIRS with its priority claim could object to any reorganization plan \nthat did not provide for full payment of its tax claim. The IRS \nessentially held veto authority over a family farmer's plan \nconfirmation. In some instances then, a farmer who sought to sell a \nportion of his farm to reorganize, pay creditors, and become profitable \nagain was prohibited completely from doing so.\n  After learning of this problem, I started working on a way to fix it. \nSimply put, I wanted to make sure that family farmers in a Chapter 12 \ncase could, in fact, sell portions of their farm to effectively \nreorganize without the capital gains taxes jeopardizing the \nreorganization. The very purpose of Chapter 12 and bankruptcy in \ngeneral is to allow for a fresh start. Unfortunately, this was \nnot happening because of the IRS priority.\n\n  In 1999, I introduced the Safeguarding America's Farms Entering the \nYear 2000 Act. This bill, among other things, sought to fix the capital \ngains tax issue. When I introduced the bill, I said it would ``help \nfarmers to reorganize by keeping tax collectors at bay.'' I also \nexplained:\n\n       Under current law, farmers often face a crushing tax \n     liability if they need to sell livestock or land in order to \n     reorganize their business affairs . . . High taxes have \n     caused farmers to lose their farms. Under the Bankruptcy \n     Code, the IRS must be paid in full for any tax liabilities \n     generated during a bankruptcy reorganization. If the farmer \n     can't pay the IRS in full, then he can't keep his farm. This \n     is not sound policy. Why should the IRS be allowed to veto a \n     farmer's reorganization plan?\n\n  But let me go back to a portion of what I quoted, these words, ``then \nhe can't keep his farm.'' Simply put, if you are a farmer in a farming \noperation, and you can continue to farm, and reorganization is keeping \nyou from farming, well, obviously you do not have a business of farming \nand you cannot farm. Family farms are very important to the economic \nviability of rural America.\n  The language I proposed ultimately was enacted in the 2005 bankruptcy \nreform law. Since the Bankruptcy Code, the courts, and the IRS treated \nthe tax liability as an administrative expense, the new provision \ncreated a very narrow exception to that administrative expense. \nBasically, only in Chapter 12 cases, if a farmer sold farmland that \nresulted in a capital gains liability, then the IRS's claim would not \nreceive priority status. That is the benefit of the legislation I got \npassed to reorganization of a family farm. But it is what is in dispute \nin these particular cases I am referring to. Instead the government \nwould have an unsecured claim, which means they may get paid something \nbut not necessarily the entire amount. Also, the IRS would no longer be \nable to veto a plan's confirmation, thus the farmer debtor would be \nallowed to reorganize.\n  From a bankruptcy point of view, this approach makes complete sense. \nAs I have discussed already, filing a petition creates a bankruptcy \nestate. The bankruptcy estate then sells the lands post petition, and \nthat results in capital gains that are owed to the IRS. Those taxes \nincurred by the estate post petition are administrative expenses which \nreceive priority status.\n  My language, enacted into law in 2005, stripped the priority claims \nowed to the government in this very specific instance and made them \ngenerally unsecured claims. However, since the passage of this \nlegislation, the IRS has made an about-face. The government now argues, \ndespite the way it treated this situation for all of these years, that \nthe tax liability created is the responsibility of the individual and \nnot the bankruptcy estate. Yet the entire reason we created this new \nprovision was because of the way the IRS treated the tax liability.\n  The IRS's new position has been argued in Federal courts and has \nreceived mixed results, so now there is a dispute whether my provision \naccomplishes what it was designed to do. In 2009 the Eighth Circuit \ncase Knudsen v. IRS held the provision applies to post-petition sales \nof farm assets, which is what we are discussing here. Specifically, the \nEighth Circuit rejected the IRS's position that the Internal Revenue \nCode does not recognize a separate taxable entity being created when a \ndebtor files a Chapter 12 petition.\n  Put another way, the IRS is claiming the individual debtor is \nresponsible for tax liability that arises out of a bankruptcy estate \naction. The Eighth Circuit disagreed and said there is now an exception \npreventing the IRS from having a priority claim for capital gains.\n  But in the Ninth Circuit, the court there held that there was no \nexception for post-petition capital gains. In Hall v. the United \nStates, now before the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit said the Halls \nwere responsible for the capital gains tax from selling part of their \nfarm during bankruptcy. This holding means that my provision did not \ncreate a narrow exception even though that is what I intended.\n  Unfortunately, the IRS, under the Obama administration, is taking a \nposition today that is antifarmer and the exact opposite of what it \nsaid 6 years ago. This about-face on the part of the IRS came only \nafter we made the change in the law, and it became clear that in very \nnarrow circumstances the IRS would lose its priority position. I \nrespect the IRS's interest in pursuing tax dollars, but it exhibited a \nheck of a lot of chutzpah in taking this position. Our policy reasons \nfor this new exception were very simple. The farmers didn't have enough \nmoney to pay everyone. We decided it would be better to let them sell \nsome assets, which would generate cash and help them to reorganize, \nkeep farming, and pay their creditors.\n\n  In making this decision, we realized someone would have to make a \nsacrifice. We decided to give farmers a break from government taxes in \na very narrow set of circumstances. Now, though, the government is \ntrying to figure out a way to jump back ahead of other creditors and \nget more money. These creditors the IRS is trying to break in front of \nare small businesses, suppliers, and small local banks that extend \ncredit and supplies to farmers. This is not what we expected would \nhappen when we passed the 2005 bankruptcy law.\n  This is an important issue and an important case that the Supreme \nCourt will decide in the coming months. The Supreme Court will decide \nwhether this provision accomplishes my goal, which I have stated. I \nlook forward to seeing how the case is resolved. Rest assured, I will \nwork to ensure that this policy of protecting family farmers is \nfollowed as that was our clear intent in having this law enacted. \nChapter 12 has proven successful as a leverage tool for farmers and \ntheir lenders. It helps the farmer and banker to sit down and work out \nalternatives for debt repayment. Should the Court rule that the \nInternal Revenue Code is inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Code and rule \nagainst my intent as the author, I will obviously have to work to \nremedy that inconsistency because what we did in 2005 is the right \nthing. I hope the Supreme Court realizes the history and intent behind \nthe legislation and follows the congressional intent.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as Arkansans and all Americans do last\n\n[[Page S8697]]\n\nminute errands in preparation for Christmas, one stop on the list \nalmost always includes the grocery store.\n  Like many other families our Christmas traditions include baking \ncookies. On Christmas Eve we get together with extended family for \nlunch. Many holiday memories are centered around the time spent sitting \nat the table with family and friends.\n  The unfortunate reality for more and more people, is that those \nmemories are becoming more distant as more Americans than ever are \nhaving difficulty putting food on the table. In fact, recent studies \nshow one in six Americans are food deprived.\n  Despite Arkansas's reputation as a leader in agriculture production, \nArkansans are struggling to provide nutritious, healthy meals for their \nfamilies.\n  What is most concerning is that nearly 25 percent of Arkansas kids go \nto bed hungry. That gives Arkansas the unfortunate distinction of \nhaving the worst rate of childhood hunger in the country.\n  While I believe Congress should be working identifying a range of \nlegislative improvements or reforms that can be made in Federal policy \nto help fight hunger, Washington can't help solve this problem alone.\n  This requires community involvement. Fortunately, we are blessed to \nhave help at the local level from a wide variety of organizations in \nArkansas, and nationwide, that make it their mission to fight hunger.\n  As a co-chair of the Senate Hunger Caucus, Senators Durbin, Lugar, \nCasey, Moran, Brown of Ohio, and myself put politics aside to raise \nawareness and recognize the great work underway in our states \naddressing food insecurity.\n  We call this effort the Hour for Hunger. Our initiative encourages \nall Members of Congress to dedicate one hour during this holiday season \nto highlight the commitments of national, state and local organizations \nto fight hunger.\n  Last Friday, I had the opportunity to visit the Samaritan Community \nCenter in Rogers, Arkansas. For more than 20 years, this organization \nhas lent a helping hand to the hungry through soup kitchens, food \npantries, ``Snackpacks for Kids'' and a variety of other initiatives.\n  This help is needed now more than ever. The economy is forcing more \npeople to rely on the services of Samaritan Community Center. In just \nthree years, there has been more than a 50 percent increase in clients.\n  This is the story with similar organizations throughout Arkansas. In \na segment that aired last month, CNN focused on the extent of the \nhunger problem in Arkansas's second largest city, Fort Smith. Ken \nKupchick, marketing director for the River Valley Regional Food Bank in \nFort Smith, told CNN some heart-wrenching stories encountered while \nhelping those in need.\n  Ken spoke of a mother who used to volunteer at a food pantry and is \nnow in need of the organization's services due to mounting medical \nbills for her children. He recounted a story of an elderly lady who \nwent from financial security to sorting through the dumpster garbage at \nthe local grocery store after her husband passed away and her monthly \nincome disappeared.\n  Unfortunately, similar stories can be heard throughout our State. \nCommunity-based efforts like those in Fort Smith are making a \ndifference to address hunger and malnourishment.\n  We are seeing it across the state of Arkansas. Last week, the NBC \naffiliate KARK in Little Rock spent the week urging viewers to donate \nto the Arkansas Food Bank. The Greater Good Week of Giving donation \ndrive will undoubtedly provide many blessings to many families this \nholiday season.\n  It's painfully clear that our current economic environment is \nintensifying our hunger issues in Arkansas and across the country. The \nfact is, we don't have to look far to see how hunger hurts.\n  I believe hunger is a solvable problem but it requires us all working \ntogether. Please consider what you can do to help neighbors in need, \nnot just during this holiday season, but all year long.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are, as a nation, facing difficult \nfinancial times, and I for one believe it is true that the middle class \nin America is suffering economically to a degree that is unusual. It \nneeds to be thought about, it needs to be addressed.\n  I have a number of ideas about what we should do, and they don't \ninclude raising taxes and spreading the money around. I don't believe \nthat is the right direction for the country to go. That is essentially \nthe view of President Obama. As he says he is for the middle class, he \ntaxes people at even higher levels and would do those kinds of \ngovernment programs that he believes will work.\n  At a most fundamental level, I am convinced the greatest thing we can \ndo to strengthen America--strengthen us financially, strengthen job \ncreation for the middle class--would be to do the things that allow \ngrowth in the private sector. There are a lot of things we can do that \nwill not cost this Treasury a dime.\n  Indeed, one of the greatest threats to the American economy is the \ndebt that hangs over us like a cloud. It is inhibiting growth and \ninvestment and prosperity. We have to get this Nation on a sustainable \npath, not the unsustainable path we are on. I have been disappointed, \nfrankly, at the leadership of the President. He has not understood \nthis. He believes that the way to do it is through governmental \nborrowing, taxing, and spending. That is not the way to get out of this \nfix.\n  One of the most dramatic things that are coming up before us today is \nthe Keystone Pipeline. This is precisely the kind of project this \nCongress could take action on to ensure that it occurs because it will \ncreate lots of jobs, create wealth, make us more secure as a nation, \nand help bring down the cost of energy. Low-cost energy is the best \npossible way to create even more jobs in America. We compete in a \nglobal marketplace, and the extent to which our industries can have \ncheaper energy, they can hire more people, make more widgets, and pay \nmore taxes to the U.S. Government and to States, cities, and counties.\n  The construction of the Keystone Pipeline would run from Alberta, \nCanada, to Texas refineries along the gulf coast. It adds a number of \nmiles of pipeline, although it will also use existing pipelines that \nare in place now. We have thousands of miles of pipelines around the \nUnited States. Building a pipeline is not unusual. We build them over \nand over again. Many pipelines run through our State, and they provide \nthe low-cost energy that helps us to be competitive and create jobs.\n  This construction project alone would add 20,000 American workers, \nhigh-paid American workers, jobs not funded by additional debt that we \nborrow to try to artificially create jobs. They are real construction \njobs. Experts tell us it would likely lead to the creation of more than \n100,000 jobs overall. This is a significant number.\n  In addition, as I said, it would make us more energy secure and make \nus more able to contain the growth in the price of fuel because it \nwould provide a large, competitive source of fuel for America. When \nfully operational, the pipeline will transport 700,000 barrels a day. \nThat is almost half of the amount of oil the United States currently \nimports from the entire Middle East. Mr. President, 700,000 barrels a \nday is almost exactly the amount of oil we import from Venezuela, and \nthat is not a friendly country to us. Hugo Chavez and his team there \nare a dangerous threat to the hemisphere. Much of their wealth comes \nfrom the oil they sell to the United States. I am not saying that we \ncannot buy on the world market and that we should not buy from \nVenezuela, but why in the world would we deny ourselves the right to \npurchase 700,000 barrels a day from our friend, our fine trading \npartner, Canada, our neighbor?\n  There is a strategic political interest of significance here too. How \nwill the Canadians feel if we reject this pipeline when great effort, \ntime, and years of investment and study have gone into it?\n  This plan to build a pipeline is supported by a bipartisan coalition, \nDemocrats and Republicans, including many Democratic Governors, such as \nMontana Governor Brian Schweitzer, along with a number of Democratic \nSenators\n\n[[Page S8698]]\n\nand Congressmen. It is not a partisan issue. Seven Governors of States \nthat will house the pipeline have come out to voice their support. Each \nState through which the pipeline will pass is supportive of the \npipeline. Those encouraging the pipeline also include labor unions, \nsuch as the Teamsters, that together represent about 25 million \nworkers. Remember, this is a jobs program that will create high-paying \njobs, and many will be for union workers. Yet the President has blocked \nthe pipeline construction for some time, deferring a decision now until \nafter the next election. Many argue that it is not hard to conclude \nthat this is a political decision and an attempt to avoid alienating \nthe liberal anti-energy environmentalists or those who favor the \npipeline, such as his union supporters.\n  I don't know the politics of it. All I know is that I cannot find a \nsingle sound reason not to proceed. I know it would be tremendously \neconomically beneficial to America. We must address the true, \nstructural, long-term problems that are hammering our economy and \nmiddle-class workers in America, robbing them of opportunity.\n\n  We had before the environmental committee a couple of days ago a \nwitness from Alabama--Van Richey, the CEO at ACIPCO. This is a 100-\nyear-old company where the CEO/owner a number of years ago turned it \nover to the employees. Mr. Richey testified their number of employees \nhas gone from 4,600 to 2,900, and that the pipe industry in America is \ndown 30 percent--the entire pipe industry. Think about that. These are \nreal jobs. These are people who built their lives around good-paying \nwork at ACIPCO, and over a thousand of them are now not working. I \ndon't know what they are doing. Hopefully, they found something, but it \nis unlikely to be the kind of solid manufacturing job they had. We must \npursue reforms that make our economy stronger and more productive, \nrestoring confidence and allowing for sustained economic job growth.\n  Consider a few of the biggest challenges we face. One of them is the \nhealth care law. Promises were made. The President insisted it would \nreduce health care costs, but health insurance premiums have increased \n$2,200 per family since 2008. The Congressional Budget Office warned us \nthis health care bill was not going to bring down costs, and, in fact, \nthe bill has brought costs up. That is money out of the pockets of \nAmerican families that they do not have now to spend in the marketplace \nbecause it has to be spent on their health insurance. We need to get \nthe government out of dominating and regulating areas of the economy \nfor which they have no experience or ability to operate in an effective \nway.\n  Instead of allowing the production of American energy--energy from \nthis country--the President has blocked commonsense energy production \nwhile sending stimulus dollars to favored green corporations that are \nnot producing and are going bankrupt in serious numbers. A recent study \nfound that almost 190,000 new jobs could be created next year if energy \nproduction in the Gulf of Mexico, where I live, returned to pre-\nmoratorium levels. Think about that. If we went back to the pre-\nmoratorium levels on production, it would add 190,000 jobs and bring in \nmore American wealth. Instead of having to buy our oil from Canada or \nVenezuela, it would be our own, keeping our wealth at home and creating \njobs at home.\n  The moratorium was imposed after the oil spill. We had expert \ntestimony in the environment committee there is a new device that has \nbeen prepared and is now ready to go that could be put over a blown-out \nwell, such as the one we had, so that in a matter of days it would stop \nthe leak. They eventually did that, using a cap. Instead of 90 or 100 \ndays, within a few days you could cut off a leak like that. It should \nhave been there to begin with, in my opinion. It was a very significant \nfailure of management not to have such a safety device. But it is now \navailable.\n  I also believe the permitorium--the inability to get permits--has \ncost us a lot of jobs. Now that the complete ban is over, you can get \npermits, but they have been slowed down dramatically, and huge rigs, \ncapable of drilling in the deep gulf, have been moved to other places \nin the world and are not producing. It would have cost United States \ntaxpayers virtually nothing to put an intensive effort into reviewing \nthe dangers in the gulf, doing it quickly, and putting this industry \nback on track before so many of those production rigs moved abroad.\n  Also burdensome, intrusive regulations have undermined job creation \nand hurt small businesses. The average number of rules costing the \neconomy over $100 million pending during 2001 to 2006 was about 72. \nUnder this administration, the average number is 130. In fact, over \n180,000 jobs will be lost each year from 2012 to 2020 as a result of \nfour EPA rules that impact the regulatory structure of the electric \nindustry. These are dramatic events.\n  It would cost the Treasury of the United States not a dime to not \nfollow through on these dramatic rules, one of which is the boiler MACT \nrule. I have never heard so much concern from my constituents over that \nrule. Hopefully, it will be part of the legislation that moves the \npayroll tax holiday. That legislation would also change the boiler MACT \nrule. That would be a tremendous relief for the American economy.\n  The point is, these rules cost the economy, cost jobs, drive up our \ncost of production, and make it more difficult to be competitive in the \nworld marketplace. We don't need that. Every single rule that is \neffective needs to be maintained; every single rule that is unnecessary \nand drives up cost should be eliminated. Yet we are still adding rule \nafter rule, and it is costing jobs.\n  President Obama has continued to ignore China's abusive currency \ndevaluation process which undermines the rule of law and is decimating \nAmerican manufacturing. I was pleased to work with my Democratic \ncolleagues in the Senate to pass legislation that would require the \ngovernment to respond to legitimate complaints of businesses that can \nprove they have been damaged by the deliberate manipulation of China's \ncurrency. You can't have a good trading relationship with a country \nthat is cheating you; that is not playing by the rules. Are we going to \nsit by year after year and allow factory after factory to be closed \nbecause we are unwilling to confront this on some sort of religious, \neconomic, free-trade theory because they sell us cheaper products? If \nthey cause our businesses to lay off thousands of workers or to close \ndown, should we thank them because we get a cheaper product? But how \nlong will it be cheaper?\n  I don't go for that. I think we need real leadership here. It \nwouldn't cost the Treasury a dime if we stood up and protected our \nworkers on the world competitive stage; if we backed them up and \nensured our businesses have fair trade. We would create jobs without \nadding to the debt. We would create jobs that pay more taxes and reduce \nthe debt. This trade manipulation and unfairness does enormous damage \nto the middle class.\n  The number of U.S. manufacturing sites fell from 397,000 in 2001 to \n344,000 in June of 2010. That is a real manufacturing decline. It is \nnot inevitable. In fact, I am convinced we have a chance to have a \nrenaissance in manufacturing in America. If we keep our energy costs \ndown, if we don't have unnecessary regulations, and we create a tax \npolicy that is good, I think we might surprise ourselves on how well we \ncan bounce back. Because the cost of manufacturing in other countries \nis going up dramatically--and we now have, with our technology, our \ninfrastructure, and our high machinery utilization--we can be \ncompetitive in areas we haven't been competitive in before.\n\n  Manufacturing employment peaked at 19 million in 1979, with 11.7 \nmillion in February of 2011. I don't think this country can be healthy \nand strong economically, I don't think it can have an effective \npresence strategically and militarily around the world if we don't have \na manufacturing base. I don't see how it can happen. What are people \ngoing to do?\n  They say we will go into the service industry. Well, how many people \ncan make a computer? As a matter of fact, most of these technological \nadvancements, such as our super TVs and computers, are made abroad. It \nis a competitive world, but we can be more competitive. We can take \nback some of that manufacturing, I am convinced.\n  I also believe at a time of high unemployment we need to be sure the \nimmigration laws of this country are enforced. The very idea we should \nrelax\n\n[[Page S8699]]\n\nour laws and shouldn't insist they be enforced at a time when we have \nalmost 9 percent unemployment makes no sense to me. We need to get \nAmerican workers working, not imported workers taking jobs from \nAmericans. It is that simple.\n  We have to protect our legitimate national interest. If you want to \nhave open borders, I am willing to discuss that and say we should have \ntotally open borders. But if you don't--and no nation in the world \ndoes, to my knowledge--then you must create an immigration system that \nserves your national interest and creates jobs for American citizens \nwherever possible.\n  America's $15 trillion debt is destroying jobs and confidence in the \neconomy. The debt itself is the largest we have ever seen. The annual \ndeficit is the largest we have ever seen. It dwarfs any deficits we \nhave ever had before, and it is continuing year after year.\n  President Bush, in his last year in office, had the biggest deficit \nhe ever had--$450 billion. It was one of the largest deficits in the \nhistory of the Republic. President Obama's first year in office saw a \n$1.4 trillion deficit. It has been $1.3 trillion or more for the last 3 \nyears.\n  This year, CBO was predicting the deficit would come in at a tad \nunder $1 trillion--$970 billion. But if we pass this tax holiday, we \nwill add $200 billion to the debt just like that. So next year, we will \nbe at $1.1-plus trillion, if the Congressional Budget Office's \nprojections are true.\n  This is a serious matter. The debt is a threat to us. We have to quit \nrunning up the debt. We have to quit borrowing so we can spend. That is \nall this tax holiday is--the government borrowing the money so people \ndon't pay into their pension plan--Social Security. I am uneasy about \nthat. It weakens the moral component of Social Security and it clearly \nadds to our debt. Social Security is on an unsustainable course. This \nbill would do nothing to fix the unsustainable course of Social \nSecurity. It says we don't put in the money we have been putting in \nevery year for the last 60 years, I suppose. How can that do anything \nbut weaken Social Security? And it absolutely increases our debt and \nwill show up on the score by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  I am the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee. It is so \npainful; I would love to be able to support--and I won't say I won't \nsupport--this tax holiday. But it is not sound policy in the long run \nfor America. We can't keep chasing after and borrowing money to spend, \nbecause the debt is so large. We now have a debt equal to 100 percent \nof GDP, our gross debt. We have never had anything like this before.\n  So it is time, indeed, for a middle-class agenda, an agenda that \nhelps and strengthens this country. We don't need more dishonest \nspending, politicians promising favor, promising to give people \nsomething the government doesn't have to give, spending money we don't \nhave, to try to buy votes with it. We don't need any more of that. The \nnet beneficiary of all this seems to have been the political class, not \nthe middle class.\n  So what do we need to do? A good, sound program means creating jobs \nthrough the private sector, putting a stop to crony capitalism and \nfavoritism, producing more American energy, and making our government \nleaner and more productive. That is good for the economy: creating a \nlong-term debt reduction plan so that every investor and businessperson \nand American citizen will say, well, we are on a path now that is \nsustainable, not on a path that is unsustainable--as every economist \nhas told us; adopting a globally competitive Tax Code, a Tax Code that \nenhances investment in America, enhances expansion in job creation, not \none that inhibits growth and job creation.\n  We need to confront illegal immigration at the border and at the \nworkplace and serve the national interests. We need to uphold the rules \nof law in trade and quit acquiescing to those who cheat and manipulate \ntrade rules to their advantage. I don't believe we can sustain that \nover a long period of time. I do believe that has hammered jobs and \nmanufacturing in America.\n  We need to eliminate unwise and damaging regulations. Any burden \nplaced on individual Americans or businesses in America that does not \npay for itself in benefits should never be imposed. We have too much in \nthat category. Finally, delivering to the good people of this country \nthe honest and responsible government and budget they deserve.\n  The sad fact is, we have now gone 961 days without a budget. I think \nthat shows the irresponsibility of this Congress. I was disappointed \nwhen the Democratic leader in the Senate said it would be foolish to \neven attempt to bring up a budget this year, and he was not going to do \nit for the second year. This is really, really dangerous; a country \nthat is suffering the greatest debt and deficits we have ever had, to \nnot have a budget is utterly and totally unacceptable.\n  I can't imagine a party wanting to be the leader of the Senate that \nwill not even bring to the floor a budget, as required by statute, \nrequired by law. The House passed one. They passed a historic budget, a \nbudget that would have altered the debt course of America, put us on a \nsound path. The Republican leadership in the House summoned their \ncourage and produced a budget that would reduce spending, alter the \ntaxes in America in a way that would create more growth, and brought it \nforward.\n  So Senator Reid thought he was clever. He knew Democrats wouldn't \nvote for it because it would actually cut spending, and he brought it \nup so it could be voted down. But over 40 people voted for it.\n  I brought up at the same time President Obama's budget--the most \nirresponsible budget ever submitted, one that would increase taxes but \nincrease spending more and increase debt more than if we didn't have \nthat budget. So I brought it up and said: Well, let's vote on the \nPresident's budget. Zero votes, 97 to 0, against that budget.\n  We need to be sure the people who run this country understand that \nthe American people are not happy with us. How can they be happy? We \nare borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. We are on an \nunsustainable debt course, and we don't even have a budget and refuse \nto bring up one. It is just unthinkable.\n  We will end up in the last of this session heading into Christmas \nwith some conglomerated-together, massive omnibus bill, a last-minute \ntax holiday bill, and somehow we will muddle forward and continue \nspending for the government so it will not close down. But all of this \nshould have been done months ago. There is no reason it has to be held \nto the last minute except it gives the leader more power to manipulate, \nand it gives Members of Congress less opportunity to know what is in \nit. It gives the American people less opportunity to know what is in \nit.\n  So I am not happy. I don't think the American people are. I think \nthey are rightfully disappointed with us. Somehow we have to get this \ncountry on the right track. It will require tightening our belts. We \ncannot continue to borrow and spend at this rate.\n  A lot of people are going to be disappointed that things they hoped \nto receive they will no longer be able to receive. But the country will \nnot sink into the ocean. It will not. This country is strong. All we \nhave to do is do what they are doing in New Jersey and doing in \nAlabama, beginning to do in some of the other States that have been \ndeeply in debt, do what Senator Warner did as Governor of Virginia: \nmanage the economy and balance the budget. I appreciate his leadership \nin the Senate to try to produce something worthwhile for the Nation.\n  So we can do better, and we have to do better, and the American \npeople are entitled to it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I know we are all anxious to reach a \nconclusion on significant legislation that is pending. It determines \nmany things important to Americans and it creates the opportunity for \nMembers of the Senate and the House to spend a little\n\n[[Page S8700]]\n\ntime at home during the holiday season. I am reminded how blessed I am \nthis holiday season to return home to a rural State, where family \nvalues and community traditions run deep. There is no tradition more \nimportant to us than how we pass on, from one generation to the next, \nthe workings on a family farm.\n  I am worried these rural traditions are under attack by Washington, \nDC. In September, our Department of Labor proposed new rules that would \nban youth under the age of 16 from participating in what are many \ncommon farm-related tasks such as rounding up cattle on horseback, \noperating a tractor or cleaning out stalls with a shovel and \nwheelbarrow. I am sure there are many 15- and 16-year-olds who would be \nhappy not to do that work, but it is important work, and it is a way \nfathers and sons, mothers and daughters, grandparents, work side by \nside with family members.\n  One of the things I care a lot about is agriculture. That matters to \nus in places such as Kansas because that is the economy of our \ncommunities. But I also know it is important for other reasons as well, \nnot just dollars and cents. It is important because it is how, \nhistorically, in this country, we passed on our values from one \ngeneration to the next. Working side by side with moms and dads and \ngrandparents is the way we pass on character and values and integrity \nfrom one generation to the next. It is something that throughout the \nhistory of our country has been important across our Nation when every \nplace was a rural part of our Nation.\n  To most young people growing up on that family farm, jobs are \nroutine, it is a part of their lives. These Department of Labor \nregulations are going to intrude significantly in that ability. \nAccording to the American Farm Bureau Federation, about 98 percent of \nour country's 2 million farms are family owned. By working alongside \nthose parents and grandparents, important skills and values are \nlearned. The problem we face now is that agriculture is a way of life \nand the Department of Labor wants to change that.\n  Until recently, farms jointly owned and operated by multiple family \nmembers had discretion over the responsibilities they gave their \nchildren on the farm. But this new rule would do away with that \nfreedom. The Department of Labor is proposing to tell farmers and \nranchers: We know what is best for your children and what they should \nand should not be doing.\n  The Department of Labor is also trying to do away with successful \nfarm safety and training certification programs. In our part of the \ncountry and around the Nation, 4-H and FFA county extension offices are \nvery important. They play a critical role in training and certifying \nyoung people to safely carry on farm activities. That happens today. \nBut the Department has ignored research that shows such programs \nimprove safety habits of young people and instead criticizes these \ntraining programs for being too locally driven and lacking Federal \ndirection.\n  One would assume, before making such a drastic change to farm labor \nrules, the Department would identify reliable evidence and data that \nshow the need for changes, but it is quite the opposite. In fact, the \nDepartment of Labor admits it lacks data to justify many of its \nsuggested changes. Furthermore, according to the National Farm Medicine \nCenter, youth-related injuries from farm accidents have declined by \nnearly 60 percent from 1998 to 2009.\n  If you ask any farmer or rancher about the importance of safety, they \nwould tell you safety is at the top of their list. It is their \nchildren. It is their neighbor's children. They care greatly. But they \nwould also tell you it is critical for the rural way of life to be able \nto train and encourage the next generation to safely and successfully \nbegin careers in agriculture. If today's young people are not given the \nchance to learn at a young age what it takes to operate a farm, we put \nat risk the future of agriculture in our Nation.\n  If these changes go into effect, not only will the shrinking rural \nworkforce be further reduced and our Nation's youth be deprived of \nvaluable career training opportunities but, most important, a way of \nlife begins to disappear. Our country cannot afford to lose the next \ngeneration of farmers and ranchers.\n  I shared my concerns with the Secretary of Labor several weeks ago, \nin which we asked for a delay, a longer comment period. The comment \nperiod was running through fall harvest across most of the country. The \nDepartment of Labor granted a 30-day extension, but that expired \nDecember 1, about 2 weeks ago. Parents and communities should be \nallowed to look after the best interests of their families and \ncitizens. Now that comment period has run. I hope the Department of \nLabor will take into account the serious concerns by farmers and \nranchers, their families, and agribusiness across the country. But just \na delay and longer comment period is insufficient. In fact, I am \ncirculating a letter among my colleagues in the Senate that I am asking \nthem to sign, requesting the Department of Labor not proceed to \nimplement these rules. I ask my colleagues to take a look at that \nletter and please join me.\n  Local experts should be the ones conducting safety training programs \nto educate our Nation's young people. The future of agriculture depends \non stopping this vast overreach of Executive authority, protecting \nindividual rights.\n  We know rural America's values are not always the values held in \nWashington, DC. In the weeks ahead, I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues to make certain this destructive rule does not move forward \nso we can protect and preserve our values for the next generation of \nAmerican farmers and ranchers, values our country so desperately needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8700-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO AARON POPELKA\n\n  Mr. MORAN. One of the beneficiaries of growing up on a family farm in \nKansas is somebody I would also like to mention briefly this morning. \nAs Members of Congress, we surround ourselves with bright minds and \nfellow natives of our home States. I have had the privilege of working \nalongside a young man, Aaron Popelka, as a member of my staff for 6 \nyears. In those years, Aaron has proven himself to be a thoughtful \nvoice in a chaotic Capitol Hill culture. With a bright policy mind, \nAaron has advised me on agriculture and energy and trade policy while \nalso serving as my chief council.\n  A native of Munden, KS, Aaron brought with him a commonsense approach \nto the way he conducted his duties on behalf of our State. Aaron will \ncontinue his duties on behalf of Kansans but in a different fashion. \nAaron has accepted a position back home in Kansas and will leave my \nstaff at end of the year. The lure of returning home to Kansas is \npowerful. Over the years, I have lost valued members of my staff, much \nlike the rest of you. However, I appreciate the fact that while their \ndeparture from Washington DC is not pleasing to me, more often than not \nthey return home to Kansas and the result is a benefit to our home \nState.\n  I am thankful for having had Aaron as a member of my staff. I am \nthankful for the faithful service he has provided to my fellow citizens \nin our home State. But I am most thankful for his friendship and I look \nforward to our paths crossing again back home.\n  Aaron, best of luck to you and God bless you and your family.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the holiday season is coming upon us, a \nperiod of celebration and joy. But as we prepare to spend time with our \nfriends and our families in the coming weeks, it is important to \nremember during this holiday season there are many families out there \nacross this country who are hurting.\n  As I visit with Hoosiers, I hear concern in the voices of parents \ntrying to\n\n[[Page S8701]]\n\nmake their mortgage payment, the manufacturer trying to find work, and \na business owner trying to make payroll. Too many Hoosier families have \na parent unemployed or underemployed, some working two or three jobs \njust to scrape by. For nearly 3 years we have been hearing the \nPresident talk about how this Nation needs good-paying jobs for people. \nThe President has spoken on this on numerous occasions. In his \ninaugural address in 2009, he said:\n\n       There is work to be done. The state of our economy calls \n     for action, bold and swift. And we will act, not only to \n     create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth.\n\n  More than a year later in June 2010, the President said: ``Our top \npriority is to recover and rebuild from a recession that has touched \nthe lives of nearly every American.'' Two months ago, the President \nsaid: ``Everywhere I go, they tell me they want action on jobs.''\n  Despite the rhetoric, what we have and what we are dealing with is a \nseries of regulations and policies coming out of the White House that \nare denying Americans the opportunity to have jobs and preventing job \ncreators from hiring. This is a result of regulations that are \nhampering businesses as well as policies here that we have or have not \nenacted that would encourage job growth and economic opportunities.\n  For nearly 34 consecutive months unemployment has been hovering \naround the 9-percent level although we all know the real unemployment \nnumber is much higher than that. There are people who have given up \nlooking and they're no longer counted. There are people who are working \nat pay levels and talent levels far below their abilities. And so the \nunderemployment number, combined with the unemployment number, is very \nsignificant and much higher than the official number reflects.\n  For months I have been on this floor talking about a whole number of \ninitiatives I thought was necessary to spur our economy and get us \nmoving forward again. Comprehensive tax reform is something Senator \nWyden and I have engaged in on a bipartisan basis and we've been \ntalking about it all year, yet here we are at the end of the session \nand we are not going to be able to accomplish that this year. We'll \ngive it a run next year, and hopefully we can make some progress on \nthat. There is almost a unanimous consensus that comprehensive tax \nreform needs to take place. Yet we have now spent a year talking about \nit but not doing it. We also know that issues such as entitlement \nreform and reducing the out-of-control spending here are necessary to \nput us on more solid footing, and despite the valiant efforts and hard \nwork of many in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats, we've been \nunable to accomplish and succeed. Much of this difficulty, frankly, has \nbeen because the White House refusing to demonstrate leadership. The \nPresident has not stepped up and engaged in fulfilling the very things \nhe said are the most important things we need to do.\n  Let me cite two examples. The first one is still under discussion \nand, hopefully, will be part of what we are able to accomplish before \nwe finish here either late this weekend or into next week, and that is \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. By delaying a decision for a year, the \nPresident essentially is saying we are denying 20,000 or more \nindividuals from gaining work. The president is blocking jobs and \npreventing Americans from building this much-needed pipeline which is \nso important for the future of this country. We talk about our \ndependence on Middle East oil and the blood and treasure we have had to \nspend to keep those sea lanes open and that oil flowing to the United \nStates, and yet the President denies us the opportunity to mine our own \ndomestic energy sources and to use sources that come from Canada or off \nour shores.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline is a project that if constructed will bring \na minimum of about 750 million barrels of oil to this country for \nrefining purposes. It will provide an estimated 20,000 new jobs \ndirectly and support hundreds of thousands of jobs in coming years \nindirectly. My State alone, Indiana, has indicated that at least 100 \nIndiana companies would benefit from the pipeline. This project has \nbipartisan support as well.\n  Twenty-two House Democrats wrote a letter to President Obama and said \nthat it is in our national interests to have a Presidential permit \nissued for Keystone as soon as possible. That's supported by \nRepublicans, but the President has said that if we send him a yearend \nbill that includes this, he plans to veto it. It makes no sense what-\nso-ever. It is irrational--to say that the No. 1 priority for this \ncountry is to get people back to work and to provide jobs, and here we \nhave a ready-made job creator that is being postponed to pacify some \nextreme environmentalists who don't want one drop of oil or one piece \nof coal mined in this country or used in this country to provide energy \nresources. They think all we need to do is switch to electric--which, \nby the way, is only produced through burning coal and oil--to provide \nelectricity to plug in our cars and make them work or they want wind \nand solar. Well, if we look outside the window here in Washington and \nacross most of the country the last few days you are going to see a lot \nof clouds and very little sun. And you are not going to see much wind. \nWe cannot run factories, we cannot run businesses, we can't even light \nthis Senate based solely on this alternative energy as it currently \nexists, and it is costing the taxpayer a lot of money.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline also has the support of labor groups and \nunions. These are the entities that will be providing jobs for the \nproject.\n  Mark Ayers of the AFL-CIO wrote:\n\n       For America's skilled craft construction professionals, any \n     discussion of the Keystone XL project begins and ends with \n     one word: Jobs . . . Throughout America's heartland, the \n     Keystone Pipeline represents the prospect for 20,000 \n     immediate jobs, and as many as 500,000 indirect jobs via a \n     strong economic multiplier effect . . . without one single \n     dollar of government assistance.\n\n  That is right. This is totally paid for by the private sector. We can \nprovide 20,000 jobs immediately without taxpayer dollars. That is why \nthis is supported by Republicans, supported by Democrats, supported by \nUnions, supported by right-to-work States, supported across the board \nby those who feel we need more energy independence. Yet, after assuring \nus that his top priority is creating jobs, the President says, no. \nInstead, he chooses to yield to some extreme voices on the \nenvironmental left who basically say, no more oil, no more pipelines, \nno more coal, fossil fuels are out. It is wind, solar, batteries, or \nnothing--despite how many jobs it costs.\n  So I am asking the President of the United States to reconsider his \ndecision especially at a time when people are struggling in this \ncountry. The commonsense solution to one of our problems is right here \nbefore us. Yet we hear from the President, no, he is going to postpone \nthe decision for a year to get past the 2012 election. This is \npolitical decision is denying a lot of people work at a time when it is \ndesperately needed. At the same time the President is asking the \nCongress to extend unemployment benefits, primarily because of his own \nfailed economic policies, the White House is blocking this incredible \njob creating opportunity.\n  Another immediate action the administration can take would be to \naccept a modest provision to provide a reasonable delay on two costly \nEnvironmental Protection Agency regulations that will deal another \ndevastating blow to our already fragile economy. In the next few days, \nthe Environmental Protection Agency is expected to finalize a rule that \ncould threaten over 20 percent of the coal-fired powerplant generation \nin the Midwest and in the Southeast. We've now learned it also has a \ndramatic adverse effect on powerplants in the States of Kansas, \nOklahoma, and Texas. So a major part of our country will be affected by \nthis rule. Known as Utility MACT, this regulation will force most of \nour country's 1,100 coal-fired plants to retrofit their facilities or \nclose their doors. The Partnership for Affordable Clean Energy reported \nthat closures of U.S. coal-fired powerplants will accelerate sharply \nduring the next 10 years because of this utility rule.\n  The EPA's expected announcement on the utility rule comes just after \nthey issued another major rule that will cost additional American jobs \nbecause starting on January 1 the EPA will begin requiring utilities to \nreduce powerplant emissions that may cause air quality complications in \nneighboring States. That regulation, called the Cross State Air \nPollution Rule, is\n\n[[Page S8702]]\n\nalso one of the most expensive policies ever imposed on coal-fired \nplants. Under this rule, the EPA will require plants to install costly \ncontrol technologies in exchange for minimal environmental gains.\n  The combined economic impact of the two regulations I have just \nmentioned is alarming. The Indiana Energy Association estimates that \nthe cost of these rules will be between $6.5 billion and $7.3 billion \njust in my home State of Indiana. And when we add the entire eastern \nhalf of the country, from Mississippi River on to the Atlantic Ocean, \nthat number goes up exponentially.\n  The National Economic Research Associates estimates employment losses \nof 1.4 million across the country as a result of the current EPA rules \nand deadlines. By 2016, NERA reports that American ratepayers will see \nan average increase of up to 23.5 percent--and in some places rates \nwill be even higher.\n  Now, I want to say this: Cleaning our air is a worthy goal. Hundreds \nof billions of dollars have been spent under the Clean Air Act, which I \nsupported in the 1980s and early 1990s because, as Americans, we all \nwant to clean our air. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent \nby our utilities on clean air, consumers have been paying for it \nthrough our electricity bills to clean the air. The progress we have \nmade has been astounding.\n  Provisions that were offered in a bill Senator Joe Manchin--a \nDemocrat from West Virginia--and I offered together on a bipartisan \nbasis do not turn back or unwind the progress we have made. They simply \nextend the compliance date for a 3-year period of time and coordinate \nthat compliance date so that utilities can accomplish both of these \ngoals laid out by the EPA in a reasonable time frame. This rule will \ntake effect on January 1 of 2012. So we're asking for a little more \ntime.\n  Earlier this year I voted to eliminate these rules. That vote, led by \nSenator Rand Paul, was defeated. So we move now to the next stage which \nis to give utilities more time to meet EPA deadlines.\n\n  I urge the President to consider the Manchin-Coats legislation called \nthe Fair Compliance Act, which is bipartisan legislation to delay the \nimplementation of these harmful EPA rules. Otherwise, our utilities \nwill not have the time needed to adequately prepare. The EPA will be \nshutting them down. Without extra compliance time, there are \npredictions of blackouts or rolling blackouts and substantial increases \nin utility rates at a time when the economy is struggling and our \nmanufacturers need every competitive advantage they can get in order to \ncompete around the world and get people back to work.\n  Having said that, let me just say one more thing. It is disappointing \nfrom my perspective in the lack of progress in addressing our dire \nfiscal situation. We've tried just about everything and every process \nand every procedure people can think up, and each one of those has \nachieved either minimal results or failed completely. So after \nevaluating and looking at the extraordinary effort, energy and time put \ninto the process this year, there have been very few results. It has \nbecome clear to me and reaffirmed something I believed from day one \nwhen I first got into politics--that unless we put in place a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution that will require Members to come \ndown to this well and, before the President of the Senate, put their \nleft hand on the Bible and their right hand in the air and swear to \nuphold a Constitution that incorporates a balanced budget requirement, \nwe are never going to get there.\n  There is always a reason why something statutorily--all the efforts \nof the Gang of 6, the committee of 12; the rush to prevent crises by \nraising the debt limit; the cliff hangers: are we going to pass this or \nnot, and are we going to extend the debt limit or not extend it--all \nthe provisions through the appropriations process to cut spending and \nreduce government involvement and so forth have essentially failed.\n  What we need to do is what most States in this country do, what every \nbusiness has to do, what every family has to do; that is, commit to \nbalancing our budget, not spending more than we take in, and having a \nsworn, constitutional agreement that this is what we will do before we \nadjourn during every session. My State of Indiana has to do this, and \nmany States across the country have to do this. They do because it \nproduces transparency and honesty and Members going before their \nconstituents and saying: That program is a great idea, but we can't \nafford it. Unless you're willing to support Congress raising your taxes \nor cuts in other places, we can't put that new program in place.\n  I think my time is running out. I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes, and I will wrap it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues.\n  If we don't have this ultimate enforcement mechanism, I fear we will \njust continue to do what we have been doing for years and years and \nyears; that is, falling far short of where we need to go. I think where \nmost of us know we need to make the tough decisions, to be honest with \nour constituents, to go forward and basically say this is what our \nsworn obligation is, and we are going to have to fulfill this \nobligation. Nothing else has succeeded in forcing this body to come \ntogether and in a bipartisan way--or even on a partisan basis--do what \nis necessary to get our fiscal house in order.\n  During this holiday season, the people who are without work and \nstruggling to pay their mortgages or struggling to save money so their \nkids can go to school, struggling to pay bills, wondering what the \nfuture is going to hold, those working two or three jobs, they are all \nout there saying we have to get this together, we have to get this \ncountry moving again. We cannot do that if we are plunging into debt or \nthe policies coming out of this administration are denying our citizens \nthe right to work in jobs that are available, such as the Keystone \nPipeline. I can't even pay the utility cost now they say and if you are \ngoing to raise my rates 20 to 30 percent because of these regulations \nit is not going to be the kind of joyful, happy celebration at \nChristmas we would all wish for all our families across America.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague from Alaska, and the ranking member of the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, Lisa Murkowski, in urging passage of the \nInsular Areas Act of 2011. This legislation would enact three time-\nsensitive provisions needed to improve the operation of certain Federal \nprograms in the U.S. territory of American Samoa and in the freely \nassociated states of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the \nFederated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau.\n  First, section 2 of the bill would amend the Compact of Free \nAssociation Amendments Act of 2003 to direct the Secretary of Energy, \nas a part of\n\n[[Page S8703]]\n\nthe Department's Marshall Islands radiation monitoring program, to also \nperiodically monitor the containment structure on Runit Island where \nnuclear cleanup wastes are buried. This new monitoring would include a \nvisual inspection of the containment structure and a radiochemical \nanalysis of groundwater surrounding and in the structure. This section \nof the bill further requires the Secretary to submit a report to \nCongress with the results of the monitoring. Finally, the section \nrequires that the Secretary of the Interior shall make available to \nDOE, from existing technical assistance funds, the funding needed to \nconduct the chemical analysis of groundwater.\n  This section was requested by the Government of the Marshall Islands \nbecause of continuing concerns about radiation contamination among the \npeople living and fishing near Runit Island. Officials from the \nDepartment of Energy regularly visit the islands near Runit as a part \nof DOE's ongoing Marshall Islands monitoring activities, and it is \nreasonable to direct that those officials periodically monitor the \nRunit Island containment structure to assure the community that the \nsurrounding waters are not being contaminated and do not pose a health \nrisk to persons living and fishing nearby.\n  Second, section 3 of the bill would amend current law which \nauthorizes U.S. judges to serve temporarily, on a reimbursable basis, \non the courts of the freely associated states. These island nations \nwere formerly administered by the United States under a U.N. \ntrusteeship, and the practice of providing temporary judges on a \nreimbursable and time-available basis to assist local courts has \nexisted for several decades. This section was requested by the \nGovernment of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has few \njudges of its own and seeks to have additional U.S. judges available to \nassist, particularly when multijudge panels are needed to hear appeals. \nThis authority is used by the Ninth Circuit Court only a few days per \nyear when such temporary assignments do not interfere with the caseload \nof the assigned judges. The section would expand the pool of eligible \njudges from circuit and district judges, to include magistrate and \nterritorial judges. On March 31, 2011, I received a letter from the \nJudicial Conference of the United States stating its support for this \nprovision.\n  Finally, section 4 of this bill would amend the Fair Minimum Wage Act \nof 2007 to delay the 50-cent increase in the minimum wage of American \nSamoa that is scheduled for September 30, 2011, until September 30, \n2015. It would also delay future periodic minimum wage increases and \nthe periodic GAO report on the impact of prior wage increases from a 2-\nyear to a 3-year, cycle.\n  American Samoa is a small, remote, unincorporated and unorganized \nU.S. territory--the only U.S. territory in the Southern Hemisphere. Its \neconomy more closely resembles that of the nearby island-nation of \nSamoa than it does the U.S. economy. It has a large subsistence sector, \nas indicated by a 30 percent unemployment rate, and an average per \ncapita income of about $7,000 year--less than a quarter of the poorest \nState. The wage economy is concentrated in the government sector and \nfish processing. In recent years, however, trade globalization and \nrising costs have contributed to a severe economic downturn. GAO \nrecently reported--GAO-11-427--that one of two tuna canneries closed in \n2009 and the other cannery significantly reduced operations. Employment \nin this key sector fell by 55 percent from 2009 to 2010. The U.S. \nminimum wage was extended to American Samoa in 2007, with annual \nincreases of 50 cents starting in 2008. But, because of the severe \ndownturn, Congress delayed the 2010 wage increase until 2012. The \nGovernment of American Samoa is requesting this further delay because \nof the unique and continuing challenges it faces along with other South \nPacific island economies.\n  Mr. President, there are no authorizations in the bill, and any \nadditional costs associated with its enactment would be funded from \nexisting sources. These are time-sensitive provisions of interest to \nthese remote U.S.-affiliated island communities, and I urge the support \nof my colleagues in passing this bill.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements \nrelating to the matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the payroll tax cut \nwe have been debating and considering these many weeks and which we \nseem to be making some progress on today. I know we will hear more \nabout that later today. I wish to make a couple points--first about the \nissue itself and then a few points about what is happening in \nPennsylvania. I wish to highlight some of the constituent mail we have \nreceived about this issue and about the state of the economy and \npeople's lives.\n  But first and foremost, by way of review, we have had a number of \nweeks now of debate about the payroll tax and putting in place an \nagreement where both parties can come together to make sure we put in \nplace the payroll tax cut we agreed to last year.\n\n[[Page S8704]]\n\nMany who have been watching this debate know what that means. Instead \nof having an individual worker or employee pay 6.2 percent as a payroll \ntax, we reduced that last year to 4.2 percent. I think it is vital, at \na minimum, we do that, we extend it.\n  I had two pieces of legislation--two different versions--to reduce \nthat even more, to cut it in half and also to do the same for \nbusinesses. I think that is a good idea, but for whatever reason we \nhave not reached agreement on that. But we seem to have made progress \nin the last couple days--even in the last couple hours--coming together \non an agreement on the payroll tax. We do not have an agreement yet. \nBut we are all working very hard because we all know both the benefits \nof it and the consequences of not extending the payroll tax cut.\n  The benefits are plainly evident. If we put in place this payroll tax \ncut, we can jump-start, kick-start job creation and move the economy \nforward. I say that in light of some recent numbers we have in \nPennsylvania. Pennsylvania's unemployment rate has hovered around 8 \npercent for a long time. The number of people unemployed in our State, \nthe 8 percent, does not sound as high as in some places, but that meant \nover half a million people were out of work. It was not too long ago--\njust a few months ago--when we had roughly 525,000 people out of work. \nThat number reduced to about 513,000. Fortunately, just yesterday, we \ngot news that the number has fallen below 500,000 for the first time in \na long time. We are at 499,000--not much below half a million, but that \nis good news for Pennsylvania. What that meant is, our unemployment \nrate went from 8.1 percent down to 7.9 percent. So we are below 8 \npercent.\n  As many people know, the national rate went below 9 percent to 8.6 \npercent. So we are seeing the unemployment rate nationally and in a \nnumber of States, including Pennsylvania, going in the right direction, \nmeaning it is going down. The unemployment rate is going down. The \nnumber of people out of work, fortunately, is shrinking a little bit.\n  We have a long way to go to completely dig out of this economic ditch \nour economy has been in for a long time. One of the best ways to \ncontinue that progress is to pass a cut in the payroll tax again, as we \ndid last year. It was the right thing to do last year. It is the right \nthing to do this year, to continue the progress. We want to make sure \nwe are doing everything possible so our month-to-month job creation \nnumber is much higher than it has been.\n  We have been averaging in the roughly 150,000 range of private sector \njob growth. That is not enough. We need that above 200,000, and we need \nit even above 250,000. If we take this step--it is not the only step--\nthere is no magic wand to any policy we pass. Cutting the payroll tax \nwill not solve all our economic challenges. But it is one of the most \nconstructive, one of the most effective steps we can take.\n  If we do not do it, here is the consequence, at least as it relates \nto Pennsylvania--a big State that has a lot of the economic challenges \nmany States have. Mark Zandi, a respected economist, did some analysis \njust on Pennsylvania. If we do not extend the payroll tax cut, which, \nas we know, has the potential to benefit 160 million American workers--\nin my home State of Pennsylvania last year that meant more than 6.5 \nmillion workers had a cut in their payroll tax, a tremendous benefit \nfor a State such as Pennsylvania. We grew in the last year about 50,000 \njobs. That is the good news. The bad news could be, if we do not pass a \npayroll tax cut, for Pennsylvania--for the country, which, obviously, \nwould have an impact in Pennsylvania--the job loss number, according to \nMark Zandi, would be just shy of 20,000 jobs lost in the State of \nPennsylvania in 2012.\n  So it is vitally important for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I \nthink that applies for the Nation as a whole. It is one of the steps, \nand, frankly, one of the few steps Congress can take that will have a \ndirect impact not just on the economy overall but to directly put \ndollars in people's pockets--take-home pay. That is what this whole \nissue is about for employees--what is going to be their take-home pay \nin 2012. If we pass the tax cut, it will be about $1,000. If we do not \npass a tax cut, it will be zero in terms of an extra benefit.\n  Working Americans who have been struggling through this economy and \nsuffering should have the right to expect we take the action they are \ntelling us to take to cut the payroll tax.\n  Let me cite two examples of what people are asking us to do, from two \nconstituents, and then I will conclude my remarks.\n  Here is a letter from a woman in Pennsylvania, central Pennsylvania. \nI will not give her name. We do not have the authority to do that. But \nI wish to read some of her words. Here is what she says about how she \nperceives Washington and what is happening here. I will just read about \ntwo sentences from her letter:\n\n       Please make sure something is done in Washington before the \n     end of the year. I feel that no one should be able to have a \n     break--\n\n  Talking about us in Congress--\n\n     before taking action on the tax breaks that will expire at \n     the end of this year. If you all cannot do this then you \n     should all leave office and let someone in there who can work \n     together and get things done. Stay and do your job. Period!!\n\n  She has two exclamation points after the word ``period.'' What she is \ntelling us is what so many Americans are telling us: that we have work \nto do here, to come together, to agree not just on a budget for the \nnext year but especially on something as fundamental as this payroll \ntax cut. So she said it very well, and she encapsulated a lot of what \npeople are feeling.\n\n  I am going to read an excerpt from a second letter, one from a woman \nfrom the eastern side of our State, in the so-called Lehigh Valley of \nPennsylvania. I will not read the whole letter. It is about her family \nand some of the economic challenges they have had. I wish to read just \ntwo excerpts. She says:\n\n       Now I find myself questioning whether or not anyone has an \n     answer and if they do, will it be too late.\n       You see, over the last 2 years, all four members of my \n     family, myself included, have lost our jobs.\n\n  This is a woman from one family in one part of Pennsylvania talking \nabout how many members of her family have lost their jobs. She expects \nus to get our job done--to come together and to work together to pass a \ncut in the payroll tax.\n  Later in the letter she says this--and I will conclude with this \nquotation:\n\n       We need to put people back to work. Only then can the \n     economy get turned around. I don't care who comes up with the \n     plan, but the parties need to work together if this country \n     is going to survive. My family is only one example. I know of \n     SO many others who are struggling and in an even worse \n     position than we are.\n\n  She is talking about other people being in a worse circumstance, and \nshe has all four members, including herself, of her family who have \nlost their jobs in the course of the last year or so. So if she can \ndemonstrate--this woman from the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania--if she \ncan demonstrate that kind of empathy and compassion and understanding \nof what others are going through, when she herself and her family have \nsuffered so substantially in this economy, the least we can do in the \nSenate, in Washington--the very least we can do--is come together and \nwork together to get this job done.\n  The leading indicator of that, I would argue, is making sure we put \nin place a cut in the payroll tax so at a minimum--as people are still \ndoing holiday shopping and still wanting to have a bright and happy \nholiday and want to have some measure of peace of mind, some measure of \nsecurity about next year--at least know we came together and made sure \nthis payroll tax cut was in place.\n  It is vital for the people of Pennsylvania, and I think it is \nessential for economic growth across the country. We need to come \ntogether and get this done.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we seem to be heading to an agreement\n\n[[Page S8705]]\n\ntoday. At this point, the House appears to be ready to vote on the \nconference report on the appropriations bills for the rest of the \nfiscal year, which would be until the end of September of next year. I \nthink this is good. We came to an agreement in August called the Budget \nControl Act. It was a 10-year commitment to lower spending, lower our \ndeficits. It required a cap in each of the next 10 years that would be \na down payment on our debt, would lower the deficit and lower the debt.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill, obviously, because it has so many \ndifferent agencies in it, rather than each separate agency bill going \nforward as we have done normally in the past in the Senate--because it \nhas so many, there are people who are going to disagree with parts of \nit. There is no getting around that. The military construction, of \nwhich I am on the subcommittee and have chaired it in the past, is part \nof this bill. So are many of the other bills that are very important \nfor the functioning of our government.\n  However, the appropriations bill sticks with the agreement we all \nmade. In August, there was a lot of negotiation on how we deal with the \ndebt. To be honest, I did not think it was enough. Many of us did not \nthink it was enough. But we have not been able to come to terms between \nthe two Houses of Congress and with the President on how we can do more \nand get the votes to do it and get the President to sign the bill.\n  So I am not saying we are going to agree with everything in this \nOmnibus appropriations bill. But every one of these bills did go \nthrough the committee, and they have been vetted. They did keep the \nagreement. We have lowered the spending across the board. We set the \nfinal fiscal year 2012 funding at $1.043 trillion. This is $7 billion \nless than last year's level, and it is almost $100 billion less than \nthe President's request.\n  Now, it is not enough for many people in this body, but we all voted \nin the majority; 74 separate Members voted in favor of the Budget \nControl Act, and the appropriations bills all have met those caps. That \nis something I do not hear said very often in this body, that we have \nmet the caps.\n  I was vice chairman, the ranking member, of one of the very important \nappropriations committees that funded NASA, the Department of Commerce, \nthe Department of Justice. We met these caps. It was hard. Each one of \nthe subcommittees of the Appropriations Committees on the Senate side \nmet the caps, even though we had to cut and balance and set priorities \nand not fund some of the important areas that we would like to have \nfunded. But that is what choosing and prioritizing are about. That is \nwhy we made the agreement, and we stuck to it. So when all of these \nappropriations bills are complete, we will have cut discretionary \nspending for 2 years in a row for the first time in modern history, \nfrankly, really cut.\n  So now we are working toward cutting the deficits over a 10-year \nperiod as we agreed we would do. In the next few days, I hope we are \ngoing to take fiscal year 2012 off the books and immediately focus our \nattention on long-term deficit reduction and, hopefully, comprehensive \ntax reform because the real issue is how we are going to get the debt \ndown more.\n  We are talking about a $15 trillion debt. If we cut the debt $1 \ntrillion, it is a down payment. But I think we need to do more in a \nresponsible way. But we cannot do it all in discretionary spending. If \nwe are going to do what the taxpayers elected us to do, then we are \ngoing to have to deal with entitlements. We are going to have to deal \nwith Social Security reform and Medicare reform.\n  Everyone knows, common sense tells us, Social Security has changed \nsince the time it was passed and today when people are living longer \nand retiring later. But we have not accommodated those changes. We have \nnot set the actuarial tables that would sustain Social Security for the \nnext 75 years. We could do it by just very gradually, 3 months a year \nonly, increasing the age of retirement; put a cap on it at 68 or 69. We \ncould bring Social Security into balance.\n  We would also have to make adjustments in the cost of living \nincreases. But we would not have to raise taxes, and we would not have \nto cut the core benefits in any reduction. So we can do this and make \nsignificant deficit reductions so the $15 trillion starts coming down. \nThat is our debt.\n  We have to deal with Social Security reform. I have introduced \nlegislation, the Defend and Save Social Security Act, with Senator Kyl \nas my cosponsor that has done exactly that. Other Senators have \nintroduced legislation. Senator Paul introduced legislation that would \ngradually bring down the Social Security deficit, which would also \nbring down the debt of our country. This is responsible. I am going to \npush next year to try to get this Social Security reform.\n  But in the next 2 days we are going to deal with discretionary \nspending because that is all we have on the table to deal with, and we \nare going to keep the agreements we made in the Budget Control Act, \nwhich 74 Members of the Senate supported. The appropriators have kept \ntheir word. Every single bill has had a cap on spending. Where we have \nthe capability to deal with discretionary spending--and that is all we \nhave, we cannot deal with entitlements until we have entitlement \nreform. But in discretionary spending, the appropriators have kept \ntheir word. That is what we will be voting on, to keep the word that 74 \nSenators agreed was the right approach.\n  We are going to vote on a bill that will be passed by the House today \nand, hopefully, be passed by the Senate tonight or tomorrow as our \nleader has said we will. I hope we can pass that bill.\n  We also have to deal with the long term. We are not going to be able \nto do it in the next 2 days, but surely when we come back next year we \ncan pick up tax reform. We can put our Tax Code in a better structure \nso our corporations will bring their businesses that are now overseas \nback to America. Those are going to be jobs in America. That is how we \nwant to create revenue in this country, not by taxing the people who \nwould hire people but by having an equitable Tax Code that will make \ncorporations do their business here so people will have jobs, and they \nwill increase their revenue and the economy of our country.\n\n  That is the way we need to deal with the long term. We need to deal \nwith entitlement reform and Tax Code reform. We do not have a revenue \nproblem in this country. We do not have a problem with people paying \ntoo little in taxes. We have a spending problem that has given us a $15 \ntrillion debt.\n  So I hope as all of those families in America are settling in for the \nholidays that we would be doing the work in Washington that would \nassure a long-term future for these families, which means we are going \nto have to cut spending from the government, that we are not going to \nincrease taxes on the working people of our country, and that we would \nhave regulatory reform that would allow our small businesses to grow \nwithout the heavy hand of government putting a blanket on their ability \nto grow.\n  When there is a blanket on the ability to grow, they are not going to \nhire more people. That is the problem we have in this country right \nnow. So we are making, in the next 2 days, I hope--I hope my colleagues \nwill support the agreement we made in August to start the down payment \non the spending in this country, lowering it, lowering it from what the \nPresident sent over, a budget from which we have cut almost $100 \nbillion.\n  Even in the face of this crisis in this country on spending, the \nPresident sent us a budget that was almost $100 billion more than we \nare going to pass in the House and Senate because we made an agreement \nin August to cut spending. The House is also going to send disaster \nrelief, which I will certainly support, and they are going to send a \nbill that would pay for it with a 1.83-percent across-the-board cut in \ndiscretionary base spending, excluding the Department of Defense, \nmilitary construction, and veterans affairs. I think that is a \nresponsible approach.\n  I think with the budget that we are putting forward with the \nappropriations, with a 1.83-percent across-the-board cut to fund \ndisaster relief that we know is going to happen and be necessary in the \nnext 9 months of next year, that we should pay for that. We should have \ndisaster relief in our budgets in the future, and we should try to \naccommodate it right now.\n  We are not going to withhold it for people who are in need. We do not\n\n[[Page S8706]]\n\nknow if it is going to be wildfires or droughts or hurricanes or \ntornados. We are not going to deny that help. But it should be budgeted \njust like everything we do. We should have some sense that we have \nprepared for it. Preparing for disasters should be part of our budget. \nThere is not a business in this country that does not prepare for \ndisasters. The government should do it too.\n  I hope we will be on a trajectory to lower the spending, keeping our \nagreement of August with the Omnibus appropriations bill that is going \nto be passed by the House this afternoon and will come to the Senate. I \nhope we will be able to act by tomorrow on that piece of legislation \nthat keeps the agreements we made.\n  It is a down payment. It is not what all of us wanted, but I think we \nought to put in disaster relief. I think we ought to pay for that with \nanother 1.83-percent cut across the board. I think that would be the \nresponsible approach, and then we can start next year on the long term. \nThat would be regulatory reform, Social Security reform--to make it \nsolvent for 75 years, at least--and Medicare reform. Those are the \nthings that will give us a long-term, hopefully, solvent government \nthat will be the model for the world because, is there any question \nthat we need a model in the world right now for fiscal discipline and \nresponsible governing? I hope America can provide it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to make some observations about \nthe Keystone Pipeline. President Obama has said his first priority is \njobs. Here is an opportunity for the President to show it, a pipeline \nprovision that, according to some estimates, would create thousands of \njobs right away. In fact, those are all the estimates I have seen, that \nthis is a project that is ready to go.\n  Here is an opportunity for the President to say he is not going to \nlet a few radical environmentalists stand in the way of a project that \nwill create thousands of jobs and make America more secure at the same \ntime. The labor unions support the pipeline, the Chamber of Commerce \nsupports the pipeline, out-of-work Americans support it, and a growing \nnumber of Democrats are expressing their support as well.\n  Here are a few of the comments we heard from Democrats just this very \nweek. Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota said:\n\n       I personally think the pipeline is absolutely in the \n     national interest. It'll help us reduce our dependence on \n     foreign energy, at least foreign sources that are hostile to \n     our interests.\n\n  Senator Conrad further said:\n\n       I, for one, on this side hope that this could be part of a \n     final package and I hope that this is something we could work \n     through in the coming hours.\n\n  Senator McCaskill:\n\n       If States rights are being protected and if this is going \n     to be something maybe, that we can try to jump start the \n     approval process, make it go more quickly.\n\n  Representative Clyburn, one of the leaders of the Democratic \nconference in the House:\n\n       I'm very much for the pipeline. There is no question about \n     that.\n\n  Congress should do something, not just assist people who are \nstruggling in a down economy or out of work, but help incentivize job \ncreation for them at the same time. In other words, let's not just pass \na bill that helps people on the benefits side; let's also include \nsomething that actually helps the private sector create the jobs \nAmericans need for the long term. This is the balanced approach \nAmericans want, one that extends help but also offers hope.\n  This is just the kind of thing we should be doing around here. Both \nparties like it, the labor unions like it, why in the world wouldn't we \nwant to put it in the package?\n  The only reason the White House has given for opposing the pipeline \nprovision is they would rather vote on it alone, which makes absolutely \nno sense. You are either for the provision or you are not. So I suggest \nhere is a rare opportunity to do something truly positive together on a \nbipartisan basis at the end of the year. Let's finish this year on a \ntruly cooperative, bipartisan note. Let's strengthen our Nation's \nenergy security, decrease the energy we import from overseas, create \nAmerican jobs right now, and let's do it all on a bipartisan basis.\n  As I said, there is bipartisan support for this project. We need to \nget it done, and we need to get it done now. The House of \nRepresentatives has been quite clear that they are not going to support \na package that does not include the pipeline. Frankly, I would not be \nable to support a package that doesn't include the pipeline. I think \nthis is something we could all be proud of at the end of the year, \ndemonstrating to the American people that we can work together not only \nto help those who are struggling, through a continuation of the payroll \ntax holiday and an unemployment benefits package, but also create jobs \nat the same time in the private sector without a penny of the Federal \nGovernment's money by moving this pipeline along.\n  After all, it has undergone years of environmental studies. It is \nready to go. The company is ready to hire the people just as soon as we \ngive them the signoff.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank those who have listened to our e-\nmails back in Florida that we just sent out alerting them I will be \nspeaking on the Senate floor, maybe the last time I will speak this \nyear.\n  I want to take a few minutes to update everyone on what this first \nyear in the Senate has been like. First of all, it has been a \ntremendous privilege and honor. There is not a day goes by that I do \nnot come to this building early in the morning, when I can get to the \ngym--I probably should do that more than I do--and see this building \nlit up in the darkness. It takes my breath away that I actually get to \nwork here in this building on behalf of the people of the State of \nFlorida.\n  I recognize what an honor and privilege it is to have this position, \nnot just in this unique institution--which is different, perhaps, than \nany legislative body in all of history--but this Republic that stands \nout in the history of mankind. As Americans, we should always take a \nmoment to recognize that in America, on this floor, we debate and \nsometimes solve issues other countries fight wars with each other \nabout. That is a real blessing and a real opportunity to be an example \nfor the world. I am grateful and feel blessed to be a part of it, and I \nthank the people of Florida for the opportunity to do it.\n  I want to share two observations as this year comes to an end--and, \nhopefully, today or tomorrow, sometime this week, we will wrap up our \nwork in this body for 2011--observations I have after my first year. I \nthink I am 3 weeks from having been sworn in for the first time. There \nare a couple of things that concern me.\n  First is a real lack of urgency. There are some major issues that \nconfront America. These have to be confronted. We need look no further \nthan Europe to see what our future holds, unfortunately, if some of the \nissues that now confront us are not confronted. That is not hyperbole, \nit is not partisanship, it is reality--it is math. This country borrows \nmore money than it needs to or should. This is a country that is now \nspending more money than it takes in at an alarming pace, and there is \nno plan in place to prevent that.\n\n  That is not a partisan observation; that is not a Republican concern \nor a Democratic concern; that is the concern of every person who is \ngrounded in\n\n[[Page S8707]]\n\nreality, that we cannot continue doing what we are doing now.\n  There are specific programs that are in trouble that we should be \nvery concerned about. Medicare is one example. I have a very special \nplace in my heart for Medicare. No. 1, there are a lot of people in \nFlorida who are on Medicare; and, No. 2, in my own life, both in my \nfather's illness last year before he passed away and this year when my \nmother suffered some setbacks in her health, I have seen firsthand how \nimportant Medicare is.\n  There are two things that worry me about Medicare. The first is that \nit will not be there when my generation and future generations retire. \nThe other is just as important: that somehow, if we fail to act in a \ntimely manner, people like my mother, who are currently on Medicare, \nmay at some point in their lifetime see their benefits change \ndramatically or see the program and quality of access decline.\n  We need to do everything we can to save Medicare. We know for a fact, \nand no one can dispute, if we leave Medicare the way it is right now, \nthat program is going to be in a lot of trouble. I hope there is a \nsense of urgency about that. Also, the fact that our economy is now \nsmaller than our debt--$15 trillion is a lot of money we owe, that our \nchildren and our grandchildren will owe. That is a lot of money. That \nis a big deal. The national security threats we face are significant \nand have to be confronted.\n  The sense that somehow the major issues can wait until another \nelection or another moment concern me because these issues have a \ntendency to sneak up on us and a problem becomes a crisis. It is a lot \nharder to solve a crisis than it is to solve a problem, so I hope we \nhave a sense of urgency with regard to these issues in the coming year.\n  There is another issue I would like to talk about, which is a \ntroubling emergence in the last year in politics. It is this rhetoric \nthat, in my opinion, seeks to divide Americans against each other, \nbasically pits Americans against each other.\n  The way the rhetoric basically goes is, there is a reason there are \nAmericans who are struggling, hurting; a reason that people have lost \ntheir jobs; that people are working twice as hard and are making half \nas much; that people have lost their homes, and people have graduated \nfrom college but cannot find a job. And there is a theme by some, \nincluding, frankly, many in our political leadership and from time to \ntime even the White House, saying to people the reason they are doing \nworse is because there is a handful of people out there doing too well. \nThe reason they have lost their jobs is because someone else is being \ntoo greedy. The reason they are losing their homes is because someone \nelse owns too many homes. The reason they are making less money is \nbecause someone else is making too much money.\n  I am troubled by that rhetoric that pits people against each other \nbecause the second part of that argument is give the government more \npower; give us, government, more power so we can step in and right this \nwrong, so we can take away from the people who have too much and give \nto the people who do not have enough.\n  Let me tell you why I am troubled by that. The first reason I am \ntroubled by that is because it is absolutely not the kind of country we \nhave been for 220-some-odd years. It is not in our nature. Americans \nhave never been a people to drive through a nice neighborhood and say: \nOh, I hate the people who live in these nice houses. Americans are \npeople who drive through a nice neighborhood and say: Congratulations \non your nice house. Guess what. We will be joining you soon.\n  We have never been people who go around and confront people or look \nat people who have been financially successful and say: We hate you. We \nenvy you because of how well you are doing. Americans have celebrated \ntheir success, and they say: Guess what. We are going to be successful \nsoon as well.\n  I remember growing up, I always tell people I am a child of privilege \nbecause I have the privilege and the honor of being born in the \ngreatest country in human history and of having a mother and a father \nwho were married, loved each other and lived in our home. These are two \nof the most important benefits anyone could have. But my parents were \nworking-class folks. My dad was a bartender for most of his life. My \nmom was a maid and cashier and stock clerk at K-Mart. We were not \npeople of financial means in terms of significant financial wealth.\n  I tell them I always had what I needed. I didn't always have what I \nwanted, but I always had what I needed. My parents always provided \nthat. I don't remember them telling us or teaching us the only way we \ncould be more successful was if other people were less successful. They \nnever inculcated in us the belief that somehow in order for us to climb \nthe ladder, other people had to come down from the ladder.\n  On the contrary, they would hold up these examples of success to \ninspire in us the hope that someday we could be there as well--\nfinancially, in our careers, what have you. We are people who have \nalways celebrated other people's success so long as we always had the \nopportunity to meet that success ourselves. That is the American \nnature. That is the American character. That is what makes us different \nfrom the rest of the world.\n  I am afraid we could lose that or are on the verge of losing that. I \nam concerned that there are those in America's political leadership who \nare advocating that we abandon that in favor of something else. I think \nit is wrong because it does not work. That thought process that somehow \nother people have to be worse off in order for us to be better off does \nnot work. People get on boats, people jump fences to get away from that \nkind of thought process. People flee countries that do that because it \ndoes not work. It never has.\n  It will not work here. The proof is in the numbers. Let's put aside \npartisan political rhetoric for a moment and look at the numbers. In \nJanuary of 2009, when the President was sworn in, he inherited a very \nbad economy. He inherited a bad economy. He inherited an economy, for \nexample, that had 12 million people out of a job, an economy where gas \nwas $1.85 a gallon, where the debt was at $10.6 trillion, where we were \n39 million Americans living in poverty in January of 2009. He inherited \na bad economy.\n  But for the first years of his Presidency, at least one of the first \n2 years, he had 60 votes in the Senate which I quickly learned is the \nway everything seems to happen around here, by 60 votes. He had a \nmajority in the House. He could have anything he wanted, and he said: \nThis is what I want. This is what the President said: He wanted a \nstimulus package, and he got it. He wanted his health care package, and \nhe got it. He wanted financial services reform, and he got it. So what \nhappened? Let's look at the numbers.\n  He became President, bad economy, got everything he wanted. What has \nhappened since? Now there are 13.3 million people unemployed, gas is \nnow at $3.27 a gallon on average, the debt is now up to $15 trillion, \nand people in poverty--39 million when he took office, 46 million \npeople now.\n  Put aside the partisan rhetoric for a moment--just the numbers. He \nbecame President, got everything he wanted, and everything got worse. \nThose are the facts.\n  Is that because he is a bad person? Of course not. It is ridiculous. \nIt is because his view of government and politics is wrong and those \nwho share it are wrong. They are not un-American, they are not bad \npeople, but the proof is it doesn't work. It has not worked anywhere \nelse in the world to approach it this way, and it is not going to work \nhere. I hope in this new year we will reverse course on these things \nand instead embrace and take up that which does work in America.\n\n  What makes America become more prosperous? It is not that \ncomplicated. It is not Fortune 500 companies or big corporations. Every \ncountry in the world has rich people. Every country in the world has \nbillionaires and millionaires. What makes us different is that here a \nworker can become an owner, an employee can become an employer. It \nhappens all the time. You cannot walk two blocks anywhere in this \ncountry and not bump into somebody who didn't start a business out of \nthe spare bedroom of their home, who didn't take their credit card or \ntheir lifesavings and risked it all behind a great idea and today 20 \npeople work for them. That is 20 families being fed, 20 families \nsending kids to college because somebody had the audacity to take\n\n[[Page S8708]]\n\ntheir lifesavings and pursue their dream. So they opened a business out \nof the spare bedroom of their home; they opened a business out of a \ncorner in their garage; and nowadays you can start a business with a \nlaptop and an empty table at a Starbucks, and it works. We have to get \nback to that.\n  What stands in the way of that are three things, above everything \nelse. The first is a Tax Code that is crazy. It is not complicated, it \nis not burdensome, it is crazy. It is the craziest thing you have ever \nseen in your life. First of all, it is full of loopholes and exemptions \nbuilt in. That doesn't hurt the big guys. It doesn't hurt billionaires \nand millionaires and big corporations. These guys can handle this \nstuff. They may not like it, but they can hire lawyers, accountants, \nand lobbyists. They can figure this stuff out. You know who a \ncomplicated Tax Code kills? The guy or gal trying to start a business \nout of the spare bedroom of their home. We have to simplify our Tax \nCode. It has to be reformed. If there is stuff in it that is the result \nof good lobbying as opposed to good policy, take it out. I hope we will \nwork on that. Everybody here says they are for tax reform, so do it. \nLet's have urgency. Let's have some urgency behind that.\n  The second is regulations. Look, we need to have regulations. Here is \na glass of water. I don't want this to have poison in it. I want our \nair to be clean. Government has a role to play in those things. Let me \ntell you what happens when regulations go too far, when they seem to \nexist only for the purpose of justifying the existence of a regulator. \nYou don't hurt the guys who have made it; you don't hurt the big \ncorporations or the billionaires. These guys can hire lawyers to deal \nwith that stuff, and they can hire lobbyists to change all that stuff. \nIt kills the people trying to start a business out of the spare bedroom \nof their home. So we have to simplify the regulatory system we have in \nthis country as well.\n  Finally, this debt. The debt is a problem. There is no plan in place \nto do anything about it. People are afraid, concerned, worried--and \nrightfully so--about investing money in an economy that doesn't have a \nplan to pay its bills. I hope we reverse course on all of these issues. \nIf we do, it will lead to prosperity.\n  Let me tell you what prosperity will lead to. It will lead to more \njobs, more jobs will lead to more taxpayers, more taxpayers will lead \nto more revenue, and more revenue means we will have money to pay down \nour debt and do what government should do, such as our national \ndefense, invest in infrastructure and in our people, and provide a \nsafety net to help those who cannot help themselves.\n  To do that, it all starts with embracing the fundamental principle of \nAmerica's prosperity. We have never been a nation of haves and have-\nnots. We are a nation of haves and soon-to-haves, of people who have \nmade it and people who will make it. That is who we need to remain if \nwe desire to provide our children with what we had, an American \ncentury, which is what the 21st century can be, should be, and will be. \nIf in 2012 this body and our leadership reverse course from the \ndirection we are headed, it will place us on a path that is true to our \nheritage as a people and embrace for our children and grandchildren a \nfuture they deserve, a prosperous and growing America where all things \nare possible, where anyone from anywhere can accomplish anything, where \nthe son of a bartender and a maid can be a U.S. Senator, and where \nanyone watching, no matter where you start out in life, can accomplish \nand be anything you want to accomplish if you are willing to work hard, \nplay by the rules and have the ability to do it.\n  With that, I want to wish all of my colleagues and the people of \nFlorida and the people of the United States a merry Christmas, a happy \nHanukkah, and a happy New Year. May God always bless our country and \nmay 2012 bring us the safety and prosperity for our Nation and for the \nworld.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will take the opportunity while the \nfloor is relatively quiet to come and explain one of the votes we are \ngoing to be asked to cast tomorrow. In fact, it is very timely that I \nam here on the Senate floor at 2 o'clock in the afternoon because the \nHouse, I understand, just passed H. Con. Res. 94, and I am going to ask \nthe Senate to reject that resolution when it comes here tomorrow for \nour vote. I am asking Democrats and Republicans to join with me in \nvoting no on that resolution. I would like to take a few minutes to \nexplain why. I think pictures are worth a thousand words, so let me \njust use four to save time.\n  This is about disasters in 2011. This whole issue is about how we \nshould budget for disasters. It is an important debate that has been \none of the many debates Congress has had over this last year, and we \nare wrapping up that debate in the next 48 hours. So this is a part of \nthat debate.\n  I think pictures speak louder than words. This is a picture of \nJoplin, MO, a town that was virtually wrecked by a massive and monster \ntornado and tornadoes.\n  This is a picture of the Mississippi River flooding in Cairo, IL. \nThis year, the Mississippi River was at one of its highest levels in \nsome places in over a century. We received our own share of that \nflooding in Louisiana, which sits at the base of this great Mississippi \nRiver basin. So our people, as well as people along the entire \nMississippi River Valley, experienced unprecedented flooding.\n  The lonely and distraught couple sitting in what looks like the \nmiddle of an ocean is actually in Nags Head, NC. This is what happened \nto their beach home as water virtually surrounded them and destroyed \nthat community. Again, this happened this year with Hurricane Irene.\n  Down here on the far right is a picture of the fires that raged and \ndevastated parts of Texas, which experienced one of the worst droughts \nin the recorded history of Texas.\n  What is sad about this debate is I could show picture after picture \nafter picture of communities in our country devastated by tornadoes, \nfires, hurricanes--disasters that strike without warning and whose \nimpact is virtually impossible to measure until months afterward \nbecause of the extraordinary damage. In fact, the Weather Service just \nthis month did a recalculation of 2011 and declared it to be one of the \nworst disaster years since records have been kept, saying they have now \nconcluded, as enough evidence has come in, that we had over 12 \ndisasters in 1 year--in this year of 2011--over $1 billion each.\n  So this year was a real outlier, but sadly--and the Presiding Officer \nhas heard it in his State, and we have heard it in my State of \nLouisiana, and we have heard it around the world--these pictures may \nnot be an aberration. These pictures may show what is to come. And \nwhile 2011 was a very bad year, people are starting to think that as a \nresult of the changes in temperature and climate change--and whatever \npeople think the reasons are for that, no one should disagree with the \nconsequences of changing temperature, which are violent weather \nepisodes. The question is, What are we going to do about it and what is \nthe right way to move forward? Let me show my colleagues what the wrong \nway is before I explain the right way.\n  This picture depicts the wrong way to respond. This has been \nsuggested by some of my Republican colleagues. They suggest that when \nthe water rises on your home or when the tornado rips you out of your \nbed and the roof falls on you and your family or when the river water \nrises and you look out of your second-floor window over your 100- or \n200-acre farm and you can't see anything and your cows are swimming and \nyour horses are swimming as well, that what you should do is climb on \nyour roof, call Washington, call the hotline, and identify the offset \nin the\n\n[[Page S8709]]\n\nFederal budget to provide the cost of your rescue. It is laughable. It \nis supposed to be funny. It is a funny cartoon. But when we think about \nit, it is really not funny to tell the American people that in order to \nbe rescued, you need to call the budget office of the Federal \nGovernment, identify an offset, and then we will send a rescue unit to \nrespond to your emergency. It is not funny. The American people aren't \nlaughing.\n  So I am going to ask my colleagues to vote no on H. Con. Res. 94 \ntomorrow because that is exactly what H. Con. Res. 94 does. I should \nget a big pen and write, ``If you think that grandma here with a cat \nand the phone is what you want your constituents to look like, then you \njust go right on and vote for H. Con. Res. 94.''\n  But I am not going to vote for that concurrent resolution because our \nleaders wisely--both Republican and Democratic leaders, wisely--in \nAugust, in anticipation of this issue, already provided for disaster \nfunding in the Budget Control Act. They already provided for it. We \ndon't have to tell our constituents that before we can send money to \nhelp them in Joplin or in Nags Head, NC, or Cairo, IL, or San Antonio \nor Dallas, TX, they have to identify an offset, because we wisely said \nwithin the Budget Control Act, within our efforts to close the budget \ngap, that we are providing for disaster funding, and that is what we \nhave done. But some Members of the House will continue to want to \nadhere to trying to identify an offset before disasters can be \nresponded to. They say things such as, we should pay for disasters in \nthe year we respond to them.\n\n  I am going to present a chart in just a minute, but first I want to \ntry to explain the second reason this is a faulty way forward.\n  In 2005, which wasn't that many years ago, the Federal Government \nallocated $45 billion--actually, I think this number is about $68 \nbillion, and I will show the chart in a minute--in 1 year, and that \nyear was the year of Katrina and Rita, which were the No. 1 and No. 3 \nmost violent and disastrous and costly hurricanes in the history of our \ncountry. They happened in the same year to the same State--or to the \nsame area, which was Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. We got the \nbrunt of two of the worst storms that literally flooded a metropolitan \narea or flooded an area greater than the size of Great Britain. And \nthat amount was $68 billion.\n  If we followed the poor logic of some on the Republican side that we \nhad to pay for this disaster in that year in the budget, I think we \nwould have probably had to eliminate half of the discretionary budget \nof the United States of America. I am going to get that exact number. \nBut it is ludicrous to think we would be able to find $68 billion in \nthe budget in that one year. In fact, the whole homeland security \nbudget--it wouldn't be half--the whole homeland security budget is $42 \nbillion. So let me repeat: Instead of half, we would have had to \ncompletely eliminate the entire homeland security budget of the United \nStates of America, plus another couple of smaller budgets, to meet the \n$68 billion requirement. It doesn't make any sense, and it is not \nright. It is not the right way to budget. It violates the Budget \nControl Act, and it is so hypocritical that some on the other side are \nrequiring this for domestic expenses when they don't require the same \nthing for foreign expenses or international expenses.\n  I would like to put up the next chart. To pour salt on the wound--and \nI don't quite understand the politics. I don't understand the math. I \ndon't understand the budgetary consequences, and I don't understand the \npolitics. They are wrong on all three counts because this is what those \nwho voted for H. Con. Res. 94 have to go home and explain to their \nconstituents. They are going to have to go home and say: When I was in \nCongress, I allocated $823 billion for the war in Iraq and required no \npay-for. Then I went back to Congress and spent $557 billion in \nAfghanistan and didn't say a word about that. Then I went back and \nadded a Medicare drug benefit for $180 billion, and we didn't pay for \nthat. Then I went back and sent checks to everyone when George Bush was \nthe President, and those checks cost $124 billion, and we didn't \nrequire any offset or budget implication for that. But when Americans \nhad their homes destroyed, their farms flooded, their businesses ruined \nby disasters, I can't send a dime unless we take it out of health, \ntransportation, or education.\n  So they said no to this little $8.1 billion--after spending a grand \ntotal of $1.68 trillion on all these items. So I do not understand the \nmath. I do not understand their position as to the budget. I most \ncertainly do not understand the politics, and I do not agree with it \nbecause I think the American people should come first. Their needs from \ndisasters should come first. We cannot possibly, because of the erratic \nnature of disasters themselves--we might think we are powerful in the \nSenate, but we are not more powerful than God, and we are not more \npowerful than nature; and I am not saying that God causes these storms, \nbut nature has a way--we are not that powerful and we do not know and \ncannot predict when these will happen. All we can do is respond.\n  We have responded appropriately in the Senate version of this bill. \nOur bill will provide funding for FEMA, for the Corps of Engineers, \nwithin the budgetary control structure. It will allow us to pay for \nthis over time in future negotiations, which is the wise way to do it. \nBut it will not force us to use disasters that occur in this country as \nan excuse to continue to ring out costs from health, transportation, \nand education.\n  As my colleagues know, I feel very strongly about this issue, and I \nam proud to say I think many Democrats and, hopefully, some Republicans \nfeel strongly that their constituents at home should come first, that \nthe budget should provide for an immediate response when people are \nvictims of floods or tornadoes or hurricanes or other disasters.\n  I think most people in the Senate understand 2011 was a tough year. \nIt was a historic year. But the sad thing is, I think we also \nunderstand it could repeat itself. Using these disasters, when it was \nnot the case for the war in Iraq, was not the case for the war in \nAfghanistan, was not the case for Medicare, was not the case for the \nrebate checks--but when it comes to disasters we cannot seem to find \n$8.1 billion within the budget control structure. I do not, as I said, \nunderstand it.\n  We have seen this cartoon I have in the Chamber before. I will not go \ninto it. But I think it says beautifully why this is the wrong \napproach. Again, these pictures speak a thousand words. This other \nchart shows what a disaster looks like. I wish I had something to show \nwhat it feels like to lose everything, and then, when you have lost \neverything, trying to provide confidence to your own family, to your \nown children, and to your neighbors, to then listen to the debate in \nCongress that says: We write a blank check to Iraq, a blank check to \nAfghanistan, a blank check here, and yet, when it comes to funding for \ndisasters, we have to have this argument.\n  I am going to ask my colleagues to vote no on H. Con. Res. 94 \ntomorrow. In voting no, we will reject to the find-the-offset-now \nrequirement. We will honor the agreement made between Republican and \nDemocratic leaders back in August to include this in the Budget Control \nAct. We will send a powerful signal to our constituents that they come \nfirst; that disaster victims should come first in the budget, not last; \nthat we understand how difficult it is for them to rebuild their \ncommunities, and the Federal Government wants to be and will be a \nreliable partner they can depend on in their time of need.\n  With this ill-advised resolution, we return to an issue that consumed \nthis Chamber for weeks this past fall.\n  That issue is how we pay for disaster funding--money used by \ncommunities destroyed by disasters that are struggling to clean up, \nrebuild, and move on with their lives after a tragic act of Mother \nNature.\n  We have seen many such events over the past few years--from historic \nfloods in the Midwest, to deadly tornadoes in the South, to the \nwreckage inflicted on a huge swath of the country earlier this year by \nHurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee.\n  Back in September, Republicans in the House stood in the way of this \ncritical recovery money, arguing that no funds should be sent to \ndisaster victims until Congress had figured out how to pay for it \nthrough other cuts.\n  That is bad enough on its face. But what made it even more ridiculous \nis\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\nthat this Congress had already agreed on a method for funding \ndisasters. That agreement came over the summer when we passed the \nBudget Control Act--a measure that received significant support from \nDemocrats and Republicans in both Chambers of Congress.\n  That act included two contingency funds--funds that could be spent \nabove and beyond the established cap on Federal spending. One of those \nfunds was for overseas contingencies like the wars and rebuilding in \nIraq and Afghanistan that allows for $126 billion in spending above the \ncap. The other was for disaster relief and included an $11.3 billion \ncap adjustment for additional spending beyond the regular level.\n  We made this agreement because we recognized that there is a real \ncost associated with disaster recovery--a cost that can't always be \nanticipated because natural disasters, by their very nature, are highly \nunpredictable.\n  The stand-alone disaster funding bill we consider today, when \ncombined with the minibus passed last month, will account for $10.4 \nbillion of that $11.3 billion disaster funding cap--an amount \ncompletely within the requirements laid out in the bipartisan Budget \nControl Act.\n  But now, House Republicans are once again trying to go back on that \nagreement by requiring that agreed-upon funding be offset with \nadditional across-the-board cuts to discretionary spending.\n  There are two reasons this is wrong-headed.\n  Reason No. 1: The House Republicans are creating a double standard \nregarding offsets--one for defense spending and another for domestic \ndisaster relief.\n  That is because, in this proposal, they only require an additional \noffset for domestic disaster spending. They have sent over no such \nlanguage for the additional funding provided in the bill we just voted \non for overseas contingencies.\n  Let's get to the heart of what that means. It means that House \nRepublicans are saying: No, we don't have to pay for wars in places \nlike Afghanistan or Iraq. But we do have to offset spending for \ndomestic disaster recovery.\n  Why is that? Why is it that the House Republicans say we are able to \nrebuild Iraq or Afghanistan without a single word of protest, but we \nwon't rebuild Vermont or New Jersey or Missouri or Louisiana in a \nsimilar way?\n  The omnibus bill has $126 billion in it for the costs of the wars. If \nwe followed the same pay-for standard that the House Republicans are \ninsisting on for disaster relief on the costs of the war, we would have \nto impose a 24-percent across-the-board cut on the Defense budget or a \n12-percent cut on the entire discretionary budget.\n  This double standard makes no sense. I remind my colleagues that when \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita struck the gulf coast, it required \nappropriations of more than $62 billion in fiscal year 2005 alone. If \nwe applied the House Republican requirement to pay for a disaster of a \nsimilar size, we would have to cut domestic spending by 12 percent.\n  During the 112th Congress, we have not cut defense. We have not \nincreased taxes on individuals who make more than $1 million a year. \nBut the House Republicans want to keep going back to this one small \npart of the budget to find savings.\n  So, let's be clear. Here is what the Republicans do not require \npayment for: Iraq war, $823 billion; Afghanistan war, $557 billion; \nMedicare drug benefit, $180 billion; and Bush rebate checks, $124 \nbillion.\n  Now, you ask, what do they require payment for? Community disaster \nrelief, $8.1 billion.\n  Reason No. 2 of why the House Republicans' plan should be firmly \nrejected: The House Republicans' plan wouldn't require true across-the-\nboard cuts to pay for disaster spending. It would only require cuts to \ndomestic discretionary spending--a portion of the government that makes \nup only 14 percent of total expenditures.\n  In April, we cut domestic discretionary spending for fiscal year 2011 \nby 7 percent. And the omnibus legislation before the Senate, consistent \nwith the Budget Control Act, cuts it by an additional 1 percent.\n  This proposal--the one we are currently considering--would pile on to \nthat by cutting another 1.8 percent to domestic programs.\n  I think we need to be clear about exactly what this would mean. There \nare consequences to these cuts--real consequences that the American \npeople would feel immediately.\n  Among them, it means that Title I education funding would be cut by \n$265 million. That means that almost 1,000 schools serving more than \n350,000 disadvantaged students could lose funding, and about 3,700 \nteachers and aides could lose their jobs.\n  It means that special education funding would be cut by $199 million. \nThat could lead to the loss of 2,600 education staff serving special \nneeds students.\n  It means a $146 million cut to Head Start funding, which would \neliminate 11,000 low-income students and their families from this \ncritical program.\n  It would mean a reduction of 400 Border Patrol agents--nearly half \nthe number that we hired and trained since Congress enacted the border \nsecurity supplemental 16 months ago.\n  It would mean that 161,000 fewer women, infants, and children would \nreceive food assistance under the WIC program.\n  It would hurt our efforts to combat terrorism and crime, with more \nthan 5,500 Department of Justice positions becoming vacant through a \nhiring freeze and furloughs.\n  It would mean a cut to the IRS enforcement mission, resulting in lost \nrevenues of approximately $4 billion annually. That would increase the \ndeficit by at least six times the magnitude of the proposed reduction.\n  It would mean a $15 million cut to the senior nutrition program, \nwhich means 2 million fewer meals to needy seniors.\n  The House Republicans would like you to think that these cuts are \nnothing more than reducing bureaucracy. I beg to differ. These cuts \nhave consequences in the everyday lives of Americans across our Nation.\n  Here is the bottom line: Instead of being really serious about \nclosing the budget gap and putting new revenues on the table or saying \nacross-the-board cuts for everything, House Republicans continue to use \neverything, even disasters that strike home, as an excuse to cut \nhealth, education, and transportation.\n  Well, I stand here today and say to them: Enough is enough.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution. This Congress \nmade an agreement months ago on how to fund unanticipated disasters. We \nshould stick with that agreement.\n  There are times and there are places for politics. Aid for disaster \nvictims is not one of them. Victims of natural disasters should not be \nvictimized twice--first by Mother Nature and then by politics in \nWashington.\n  There may be another expression of a different side of this argument. \nI have not heard a good one yet. But I look forward--if any of my \ncolleagues want to come down and take the opposite side of this \nargument, I am around. I am not going anywhere. I will be here today. I \nwill be here tomorrow. I will be happy to debate them on the floor on \nthis subject. But as the chair of the Homeland Security Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I have to take a strong stand on this issue because our \nbudget is the one that basically gets called on to fund these \ndisasters.\n  Again, if I have to follow the requirement to fund them in the year \nthe money is spent--1 year--I am going to have to come to this floor \nand tell everyone: We are not going to have a homeland security bill \nthis year because we just had a category 5 strike Miami, and the bill--\nas they said last night on the Weather Channel--will exceed $40 \nbillion. So I am going to have to give up our whole bill, and we will \nhave no security for the United States to pay for the disaster in 1 \nyear.\n  This is the chart I wanted to show. This is how erratic funding can \nbe, as shown on this chart. This shows funding from 2003 to 2012. In \n2003, we spent basically a little over $1.7 billion. Then it jumped up \nto a little over $6 billion. Then, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma--which was \nin Florida--moved us all the way up to $45 billion in 2005, and then we \nfell back again to about $7.8 billion. We can see the erratic nature of \nthese storms. It is impossible for us to even get a good average. So \nthe only thing we can do is put a baseline in our bill, and then if \ndisaster strikes, to respond and put it in the Budget Control Act over \nour 302(b) allocations.\n  If we do not do it that way, we are going to end up having to \nscramble\n\n[[Page S8711]]\n\nevery year to quickly calculate what the disasters were last year and \njam it against some budget. It is either going to be education that \ngets gutted or health that gets gutted or agriculture that gets gutted \nor homeland security. I do not want to have to be the one to call the \nthousands of Border Patrol agents whom I have helped to fund in my \nbudget or have to call Senator John McCain or Senator Kyl and say: I am \nsorry. We have to lay off all the Border Patrol agents along the border \nin Arizona for a year or two because we had a big storm in Miami, and I \nhave to send the money to Miami.\n  Whoever heard of such a thing. That is what the Republicans in the \nHouse have sent to us. It should be rejected on its face. There is a \nbetter way to move forward, and the way is in the Budget Control Act \nthat our leaders wisely have already agreed to.\n  So we will have this vote tomorrow. Again, I think I have raised \nthree excellent points about why the House approach is wrong and why \nour approach is correct. If someone wants to come and debate it, I will \nbe happy to maybe try to explain it a little bit more.\n  I can understand some on the other side who say: We have to find a \nway to pay for it, even if we have already negotiated, et cetera, but \nwhen the other side refuses to put even a new penny on the table to \nhelp with some of these things, it makes it even harder to achieve what \nwe are trying to achieve.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I hope my colleagues will hear these \narguments and let me know if there is anything further we can explain \non it. But I think the picture says a thousand words.\n  I will close with this again: No American should have to sit on their \nroof, while the water rises, and identify an offset to finance their \nown rescue. We are a stronger nation than that. We are a bigger nation \nthan that. We most certainly can provide the funding for FEMA, for the \nCorps of Engineers, and other funding in the way our Budget Control Act \nstipulates in this budget.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here to urge that my colleagues in \nCongress and the Obama administration provide the funding for the Low-\nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program or LIHEAP. As you know, in \nConnecticut, LIHEAP provides immediate critical heating assistance for \nfamilies and seniors in need during these freezing cold winter months.\n  Last year, more than 45,000 New Hampshire households received LIHEAP \nfunds. That is more than 106,000 individuals. But unfortunately this \nyear, many of those families have been on waiting lists. Funding for \nthe program has been in limbo at a time when temperatures are dropping.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services here in Washington has \nreleased $1.7 billion, but so much more is needed. Making matters \nworse, the Energy Information Administration projects a 10-percent \nincrease in the price of heating oil this winter. That is the highest \naverage winter price ever predicted.\n  In New Hampshire, more than half our homes rely on home heating oil. \nIt is one of the highest percentages in the country, and the number of \nfamilies who need assistance is growing every day. State offices are \nbeing forced to change eligibility levels for funding as they grapple \nwith uncertainty over future funds.\n  There are two things that can be done in order to immediately address \nthis situation before it escalates into an even more serious crisis. \nFirst, Congress needs to pass an Omnibus appropriations bill as soon as \npossible. I am very pleased to see the positive progress on this issue; \nthat there has been an agreement announced on an Omnibus appropriations \nmeasure.\n  Hopefully, we are on track to pass that bill either today or \ntomorrow. The omnibus includes nearly $3.5 billion in funding for \nLIHEAP. But we need to get that money out the door. Once Congress has \nspoken, is that the administration needs to release additional LIHEAP \nfunds as quickly as possible.\n  The $1.7 billion that has already been released is not enough. But \nthe knowledge that additional LIHEAP funds are pending in the omnibus \nbill we are about to pass should give President Obama the assurance he \nneeds to release more money. I hope once the budget is passed the \nadministration will release these additional funds as soon as possible, \nbecause at this holiday season, what better gift could we provide to \nthose families in need than to make sure they have the funds to keep \ntheir houses warm this season.\n  I know it is difficult to argue for more funding these days because \nof our deficit. Its challenges are clear. In fact, in the Senate, we \nhave already voted, and I was one of those votes, for more than $1 \ntrillion in cuts to Federal spending this year.\n  I have continued to call for a comprehensive, balanced, bipartisan \nplan that looks at both revenue flows and spending. I have been part of \nthe working group, a bipartisan working group, that now has over 40 \nSenators calling for a $4 trillion deficit reduction proposal over the \nnext 10 years. But when we cut our budget, we need to look at wasteful \nspending, at duplicative programs, and at subsidies to industries that \nno longer need our help.\n  LIHEAP energy assistance for low-income families does not fall under \nany of those categories. It is not a frivolous program. It is a program \nthat ensures that vulnerable citizens in New Hampshire and across this \ncountry are not forgotten and left in the cold this winter.\n  I have been hearing from people across New Hampshire about the \ndifficulties they are going to face if this funding is not available \nand available soon. I wish to just share one of those stories. It is \nthe story of Kim Brandolini of Nashua. In 2010, Kim suffered a series \nof strokes that left her disabled and unable to work. LIHEAP funds \ncovered nearly all her monthly fuel costs last year.\n  But this year, because of the cuts, she is on the waiting list. She \ndoes not know how she is going to pay to heat her home. She already \nowes the oil company $600, and last year she had to pay $6,000 to \nreplace a broken boiler. Kim is only 44 years old. She is raising a son \nall by herself. Previously, she served for 14 years in the Army \nReserve. Kim does not deserve to be in this situation.\n  In Nashua, which is one of the warmest parts of New Hampshire, the \naverage nightly low is below freezing for nearly half the year.\n  If we don't find a way to fund LIHEAP now, Kim and thousands like her \nwill have no way to keep their families safe and warm. We need to act, \nand we need to act quickly. Already, the delay in funding LIHEAP has \nprevented States such as New Hampshire from taking advantage of more \naffordable bulk purchases of home heating oil. The bottom line is, now \nthat we have a budget agreement, we need to release additional funds so \nthat thousands of New Hampshire families stay warm and don't have to \nmake impossible choices between their basic needs this winter. We can't \nleave families such as Kim Brandolini's out in the cold this winter. I \nhope we can get this budget passed as soon as possible and that the \nObama administration will release additional LIHEAP funds before \nChristmas and the end of the year.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8711-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8711-S8715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to address the Senate on the \nsubject of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which has been reported to be part \nof the proposed package that would contain the extension of the payroll \ntax holiday and the expiring unemployment insurance benefits.\n\n[[Page S8712]]\n\n  There have been some who have raised questions about the pipeline and \nsome who have said they object to it being included in the package, but \nI would like to hopefully shed a little light--maybe not so much heat--\non the subject, coming from a State such as mine, which is an energy-\nproducing state. We are very familiar with the oil and gas pipelines \nand the safety measures that need to be undertaken to keep them safe \nand to keep them from contaminating the environment. This is not some \nsort of alien technology or something the industry does not have the \nexpertise to deal with in a safe and secure and appropriate manner.\n  The legislation that is being proposed in the payroll tax holiday \nwould require the Secretary of State to issue a Presidential permit \nwithin 60 days of enactment--and this does not take the President out \nof the equation--unless the President publicly determines this project \nis not in the national interest. So if for some reason--really beyond \nmy comprehension--President Obama were to determine that building this \npipeline was not in the public's interest, he could, under the terms of \nthis legislation, essentially veto it. But once the permit is approved, \nTransCanada would be able to start construction on parts of the project \noutside of Nebraska.\n  Now, why outside of Nebraska? As you may recall, Mr. President, a \nnumber of people in Nebraska, including their leadership here in the \nSenate, had concerns about the route of the TransCanada pipeline, the \nKeystone XL Pipeline within Nebraska itself, but Nebraska's leaders \nhave taken it upon themselves to come up with a new route, which they \nwill do in order to satisfy concerns about contamination of the aquifer \nin that State.\n  The one point I would like to emphasize is that we have been talking \nfor a long time--since the financial crisis in September of 2008--about \nwhat we need to do to get our economy back on track and to create jobs. \nIndeed, there was a lot of discussion back during the passage of the \nstimulus that we needed shovel-ready jobs. But, as you will recall, \nthere were a lot of things that went into the stimulus that did not \ninclude infrastructure development. In fact, infrastructure was \ncomprised only of a very small fraction of what the spending on the \nstimulus actually did.\n  First of all, let me make clear what we are talking about. This chart \ndemonstrates the existing Keystone Pipeline. In other words, there is \nalready a Keystone Pipeline, but it goes from Alberta, Canada, and \nterminates in Illinois. That is the orange line. So what we are really \ntalking about is an extension and expansion of the Keystone Pipeline, \nand it terminates in Port Arthur and Houston, TX, where we have the \nrefinery capacity to make it into gasoline, jet fuel, and the like. So \nthis is the proposed route, as you can see, of the expansion. It hooks \nup in Steele City, NE, with the existing pipeline going down to \nCushing, OK, but then the expansion would be down into Houston and Port \nArthur.\n  I think this is another educational document. These actually are the \ncrude oil and refined product pipelines that currently exist in the \nUnited States. So lest anybody feel as if we are doing something new \nand novel that has never been done, let me try to disabuse them of that \nnotion.\n  As you can see, this is a huge spider's web of oil and gas and \nrefined product pipelines throughout the United States. Not \nsurprisingly, you see a lot of them concentrated down in my State of \nTexas but, importantly, a good portion of that pipeline traffic \nemanates from our No. 1 trading partner in the world, Canada, which is \na friend and an ally and a safe source of oil and gas into the United \nStates. As to some people who perhaps wonder about this pipeline and \nwonder what it all means, this will help allay any concerns or some \nconcerns they might have that we are somehow doing something novel or \nrisky or that we have not done in the past.\n  Pipelines are simply one mode of transporting oil and gas. You can do \nit other ways. You can put it on a tanker truck and drive it down our \nhighways. I happen to think this is a better and safer way to do it \nthan loading up a bunch of tanker trucks to drive down our highways. \nYou can do it through barges, through our inland waterways. But the \npipeline is simply the most efficient and safest way of doing it.\n  Of course, as we all know, these pipelines are by and large buried \nand more or less unseen. So this is a transportation network for our \nNation's oil and gas that most people probably are not even aware of, \nand I guess that is a good thing, but it is important that people \nunderstand what we are talking about.\n  These pipelines move crude oil from oilfields on land and offshore to \nrefineries, where it is turned into fuels and other products.\n  You can see down here in the Gulf of Mexico, for example, where we \nhave tremendous reserves of oil and gas. You can see how the pipelines \nextend even beneath the water out into the Gulf of Mexico.\n  These pipelines move crude oil to refineries, where it is turned into \nfuels and other products, and then from the refineries to terminals, \nwhere fuels are trucked to retail outlets. One amazing thing about this \nis this literally happens 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, out of sight \nand out of mind to most Americans.\n  Let's talk a minute about safety because this is something on which \nno one has an exclusive claim when it comes to our environmental and \nsafety concerns. Under the law, any spill associated with one of these \npipelines has to be reported--a spill of 5 gallons or more--to the \nDepartment of Transportation. There are already a number of Federal \nagencies that regulate this industry, including the U.S. Pipeline and \nHazardous Materials Safety Administration, the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency, and the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  Once this oil gets to the refineries, the U.S. refining sector has \ninvested a lot of money upgrades throughout the country to adapt to the \nworld's changing oil supply, including the increasing percentage of the \nworld's oil that is so-called heavy crude. My understanding is that \nwhat comes out of the oil sands in Canada is heavy crude which requires \na little different refining capability. But refineries in the U.S. gulf \nregion have long received heavy crude from other countries and are \nwell-positioned to receive and to handle these supplies from Canada.\n  I think it is important for us to also contemplate not just the \neconomic aspects of this source of oil to be consumed here in America \nbut also that it is not dependent, for example, on imported oil from \nthe Middle East and subject to weather conditions or hostile \nenvironments that might otherwise cause economic and national security \nconcerns here in America.\n  We hear from time to time that Iran, which we know has growing \naspirations for regional influence in the Middle East--and now, with \nthe end of America's involvement in the Iraq war, we know Iran is going \nto rush in to try to fill some of that vacuum there, and I am concerned \nabout it. But more to the point today is that 90 percent of the Persian \nGulf's oil exports and 40 percent of the global seaborne oil trade goes \nthrough the Straits of Hormuz, which would be a logical first place for \nthe Iranian Government to choke off--should they decide to create \nhavoc--the oil supply through that vital area. The Straits of Hormuz, \nof course, is very important in a geopolitical sense.\n  The point I am simply trying to make is that this is not only a \nmatter of jobs--but it is a matter of jobs in America with the \nconstruction of this pipeline--it is not just a matter of how we \nprotect our environment, which is very important--how do we regulate \nthis industry in a way that protects the health, safety, and welfare of \nthe American people--but this is a national security issue as well.\n\n  It is also very important in terms of simply the price of gasoline. I \nam not an economist by training, but I do understand that when there is \nmore of something and given that there is stable demand, you will be \nable to lower the price when there is a greater supply. It is purely a \nmatter of supply and demand.\n  I looked online at the price of gasoline a year ago. It was $2.98 for \nthe price of a gallon of regular gasoline. Today it is about 27 cents \nhigher. Of course, it has been much higher, as you know. But my point \nis that this is a stable and secure source of oil used to make gasoline \nand other refined petroleum products that will help bring down or at \nleast stabilize the price of gasoline for consumers.\n\n[[Page S8713]]\n\n  We all know that in the current economic environment, people are \nliving under much more constrained circumstances. They are having to \nmake choices that I wish the Federal Government would make more often; \nthat is, what things you have to have today, what things you would like \nto have but you can put off until tomorrow, and what things you maybe \nwould like to have but you are going to have to end up doing without \nbecause you simply cannot afford it.\n  Well, gasoline is something people need in order to drive their kids \nto school or drive to work, and the increased price of gasoline because \nof geopolitical uncertainty, because of concerns about supply, \ndisasters such as we had in the Gulf of Mexico--all of those cause \ndisruptions or concerns about disruptions in supply that cause gas \nprices to go up. So this is another good reason why I believe we need a \nstable source of additional oil and, again, from a friendly nation, our \nNo. 1 trading partner, which is Canada.\n  Let me just quickly go over a few other little factoids that people \nmight find interesting. This is a $7 billion project. As I said, it is \nthe largest shovel-ready infrastructure project in the United States \ncurrently. It has been under review by the Federal Government for 3 \nyears. This is not some knee-jerk or impulsive decision we are asking \nto be made here; this is something that has been carefully reviewed for \nits environmental impact.\n  The good news at a time when unemployment remains unacceptably high \nis that this project is estimated to cause the creation of about 20,000 \njobs. We all know that the No. 1 problem in America today is that too \nmany people are out of work, the No. 2 problem in America today is that \ntoo many people are out of work, and the No. 3 problem in America today \nis that too many people are out of work. This would create jobs at a \ntime when we sorely need them, and that is why this project has gained \nthe kind of bipartisan support that gives me great hope that we will \nsomehow knock down the impediments to building this pipeline so we can \nget people back to work and we can get that stable oil supply and \ncreate economic development in the private sector when we need it \nmost. It is estimated this pipeline would ultimately generate about \n$20.9 billion in new private sector spending. We all know that with the \nFederal Government revenue down around 15 percent of our GDP because of \nthe recession and slow economy, while spending is up around 25 percent \nof GDP, we need to do two things: We need to cut Federal spending, and \nwe also need to increase growth in the private sector which will \nproduce additional revenue to the Treasury and help us close that \ndeficit gap and begin to chip away at the debt. This pipeline and the \njobs it would create and the tax revenues that would be generated will \nhelp do that.\n\n  This is also important to our relationship with our trading partner \nCanada. As the Presiding Officer knows, the North American Free Trade \nAgreement is a big deal in my State of Texas because of the trade \nagreements between Canada and the United States and Mexico. But this \nrecognizes that our trading relationship with Canada is literally the \nmost important one in the United States. There is something in it for \nus as well in that for every dollar the United States spends on \nCanadian products, 91 cents is returned to the United States. There is \na close economic security relationship between the United States and \nCanada.\n  This pipeline would also encourage development of additional oil \nresources in the northern part of the United States. North Dakota \ncurrently has I believe somewhere on the order of 3 or 4 percent \nunemployment. One reason why it does is because they have discovered--I \ncan get a confirmation from Senator Hoeven, perhaps, but one reason why \nNorth Dakota has been booming, in addition to great leadership, has \nbeen the fact that the Bakken formation there has been the source of a \nhuge supply of oil. Of course, building this pipeline would help \nfurther enhance the ability to develop domestic oil and gas resources \nand put them in the pipeline and get them to the refinery and get them \nto market.\n  This is one of the big dangers I think we also need to highlight: In \na world where we are so interconnected and where there are so many \noptions available to our trading partners such as Canada, the fact is \nif we don't create this pipeline expansion for markets where these \nproducts come into the United States, then Canada is going to sell it \nto China or other parts of the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May I remind the Senator that we are operating \nunder a 10-minute time limit. The Senator has consumed 17 minutes and \nthere is now another Senator on the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for another 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. This is as close to a no-brainer as I think we can \nidentify. But this also particularly benefits my State of Texas, which \nI am honored to represent. TransCanada's direct investment of about \n$1.6 million in Texas for the construction and development of the \npipeline will lead to gains in business activity in the State of Texas \nof an estimated $2.3 billion in total expenditures and $2 billion in \noutput. The increased economic activity stimulated by the TransCanadian \ninvestment in Texas will generate tax receipts in construction of an \nestimated $41.1 million to the State and $7.7 million to local taxing \nentities. Once these facilities are completed, they will have a useful \nlife estimated at not less than 100 years. Using reasonable assumptions \nregarding valuation and tax rates, these assets are estimated to yield \nmore than $1.1 billion in property taxes to local governments in the \nState, which are the primary source of funds for public education, \namong other things.\n  I recognize the distinguished Senator from North Dakota is here on \nthe floor and I wish to yield to him. I appreciate the opportunity to \naddress this issue. I would point out that this project has strong \nbipartisan support. I invite my colleagues--who perhaps are not as \nfamiliar with the importance of this pipeline project to the economy of \nthe United States and job creation and who may not be aware that this \nis nothing new; this is something we have done before in a safe and \nenvironmentally responsible way--to join us and perhaps reconsider \ntheir view so we can get this done and help get 20,000 Americans back \nto work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the subject of the \nKeystone Pipeline. I am pleased to follow my esteemed colleague from \nthe great State of Texas. I think it is only appropriate that I follow \nhim, both because I agree absolutely with his remarks and I think it \nshows the importance of this project to North Dakota and Texas and \nacross this country. This is an incredibly important project, so I am \npleased to be here again today to address it.\n\n\n                             Russell Evenmo\n\n  First of all, let me say it is nice to welcome Russell Evenmo to the \nfloor on his last day. He has done an outstanding job working for me. \nHe also has my chart, so I am glad we are able to get him on the floor.\n  The legislation we have authored on the Keystone Pipeline is included \nin the House package that provides an extension for the payroll tax \ncut. It is very appropriate that it is in that package, so I come today \nto talk about some misperceptions I am hearing out there in regard to \nthis legislation. The first is that somehow this is an add-on to the \npayroll tax holiday extension legislation which some think shouldn't be \nthere. I wish to address that, because it is absolutely where it should \nbe. It is a jobs bill. The extension of the payroll tax cut, the \npayroll tax holiday, is about helping to create more jobs in this \ncountry. It is about helping people who are out there working hard \nevery day. It is about stimulating economic activity. It is a tax \nreduction to help get this economy going and to help get people back to \nwork.\n  Keystone is a jobs bill. It belongs in a jobs package. This is a jobs \npackage. This is about creating jobs. It creates jobs without the \nFederal Government spending 1 penny. In fact, this will generate \nhundreds of millions of dollars of State and local tax revenues. It \nwill generate private investment, but it will create jobs. This is a \njobs package. So I wish to address that misperception I have heard from \ntime to time and respond that this does belong as part of a jobs \npackage. Of course it does. This is how we create jobs.\n\n[[Page S8714]]\n\n  I appreciate greatly the esteemed Senator from Texas speaking about \nsome of the things that are going on in North Dakota, and he is \nabsolutely right; Texas has a long history with the energy industry. \nNorth Dakota is increasingly becoming a stronger and stronger energy \nplayer in all types of energy. We have wind; we have hydro; we have \nbiofuels; we have biomass; we have solar. We are now the fourth largest \noil-producing State in the country. Next year we will be the third \nlargest oil-producing State in the country behind only Alaska and, of \ncourse, No. 1, Texas. But to do that, we need infrastructure. We need \nto be able to transport our oil--oil that we produce--to the refineries \naround the country. We will put 100,000 barrels of oil a day that we \nproduce in North Dakota into this pipeline and get it down into the \ngulf refineries. So this isn't just about moving Canadian crude into \nthe U.S; this is about moving our own domestic product as well.\n  As the Senator from Texas may have explained, there is a backlog of \noil in Cushing right now, which is a hub for oil. But we need to move \nthat oil from Cushing, in Oklahoma, down to the refineries in Texas and \nLouisiana. This pipeline will move that product to these refineries. \nSo, again, it is not just about moving Canadian crude into the United \nStates; this is about moving product throughout the United States as \nwell where we have serious bottlenecks. When we have those bottlenecks, \nour producers in North Dakota get less. They face a discount. If the \nproduct has to move by rail or by truck, we suffer a discount. That \naffects not only the oil companies themselves but it also affects the \nindividual producers, the mineral owners who get royalty payments. This \nis about truly creating economic activity.\n  The first point I want to emphasize is that this is absolutely--is \nand should be--part of this jobs package.\n\n  The second point I want to talk about for a minute is that the \nconcern has been expressed that somehow we are rushing this process. \nSomehow we are not taking enough time in terms of approving this \npipeline, so maybe that could create an environmental concern. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. We are taking more time than we did \nfor almost the exact same project that has already been approved.\n  This red line here on this chart is the Keystone Pipeline. The \nKeystone Pipeline runs from Alberta, Canada, down to Patoka, IL. It \nbrings product down to refineries in the United States. That pipeline \nhas not only been approved but it has been built. It moves 590,000 \nbarrels a day of oil from the Alberta, Canada area down to our \nrefineries. That has been approved and built, and we are moving almost \n600,000 barrels of oil today. This is the Keystone XL project, right \nnext to it--a very similar project.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the timeline on this as well. I was \nformerly the Governor of North Dakota. While I was Governor, \nTransCanada built the Keystone Pipeline and now they are working to \nbuild the Keystone XL Pipeline. Let's walk through that timeline for a \nminute. First let's start with the Keystone Pipeline. That project \ninitially applied for a permit on April 19, 2006. The final \nenvironmental impact statement was issued 2 years later--actually less \nthan 2 years later. It was issued on January 11, 2008. So in less than \n2 years, this project, very similar--in less than 2 years they got a \nfinal environmental impact statement. And amazingly enough, within 60 \ndays after that final environmental impact statement it was signed off \non and approved by the State Department. It had final approval. So it \nall happened within a 2-year process for that project.\n  Now let's talk about the Keystone XL project. Keystone XL: \nTransCanada, the same company, is building it. The same company is \nbuilding both projects. They filed for a State Department Presidential \npermit in September 2008. That is when they filed for their permit. \nThey went through the whole process. They got a final environmental \nimpact statement on August 26, 2011--3 years.\n  The first project, the whole project was approved in less than 2 \nyears. This project, we have already been at it for 3 years. So people \nare saying this is rushing--somehow rushing the project. Almost an \nidentical project, fully approved from start to finish in 2 years, and \nwe are sitting here 3 years later, and we don't even have approval yet, \nand we are rushing the process somehow.\n  Furthermore, the Department of State indicated that after all this \nenvironmental work--after 3 years of environmental work the State \nDepartment said, We are going to have a decision out before year end, \nmeaning now. Before the end of this year, the State Department says, we \nare going to have a decision.\n  So myself and others who have been working on this say: Well, that is \ngreat. Finally, we are going to get a decision. Then all of a sudden \nthe administration says: No, no, we are not going to have a decision. \nWe are going to need another 18 months. We are going to need another 18 \nmonths somehow because there is concern about the route through \nNebraska. That was the concern.\n  So the State of Nebraska then--let's make sure I have my dates \nright--then said: OK, we are concerned in Nebraska. But we are going to \naddress the problem. We are going to solve the problem. The State of \nNebraska had a special session on November 1 of this year, which \nconcluded on November 22. In their special session, they agreed that \nthey would reroute the Keystone XL Pipeline as to the route in \nNebraska. The concern was that it went through western Nebraska, what \nis called the Ogallala Aquifer or the sandhills region. There is a lot \nof irrigation there. Even though there are other pipelines there, they \nsaid: We do not want it in that part, so we will agree to reroute the \npipeline in Nebraska.\n  All this legislation provides, the legislation we have written--and \nthere have been other bills on this--but the legislation included in \nthe House package we are working to get passed in the Senate, here is \nwhat it says: 60 days after the bill is passed, the President, through \nthe Department of State, has to make a determination on whether this \nproject is in the national interest. They do not have to say yes. They \ncan say yes or they can say no, but they have to determine whether it \nis in the national interest--60 days after the bill is passed.\n  But as to the Nebraska piece, we say, Nebraska's Department of \nEnvironmental Quality will work with EPA and the State Department and \ntake the time they need to reroute in Nebraska. Because that was the \nconcern. It does not set a timeline on how fast they have to do it. It \nsays: You have the time you need to reroute and address the concern \nthat was raised.\n  This legislation is all about solving the concern that was raised so \nthis project can go forward. It does not set a timeline on it. Again, \nwhere is this rush that it could somehow create an environmental issue? \nIt is not there.\n  The point is this: If we do not pursue this project, this oil will \nstill be produced--700,000 barrels a day--700,000 barrels a day of \nCanadian crude. It will still be produced. But instead of coming down \nto our refineries in the United States, instead of creating jobs in the \nUnited States, instead of reducing our dependence on oil from the \nMiddle East, the oil is going to China. That pipeline, instead of going \nsouth, will go west. The product will be put on oil tankers and it will \ngo to Chinese refineries. In the Chinese refineries there will be \nhigher emissions, lower environmental standards. So you are going to \nhave more emissions, more environmental impacts.\n  Again, I come back to the point: Are we going to create more energy \nindependence for ourselves, are we going to create more jobs here, or \nare we going to send that product to China? Because that is the choice. \nThat is the real choice. Do you want to deal with reality, real terms? \nThat is the choice we face.\n  Look, this project is about creating jobs. It belongs in a bill that \nis about creating jobs. This--and I will wrap up, Mr. President--\nlegislation is about reducing our dependence on oil from the Middle \nEast--700,000 barrels a day--not to mention the product it helps my \nState of North Dakota, Montana, and others move down to our refineries \nin Texas and Louisiana.\n  With this pipeline, we will have better environmental stewardship, \nnot worse. This is a project on which we need to move forward. We have \ndrafted this legislation. We have worked on a\n\n[[Page S8715]]\n\nbipartisan basis to get legislation that addresses the concerns. It is \ntime to move forward. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to talk on a number of issues, but \nI would tell my friend from North Dakota, I very strongly disagree with \nhim about this Keystone XL Pipeline. For those of us who are concerned \nabout global warming, and all of the destruction that is currently \ntaking place because of global warming, and will increase in years to \ncome, this Keystone XL project is exactly what we should not be doing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8715-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Mr. President, before I get to the Keystone issue, I \nwant to suggest that at this particular moment, at the very end of the \ncongressional session, before the end of the year's work, it is a \nstrange moment in Congress because you have, behind closed doors, \nnegotiators from the House and the Senate--Republicans and Democrats--\ntrying to put together large and complicated bills, and the concern I \nhave--and I speak only for myself, but I think other Members in the \nSenate feel the same way--is we are suddenly going to be given a fait \naccompli, a complicated and long bill with many implications, many very \nimportant provisions, and then we are going to be asked to vote on it \nwith not having had much input into the bill or even the ability to \ndigest it fully and know what it means to our constituents.\n  Let me touch on some of the issues that concern me, and let me also \nsay that what I am going to be referring to are reports in the media. I \ndo not know what will be in the final product. I am not sure anybody \ndoes. But here is some of what the media is reporting that might be in \nthe payroll holiday tax bill--or what might not be in it, for that \nmatter.\n  One of the issues I believe very strongly about is that at a time \nwhen the middle class is disappearing, when poverty is increasing, and \nwhen more and more Americans understand that the wealthiest people are \ndoing phenomenally well, and yet their effective tax rate is the lowest \nin decades--an issue Warren Buffett keeps reminding us about--that it \nis almost definitely going to be the case that while we continue to cut \nprograms or raise revenue from the middle class and working families, \nthe wealthiest people in this country will continue to avoid paying \nanymore in taxes. So we have a situation where the effective tax rates \non the wealthiest people in this country are the lowest in decades, and \nyet, once again, as we talk about deficit reduction we are going to cut \nthis program, we are going to cut that program, and yet the wealthy--\nmillionaires and billionaires--are not going to be asked to pay one \nnickel more in taxes. I think that is wrong, and people should \nunderstand that in all likelihood that is exactly what will happen \nagain.\n  Furthermore, we have major corporations, companies on Wall Street, \noil companies that in recent years have made billions of dollars in \nprofit and yet have, in some cases, believe it or not, not paid one \nnickel in Federal corporate income tax because of a wide variety of \nloopholes.\n  We have a situation where we are losing tens and tens of billions of \ndollars--a hundred billion dollars--a year because of all kinds of tax \nhavens which exist in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, other countries. \nLarge corporations, wealthy individuals can shelter their money, not \npay taxes, and then the result is revenue declines in the United \nStates, and my friends in the Republican Party suggest: Cut this, cut \nthat, go after Social Security, go after Medicare, go after \nMedicaid, go after education, go after environmental protection. Yet \nonce again--once again--the wealthiest people in this country will not \npay a nickel more in taxes, large corporations will continue to enjoy \nhuge tax loopholes.\n\n  Second of all, as somebody who believes it is absolutely imperative \nthis country transform its energy system away from fossil fuel, away \nfrom greenhouse gas emissions, and moves to energy efficiency and \nsustainable energy, I am very concerned that in the legislation we will \nbe dealing with today or tomorrow--or Sunday or whenever--there will \nnot be an extension of important programs for renewable energy.\n  One of the most important is the 1603 renewable energy extender. This \nis a Treasury grant program which helps provide financing for renewable \nenergy projects by converting an existing tax credit into a grant.\n  This one program, which costs barely more than $1 billion, has \nleveraged $23 billion in private investments. It supports 22,000 \nrenewable energy projects in all 50 States of our country. It has \ncreated up to 290,000 jobs. If we do not include the 1603 program in \nlegislation, it will expire at the end of this year. What we have seen, \ntime and time again--whether it is wind, whether it is solar--is, if we \ndo not extend these programs, investments in these technologies \nsignificantly decline, we lose jobs, we lose our ability to compete \ninternationally in terms of becoming a leader in sustainable energy.\n  I hope very much what I am hearing in the media and other sources is \nnot correct. I hope, in fact, the 1603 Treasury grant program is \nincluded in any legislation that we vote on. That is an issue of major \nconcern to me.\n  We have today a declining middle class. We have 50 million people who \nhave no health insurance. We have a lot of elderly folks who, despite \nMedicare, pay a great deal of money out of their own pockets for health \ncare. What I am hearing--again, I do not know what will be in the final \npackage, but what some media reports suggest is, there are proposals \nout there to increase Medicare income-related premiums by 15 percent, \nstarting in 2017, and also that there are some ideas out there which \nwould decrease the income at which beneficiaries pay these income-\nrelated premiums to $80,000 for an individual and $160,000 for a \ncouple. What this would mean is that older people will have to pay more \nfor health care. In some cases they cannot afford to do that. I hope \nvery much that does not happen.\n  When we talk about Medicare in this country, we have to talk about \nthe overall health care crisis, which is not only that 50 million \npeople are uninsured, it is not only that health care costs for all \nhealth insurance companies are soaring--or virtually all of them--but \nwe have to ask why it is in the United States of America we end up \nspending almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the \npeople of any other country.\n  Yesterday in my office I had a member of the Australian Parliament. \nIn Australia, all people have health care as a right. Prescription drug \ncoverage is largely covered by the government. Their costs for \nprescription drugs are much lower because their national health care \nprogram negotiates prices with the drug companies. Yet in our country \nthe situation is very different.\n  What we want to do is not ask middle-income people to be paying more \nfor their health care at a time when many of them are paying already \nmore than they can afford. So the changes in Medicare which I have been \nreading about are something that concern me very much.\n  There is another area out there which I think will have profound \nimplications for our economy. The House Republican leadership passed a \nbill recently as part of this conference negotiation going on now to \nslash unemployment insurance in half and cut up to 40 weeks of \nunemployment benefits. If this legislation were to become law--and I \ncertainly hope it will not--it could lead to the loss of 140,000 jobs \nand hundreds of thousands of unemployed workers, who lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own, losing their benefits.\n  Here we have a situation where, in real terms, 25 million Americans \nare unemployed or underemployed, long-term unemployment is the longest \non record, we have more people who are experiencing long-term \nunemployment than at any other time we can remember, and the solution \nour Republican\n\n[[Page S8716]]\n\nfriends want to bring about--after fighting to make sure millionaires \nand billionaires are not asked to pay more in taxes--is to slash \nunemployment insurance in a very significant way.\n  Now, there is another issue dealing with employment above and beyond \nunemployment insurance; that is, that the House Republican bill, the \nideas that they are bringing into the conference, would freeze Federal \nemployee pay through 2015, and over a period of years reduce the \ncivilian workforce by 10 percent, cutting some 200,000 decent-paying \njobs.\n  Now, let's be clear. For Federal employees there has already been a \npay freeze for the last 2 years. Those are the nurses in our Veterans' \nAdministration hospitals. Those are people who are making $30,000, \n$40,000 a year. There is now a proposal to once again extend the freeze \nto them.\n  This is a real cut in real wages because inflation is going up for \nour Federal employees. But what concerns me equally is not only the \nimpact this freeze would have on Federal employees, it sends a signal \nto every employer in America who says: Well, yes, I know you guys have \nnot gotten a wage increase in a number of years. I know that I have \nasked you to pay more for health insurance. Yes, we have cut back on \nyour pensions. But guess what. In Washington, the Congress says they \nare going to once again, for the third year, freeze Federal pay. In \nfact, they are going to ask Federal employees to pay more, too, for \ntheir pensions, which means a cut for many Federal employees. Well, if \nthe Federal Government can do it, it says to private employers all over \nAmerica so can they.\n  One of the points President Obama has been making and why he last \nfought for a middle-class tax cut is that he wants to put more money \ninto the hands of working families. I understand that. I agree with \nthat concept. But what is the sense of providing tax breaks for the \nmiddle class on one hand--a concept which I support----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. What is the sense on one hand in saying, we need to put \nmoney in the hands of the middle class through a tax cut, and, on the \nother hand, send a green light to employers all over this country who \nwill now look at the Federal Government and then say to their \nemployees: Hey, the Federal Government has frozen wages for a third \nyear, cut back on pension programs, and we are going to do that as \nwell.\n  Lastly, but not least, for whatever reason, my Republican colleagues \nin the House have put into this mix of a payroll tax holiday a demand \nthat the Keystone XL tar sands project be completed; that the President \nbe forced, as I understand it, to make a decision on this within the \nnext several months.\n  The reality is that among many other factors, the inspector general \nof the State Department is currently investigating whether the State \nDepartment acted inappropriately in appointing a particular company to \ndo the environmental study which, amazingly enough, given the fact that \nI think they had a conflict of interest, ended up in a very positive \nlight.\n  So the inspector general is now looking at a conflict of interest \nissue in terms of the environmental study which will take a bit of \ntime. Furthermore, I think many of us understand that at a time when \ngreenhouse gas emissions are rising rapidly in this country and all \nover the world, at a time when virtually the entire scientific \ncommunity tells us that global warming is an enormously significant \nproblem for the future of our planet, at a time when we are seeing \nincreased floods and droughts and extreme weather disturbances, anyone \nwho has studied the issue understands that in terms of global warming, \nthe Keystone XL tar sands pipeline is a very dangerous project.\n  Producing energy-intensive tar sands oil emits 82 percent more carbon \npollution and contributes more to global warming than conventional oil, \naccording to the EPA.\n  With that, let me conclude but just suggest that I think we need to \nbe discussing publicly some of the issues that we may be voting on in a \nvery short period of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8716-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8716-S8717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FEDERAL DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we will be voting, I understand, on \nthree pieces of legislation from the House. One is a massive omnibus \nbill that would include 9 of the 13 appropriations bills that should be \nbrought up individually and voted on individually, with amendments on \neach one. They have all been cobbled together now at the end of the \nyear in one giant omnibus bill, with only a few hours for us to review \ntheir contents.\n  In addition, there will be a vote to offset certain emergency \nexpenditures--in other words, pay for these new expenditures with \nsavings elsewhere in the government rather than borrow the money for \nit--add to our debt for it. A third vote will be, in effect, to fund \nand appropriate the money that would be so offset or spend it by \nborrowing it if it is not offset.\n  I would just share with my colleagues one particular thing. The \nPresiding Officer, Senator Whitehouse, is on the Budget Committee, and \nour staff has looked at these budget numbers. I would just advise my \ncolleagues--I believe they should vote to offset the additional \nexpenditure. This is the reason: The Budget Control Act enacted this \nsummer was part of an effort where Republicans said: We will raise the \ndebt limit, but we want you to cut spending. We need to cut back on \nspending because we have had a series of deficits the likes of which \nthe Nation has never seen before. We have to do better. We need to \nreduce spending.\n  Our Democratic colleagues resisted. So when it was finally done, it \nwas a $900 billion-plus reduction in spending, which was to occur over \n10 years. Plus, the committee of 12 was supposed to find $1.2 trillion \nmore if they could. If they could not, there would be an automatic cut \nof that. So it would be about a $2.1 trillion savings over 10 years.\n  Experts have told us we need at least $4 trillion in savings over 10 \nyears, not $2 trillion. But it was a step in the right direction, and \nthat was the best that could be done under the circumstances. So the \nbill was passed. What I want to say is that under that legislation, it \nwas discovered that this year--the current fiscal year, that began \nOctober 1--we were going to spend $1.43 trillion instead of the $1.5 \ntrillion we spent last year. So there was a lot of heartburn and \ncomplaining. We are only cutting $7 billion out of the discretionary \nportion of our budget, not Social Security and Medicare, but other \nprograms that are going up every year: food stamps, college loans, Pell \ngrants.\n\n  So we were going to cut at least the discretionary accounts by $7 \nbillion, from $1.50 trillion to 1.43 billion. But I have to say, we are \nnot going to achieve that. Just as has so often been the case, we \npromise reductions in spending but do not get there. You would think \nthat we could find $7 billion. You would think that is not too much to \nask this government, that has been increasing spending at a substantial \nrate, to reduce spending a little bit.\n  In fact, in the first 2 years of President Obama's administration, \nnondefense discretionary spending went up 24 percent, a dramatic \nincrease. So to reduce spending and try to get this huge deficit under \ncontrol is not too much to ask, in my opinion. Indeed, we are borrowing \n40 percent of every dollar we spend. This year we will spend about $3.6 \ntrillion and take in about $2.2 trillion or $2.3 trillion. That is just \nnot any way to do business.\n  This will be the third straight year that has happened. So we were \nlooking for some improvement. I would just say to my colleagues, this \nis one little offset, $8 billion in additional spending, and it will \ndetermine whether we have any reduction in spending or whether, in \nfact, contrary to our promises this summer, we will spend more this \nyear than last year.\n  These are the numbers as we have calculated them from the Budget \nCommittee staff. The regular appropriations would be this year $1.43 \ntrillion, but they have added to it disaster and other spending of $11 \nbillion, which\n\n[[Page S8717]]\n\nwould mean we would be spending $1.54 trillion, more than the $1.50 \ntrillion we spent last year. We would be spending more, not less.\n  The House has sent over a bill that would offset $9 billion of that, \nwhich would bring the total spending this year to $1.45 trillion. That \nwould reduce our spending this year by $5 billion, not as much as we \npromised in the Budget Act but at least a modest reduction.\n  It is a very important vote. It is a symbolic vote. It says: Are we \nhonest with the American people when we go before them with a bill that \nsays we are going to spend less than we spent last year, even if it was \na small amount? We cannot even achieve that.\n  Perhaps that is why people are unhappy with us. We have been \npromising them that we would do something about the debt situation in \nthis country. But we have not done much. As a matter of fact, we have \ndone almost nothing.\n  So I would just urge my colleagues to think about that as they cast \ntheir votes on this portion of the House legislation, which has not \nbeen discussed much among our colleagues, and not particularly well-\nunderstood. But I do think it is important. I think it is an important, \nsymbolic vote.\n  Are we willing to do that? It would amount to about a 1.86-percent, \nless than 2 percent across-the-board rescission to offset spending on \nthe other spending items, exempting defense and some other items. \nDefense, of course, has taken dramatic cuts already. They are working \non very dramatic cuts, and as a result of the failure of the committee \nof 12, they will take a huge cut.\n  The Defense Department has taken, on a percentage basis and a real \ndollar basis, far more in reductions than any other department. Of \ncourse this is not for war spending. War is in a separate overseas \ncontingency account. This is the base defense budget that is taking the \ncuts. I wanted to share that with my colleagues.\n  I also appreciated Senator Hoeven's presentation on the Keystone \nPipeline. And I truly believe, and agree with my friend from Vermont, \nthat unemployment is a tremendous problem for us.\n  What I don't agree with is that it can be fixed by borrowing and \nspending and taxing. That is what we have seen lately. I suggest that \none way to deal with unemployment is to not spend any government money, \nget the government bureaucrats busy, examine this pipeline. We have \npipelines crossing all over this country. If we bring those under \ncontrol, approve this pipeline, it will add 20,000 real jobs and \n100,000 indirect jobs and make this country more safe and secure from \nforeign energy exploitation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for as \nlong as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8717-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8717-S8721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Omnibus \nappropriations conference report that I guess will be before this body \nat the pleasure of the members of the Appropriations Committee.\n  I call my colleagues' attention to the size of this bill. There are \n13 agencies of government, all appropriations bills, and none of this, \nbecause of the pressing issues of the calendar, will be open to any \namendments--no amendments regarding all these functions of government \nand a cost of, in this particular bill, it is $915 billion. These are 9 \nappropriations bills of the 12. This contains $915 billion that we will \nprobably be considering, and because of the fact that we all have to \nget out of town--and I am one of those--we will vote sometime tomorrow, \nand we will be able to tell our constituents we have completed our task \nfor the year, at least as far as funding the government to continue--as \nwe seem to threaten to do every year, although I am not sure people are \nas frightened as they used to be.\n  This bill before me is 1,221 pages long and contains funding for nine \nof the annual appropriations bills, for a grand total of $915 billion. \nIf you add the three appropriations bills already enacted, we are going \nto spend $1.043 trillion. That is a fantastic improvement because last \nyear it was $1.1 trillion. So I am glad our constituents, whom we \npromised, when some of us, such as myself, ran in 2010 for reelection, \nthat we would get this $15 trillion debt under control--and we go back \nto Washington and eliminate the reckless and out-of-control spending, I \nam sure they will be pleased to know that instead of $1.1 trillion, we \nare now down to $1.043 trillion--a reduction of approximately 5 \npercent. We can get a better deal than that at the Macy's Christmas \nsale. Of course, not to forget the earmarks--here it is.\n  I am confident no average Member of the Senate--what I mean by that \nis not a member of the Appropriations Committee has had a chance to \nperuse this hernia-inducing piece of legislation. If it sounds like I \nam a little cynical and a little angry, it is because I am, and the \nAmerican people are cynical and angry.\n  There are 535 Members of Congress. All of us are sent by our \nconstituents to represent them. But I think the American people and our \nconstituents should know this is a report on a bill that is signed by \n37 Members of the House and 17 Members of the Senate. There are 535 \nMembers, and these are the ones who put this together. It is full of \nhundreds of earmarks, pork, unnecessary spending, and projects in the \ndefense portion of the bill, which I will be talking a fair amount \nabout, which are neither requested nor needed by the men and women \nserving in the military. It is full of things I will talk about later \non, such as artifact museums for Guam, medical research--this is in the \nDefense appropriations bill and has nothing to do with defense.\n  Then we begin to wonder why the American people have such a low \nopinion of our performance in our Nation's Capital. I saw a poll that \nsays it is as low as 9 percent. Hopefully, that is not representative--\nmaybe it is a 10-, 11-, 12-percent approval rating. We were debating a \nbill last year that had $1.1 trillion and contained 6,488 earmarks that \ntotaled $8.3 billion. Now we have a bill that is $915 billion, and this \nyear we have no traditional earmarks, but there is $3.5 billion in \nunauthorized spending in the Department of Defense portion of the bill \nalone--the Defense appropriations part of it is $3.5 billion, on which \nthere has never been a hearing, and it has never been considered by the \nArmed Services Committee. If it was, it was rejected. So we have $3.5 \nbillion just in the defense part of the bill. Nobody wanted it or asked \nfor it, neither the military, nor the services, nor was there a \nhearing. They added $3.5 billion in the Department of Defense alone.\n  I think the men and women in the military deserve better than some of \nthese earmarks that I will talk about. Here we are, we are going to \nrush and beat the clock, and we haven't even moved to this piece of \nlegislation yet. In case some of our constituents don't know, a call \nwill be made to everybody saying please agree to a few hours' time \nagreement so we can vote tomorrow and we can all go home, and we will. \nThere will not be a single amendment debated and voted on, on this bill \non this floor. I would like to say we didn't see it coming, but the \nfact is we did see it coming.\n  In keeping with the regular order and legislating requirements of the \nSenate, the Armed Services Committee--of which I have been a proud \nmember for many years--scheduled and conducted more than 70 hearings, \nvetted the President's budget request, and reported a bill out. Seven \nmonths later, we moved to the floor of the Senate and we did authorize \nfunding and hundreds of millions of dollars and the appropriators \ndecided they knew better. We have a fundamental problem in the Senate, \nand we are unable to engage in the process of authorizing prior to the \nregular appropriations. What is the outcome? A handful of people--all \ngood, honest, decent people, I am sure--and unelected staff disburse \nhundreds of billions of dollars, often in a manner that directly \ncontradicts the will of the authorizers--those who are entrusted in \ntheir Committee assignments to authorize what is necessary to defend \nthis Nation.\n  So here we are at the eleventh hour ramming through a measure so we \ncan get out of town for the holidays. I will talk about some of the \nprovisions,\n\n[[Page S8718]]\n\nmost of which are in the Defense appropriations portion of this \nconference report.\n  Section 8083 of the bill permits the Secretary of Defense to transfer \noperations and maintenance funds. Operations and maintenance funds are \nsupposed to buy the gas and the spare parts--the things that keep the \nmilitary machine moving. That is what it is. So $33 million goes to \nGuam, and this funding is in direct contradiction of the explicit \ndirection that was in the conference report that prevented this because \nwe knew it was coming.\n  If this omnibus bill were subject to amendment, I would immediately \nseek to strip the funding from this bill. Let me be clear. This funding \nI am talking about for Guam is a ``bridge to nowhere.'' The money, in \npart, is to provide the Government of Guam funds to buy 53 civilian \nschoolbuses. They put money in the Defense bill for 53 schoolbuses and \n53 repair kits for the buses for $10.7 million. That is to buy \nschoolbuses and repair kits for Guam. Why? Why would we want to do \nthat? Their reasoning is because we are redeploying marines from Japan. \nBut we have paused that redeployment in the authorization bill because \nwe don't know exactly how to do it. So we are pausing the redeployment \nof marines; meanwhile, the appropriators move forward and put $10.7 \nmillion in to buy civilian schoolbuses, and not one single marine, \nsailor or airman has been assigned to Guam as part of the intended \nbuildup that would justify in any way using that money.\n\n  What else are we buying with this $33 million? Well, $12.7 million is \nintended to be used for a cultural artifacts repository. I am not \nmaking that up--$12.7 million of your tax dollars is buying a cultural \nartifacts repository in Guam, in the name of the redeployment of the \nU.S. marines from Japan, which is not taking place. They claim it is \nrelated to artifacts that will be dug up during the major military \nconstruction projects that have been planned for Guam as part of the \nbuildup. But with the agreement of the Pentagon, we have put it on \nhold.\n  I guess it is important when you are doing a military construction \nproject to preserve the artifacts. The money intended for this cultural \nartifacts repository is, at best, early, and much less if it were ever \nneeded. So here we are with an investment of at least $33 million on a \n``bridge to nowhere'' to hold artifacts that will never be dug out of \nthe Earth.\n  The money in this Defense appropriations bill for this cultural \nartifacts repository is actually going to be spent to build a 20,000-\nsquare-foot museum, most of which will be used for the storage of \nexisting artifacts and existing administration, completely unrelated to \nthe major military construction projects associated with the buildup on \nGuam.\n  They get the benefits of $12.5 million in Federal largess for a new \nmuseum, which otherwise they could not get. I would like to say there \nare many citizens of Arizona who are out of work, whose homes have been \nlost, and who would benefit from any sort of action by the Federal \nGovernment--the holiday season is approaching in my State and all over \nAmerica where there is not enough money to fund the food banks, and we \nare going to spend money on schoolbuses and cultural repositories in \nGuam.\n  That is not the end of the story. This initial funding grant to Guam \nof $33 million includes $9.6 million for the first phase of a mental \nhealth facility. They claim that is somehow related to the proposed \nmilitary buildup on Guam. I am still trying to sort that one out. \nWithout one additional marine or his family being stationed on Guam, \nhow does a proposed buildup not happening for years help with a mental \nhealth facility on Guam?\n\n  It might not surprise you to learn this money for a new mental health \nfacility has nothing to do with any marines coming to Guam but is \nrequired to satisfy a current Federal injunction that mandates the \nconstruction of a new facility. So take it out of Defense. Take it out \nof the hardware and the operations and maintenance our men and women in \nthe military need.\n  Our committee did the research for these projects. We reviewed the \nworking papers of the Department of Defense's Economic Adjustment \nCommittee and found this funding would not go to its priorities and \ndecided, as a conference, not to support the authorization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Working Papers Excerpt of DOD's Economic Adjustment Committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT COMMITTEE 2010 GUAM SOCIOECONOMIC NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n                             WORKING PAPERS\n\n                      Summary of Projects Assessed\n\n\n PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE--Guam Mental Health and Substance Abuse \n                                Facility\n\n       Recommendation: Consider for Fiscal Year 2012 budget \n     submission. A Federal injunction mandates Guam Department of \n     Mental Health and Substance Abuse to hire additional staff \n     and construct a new facility to provide for approximately 60 \n     percent of identified and un-served cases. Projected military \n     buildup induced growth could adversely impact the island's \n     mental health and substance abuse system. A new $34.2 million \n     facility provides enhanced treatment services in counseling, \n     physical training, recreation, daily living assistance, peer \n     support, and speech therapy.\n\n\n                     CULTURAL--Cultural Repository\n\n       Recommendation: Consider for Fiscal Year 2012 budget \n     submission. Federal law requires the U.S. Government to \n     curate and archive cultural artifacts discovered as a result \n     of U.S. Government construction. Guam's existing space to \n     receive, study, and store such unearthed cultural artifacts \n     is inadequate. A $12.7 million Cultural Repository will \n     provide 20,000 square feet of curatorial and administrative \n     spaces. Currently, the majority of Guam's artifacts reside in \n     foreign museums for archival storage.\n\n\n                          EDUCATION--Bus Fleet\n\n       Recommendation: Consider for Fiscal Year 2012 budget \n     submission. This $10.7 million project buys 53 school buses \n     and associated spare parts' packages to correct Guam's severe \n     shortage of school buses. Future induced population growth \n     will further strain the busing system.\n\n                                Excerpts\n\n\n       Project 1: Guam Mental Health and Substance Abuse Facility\n\n       GovGuam provided an initial $34.2 million cost estimate to \n     build a new mental health and substance abuse facility at Oka \n     Point. When completed, this facility would provide enhanced \n     treatment services that include counseling, physical \n     training, recreation, assistance with activities of daily \n     living, peer support, and speech therapy, in addition to \n     other efficiencies gained through close location to other \n     related inpatient and outpatient medical care. Presently, the \n     GovGuam Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse \n     (DMHSA) program is managed by the court-appointed Guam \n     Federal Management Team (FMT) and the Guam Mental Health \n     Planning Council. DMHSA is currently under permanent Federal \n     injunction and is required to hire additional staff and \n     construct a new facility to address their deficiencies. Due \n     to inadequate staff and facility resources, DMHSA is not able \n     to provide services to approximately 60 percent of 1,400 \n     identified as requesting assistance.\n\n\n                     Project 2: Cultural Repository\n\n       The Federal Team reviewed a $12.7 million project cost \n     estimate from GovGuam for the design, construction and \n     outfitting of a Cultural Repository that would provide 15,000 \n     square feet to store existing artifacts, artifacts \n     anticipated to be discovered during the buildup of military \n     forces on the island, and an additional 5,000 square feet of \n     space for administrative offices. Presently, GovGuam provides \n     artifacts to foreign museums for exhibitions or stores them \n     in 7,600 square feet of space split between two floors of an \n     office building. This storage space is presently over \n     capacity and does not meet cultural storage requirements, \n     including environmental controls. The proposed facility would \n     be located on government owned land and be adjacent to the \n     future Guam Institute of Natural History and Cultural \n     Heritage (GINHCH). The present facility would be \n     decommissioned and the artifacts would be transferred to this \n     new facility with the remainder of the space projected to be \n     occupied in 10 years.\n\n\n                      Project 3: School Bus Fleet\n\n       GovGuam estimates $10.7 million is needed to purchase 53 \n     school buses and spare parts packages. The school bus fleet \n     provides transportation services to all non-DoD students on \n     the island for both public and private schools and for \n     extracurricular activities. The bus fleet is also an integral \n     part of the island's emergency response plan and is used for \n     population relocation during large scale events. Currently, \n     the fleet operates only at 47 percent, requiring buses to be \n     triple cycled during the day. Schools also start classes at \n     different times in order to ensure that all children can be \n     bused to school. Daily bus runs begin before 6:00 a.m., \n     resulting in some students arriving well before classes \n     begin. Subsequent morning bus cycles often deliver students \n     to school well after classes have begun. At the end of the \n     school day, students are often delayed by hours in their \n     departure from school due to school bus shortages.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is not the way Congress is supposed \nto\n\n[[Page S8719]]\n\nwork. Authorizing committees exist to provide specific congressional \napproval of Federal spending. Appropriations committees and \nsubcommittees exist to take the available Federal dollars and allocate \nthem to programs consistent with the authorizations that have been \nprovided by the authorizing committees. In no way do appropriations \ncommittees have the legitimate authority to override the specific \ndirection of authorizing committees when those authorizing committees \nhave spoken to a matter and denied authority for a specific type or \nlevel of funding.\n  This is why the approval rating of Congress is in single digits. The \nAmerican people have seen through this. They see this kind of abuse and \nwaste and they have had enough of it. If you don't understand the rise \nof the tea party, you can start by looking right here.\n  It is not as if this issue was somehow hidden from the leadership of \nthe Appropriations Committee. I wrote to the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee. Let me give a few examples of \nwhat the Appropriations Committee has done.\n  There is a program called MEADS--the Medium Extended Air Defense \nSystem. The program was supposed to have been terminated as originally \nproposed in the Senate version of the bill. The Defense appropriations \nportion of the bill is at $390 million, nearly the entire $406 million \nrequested. We found out the Appropriations Committee was going to fund \nthe program, and I felt compelled to ensure the final Defense \nauthorization conference report prohibits any funding beyond 2012. \nUnder the requirements imposed by the Defense authorization conference \nreport, this year's funding will be restrained by prohibiting the \nDepartment from spending more than 25 percent until the Secretary of \nDefense provides a plan to either restructure the program in a way that \nrequires no additional funding or terminates the program. So we wanted \nto get this report from the Secretary. But what did the Appropriations \nCommittee do? The full $406 million.\n  I think my colleagues should understand, they have decided to never \nput this system--the Medium Extended Air Defense System--into \noperation. They want to have a corporate memory, a memory of what they \nhave learned in spending what ends up to be a couple of billion \ndollars.\n  The Next-Generation Bomber. The President asked there not be money \nproposed for the Next-Generation Bomber, but the appropriators chose to \nadd $100 million--$100 million. This is money for the Next Generation \nBomber that was not requested by the Air Force nor was there any \ntestimony by the Air Force leadership, either civilian or military, in \nsupport of this additional huge addition in funding. It magically \nappeared here.\n  This morning, I tried to find out if this money would be wisely \nspent, and the answer is no. We called the Air Force Chief of Staff. \nThey said they didn't request the funding. They do not want it. The \nmoney is ahead of need, meaning it could not be applied to the program \nin an effective or efficient manner.\n  The analysis of alternatives, which helps determine what the \ncapability of the bomber should be, will not be completed for another \nyear and a half. The capabilities requirement document, which is key to \nensuring the new bomber design is stable--which is needed to determine \nif increased taxpayer dollars should be invested in the new bomber--is \nnot complete and will not be complete for a couple of years. Finally, \nthey wanted to use this money to sustain the bomber force they have.\n  So why? Why? Why would we add $100 million when there is absolutely \nno way it could be used? Well, I can only say there are reasons for it. \nI will not make allegations, but it is not magic. It is not something \nthat appears out of thin air.\n  There is a program called Combat Dragon. Of approximately 100 \nunrequested and unauthorized additions above the President's budget \nrequest found in the appropriations bill, one of the more interesting \nones is a $20 million allocation for an obscure aircraft program called \nCombat Dragon II. The name is interesting. Sounds pretty exciting. You \nwon't find it in the President's budget request. It didn't appear in \nour authorization bill. So I asked my staff to find out what happened.\n  The purpose of the program: Combat Dragon II is to lease up to four \ncrop-duster-type aircraft and to outfit them with machine gun pods, \nlaser-guided bombs, rockets, and air-to-air missiles. I asked if this \nrequest was justified, vetted, approved in any way. The answer was no, \nno, no. There is no urgent operational requirement for this type of \naircraft.\n  After a little investigation, we found this aircraft lease will not \nbe--surprise, surprise--competitively awarded. As such, it is \neffectively earmarked for a particular aircraft manufacturer that has \nthe corner on this particularly obscure part of the aviation market.\n  The C-17. The Defense appropriations bill adds $225 million--only \n$225 million--for an unrequested, unauthorized C-17 aircraft that no \none in the U.S. Air Force or the Pentagon thought we needed. According \nto every strategic planning document, the Air Force has an excess \ncapacity of large cargo aircraft, and the Air Force already has 222 C-\n17 cargo aircraft and more than 80 C-5s.\n  The key reason for an overage of large cargo aircraft is because the \nAppropriations Committee over the past several years added 44 C-17s \nthat were not authorized--that we neither needed nor could afford--at a \ncost of $14 billion above the Department's request.\n  The OMB, five Secretaries of Defense, the Commander of Transportation \nCommand, and the current Secretary of the Air Force have all \nunanimously stated they do not need nor can they afford to operate any \nmore C-17 aircraft. In fact, the President appealed to the Congress and \nsaid the Nation cannot afford any more. You would think after $14 \nbillion and 44 C-17s, averaging over $250 million each, that would be \nenough of an earmark. Obviously, not so for the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  There are others in here. Some of my old favorites. There is $25 \nmillion for unrequested helicopter upgrades, an increase to the Civil \nAir Patrol Program of $7 million, unrequested, unauthorized; $273 \nmillion in unrequested, unauthorized research on everything from \nParkinson's disease and HIV to alternative energy and nanotechnology.\n  Speaking of alternate energy, the appropriators tucked unrequested, \nunauthorized funding throughout a certain division of the bill, and \n$130 million in ambiguously named ``alternative energy research'' is \nscattered for the same sort of programs that brought us the recent \nachievement of the Department of the Navy, which proudly announced the \npurchase of 450,000 gallons of alternative fuels for $12 million. My \nfriends, that equates to $26 a gallon. I am certain our constituents \nwill be glad to know their tax dollars are now going toward paying $26 \na gallon for aviation fuel.\n\n  But, no, no, they need more money--$262 million in unauthorized Navy \nresearch and development programs. The list of Navy adds is eerily \nsimilar to the Army's, and as you would expect, it covers a familiar \nset of Member interest items--nanotechnology, alternative energy, and \ngiveaways to home-State interests.\n  There are increases for Space Situational Awareness.\n  I repeat, $50 million in increases for Space Situational Awareness in \ntwo funding lines--just two lines--with no justification. No argument \nfor it. Maybe it is good. It may be good, but we won't know. We won't \nknow for months and months and months, and maybe years.\n  For those who are interested in the compelling national security \nissue of space situational awareness, you will be glad to know $50 \nmillion of your tax dollars is going to be spent there.\n  The budget requested $86 million for Operationally Responsive Space. \nThis bill adds $26 million more, just for fun.\n  The Armed Services Committee authorized, and the Congress will soon \nappropriate, some $290 million for research into post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, prosthetics, blast injury, and psychological health. These \nare critical to improving our actual battlefield medicine. Yet once \nagain, the appropriators inserted unrequested money for medical \nresearch, this time to the tune of $600 million.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that these unrequested projects are \nfunded at the expense of other military priorities. I agree that \nresearch on multiple\n\n[[Page S8720]]\n\nsclerosis is necessary, and Alzheimer's and cancer. But why should it \nhave to come out of the Defense funding?\n  I will tell you why it does. It is the same reason why Willie Sutton \nrobbed banks. When they asked him why, he said, that is because the \nmoney is there. So this money, which may be meritorious to spend on \nAlzheimer's and cancer and other medical issues, should not come out of \nthe Defense appropriations bill.\n  Of course, the Guard and Reserve always come in and get additional \nmoney. They got $1 billion in unrequested, unauthorized funding for \n``miscellaneous equipment.'' I repeat: $1 billion for ``miscellaneous \nequipment.'' I am sure certain States on the appropriators' short list \nwill be very pleased to have the money directed their way. I am not so \nsure about the taxpayers.\n  Some have merit, some don't. None of the ones I talked about were \nrequested. And this is just in Defense. The tragedy of all this is, \nexcept for the Senator from Oklahoma and myself and a few others, all \nthis will slide through and the American people--obviously, the \ntaxpayers--will pick up the tab.\n  We won't have a chance to address the issue of the bonuses that have \ngone to the executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that have cost the \nAmerican citizens so many hundreds of billions of dollars. We are going \nto let these people--because this won't be appropriated--we are going \nto let them take home annual salaries of $900,000 and bonuses of $12.08 \nmillion, while they ask the taxpayers for more bail-out money. Mr. \nEdward DeMarco says that is the only way you can get good people to \nserve the country.\n  I am sure the men and women in the military would be interested to \nknow that is what is required to serve. The base pay of a four-star \ngeneral is $179,000. The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court makes \n$223,000. But Mr. DeMarco feels people who are working at Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac deserve $900,000, and millions of dollars in bonuses.\n  After all, they are doing such a great job.\n  The Alaska Native corporations is one of my favorites. We need to be \nespecially mindful of how taxpayer dollars are appropriated. The Army \nCorps, in light of a recent Justice Department investigation, revealed \nwhat prosecutors called one of the largest bribery scandals in U.S. \nhistory involving Army Corps contracting officials and the contracting \ndirector of Eyak Technology, an ANC-owned company. In the authorization \nbill, we are trying to have all of these small business funding issues, \nno matter whether it be in an ANC or others, looked at.\n  And, of course, we won't be able to address the Solyndra issue. \nPrivate investors will collect the first $69 million that can be \nrecovered from the company, with taxpayers placed in second position by \nthe Department of Energy.\n  If we had been able to amend this bill, I would have worked with my \ncolleague, Dr. Coburn, to restore much needed funding to the Government \nAccountability Office. In a recent report released by Dr. Coburn, he \nhighlights that ``just this year GAO identified hundreds of billions of \ndollars of duplicative and overlapping programs that, if addressed by \nCongress, could both save money and improve services for taxpayers. For \nevery $1 spent on the GAO, the agency provides $90 in savings \nrecommendations. Yet, instead of adopting those good-government \nreforms, the Senate Appropriations Committee has responded by proposing \ndramatic budget cuts to the GAO.''\n  I don't want to go through all this pork that I just described again, \nbut we can afford all that and yet we are going to cut the only \nwatchdog organization that really gives us an objective view of what we \ndo here in Congress. I am sure that it is a coincidence.\n  So here we are again. Here we are again, the same thing as last year, \nthe same thing for years--a few Members of the House and Senate making \ndecisions on hundreds of billions of dollars, perhaps over $1 trillion, \nand we, the other Members, because of our desire--understandable--to \nleave this body and return to our homes for the holidays, after a few \nhours of debate, no amendments, no changes in the bill, not having had \nthe ability to even examine it, we will be voting.\n  I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would just mention, I say to my colleague from \nOklahoma, the issue of this cutting of the budget of the Government \nAccountability Office. It seems rather strange to me. And I would be \ncurious, with this cut to the Government Accountability Office, what \nwill the effect be on our ability to have this watchdog organization \ngive us the reports and information we need as far as the functions of \ngovernment are concerned?\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator for his question.\n  I think the people need to know what the GAO actually does. The GAO \nis nonpartisan; they are not Democrats or Republicans. They are \naccountants, and they are investigators, and they are the most valuable \ntool we have because we won't do the oversight of calling agencies up \nhere. I think the numbers are that we are going to lose 400 \ninvestigators and auditors out of the GAO. One question to ask is, Why \nis it we are cutting the GAO more than we are cutting our own budget?\n  Let me make one additional point. Things are not right in our country \nbecause things aren't right in the Senate. This 1,200-page bill that \nshould have come out here appropriations bill by appropriations bill--\n11 or 12 appropriations bills--has over $3.5 billion worth of \nphonemarks in it. We don't have earmarks anymore; they are all \nphonemarks. The corruption is still here. The pay-to-play game is still \ngoing on in Washington. Now we just don't do it in the bill, we do it \nby telephone, and we threaten agencies: If you don't give this money to \nthis person, your money will be cut the next year.\n  So the fact is, although we have an earmark ban, there are thousands \nof earmarks in this bill. And what do we do? We cut the very agency \nthat is going to be required to help us solve our financial problems \nover the next few years; we cut them more than we cut our own budgets. \nNow, they can be cut, and appropriately so. Everybody is going to have \nto share. But to cut the GAO 6.4 percent--40 percent more than we are \ncutting our own budgets--out of spite? They and the Congressional \nResearch Service do the best work on the Hill. They do better than we \ndo. Yet we are going to take away a tool that is going to help this \ncountry solve its very difficult financial problems. I think it is \noutrageous. It nauseates me.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would ask my colleague, I identified $3.5 billion \nunrequested, unauthorized, no-hearing-on projects--$3.5 billion. Since \nDr. Coburn has taken a broader view of things, I wonder how many \nbillions he would estimate totally there are of these unauthorized, \nunrequested projects in the entire bill.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would just respond to the Senator, I don't know for \nsure because we haven't been able to go through the whole bill, and the \ncreativity associated with parochialism and getting reelected by \nhelping the very well-connected few in this country is unbelievable. So \nit is hidden, and it takes a long time. It doesn't take 48 hours.\n  We got this bill at 2:00 Tuesday morning. That is when we got it. And \nof course nobody is around at 2:00 Tuesday morning, are they? So we \nwill have 72 hours to read a 1,200-page book, and then we have to \nfigure out what is in it. As the Senator said, we are not going to know \nwhat is in it, not until the next Solyndra comes, not until the next \nperson goes to jail, not until the next Senator goes to jail. We are \nnot going to know.\n  The fact is, what we are seeing is irresponsible behavior on the part \nof the Congress with this bill, and if we don't break this cycle of \nprotecting incumbency through spending money, we are not going to have \na country left. It is not just wrong, it is immoral. It is immoral.\n  The Senator talked about research at the Department of Defense. There \nare good reasons to do medical research at the Department of Defense, \nbut we have the world's premier institutes, the National Institutes of \nHealth. Now, we are not increasing them significantly, but we are \nmarkedly increasing the study of MS at a military research facility \ninstead of through NIH, where we are spending $100 million already a\n\n[[Page S8721]]\n\nyear on it? So we are going to duplicate it.\n  I have said it before: We have taken a stupid pill. We have either \ntaken a stupid pill or a corruption pill. I don't know which it is. But \nI know that the long-term effects of doing this kind of legislating at \nthis time in our history, when we have the greatest difficulty and the \ngreatest landmines ahead of us financially--for us to do what we are \ndoing here today to please a very small group of Congressmen and \nSenators who happen to make up the Appropriation Committee and to \naddress their election concerns and their knowing better than the \nauthorization committees--it won't surprise the Senator that in this \nbill, this conglomeration of what I will call an omni-terrible, is over \n$400 billion in spending that is unauthorized, that has never been \nauthorized or the authorizations have expired long ago and the \nauthorizing committees don't reauthorize it for a reason, and yet we \nkeep spending the money.\n\n  So I think it is amazing that we have as high as a 9-percent approval \nrating. And I am saddened not just for us, I am saddened for the future \nof America that we would now, right before Christmas--because we are \nrunning on a deadline to go home we are going to pass a bill that is \nessentially irresponsible, inept, and loaded with political favors \ninstead of doing the best right thing for this country.\n  The GAO, in late February, early March, put out a report on \nduplication in the Federal Government. Most of my colleagues applauded \nit. It was a great deal of work that they spent a lot of time on. The \nsecond and third component of that, of the Federal Government, is \ncoming out this February, and in it were hundreds of billions of \ndollars of duplicative programs. Not in one place in this bill that we \nhave been able to find so far has any of what the GAO said should be \neliminated, should be discontinued--none of it has happened.\n  What is the consequence of spending $200 billion of borrowed money--\nmoney we don't have--on things the GAO says we don't need? What is the \nconsequence of that? The consequence of that is impoverishment of our \nchildren. It is the theft of opportunity from our children. That is \nwhat it is. So I don't say the word ``corruption'' lightly. When you \nare stealing opportunity and you are impoverishing those who follow, \nthat is corrupt. It is also immoral.\n  We won't be able to defeat this bill. We won't be able to amend this \nbill. We won't be able to offer amendments to what the GAO said is \nabsolute stupidity because of the way we are bringing this up and the \nfact that we didn't bring these bills through here. And the bills they \ndid bring through, they limited the amendments on anyway. So the voice \nof the average American doesn't get heard in the Senate under the way \nit is operating right now. Good ideas that actually will improve our \ncountry and save us money don't ever get heard. That is not the America \nI know. That is not the country I love.\n  So we are leading by example into our demise, and this is one of the \ngreatest examples of that I have seen.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I also point out, as my colleague did, that all of us \nas Members of the Senate are guided to some degree by seniority, which \nmeans assignment and ranking in various committees. But we should have \nan equal opportunity to represent our constituents and our priorities \nand our views and our goals.\n  This document was signed by 37 Members of the House and 17 Members of \nthe Senate, so really this system hands the important decisions that \nall 535 Members of the House and Senate are responsible for over to 37 \nin the House and 17 in the Senate. Neither the Senator from Oklahoma \nnor I had a single time to discuss with our colleagues all that is in \nthis bill. Not a single time did we have a chance to say: Wait a \nminute, let's not put in that cultural repository for Guam. Not a \nsingle time did we have a chance to say: Hey, this Combat Dragon II is \nnot really something we need to fund. You know, the Civil Air Patrol is \nreally a great outfit, but we don't think we need to add $7 million in \nthese difficult times. We think helicopters needed to be upgraded, but \nwhy should we add $25 million to helicopter upgrades when the military \nsays we don't need $25 million for helicopter upgrades? This is what is \nwrong with this system.\n  Mr. COBURN. If I could respond, that $25 million is going to go to \none company--we don't know where yet--that is well-connected and well-\nheeled to either a Member of the House or the Senate. Mark my words, \nthat is where it is going. Somebody--one individual business, one \nindividual constituent--is going to benefit from that at the expense of \nour children and our future.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So the system now has deteriorated to the point where \nthese decisions are made--by the way, I would like to correct the \nrecord. There are 37 total Members in the House and Senate, so 37 out \nof 535 who would be making these decisions.\n  So we really are in a kind of situation where we come down and all we \ncan do is complain about it. That seems to me a deprivation of all of \nus who are not in that group of 37 of the ability to make our input \ninto the future of this country. I do not think the American people are \ngoing to stand for it too much longer. I really don't.\n\n  I say to my colleague, I think a couple of things are going to \nhappen. I think in the next election--I say this to all my colleagues. \nI think in the next election no incumbent is safe. But I also say, one \nway or another there is going to be a third party in the political \narena of the United States. We cannot keep doing these things, \nRepublican and Democrat, without sooner or later a response by the very \nwell-informed electorate--thanks to devices like this.\n  I believe we have done this long enough. For long enough the American \npeople, who now are in more dire economic straits than they have been \nsince the Great Depression, are fed up with spending a few million \ndollars on schoolbuses in Guam that have nothing to do with our \nNation's defense.\n  I hope the Senator from Oklahoma will not give up. I certainly will \nnot. But I think, frankly, the American people deserve a lot better \nthan they are getting out of this process. If they are cynical and if \nthey are angry and if they are frustrated, they have every reason to be \nso.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I guess I am one of several Senators who \ndoesn't know for sure what is going to happen tonight or tomorrow. I do \nknow that we have one very contentious issue in the pipeline. Several \npeople have been talking about this. I would like to give, perhaps, a \ndifferent, maybe a historic perspective on this issue as we are looking \nat it.\n  I think with all the talk and all the demagoging people want us to be \nindependent from the Middle East when producing our energy in fact we \nhave the recoverable resources in the United States to be totally \nindependent--for the North American Continent to be totally independent \nin providing its own energy. We are the only country in the world that \ndoes not exploit its own resources. We have more recoverable reserves \nin oil, gas, and coal than any other country in the world. Yet it is a \npolitical problem because there are people who do not want to exploit \nour own resources. They do not want to go offshore. They do not want to \ngo there.\n  Eighty-four percent of our onshore public land is off-limits, so we \ncannot drill there. It is very disturbing when we see the real reason. \nWe have an administration that doesn't want us to exploit our own \nresources. We have a Secretary of Energy who said we are going to have \nto get the price of gasoline in the pumps comparable to Europe, $8 a \ngallon, before people realize we have to go in another direction other \nthan fossil fuels. We have an Assistant Secretary of Energy who said we \nhave to wean ourselves off fossil fuels.\n  All this green energy stuff is fine, and someday when the technology \nis there we will be able to do something with it. But it is not there. \nIn the meantime, we have to run this machine called America.\n\n[[Page S8722]]\n\n  So here the rest of the world is laughing at us, looking at us and \nsaying why is it we have a country that does not use its own resources. \nIt is pretty mind-boggling to me.\n  The first effort of this administration, in order to hide this agenda \nof not wanting to provide our own energy, was to do away with hydraulic \nfracturing. A lot of people don't know what that is.\n  Hydraulic fracturing is a technique started in my State of Oklahoma \nin 1948. There has never been a case of groundwater contamination in \nover 1 million of these applications since 1948. Yet the President made \na speech about 6 months ago saying we need to use this good, clean \nnatural gas, and it is plentiful, cheap, and we have a lot of it, we \nshould use it--but we have to do something about hydraulic fracturing.\n  The reality is we cannot get into any of these tight formations for \noil or gas without using hydraulic fracturing. It is a perfectly safe \nprocess. They are trying to kill fossil fuels by stopping it.\n  Just last week the EPA said, like an endangerment finding, that we \nhave now said in the State of Wyoming, in this very shallow well up \nthere, only 600 feet, that somehow there is some contamination, and it \nwas due to hydraulic fracturing. It is not. Hydraulic fracturing is \ndone 1 mile, 2 miles down deep. That is one of the efforts.\n  The second issue we are addressing tonight--and this is significant. \nIt is almost as if, with all the majority they have supporting the \nPresident with the 2012 elections coming up, I am in shock a lot of my \ncolleagues on the left side, on the Democratic side, are following \nPresident Obama off this plank and going along with these efforts to \nkill fossil fuels. The most recent one is the one we are talking about \ntonight, and that is the pipeline.\n  On November 10 the Obama administration State Department announced it \nwould delay the Keystone XL Pipeline decision until after the 2012 \nelections. This delay came shortly after the head of the Sierra Club, \nthe executive director, Michael Brune, tied their political support for \nPresident Obama's reelection to the Keystone decision--and they went \nalong with it. That is what we are facing right now. It is something \nthat is very punitive to our whole country, not just in terms of the \nfact that we cannot use our good, cheap energy we develop right here \nbut the number of jobs.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline is estimated to add more than 250,000 \npermanent jobs for U.S. workers and add more than $100 billion in \nannual total expenditures to the U.S. total economy. During the \nconstruction phase alone, it would generate more than $585 million in \nState and local taxes.\n  I am particularly interested in this. As to my State of Oklahoma, I \ndid not bring it with me, but there is a map that shows where this \npipeline would go in order to get to the tight formations in Alberta. \nYou will notice two-thirds of the way down is Cushing, OK. Cushing, OK, \nis kind of the intersection of all the pipelines. Right now it is \nclogged. It is full, and we cannot open it. Oklahoma alone, it is \nexpected, if they would open the Keystone Pipeline, would have some \n14,000 new jobs. That is just in my State, in Oklahoma alone.\n  The construction of the pipeline is expected to add about $1.2 \nbillion in new spending in my State of Oklahoma. We have heard Senators \nfrom Nebraska and North Dakota and South Dakota talk about how it would \naffect their States. Just in my State alone, once operational, it is \nprojected that it would add more than $667 million in property taxes.\n  Cushing, OK is a very important part of this. It is mind-boggling. \nWhen I go back to Oklahoma--I hope we go back sometime tomorrow--and \npeople ask the question of why is it, since we want cheap oil and gas \nright from the North American Continent--why would they stop a pipeline \nto carry it?\n  They do it because politically they do not want that to happen. I \nbelieve it is important to look at the other aspects. Jim Jones--a lot \nof us knew him when he was a four-star general who served with a lot of \ndignity. He was very successful. He became the National Security \nAdviser to President Obama.\n  He said:\n\n       In a tightly contested global economy, where securing \n     energy resources is a national must, we should be able to act \n     with speed and agility. And any threat to this project, by \n     delay or otherwise, would constitute a significant setback.\n\n  He ties this in to national security. He further said the failure to \nmove forward with the project will prolong the risk to our economy and \nour energy security and send the wrong message to job creators.\n\n  One of the opponents of the pipeline thinks that stopping the \nconstruction would prevent Canada from developing its tar sands. We \nhave the far left environmentalists who think somehow they can stop \nthis activity in Canada when we know what will happen if we continue to \nstop the transportation through the pipeline all the way from Alberta \ndown into Texas.\n  According to Austan Goolsbee, a former Obama chairman of the White \nHouse Council of Economic Advisers--keep in mind he is on their side. \nHe said:\n\n       It's a bit naive to think the tar sands would not be \n     developed if they don't build that pipeline.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Eventually, it's going to be built. It may go to the \n     Pacific, it may go through Nebraska, but it's going to be \n     built somewhere.\n\n  They go ahead and talk about the fact that they have already approved \na way of getting it to the west coast of Canada and shipped to China. \nSo this is something where there is no justification for stopping it \nother than the political justification. Other than the administration \nlooking at the far left environmentalists--it all started in Nebraska--\nthey said there is one little area that might not want it. So what do \nthey do in Nebraska? They got together and changed the routing of it so \nit goes to an area where there is no opposition, and there is still no \npipeline.\n  I think even if we were to have to stay here--and I am the last one \nwho wants to stay here for any length of time--a key issue right now is \ngetting that open again.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning it was announced that the \nformer officers of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are going to be \nprosecuted, or cases have been filed, for their misrepresentation of \nthe liabilities that both of those institutions posed to the American \nCongress and American taxpayers.\n  Last year when we passed the Dodd-Frank amendment on mortgages and on \nrisk retention, we exempted Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae from the \nliability that every other company in the country had to go through. We \nfind ourselves today in a place where Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have \ncost the American taxpayer at least $171 billion. That number is rising \nbecause of the exemption from Dodd-Frank; Freddie and Fannie, other \nthan FHA, are the only act in town.\n  A week ago I introduced a piece of legislation to deal with this \nissue. It is a piece of legislation that will terminate Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae and create a bridge, or a transition, from where we are to a \nprivatized mortgage securitization and guarantee program.\n  I want to briefly address how that takes place because in the end it \nwill pay back the American taxpayer. It will put Freddie and Fannie out \nof business, and we will have a robust mortgage market available to the \nAmerican people as the housing market begins to recover in this \ncountry.\n  First of all, the legislation creates a new entity called the \nMortgage Finance Agency. It is an agency with directors that are \nappointed by the President with advice-and-consent approval by the \nSenate. Its directors are members of the government that deal with \nfinancial institutions and financial regulations. It will have advisory \ngroups for people affiliated with housing, and it will be established \nwith the following goals: Within a year it will be up and running so it \ncan be a guarantor of quality residential mortgages--and I underline \nQRM, quality residential mortgages.\n\n[[Page S8723]]\n\n  The mortgage disaster America has today was a failure of \nunderwriting. We didn't make good loans. We made high-risk loans \nbecause they had high coupon paper and securitized it on Wall Street. \nPeople made a lot of money, but America lost and today our economy \nsuffers because of it.\n  The new mortgage finance agency would be able to guarantee and wrap \nhigh-quality residential mortgages. In those wraps and in those \nguarantees they would receive a fee which would go into a catastrophic \nfund to back up the risk on those mortgages.\n  In addition to that, the QRM requirements would make it essential \nthat no loan was made 95 percent loan-to-value. Any loan above 70 \npercent would have private mortgage insurance on the amount up to 95 \npercent, and within 36 months the agency would be required to have \nsupplemental insurance coverage to take the risk down to 50 cents on \nthe dollar.\n  It would be required by the fifth year to have a game plan \nestablished and a plan of liquidating the asset and privatizing the \nguarantee to the private sector. That is a very important process \nbecause it is the bridge to the end of Freddie and Fannie and the \ntaxpayer guaranteeing of residential mortgages. We would have a \nsituation with a downpayment of 5 percent, private mortgage insurance \nof 25 percent, and supplemental insurance of 20 percent, and the risk \nto the government would be 50 cents on the dollar.\n  In the great recession values fell 31 percent. In this recession they \nhave fallen 33 percent. So the government's coverage would be 17 \npercent in addition to the liability that exists today. It is a very \ngood place to have the government and to build an entity that brings us \nback to a mortgage market in the United States of America that is \nviable and that works.\n  I don't like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and I don't like what \nhappened, but it has happened. I know everybody wants to terminate \nthem, and I do too. But we have a difficult housing market in America \nthat will only come back when this robust capital is flowing into the \nmortgage markets, and that will only take place when we get ourselves \nout of the current dilemma and on a path toward privatization.\n  The American private sector is a tremendous entity. It has proven in \nmany ways they can find a solution to most all problems we have, but we \nhave to create a bridge to that privatization. We have to create an \nentity that works, an entity that is self-sustaining, and change some \nof the principles of lending back to the way it used to be in this \ncountry so that when people borrow money on their houses, they really \nhave a job, and it is verified, and their credit score indicates they \ncan make the payments they are going to be required to make; that their \ncredit history is a good history, and the house appraises and the \nunderwriting is sound. Most importantly of all, the borrower has skin \nin the game, and there is insurance on the mortgage above 70 percent \nand supplemental insurance down to 50 percent. When we do that, we have \nqualified residential mortgages, an entity that in the beginning can \nsecure those and can guarantee those and can, at the end of 10 years, \nhave an institution that can be privatized.\n  Here is the real kicker. Upon privatization, the money that is made \nby the government on the sale of the entity goes to pay back the \ntaxpayer for the $171 billion or more they lost, and any excess money, \nwhich more than likely there would be, goes to reduce the national \ndebt.\n  So I hope everyone in this body will look at the Mortgage Finance \nAgency proposal I introduced last week. When we come back next year, \ninstead of griping about the problems we have had, let's start looking \nto the solutions that will take us back to the America we love \neconomically and the housing market that is absolutely critical to our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We ask them to put their \nlives on the line, to save people from burning buildings, to track down \narmed criminals. We ask and they give each day and each night. That is \nwhy we cannot just honor them through parades, memorials, speeches on \nthe Senate floor, showing up at various kinds of festivals, but we \nhonor them by the priorities we set in our Federal Government, in State \nlegislatures in Santa Fe and Columbus and Atlanta, in city halls, and \nin county courthouses.\n  Earlier this year, Ohioans overwhelmingly rejected issue 2, which \nwould have curtailed the ability of first responders, firefighters, and \npolice officers not just to organize and bargain collectively for their \nwages and their benefits but, much more broadly than that, to have them \nsit down and negotiate with their employers, with cities, with \ncounties, with the State, and with taxpayers for safety equipment and \nadequate staffing.\n  This was a victory for them. The defeat of issue 2 was a victory for \nhard-working men and women in Ohio. It was the only time in American \nhistory when the issue of collective bargaining was on a State ballot \nfor a statewide vote, and voters voted more than three-fifths--61 \npercent to 39 percent--to preserve collective bargain rates. Again, \ncollective bargaining not just for themselves in terms of wages and \nbenefits but collective bargaining for police officers' safety vests; \nfor firefighters to have the right kind of safety equipment; for \nteachers organizing and bargaining collectively at the negotiating \ntable for class size. It was way more than about them and that is why \nthe voters of Ohio, in such a resounding number, voted to preserve \ncollective bargaining and what it meant to public employees and what it \nmeant to our way of life for those who are not public employees, and \nthat is at the State level.\n  At the Federal level we must continue to fight to ensure these brave \npublic servants have the resources necessary to safely perform their \njobs. That is because so many give the ultimate sacrifice. In the last \n10 years, 47 law enforcement officials representing 35 Ohio agencies \nwere killed while on duty. Forty-seven law enforcement officials were \nkilled while on duty just in a decade.\n  According to the FBI, 48 law enforcement officials across the country \nwere feloniously killed in the line of duty in 2009. More than 57,000 \nlaw enforcement officials were assaulted while performing their duties.\n  This past May during National Police Week, I attended a Greater \nCleveland Police Officer Memorial service in Huntington Park in \nCleveland. During the service, I met Sara Winfield of Marysville, OH. \nSara's husband Bradley Winfield was a deputy in the Marion County \nSheriff's Department, a north central community, when he was shot and \nkilled while on duty. In her grief, this widow, with two young sons to \ncare for, has become an advocate ensuring that those who protect us are \nprotected themselves. That is why I cosponsored legislation introduced \nby Maryland Democrat Ben Cardin that would create a national blue alert \nsystem aimed at apprehending criminals who injure or kill law \nenforcement officials.\n  Modeled after the Amber Alert System used to find missing children, \nthe blue alert system would disseminate critical information about \nsuspected criminals to other law enforcement agencies, the public, and \nthe media. When someone has gunned down a police officer, police \ndepartments all over the region, the State, and the country need to \nknow about it. Blue alerts would be broadcast to local media and on \nmessaging signs. It would include a detailed description of the \nsuspect, the vehicle, and other identifying information. It would \nencourage State and local governments to develop additional protocols \nto help apprehend suspects.\n  Eleven States already have such a system, but if it is only on the \nState level and the perpetrator who killed the police officer escapes \nto another State that doesn't have it, it doesn't work so well. That is \nwhy Senator Cardin's national blue alert bill is so important.\n  Ohio doesn't have this. I am encouraged that the Ohio Senate recently \npassed a version of this law. Again, it needs to be national so that it \ngoes\n\n[[Page S8724]]\n\nacross State lines, and we can obviously do that as police departments \nare talking to each other more than they ever have through technology.\n  I spoke to police chiefs from across Ohio like my city of Lorain, OH. \nCel Rivera, the chief there, said the blue alert system would be a \ncritical resource to track down criminals and to protect law \nenforcement. It would be made possible with existing community-oriented \npolicing services such as, the COPS Program funded by the Department of \nJustice.\n  I remember 15, 18 years ago when the COPS Program began with \nPresident Clinton and the Congress in the 1990s. It made such a \ndifference in helping local communities, small towns, big cities, rural \nareas, suburbs, to be able to staff up in a better way with community \npolice officers.\n  It is these types of Federal investments that are so critical for \ncommunities facing significant budget shortfalls. Too many communities \nare forced to make cutbacks in essential services reducing staff size \nand scaling back investments on safety equipment. These choices are \ndifficult, and they are made with great reluctance. That is why Federal \ngrants such as the staffing for adequate fire and emergency response, \nso-called SAFER grants, or the assistance for the firefighters grant \nare critical to help communities hire more firefighters as well as \nrecruit and retain first responders. The omnibus bill we are \nconsidering now will provide much needed investments that will help \ncommunities do that.\n  While I fight for stronger investments, it is clear every little bit \nhelps. Earlier this week the Chillicothe Fire Department received a \nfunded grant through the AFG Program. It follows the SAFER grant that \nnot only helped hire personnel, it saves lives. Fire Chief Steve \nGallacher, whom I have spoken with prior to this, was off duty when he \nexperienced a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot to the lung. Without a \ngrant that kept his neighborhood firehouse open or without the medic \nwho was hired because of the AFG grant, Chief Gallagher says he would \nhave died.\n  These Federal investments literally helped to save Chief Gallacher's \nlife. According to him, 40 percent of deaths among firefighters occur \ndue to cardiac arrest. He wrote to me:\n\n       When I helped write the grant application, I knew that it \n     would save lives. But I never imagined that one of those \n     lives would be my own.\n\n  With reduced tax revenues, with the increased need of vital public \nservices such as fire and police, it is critical we help our \ncommunities carry out the most basic and lifesaving duties. We can keep \nfirst responders and firefighters and officials on the job.\n  We can establish an alert system to warn us when criminals seek to \nharm law enforcement officials. These are bipartisan actions that can \nhelp communities across Ohio and throughout the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8724-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8724-S8726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RESOLVING ISSUES AND VOTING RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, at the late hour, as the Senate \ncontinues to try to do its work, there is word that maybe--as the Good \nBook says: ``Come, let us reason together''--maybe there is some \nmovement in bringing about some consensus-building so the people's work \ncan be done and these issues that have kept us apart for so long can \nfinally be resolved. Maybe they will be resolved only on a temporary \nbasis. But at least we would be in a situation where we did not allow \nthe tax cuts for Social Security payments that would be such--if those \ntax cuts did not continue, there would be an immediate amount more that \npeople will have to pay out of their pocket. Maybe those will continue. \nIt is certainly the right thing to do.\n  It is also the right thing to do to keep unemployment compensation \ngoing in a time of a recession, when so many people are out of work, \nand they do not have the opportunity to get work or only get what they \ncan piece together, which is not enough to sustain their families. That \nis the right thing to do. Certainly passing the funding bills to keep \nthe government going past midnight tonight is clearly the right thing \nto do, instead of extraneous issues holding us up, to having us all \nwound around the axle where we can't even fund the Government of the \nUnited States. So maybe some reasonable minds are coming together to \nstart working out these issues. I certainly hope so.\n  In the meantime, what I wish to speak about is something that is even \nmore pernicious and that is making it harder for our people to express \ntheir constitutional right of casting a vote. We have seen a pattern in \n14 States, enacting new election laws that basically are a suppression \nof voter rights. One of those States that is glaringly, dubiously at \nthe top of the list as being the most severe in cutting back on \npeople's ability to vote and to know the vote they have cast is going \nto be counted as they intended it--and, in the first place, making it \nso they can register to vote--that very fundamental constitutional \nright for Americans is being threatened through these laws in the \nStates, including my State, of suppressing the right to vote.\n  If we look at the similarities of the laws in the 14 States, we will \nsee an obvious pattern. But in my State of Florida, we see the most \nsevere assault on the rights of voters of all the 14 States. The \npresent issue is joined in a court in the District of Columbia, a suit \nironically brought by the State of Florida against the Department of \nJustice over the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and its implementation. A \npart of that suit actually questions the constitutionality of the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965. That is a rather brazen attempt, but I think \nthe courts will take care of that in short order.\n  But the very issue, as brought in this new Florida elections law, \ndoes a number of things to cut back on the rights of voters. In the \nfirst place, the League of Women Voters, which has been registering \nvoters for years, has stopped its registration of voters because of the \nnew law. Why? Because the old law on the books for decades said that \nonce an organization such as the League of Women Voters registered the \nnew voters, they had 10 days to turn that in to the respective \nsupervisors of elections in the 67 counties. The new elections law \namended that to 48 hours, and they attached to that the possibility of \na fine that could go up to $1,000 per person on the person doing the \nregistration if they did not turn in the names in 48 hours. Of course, \nwe had the two cases of two civics teachers in two different parts of \nthe State who, being good teachers, in their government class were \nregistering their students to vote and did not meet the 48-hour \ndeadline and the State of Florida is looking at the possibility of \nfining these teachers. That is the height of hypocrisy. That is the \nheight of an assault on the right of people to vote by impeding their \nability to register to vote.\n  The intended result is there. The League of Women Voters is just one \norganization. There are many. But it shows what has happened; that all \nthe registrations that would occur of people being encouraged to \nparticipate in the political system is not being done and will not be \ndone until this issue is settled in the courts, and that is probably \ngoing to be late summer. So for the period of over 1 year, since the \npassing of this new law in Florida, voters will not be registered by \norganizations such as the League of Women Voters. That is a sad \ncommentary, but in fact that is what has happened. That is what has \nhappened in the State of Florida.\n  But that is not all. Let me tell my colleagues what else the law \ndoes. My colleagues remember how college students got so active for the \nfirst time in a Presidential election. When the Presiding Officer and I \nwere coming up in college, we were taught that public service was one \nof the highest callings a person could have. We were also taught that \nto be a participant in our democracy was a civic responsibility. But \nover the intervening years, after the Vietnam war, after a number of \nother circumstances, young people got turned off to politics and \ngovernment. Then we saw them in this past Presidential election \nbecoming energized once again. They went down in the cities where they \nwent to school and they registered in great numbers. Then, on election \nday, they turned out in great numbers. Do my colleagues know what the \nState of Florida did in passing the\n\n[[Page S8725]]\n\nnew elections law? They changed the law which said that when a college \nstudent goes down there on election day to vote and they bring out \ntheir identification to show they are who they say they are and they \ncompare their driver's license identification and address to the voting \nregistration in the college town, if that driver's license, which \nlikely shows their parents' address, if it is in a different county, \nthey will not give them a ballot. They will give them a provisional \nballot. As a result, we saw in the last Presidential election in \nFlorida half the provisional ballots cast were not counted.\n  This is a blatant attempt to cut out a certain element or to make it \nmore difficult, all under the guise that they are trying to weed out \nfraud. We haven't had a lot of voter fraud in our State of Florida, and \nI daresay we would find the same in the other 13 States that enacted \nthese very repressive laws.\n  But that is not all. The law goes on further to restrict voters' \nrights by cutting back on the number of days of early voting. Why did \nwe have early voting? In our State, we went through the trauma of the \nPresidential election of 2000, when there was so much confusion about \nwhether the ballot was intended to be this way, and people were \nconfused with the way the ballot was constructed. It went on and on and \non. We know the high drama that ended in the Supreme Court of Bush v. \nGore. Because of that trauma, many State legislatures decided to try to \nmake it easier to vote. One way to vote so there was less confusion was \nto allow what other States have done, which is to let part of the \nvoting occur before election day--early voting. Then a person can take \ntheir time going in. People don't have to be confined to voting within \na 12-hour period from 7 o'clock in the morning until 7 o'clock at \nnight, with the long lines and perhaps inclement weather, with a \npouring down rainstorm or snowstorm, to inhibit people's ability to \nexercise their right to vote.\n  So legislatures across this country started enacting early voting. In \nFlorida, that early voting period was 2 weeks. The 2 weeks went all the \nway up through the Sunday before the Tuesday election. Lo and behold, \nin the last Presidential election, because of early voting, 40 percent \nof the electorate of Florida voted before election day.\n  You certainly know the supervisors of election liked that because \nthen on the election day, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., there was 60 percent \nof the vote--not 100 percent of the vote--and, therefore, it was much \nmore manageable, even though there was an extremely high turnout \nbecause it was in a Presidential election.\n  Well, by constricting, as the Florida law did, from 14 days to 8 \ndays, they are limiting that ability. They cut it back. Instead of the \nSunday before the Tuesday election, the last day of the eighth day will \nbe the Saturday before the Tuesday election.\n  On the basis of the experience of the last decade, guess who voted in \nrecord numbers on the Sunday before the Tuesday election after church. \nCertain minority groups, in record numbers. Therefore, it is again an \nattempt at suppressing that particular vote.\n  Why cannot we use walking-around common sense that would say we want \nto help people, to facilitate people, to make it easier for them to \ncast their vote, make it easier for them to register to vote; and then, \nonce they have cast that vote, to do it in a manner where they know \nexactly what they are doing, lessen the amount of mistakes, and have \nthe security of mind of knowing that the vote was going to be counted \nas they intended it? Yet we see laws have been passed in a number of \nStates to the contrary.\n  It is my hope--it is the hope of a lot of people across this country, \nwho care about one of the most fundamental rights of being a citizen of \nthe United States of America: the right to vote; a right, a \nconstitutional right that casts us in contrast to a lot of other \ncountries on the face of planet Earth--it is my hope, as the court \ndeliberates and renders its judgment, the Constitution of the United \nStates will be upheld.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I previously filed committee allocations \nand budgetary aggregates pursuant to section 106 of the Budget Control \nAct of 2011. Today, I am further adjusting some of those levels, \nspecifically the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations for \nfiscal year 2012 and the budgetary aggregates for fiscal year 2012.\n  Section 101 of the Budget Control Act allows for various adjustments \nto the statutory limits on discretionary spending, while section 106(d) \nallows the Chairman of the Budget Committee to make revisions to \nallocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. \nThe Senate will soon be considering the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 2055, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, as well as H.R. \n3672, the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2012. I previously made \nadjustments pursuant to the Budget Control Act to the allocation to the \nCommittee on Appropriations and to the spending aggregates for items \ncontained in H.R. 2055 and H.R. 3672, including funding designated for \noverseas contingency operations, disaster relief, emergencies, and \nprogram integrity. I am now revising those prior adjustments to reflect \nthe final amounts contained in the two pieces of legislation. When \ncompared to my previous adjustments, the combined effect of H.R. 2055 \nand H.R. 3672 is to increase budget authority by $2.302 billion and \nlower outlays by $0.286 billion in 2012.\n  With these revisions, I have now made adjustments to budget authority \nin 2012 pursuant to the Budget Control Act of $137.48 billion. That \ntotal breaks down as follows: $126.544 billion for overseas contingency \noperations, $10.453 billion for disaster relief, and $0.483 billion for \nprogram integrity initiatives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the \nchanges to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the \nbudgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          BUDGETARY AGGREGATES\n (Pursuant to section 106(b)(1)(C) of the Budget Control Act of 2011

I would like to \nrecognize the entire 25th Infantry Division for their service in Iraq \nand Afghanistan over the past decade. I would also like to pay my \nrespects and give my deepest condolences to the families of the 236 \nmembers of the 25th Infantry Division who made the ultimate sacrifice \nwhile serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, defending the American values \nand freedoms we enjoy.\n  Although I cannot be there in person, I send my warmest aloha and \nheartfelt gratitude to these soldiers and their families for their many \nsacrifices and dutiful service to our country.\n  Since its activation on October 1, 1941, the 25th Infantry Division \nhas played a significant role in every major conflict we have had. In \nthat tradition of outstanding service, the 6 major elements of the 25th \nInfantry Division--the division headquarters, the 4 brigade combat \nteams, and the combat aviation brigade--have made a total of 19 combat \ndeployments since 2004. Thirteen of these deployments were to Iraq and \nanother six were to Afghanistan. In addition, three separate Tropic \nLightning battalion-sized aviation task forces have deployed to Iraq.\n\n[[Page S8727]]\n\n  I commend MG Bernard S.

Mr. President, Vermont and other the other States still \nreeling in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene have a huge stake in the \nmisguided offset resolution sent to us by the House of Representatives. \nIn fact, all Americans have a stake in this.\n  On the heels of unprecedented flooding this spring, the State of \nVermont bore the full brunt of Irene in August. Our small State is \nstretched to the limit right now. Our people need the helping hand of \nFederal disaster recovery programs just as Vermonters, decade after \ndecade, have always supported this safety net when other States have \nneeded it.\n  These programs were already running on fumes before Irene and now the \nneed is even greater in this tough year in which 48 States have had \nFederal disasters declared within their borders.\n  The Senate promptly started the effort to replenish the depleted \ndisaster funds with a strong and responsible stand-alone bill in \nSeptember. Our legislation is within the bounds of the budget agreement \nreached this summer, and after overcoming a partisan filibuster, we got \nthat bill through the Senate in a bipartisan vote.\n  Now all these months later the House of Representatives sends us a \nsmaller disaster aid bill along with a resolution that calls for the \nnew disaster spending to be offset. In other words, undo the bipartisan \nbudget agreement that we all agreed to back in August; change the long \npractice of Americans promptly helping fellow Americans in a disaster's \naftermath; and pit disaster victims against those trying to get a loan \nto start their small business, those needing student loans, those \nneeding nutrition and housing assistance, those developing alternative \nenergy sources, or those performing cutting-edge research against \ndisease.\n  The House resolution calling for disaster funding to be offset with \nacross-the-board cuts is a weak and cynical response, and it should be \nrejected.\n  It is disappointing and incomprehensible that some in Congress \ncontinue to insist that assistance can only come at the cost of other \nprograms relied upon by the American people. Some of these same voices \nhad no problem with spending hundreds of billions of borrowed dollars \non wars waged overseas, on rebuilding communities in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and on giving tax breaks to the wealthiest among us. But \nnow they insist on a different standard, different rules, for emergency \nrecovery efforts desperately needed by Americans here at home. That is \njust wrong.\n  We need to come together as a country, as we always have in the past, \nto pass an emergency disaster bill that is adequate to the devastation \nfaced by Vermonters and millions of other Americans. We are bound \ntogether as one nation, the United States. Americans help each other in \ntime of need.\n  I know there are bipartisan majorities for passing a straightforward \ndisaster relief package as we have for every other disaster in the \npast, but political point-scoring and my-way-or-no-way factionalism \nstand in the way. That is unconscionable.\n  Vermonters and countless others who are trying to get back on their \nfeet after Irene and other calamities across our Nation do not have the \nluxury of time to waste on the temper tantrums of ideological factions \nin Congress. It is winter now; a harsh season in our part of the \ncountry. Some parts of Vermont already have seen over a foot of snow \nand more is on the way.\n  Statesmanship should never be out of season least of all, when our \nfellow Americans' livelihoods are at stake.\n  In the spirit of the holiday season, I continue to hope that reason \nand goodwill will prevail in the Senate on this ridiculous call to \noffset disaster relief, and on so many other issues before us that are \ncritical to the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8727-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8727-S8728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                375TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Today I rise to commemorate the 375th anniversary of \nthe National Guard. As ceremonies are held across the country to \ncelebrate this historic milestone, I wanted to pay tribute to our \nNational Guard for the enormous contributions it has made to our \ncountry throughout the course of its proud history. The origin of the \nNational Guard traces its roots back to the militias of the 13 original \nEnglish colonies. The oldest units were organized on December 13, 1636, \nin the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n  As the motto of the National Guard so aptly puts it, the force is \n``Always Ready, Always There.'' Our Constitution bestows on the \nNational Guard dual State and Federal missions. Whether aiding State \nlaw enforcement, responding to a national emergency or catastrophic \nnatural disaster, or serving alongside our Active-Duty Forces overseas, \nthe National Guard has always been and continues to be a force on which \nwe can depend, in wartime and in peacetime.\n  Rhode Island has a distinguished record of National Guard service, \nwhich began in 1638 when the first colonial defensive force was \nestablished in Portsmouth, RI. The militia, which was known as the \nTraine Band, was formed to provide protection and security for the \npeople. The group eventually evolved into the Rhode Island National \nGuard.\n  It was the Rhode Island militia that first engaged in offensive \naction against England during the lead up to the Revolutionary War. On \nJuly 19, 1769, members of the Rhode Island militia sunk the British \nschooner HMS Liberty in Newport. A few years later, on the night of \nJune 10, 1772, Rhode Island volunteers organized under Captain Abraham \nWhipple, seized and burned the HMS Gaspee in Narragansett Bay. Then, on \nApril 22, 1775, in response to shots fired at Lexington, MA, the Rhode \nIsland General Assembly mobilized a 1,500-man ``Army of Observation'' \nto serve under the command of BG Nathaniel Greene. This force was sent \nto Boston to support the Continental Army in its fight for American \nindependence. By the end of the Revolutionary War, more than 22 Rhode \nIsland militia units had contributed to our country's glorious cause.\n  During the Civil War, more than 23,000 Rhode Island militiamen \ndeployed in support of Union forces, and 16 soldiers received Medals of \nHonor. During the First World War, more than 3,800 members of the Rhode \nIsland National Guard served in combat as part of the 26th ``Yankee'' \nDivision. Furthermore, over 3,000 Rhode Island National Guard members \nwere deployed to both the European and Pacific theaters to support \noperations in the Second World War. Rhode Island National Guard units \nalso supported operations during the Korean and Vietnam wars, as well \nas Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm.\n  The Rhode Island National Guard has been particularly active meeting \nthe operational demands of the post-9/11 era. Rhode Island has the \nsecond highest per capita National Guard deployment rate of all the \nStates. It has fulfilled over 5,600 deployment requests, and many of \nits 3,200 members have deployed multiple times. In addition, the Rhode \nIsland National Guard remains an indispensable asset in protecting the \nlives and property of Rhode Island citizens. The Guard played an \ninstrumental role in 2010 responding to the historic floods in our \nState, from which we are still recovering. Today, the diverse mission \nof the Rhode Island National Guard is directed by MG Kevin R. McBride, \nadjutant general of the State of Rhode Island.\n  Since September 11, the National Guard has been deployed at \nunprecedented levels, with over 650,000 soldiers\n\n[[Page S8728]]\n\nand airmen mobilized in support of American operations overseas. In \naddition, thousands of National Guard members have responded to the \nlitany of major disasters that devastated several areas of the country \nin the recent years. I applaud the National Guard for its vital work in \nprotecting our country at home and abroad and commend its 375 years of \ndedicated service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8728-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO GUION S.

Bluford, Jr. for being the 2011 recipient of the \nPennsylvania Society Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement.\n  Mr. Bluford was born on November 22, 1942, to Guion Senior and Lolita \nBluford in Philadelphia, PA. Mr. Bluford grew up in inner-city \nPhiladelphia during a time of great prejudice and social change. As a \nyouth he spent his free time reading about aviation technology, \nbuilding model aircrafts, and dreaming of flying aircrafts.\n  Mr. Bluford attended Pennsylvania State University and joined the Air \nForce ROTC Program, receiving his FAA pilot license while still a \nsenior in college. After graduating college in 1964 Mr. Bluford was \nassigned to the 556th Tactical Fighter Squadron in Vietnam and flew \nover 140 combat missions in Southeast Asia.\n  In 1978, Mr. Bluford was selected as one of NASA's class of 35 \nastronauts. On August 30, 1980, Mr. Bluford became America's first \nAfrican American in space when he flew to orbit aboard the shuttle \nChallenger. During his career at NASA he flew on several other space \nmissions, and when he retired in July 1993, he had logged more than 688 \nhours in space.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. \nGuion S. Bluford, Jr., for his years of service to our country. I \ninvite my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Bluford for his \nrecent award and wish him well in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8728-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARTY PETERSON\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, today I join with Idaho's senior Senator \nMike Crapo to recognize and pay tribute to the exceptional dedication \nof Marty Peterson, who is retiring after 51 years of public service in \nour great State.\n  For nearly 20 years, Marty has served as the special assistant to the \npresident of the University of Idaho. He has served seven U of I \npresidents during that time, giving them valuable insight into the \npolitics of the State as he oversaw the government affairs work of the \nuniversity.\n  Marty has an in-depth understanding of Idaho's government, having \nserved as the budget director under Governors John Evans and Cecil \nAndrus. He also served on the staff of U.S. Senator Frank Church and \nwas executive director of the Association of Idaho Cities. His counsel \nwas always valuable and insightful.\n  It is no wonder, when Idaho was going to celebrate its 100th birthday \nin 1990, he was asked to oversee the planning and implementation of the \nState's centennial celebration. Twenty years later, he was the cochair \nof the committee that planned the rededication of Idaho's newly \nrestored capitol building. Marty could always be counted on to deliver \nquality results.\n  His education and military service may have had something to do with \nhis success. At the age of 17, as a junior in high school, he joined \nthe Army National Guard. Marty served 8 years and was a staff sergeant \nwhen he was discharged.\n  Marty is a graduate of Columbia Basin College, the University of \nIdaho, and Harvard University's Senior Managers in Government Program. \nBut through the years, Marty never stopped learning. He adapted, he \nstudied and continued to provide good counsel to those who sought out \nhis advice.\n  He consistently shares his time and expertise with community groups. \nCurrently, he serves on the board of directors of the Foundation for \nIdaho History, North Idaho Chamber of Commerce, Idaho Humanities \nCouncil, and the James A. and Louise McClure Center for Public Policy, \nas well as on the advisory board for the School of Journalism and Mass \nMedia at the University of Idaho.\n  In addition, he is the current president of the Historic Silver City \nFoundation and a past president of the City Club of Boise and the Idaho \nHemingway House Foundation.\n  As a well-known Hemingway scholar, Marty has lectured on Hemingway \nthroughout the United States, Spain, and Cuba. He has also been very \ninvolved in the preservation of Ernest Hemingway's home in Ketchum, ID \nand in Cuba.\n  Although Marty will be retiring from the working world at the end of \n2011, we know he will continue serving these and other groups \nthroughout the State. His retirement will give him more time to spend \nwith his wife Barb and their family and especially the grandchildren.\n  When people ask us what makes Idaho such a great place, we could talk \nabout the beautiful mountains, skiing, whitewater rafting, hunting and \nfishing, or a myriad of other things. But in reality, it is people such \nas Marty Peterson who work to make Idaho even better--that is why Idaho \nis so great.\n  It is with our sincere thanks and well wishes that Senator Crapo and \nI recognize Marty Peterson for his many contributions to the State of \nIdaho and its people. We wish him a happy and productive retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8728-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8728-S8729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ANNIVERSARY OF BELARUS ELECTION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \ncourageous men and women who are struggling for freedom in Belarus.\n  Almost 1 year ago, on December 19, 2010, elections took place in \nBelarus. At that time, some in the United States and Europe hoped that \nthis vote would be a turning point for Belarus and that its \nauthoritarian ruler, Aleksandr Lukashenko, would finally begin to \npursue the political and economic reforms demanded by his people.\n  In fact, the December 19 election was a turning point for Belarus--\nbut not in the way that some had hoped. It soon became obvious that the \nelection had been egregiously rigged by the regime. In response, \nthousands of Belarusians from every background peacefully took to the \nstreets in protest. It was the most significant public demonstration \nthe country had seen in over a half decade, and the Lukashenko regime \nresponded with violence.\n  On that day, Belarusian security forces detained or arrested over 600 \npeaceful protestors. Hundreds more were surrounded by armored tanks and \nbeaten by thugs dispatched by the regime. The Lukashenko regime \narrested seven opposition candidates who participated in the vote, \nseverely beating one candidate. In the year that has followed the \nelection, hundreds of people--including several Presidential \ncandidates--have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms in sham trials \nthat have again revealed Belarus' judicial system to be nothing more \nthan a political tool abused by the regime. It is a system that has \ninstitutionalized torture and denies its prisoners access to family, \nlawyers, medical treatment, and open legal proceedings.\n  I should note that the peaceful protests that erupted in Belarus 1 \nyear ago took place just 2 days after a 26-year-old man in the Tunisian \ntown of Sidi Bouzid set himself on fire, which in turn sparked a series \nof peaceful protests that overthrew the long-ruling dictator in that \ncountry--starting the Arab Spring. But as the winds of change sweep \nacross north Africa and the Middle East, ousting some of the world's \nmost entrenched regimes, it is important for us to remember that there \nremains one last dictatorship in Europe; that is, the Lukashenko regime \nin Belarus.\n  Despite the extraordinary changes taking place around the world, the \nLukashenko regime has sustained, and even intensified, its crackdown \nagainst its own people. This is a regime that recently outlawed nearly \nall forms of public speech and peaceful assembly, including silent \nprotest. It is a regime that, instead of responding to the legitimate \ndemands of its people, has sought to cultivate close ties with other \ndictatorships, like the regime in Tehran. It is a regime that, \naccording to reports, delivered military equipment to the Qadhafi \nregime in Libya in February 2011 just as it prepared to slaughter its \nown people.\n\n[[Page S8729]]\n\n  Over the past year, I have been encouraged by the close cooperation \nbetween the United States and the European Union to hold accountable \nthose in Belarus who are responsible for the brutal crackdown there. \nContinued transatlantic coordination on Belarus is vital. The Euro-\nAtlantic community of democracies must speak with one voice to ratchet \nup pressure on Lukashenko. And while the United States and the EU have \ntaken strong and important steps, including imposing travel bans on \nnearly 200 Belarusian officials, freezing the assets that these \nofficials hold in the West, and both renewing and imposing new \nsanctions on Belarusian state-owned enterprises, more can be done.\n  In particular, I hope that in the weeks ahead, the United States and \nthe EU will implement sanctions against other state-owned entities that \nenrich the Lukashenko regime at the expense of the Belarusian people.\n  Furthermore, it is critical that at a moment when the Lukashenko \nregime is looking for a financial lifeline to keep himself in power, \nthe United States and our allies work together to ensure that \nresponsible international institutions and actors--including the IMF--\ndo not lend money to that regime. It is clear--as we have seen over the \npast 2 years--that such funds will only be used by Lukashenko to prop \nup his illegitimate and repressive rule. And I continue to urge our own \ngovernment to state publicly that the United States will not support \nany further IMF assistance to Belarus until we see credible political \nand economic reforms by Belarusian authorities, beginning with the \nimmediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners in \nBelarus.\n  At the same time we are shocked and appalled by the cruelty and \nthuggishness of the Lukashenko regime, we should also take note of the \nremarkable courage and perseverance of the Belarusian people, who press \non in their struggle for greater freedom and opportunity.\n  Over the past year, I have been honored to meet with Belarusian \nopposition leaders and activists. These conversations have been \nextremely powerful, as I have heard directly from the men and women who \nare facing repression on the front lines and looking for help from us \nin their noble struggle.\n  Today, I join my colleagues in saying to the brave people in Belarus \nwho are striving to secure their fundamental freedoms: We have not and \nwill not forget about you and your important cause. We remember your \nnames. We will stand in solidarity with you and in support of you until \nyou achieve your goal, which is a free and democratic Belarus. And we \nbelieve more than ever that the day will come when Belarus will be \nfree.\n  The extraordinary revolutions that are taking place across the Middle \nEast and north Africa should remind us all that the United States does \nbest in the world when we stand with our values and the people who \nshare them. And there is much we can do to help the Belarusian people.\n  To begin with, we must work with our European allies to ensure that \nthe financial and technical assistance we have pledged to the \nBelarusian opposition is disbursed and implemented as quickly as \npossible, particularly for groups operating inside of Belarus. And we \nin Washington must continue to engage with the Belarusian opposition \nand its emerging leaders, and lend them our support.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I do not know when Belarus will be \nfree, but I have no doubt that someday it will be free. I am confident \nthat the future of Belarus belongs not to Lukashenko and his thugs but \nto the Belarusian people.\n  Indeed, the future of Belarus belongs to the dissidents who are in \njail or who are being harassed--to Ales Byalitski, the founder of \nBelarus' largest human rights organization who recently celebrated his \n49th birthday in prison. It belongs to Alyaksandr Klaskouski, a 33-\nyear-old former traffic police officer in Minsk who pleaded with \nsecurity forces on December 19 not to use force against peaceful \nprotestors and who himself stood between riot police and unarmed \nprotestors. He, too, is now serving time in a maximum security prison \nfor his efforts. The future of Belarus belongs also to Natalia Kaliada, \nthe director of the Belarus Free Theatre, who was arrested on December \n19 but continues to press on in her work--to fight dictatorship with \nart. Natalia does this, as she put it in January when she testified \nbefore the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, because ``we want our \nspectators to think. When people start thinking, this is the most \nterrifying thing for a dictator.''\n  The future of Belarus belongs to every Belarusian who seeks a \nbrighter future for their country--a future of democracy and \nopportunity. And we stand with them in their cause on this anniversary \nof the December 19, 2010, election--and on every anniversary to come, \nuntil Belarus is free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8729-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MARK JICKLING, CRS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I want to recognize Mark \nJickling, a dedicated public servant who has served as a financial \neconomist with the Congressional Research Service and is retiring after \nnearly 33 years of providing expert analyses to the U.S. Congress on \neconomic, finance and securities matters. He is widely respected in the \nSenate and House of Representatives, as well as among his CRS \ncolleagues, for his broad knowledge and insights into financial and \neconomic matters as well as his professionalism and collegiality. \nThanks to his dedicated efforts, Congress has been better informed as \nit has sought to find legislative solutions to many of the issues \nfacing the United States financial system.\n  Mr. Jickling graduated from the University of California at Berkeley \nand started work at the Library of Congress part-time with the \nCollections Management Division. His dedication and intellect led to \nhis becoming an expert in economic matters about which he consistently \ndelivered comprehensive, insightful and helpful analyses. He rose \nthrough the ranks to become an economist reaching the level of \nspecialist, the highest level of analyst at CRS. He headed the Banking, \nInsurance, Securities and Macroeconomic Policy Section in the \nGovernment and Finance Division of CRS from 2005 to 2007, in which he \noversaw the work of a dozen other analysts and specialists. He is the \nauthor or co-author of 100 CRS reports and countless confidential \nmemos.\n  Mr. Jickling has worked on some of the most significant securities \nand banking issues facing the country. He wrote the first CRS reports \non the impacts of the September 11 attacks on the markets and on the \nEnron scandal. At that time, he also coordinated CRS' internal ``Enron \ngroup.'' He assisted senior Congressional staff as they formulated \nlegislative responses to the corporate accountability scandals.\n  From the onset of the recent financial crisis, Mr. Jickling has been \ninstrumental in assisting Congress as we addressed the serious banking \nand market problems facing the country. He provided expert analysis on \na daily basis to the Banking Committee and to others in Congress on \nhousing finance, non-bank financial intermediation, financial \nderivatives, exotic financial products and markets, and many other \nissues. His dedication was shown by his working nights and weekends \nduring this period. He significantly contributed to the quality of \nlegislation that ultimately was enacted and cooperated effectively with \nMembers and their staffs to produce the legislation. He was exactly the \nright person at the right time.\n  Mr. Jickling retires from the CRS having set a standard of superior \nservice and having assisted a generation of CRS analysts in developing \ntheir skills. He leaves CRS to spend more time with his family and \npursue some of his other interests, including the professional \nperformance of music. His many accomplishments will remain a fitting \ntribute to his career and character.\n  Mr. Jickling will be greatly missed. I wish him and his family all \nthe best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8729-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8729-S8730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO DON DIXON\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Don \nDixon, who is retiring from Senate service. Don has been a trusted \nadvisor and dear friend for many years.\n  Approximately 15 years ago, I was blessed to have Don join my staff \nas my State director of agriculture. He\n\n[[Page S8730]]\n\nbrought to the position his experience as a farmer and his sincere \ndedication to solving challenges facing the agricultural community. \nThroughout his Senate service, Don has covered thousands of miles and \nspent countless hours meeting with constituents and ensuring that their \nconcerns and interests are properly addressed. It has been said that \nanytime two farmers meet in Idaho, Don is there. This illustration, \nwhile not too far from the truth, emphasizes Don's deep personal \ncommitment to ensuring sound representation of Idaho agriculture. For \nexample, he has assisted with multiple farm bills, gathering input from \nIdahoans to craft the best policy possible, contributing throughout the \ndrafting and providing information to farmers and ranchers when the \nlaws were enacted. He sacrificed weeks with his family when he stayed \nin Washington, DC, to assist with the crafting of the 2002 farm bill. I \nhave always been able to count on Don to literally go the extra mile \nfor constituents.\n  Don's dedication and exemplary service led to his appointment to \nserve as the Idaho State executive director of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's Farm Service Agency, FSA. While this appointment, \nunfortunately, led to Don leaving my staff for the first time in 2007, \nhis work on behalf of the agricultural community during his time at FSA \nand his return to Senate service were welcomed. I feel blessed to have \nonce again benefited from his on-the-ground knowledge of production and \nagricultural policy for the past 3 years.\n  His enthusiasm and sincere desire to do all that he can for people \nare part of what make Don exceptional. His unsurpassed energy, faith, \nand optimism also set him apart. The humor and get-up-and-go Don brings \nto any challenge has enabled many accomplishments for Idahoans, and Don \nis widely respected for his integrity and devotion to achieving \nresults.\n  Although for many, retirement provides time to slow down and relax, \nknowing Don, he will likely work as hard in his retirement as he does \non the job. ``Idle'' is not a word in Don's vocabulary. However, I hope \nthat retirement provides Don with more time to spend with his family \nwhom he loves so much: his wonderful wife Georgia; his children \nLucinda, ``Cindy,'' Lorin, Paul, and Tobin; eight grandchildren; and \nsix great-grandchildren. Lucky for me, Don is also one of my neighbors \nin my hometown of Idaho Falls, so I hope to see him often. We have \nshared many laughs over the years, and I look forward to sharing many \nmore.\n  Don, you are model public servant, and I feel very fortunate to have \nbenefitted from your wise counsel and hard work for so many years. I \nwish you the happy retirement you so greatly deserve for your years of \ndedicated service. Don, thank you for all that you have done on behalf \nof Idahoans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8730-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO FRANKLIN OTIS CARROLL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to \nrecognize and honor the public service of Mr. Franklin Otis Carroll, \nwho is retiring from the U.S. Forest Service after 45 years of \ndedicated service to protecting our Nation's natural resources.\n  Frank was born on September 18, 1952, to Franklin and Betty Carroll, \nin Flagstaff, AZ. Blessed with a gift for expressing his opinion, Frank \nbelieved early in life that he was destined to pursue a career in the \nlegal profession. But as he worked to pay for school, he took a job \nwith the National Park Service as a firefighter at southern Arizona's \nSaguaro National Monument. From then on, he sought to follow in his \nfather's footsteps and care for the lands we all enjoy. He has since \nserved in four National Parks and in Forest Service Regions 2, 3, and \n4--travelling from Arizona to Idaho to Minnesota before settling in the \nBlack Hills of South Dakota.\n  Frank earned a degree in history and English at the University of New \nMexico and a Masters Degree in Public Administration at Boise State. He \nand Audrey, his wife of nearly 34 years, raised three girls--Jessica, \nLauren and Merri--and are looking forward to spending more time with \ntheir seven grandchildren.\n  Over the years, Frank has worked tirelessly to protect our public \nlands, first working on hand crews, then working his way up the ranks \nto becoming a top level fire boss. He has been a respected spokesman \nfor forest health and land management practices that keep our lands \ngreen as we battle the Mountain Pine Beetle. Proactive in educating the \npublic about our lands, Frank is the first person to pick up the phone \nto explain what is happening in the forest. During his tenure, Frank \nhas built lifelong friendships with a wide variety of folks that \ncontinue to this day.\n  Rick Cables, a former Regional Forester for Region 2 who has known \nFrank for 35 years, describes Frank as, ``one of the most passionate \nand dedicated individuals in protecting our public lands that I have \never known. He is a talented communicator whose unique gift for \ncommunicating allows him to convey complex forest issues in simple \nterms so all can understand. When the Black Hills National Forest was \nlooking to establish its new Forest Advisory Board, I could think of no \none better to help in the process. I remember telling the supervisor at \nthe time, John Twiss, he's someone that will push you harder to \ncommunicate more than you may want.''\n  Frank's life work has been the protection of public lands and he has \ndone so with an intense love of the places where he lives. It is \nbecause of the work of people like Frank Carroll that the forest \nindustry continues to thrive and maintain its crucial role throughout \nSouth Dakota.\n  I am proud to recognize and honor Frank's service to the United \nStates Forest Service and am delighted to join with his family and \nfriends in congratulating him on his retirement. I wish Frank and \nAudrey all the best as they begin a new chapter in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8730-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING VIRGINIA GABRIEL\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nVirginia Gabriel of Clarks Summit, PA, who passed away on September 26, \n2011, at the age of 93. To those who knew and loved her, she will \nforever remain an inspiration, a motivator, and a role model.\n  It is no coincidence that Virginia was born into what has been called \nthe greatest generation. Like so many others of her generation, she and \nher husband Steven responded when the country called on them during a \ntime of great need. Their commitment to the Nation was visible on the \nday of their wedding. As they exchanged their vows on the altar, \nSteven's Navy unit waited outside for the ceremony to end, at which \npoint he joined them and together they departed for their assignment, \nwhich ultimately took them to the Pacific theater. Like Steven, \nVirginia also engendered a sense of social responsibility towards our \nNation. Remaining stateside during World War II, Virginia did what she \ncould to help in the war effort. This commitment to help our Nation \ntook her to Bridgeport, CT, where she secretly worked at the Singer \nsewing machine factory throughout the war manufacturing bomber sights \nfor American aircraft.\n  Beyond Virginia's devotion to our country in its time of need, she \nwill always be remembered for her abiding commitment to her family and \nby those who profited from her presence. She made life better for \neveryone around her by lifting their spirits through her kindness, \ngenerosity, laughter, and memorable smile. Her love of family and their \nawareness of that love was an incalculable source of strength which \npropelled them forward every day. Evoking the same sentiment that \nSenator Edward Kennedy had for his brother Robert, Virginia provided \nstrength in time of trouble, wisdom in time of uncertainty, and sharing \nin time of happiness. The manner in which Virginia lived her life, and \nexpected her family to live theirs, leaves behind a legacy that ensures \nshe will always be by their side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8730-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8730-S8731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING KAKE, ALASKA\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate 100 \nyears of Kake, AK, as an incorporated first-class city. Kake Day, on \nJanuary 8, 2012, will acknowledge the community's accomplishments, \nranging from\n\n[[Page S8731]]\n\ngovernment to education, as well as recognize the village as a Native \ncommunity rich with history of the Kake Tlingit ways.\n  The Tlingit people have inhabited the region of Kake for thousands of \nyears, controlling the trade routes around Kuiu and Kupreanof islands, \nenjoying the territory, raising families, and living off the land. The \nTlingit of the Kake region gained a reputation among early explorers as \nbeing strong and powerful. Some encounters with early European and \nAmerican explorers have been documented by historians as resulting in \noccasional skirmishes.\n  In the early part of the 20th century, Kake began to physically \ntransform. Stores were built, a government school was installed, and a \npost office was established in 1904. Kake also became the first Native \nvillage to organize under Federal law, resulting in U.S. citizenship \nfor community residents. In 1912, Kake was incorporated as a first-\nclass city government in the territory of Alaska. This event is now \nknown as Kake Day, and it is the 100th anniversary of that event that I \nwish to commemorate today.\n  Kake Day is not only a celebration of past accomplishments but also a \ncelebration of the history of the Kake Tlingit ways. Kake has blended \nWestern ways and the rich cultural traditions of its past to make Kake \ninto the city it is today.\n  Recognized tribes--the Organized Village of Kake and the Central \nCouncil Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska--are essential \ncomponents of Kake, alongside entities such as the Inside Passage \nElectric Cooperative. Important food sources link the old and the new \nways of life, including salmon, halibut, shellfish, deer, bear, \nwaterfowl, and berries.\n  Nearby, standing on a bluff overlooking Kake, is the world's largest \ntotem pole, which serves as a reminder of the city's history and as a \nguide moving into the future. Standing at 132 feet, this properly \nsanctioned totem pole was carved by the Chilkats in 1967 for Alaska's \ncentennial.\n  On the 100 year celebration of Kake Day, Alaskans will enjoy a \nparade, a protocol workshop, and song and dance featuring Keex' Kwan \ndancers. I am sure the event will be memorable for all \ninvolved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/16/senate-section/article/S8731-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LEE OSTERHOLM\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I wish to discuss the life of \na great American, a fellow Montanan, and a true patriot who served his \ncountry proudly in World War II, Army SGT Lee Osterholm, a native of \nButte, MT.\n  Born on April 24, 1919, Lee served in the Border Patrol in Texas \nprior to World War II. When our country was thrust into war, Lee \nanswered the call of duty, enlisting in the U.S. Army on March 8, 1943, \nand was soon on the battlefields of Central Europe fighting for our \nvery freedom.\n  Between 1943 and 1945 Lee's unwavering commitment to duty and courage \nunder fire was evident as he led men into combat throughout the \nEuropean theater and performed superbly in both the U.S. Army and U.S. \nArmy Air Corps. Sadly he never received the recognition he deserved \nonce the war ended and he was discharged on February 9, 1946.\n  Over 65 years later, his country is finally recognizing Lee's \naccomplishments by awarding him the Bronze Star posthumously. I ask \nunanimous consent that the citation to accompany this award be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Bronze Star Medal is awarded to Sergeant Lee Osterholm, \n     United States Army, Service Number 39-616-345: ``For \n     exceptionally meritorious achievement in ground operations \n     against hostile forces while assigned as Reconnaissance \n     Sergeant, Company H, 387th Infantry Regiment, 97th Infantry \n     Division, in the Central Europe Campaign, World War II. \n     Sergeant Lee Osterholm's outstanding performance of duty, \n     technical expertise, and unwavering commitment to mission \n     accomplishment in ground combat in an active war zone were \n     vital to successful combat operations in the Central Europe \n     Campaign.

A bill to reform the United States Postal Service, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Postal \nInvestment Act of 2011 which lays out many ideas to help strengthen the \nUnited States Postal Service through investment and innovation.\n  For many years, I have been an advocate for the Postal Service, its \nworkers, and importantly, postal customers. The Postal Service \nrepresents a multi-billion dollar industry on which all Americans rely \nfor delivery of mail and packages. Unfortunately, in recent years, the \ndownturn in the overall economy has negatively impacted the postal \nbusiness, exacerbating a decline in the mail because of electronic \ndiversion.\n  The 21st Century Postal Service Act, S. 1789, passed in November by \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, contains many \nneeded postal reforms and sensible compromises. Unfortunately, that \nbill also contained an unrelated measure reducing benefits for disabled \nand injured federal workers. As Chairman of the Federal Workforce \nSubcommittee, this issue concerned me enough that I had to vote against \nreporting the bill to the full Senate. However, I did think the bill \ncontained important provisions that will help the Postal Service and I \nlook forward to further debate. I am introducing the Postal Investment \nAct to add to that conversation. While this bill is not a comprehensive \napproach that can rescue the Postal Service on its own, it represents \nseveral new ideas that have not yet been debated.\n  Since 2006, we have required the Postal Service to pay roughly $5 \nbillion per year in to an account to prefund its retiree health benefit \nliability. This is a payment that no other agency, and few private \nsector companies, must make. While prefunding this liability was a \nworthy goal, and it addressed an accounting problem in the Postal \nAccountability and Enhancement Act of 2006, it is crippling the Postal \nService financially. The core of the Postal Investment Act would \nrestructure the retirement health benefit prefunding requirement and \nallow for the funds set aside against the future liability to be \ninvested in a diverse mix of government and non-government securities, \ninstead of only in government securities as is now the case.\n  There are promising precedents for investing funds in this way in the \nFederal Government. In 2001, we passed the Railroad Retirement and \nSurvivors' Improvement Act, which created a trust fund to invest \nrailroad employee retirement assets in non-government securities. \nAssets of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation also are invested in \na diversified manner. Even in the turbulent economic times of the past \nfew years, these funds have seen healthy returns on average, at a much \nhigher rate than government securities alone.\n  I want to emphasize that the funds invested are there to cover a \nfuture liability to provide benefits to workers, some of whom have not \nbeen hired yet. Because of the long time horizon and significant assets \nof this fund, I believe that diversifying its investment would mean \npositive growth for the fund over time, and would bring it in line with \nmany private sector retirement accounts. If we want the Postal Service \nto act more like a business, we could start by allowing it similar \nflexibility.\n  In addition to investing the fund, my bill would also suspend \npayments to the prefunding account in any years in which the Postal \nService does not have the profits to invest. Unfortunately, under \ncurrent law, the fund which was set up to insure against future default \nof the Postal Service is the very thing putting the Postal Service on \nthe brink of default. I believe this new approach is a responsible way \nforward, which also recognizes the legitimate goal of prefunding this \nliability over a longer term.\n  Just as importantly, the Postal Service needs more flexibility in its \nbusiness model to innovate. My bill contains several provisions to \naccelerate innovation in the Postal Service's products. Many of these \nare based on recommendations provided to Congress in a Postal \nRegulatory Commission, PRC, report released earlier this year. The bill \nwould allow for pricing flexibilities for increased premium services \nsubject to performance requirements. It would also explicitly allow the \nPostal Service, through the PRC, to create new classes of mail to meet \nevolving customer demands. For instance, there may be a market for a \nproduct with the speed of first class mail, but with none of the \nadditional services that are part of first class. The bill also \nencourages the further development of experimental products to find new \nsources of revenue.\n  In order to create more accountability for product innovation, the \nbill would require the Postmaster General to designate a Chief Product \nInnovation officer to come up with new ideas and keep the public better \ninformed of what the Postal Service is doing to find new products and \nservices. My bill would also require more focus on retaining revenues \nfor existing products by reducing uncollected postage.\n  Finally, my bill contains several provisions related to the postal \nworkforce. Like several other proposals introduced already, the bill \nwould allow the Postal Service access to excess payments it has made \nover the years to the Federal Employee Retirement System. It would use \nthose funds first to offer voluntary retirement incentives to employees \nto help right-size the workforce.\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\n  The bill also contains a provision which was developed after we were \ninformed that postal workers may not be taking full advantage of the \nbenefits of Medicare after they reach the age of eligibility. The 21st \nCentury Postal Service Act originally contained a provision which would \nhave shifted costs from the Postal Service to the Medicare program and \npostal retirees by requiring eligible retirees to sign up for Medicare \nParts A and B, and reducing the Federal Employees Health Benefit \npackage available to them. Instead, my bill would ask the Postal \nService to work with the Office of Personnel Management and the Center \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services to educate the postal workforce \nabout how the Medicare program can work to enhance their existing \nhealth benefits.\n  To address concerns that have been expressed about how the Postal \nService works with its employee unions and management organizations on \ncollective bargaining and consultation rights, the Postal Innovation \nAct offers ways to strengthen these relationships. It contains a \nprovision clarifying arbitrators' broad authority to consider the \nfactors he or she deems relevant should collective bargaining with a \nunion fail. It also contains a provision clarifying the consultation \nprocess for managers, supervisors, and postmasters. In the case of \nlabor and management agreeing to any future workforce reductions, the \nbill also clarifies that the process would be subject to existing \nprocedures for other Federal employees.\n  Additionally, as the postal workforce has begun making concessions on \npay and benefits and other contributions to the organization's \nsolvency, this bill contains a provision intended to ensure that those \nat the very top of the Postal Service share in the sacrifice. This \nprovision is modeled on an amendment drafted by Senator Tester that was \ndiscussed but never settled on during Committee consideration of postal \nreform legislation. Currently, the Postmaster General and several other \ntop executives at the Postal Service make more than $200,000 per year, \nin addition to bonuses, deferred compensation, and other benefits. I \nbelieve that running the Postal Service is public service, and the \nPostal Service simply cannot afford to treat the top management like \ncorporate executives, especially when postal employees and so many \nother Americans face pay freezes. As important as his duties are, I \nbelieve it is wrong for the Postmaster General to be paid more than the \nSecretary of Defense. My bill would tie the top pay at the Postal \nService to the Executive Level schedule used to determine pay for \nFederal executives.\n  I believe that the provisions I have outlined in this bill will serve \nas important ideas as we move forward with comprehensive postal reform. \nIt is my sincere hope that we can work out our differences on the 21st \nCentury Postal Service Act, which would be a workable proposal to \naddress the future of the Postal Service without its flawed workforce \nprovisions.\n  As we continue this debate, I hope to offer these ideas as ways to \nfurther strengthen the Postal Service and show my commitment to \npreserving that service for all Americans well into the future. I ask \nmy colleagues to consider the proposals I have put forward and work \nwith me and all members who have their own proposals to help enact \nlasting improvements for the United States Postal Service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2016. A bill to amend the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, the \nRichard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, and the Child Nutrition \nAct of 1966 to increase access to healthy food for families, to amend \nthe Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act and the Farm Security \nand Rural Investment Act of 2002 to increase access to credit for small \nand new farmers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, over the last 10 months, I have been \nworking with a diverse group of people in my State on ways to get \nhealthier food and more local agricultural products to consumers \nthroughout the country. Our group included folks from every part of the \nState, from gleaners to cattle ranchers to pear growers. Today, I am \nintroducing legislation based on my discussions with that agricultural \nadvisory group. What we came up with is a series of proposals that I \nbelieve will create agricultural jobs, increase access to healthy \nlocally grown fruits and vegetables and reduce paperwork for small \nfarmers while improving access to Federal loans.\n  This legislation, the Fresh Regional Eating for Schools and Health \nAct, or FRESH, will provide healthier choices for recipients of Federal \nprograms, push the U.S. Department of Agriculture's, USDA's, technology \nagenda forward, increase flexibility for State and local stakeholders, \nand provide better tools for small and beginning farmers.\n  For too long, the Federal Government has pushed one size fits all \nsolutions when it comes to nutrition and school lunches. That is why \nthis bill allows States to put forward innovative approaches to \nincrease nutrition outcomes for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram, SNAP, beneficiaries. Let me make it clear: under this waiver, \nno benefits will be reduced, and eligibility requirements will not be \nchanged. But States will be allowed to provide incentives for eating \nhealthy for SNAP recipients, and help those folks meet the nutritional \nguidelines the Federal Government has put out.\n  Another area where flexibility is needed is in the school lunch \nprogram. Right now, over $1 billion goes to Oregon schools to purchase \nfood for school lunches from a USDA commodity warehouse. Meanwhile, I \nhave heard time and time again from school lunch administrators in \nOregon that they would prefer to use that money locally to purchase the \nhealthy fruits and vegetables that are so plentiful in our State. This \nbill would give them the flexibility to use half of what they now get \nfrom USDA to buy local agriculture products. This approach not only \nenables schools to buy healthier food for their students but also helps \nkeep that money in their local economy and support the family farmers \ndown the road.\n  This bill also moves USDA nutrition programs into the 21st century \nwhen it comes to technology. It would push USDA to allow using \nsmartphones and tablet technology to accept SNAP benefits, just as they \ncan accept debit and credit cards today. This will open up access for \nSNAP beneficiaries to roadside food stands and farmers markets, and \nencourage innovation within the agency. SNAP recipients would also be \nallowed to use online grocery stores to purchase foods--a hugely \nhelpful option for busy moms or elderly folks for whom a grocery store \nis just too hard to get to. For the WIC program, state agencies will be \nallowed to use technologies like videoconferencing to keep costs low \nwhen it comes to training and certification, particularly for stores in \nrural areas.\n  Folks will also get a better sense of how the over $70 billion a year \ntaxpayers fund SNAP with is being spent if this bill passes. It \nrequires companies that take in over $1 million a year from the SNAP \nprogram to provide the Federal Government with a receipt of just what \nthey have provided.\n  For small farmers, this bill suspends the 15-year limit for farmers \nto use FSA-guaranteed operating loans and the 7-year limit for them to \nuse FSA direct operating loans. By suspending these time limits \nindefinitely, farmers will have more access to these critical capital \ntools. It includes creation of a streamlined micro-loan program that \nwill allow small farmers who just need a quick loan to repair their \ntruck or buy some feed to borrow up to $5,000 on an expedited basis and \nwith reduced paperwork.\n  For beginning farmers, this legislation provides an alternative to \nthe requirement that they need three years of farm management \nexperience to get direct loans to buy farm lands. Instead, it allows \nthe completion of college degrees related to business and agriculture \nto be considered a substitute for hands-on experience. For example, \nHorticulture or Agricultural Business Management degrees would be \nacceptable as an alternative. This will give young folks more \nopportunities to get the capital needed to start a farm.\n  I am really proud of the efforts the Oregonians on my agricultural \nadvisory committee made in helping provide common sense solutions for \nnutrition and farming programs. I want to thank them for helping to \ncreate these\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\nproposals, and I am going to work hard with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle as we move to the next farm bill to include these ideas.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 2017. A bill to secure the Federal voting rights of persons when \nreleased from incarceration; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nDemocracy Restoration Act. The Democracy Restoration Act, or DRA, had \nbeen introduced in previous Congresses by former Senator Russ Feingold \nof Wisconsin and I am proud to follow his example. I want to thank \nSenator Durbin for joining me as an original co-sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  As the late Senator Kennedy often said, civil rights is the \n``unfinished business'' of America. The Democracy Restoration Act would \nrestore voting rights in federal elections to approximately 5 million \nAmericans who have been released from prison and are back living in \ntheir communities.\n  After the Civil War, Congress enacted and the states ratified the \nFifteenth Amendment, which provides that ``the right of citizens of the \nUnited States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United \nStates or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition \nof servitude. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by \nappropriate legislation.''\n  Unfortunately, many states passed laws during the Jim Crow period \nafter the Civil War to make it more difficult for newly-freed slaves to \nvote in elections. Such laws included poll taxes, literacy tests, and \ndisenfranchisement measures. Some disenfranchisement measures applied \nto misdemeanor convictions and in practice could result in lifetime \ndisenfranchisement, even for individuals that successfully reintegrated \ninto their communities as law-abiding citizens.\n  It took Congress and the states nearly another century to eliminate \nthe poll tax, upon the ratification of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment in \n1964. The Amendment provides that ``the rights of citizens of the \nUnited States to vote in any primary or other election for President or \nVice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not \nbe denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of \nfailure to pay any poll tax or other tax.''\n  Shortly thereafter Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \nwhich swept away numerous State laws and procedures that had denied \nAfrican-Americans and other minorities their constitutional right to \nvote. For example, the Act outlawed the use of literacy or history \ntests that voters had to pass before registering to vote or casting \ntheir ballot. The act specifically prohibits states from imposing any \n``voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, \npractice, or procedure . . . to deny or abridge the right of any \ncitizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.'' \nCongress overwhelmingly reauthorized the Act in 2006, which was signed \ninto law by President George W. Bush.\n  In 2011, I am concerned that there are still several areas where the \nlegacy of Jim Crow laws and state disenfranchisement statutes lead to \nunfairness in Federal elections. First, state laws governing the \nrestoration of voting rights vary widely throughout the country, such \nthat persons in some States can easily regain their voting rights, \nwhile in other States persons effectively lose their right to vote \npermanently. Second, these state disenfranchisement laws have a \ndisproportionate impact on racial and ethnic minorities. Third, this \npatchwork of state laws results in the lack of a uniform standard for \neligibility to vote in Federal elections, and leads to an unfair \ndisparity and unequal participation in Federal elections based solely \non where an individual lives.\n  In 35 States, convicted individuals may not vote while they are on \nparole. In 10 States, a conviction can result in life-time \ndisenfranchisement. Several States requires prisoners to seek \ndiscretionary pardons from Governors, or action by the parole or pardon \nboard, in order to regain their right to vote. Several States deny the \nright to vote to individuals convicted of certain misdemeanors. States \nare slowly moving or repeal or loosen many of these barriers to voting \nfor ex-prisoners. But studies show that a growing number of African-\nAmerican men, for example, will be disenfranchised at some point in \ntheir life, partly due to mandatory minimum sentencing laws that have a \ndisproportionate impact on minorities. Congress recently addressed part \nof this problem by enacting the Fair Sentencing Act to partially reduce \nthe sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine \nconvictions. While I welcome these steps, I believe that Congress \nshould take stronger action now to remedy this problem.\n  The legislation would restore voting rights to prisoners after their \nrelease from incarceration. It requires that prisons receiving federal \nfunds notify people about their right to vote in federal elections when \nthey are leaving prison, sentenced to probation, or convicted of a \nmisdemeanor. The bill authorizes the Department of Justice and \nindividuals harmed by violation of this Act to sue to enforce its \nprovisions. The bill generally provides State election officials with a \ngrace period to resolve voter eligibility complaints without a lawsuit \nbefore an election.\n  The legislation is narrowly crafted to apply to federal elections, \nand retains the States' authorities to generally establish voting \nqualifications. This legislation is therefore consistent with \nCongressional authority under the Constitution and voting rights \nstatutes, as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has been endorsed by a large \ncoalition of public interest organizations, including: civil rights and \nreform organizations; religious and faith-based organizations; and law \nenforcement and criminal justice organizations. In particular I want to \nthank the Brennan Center for Justice, the ACLU, the Leadership \nConference on Civil and Human Rights, and the NAACP for their work on \nthis legislation.\n  This legislation is ultimately designed to reduce recidivism rates \nand help reintegrate ex-prisoners back into society. When prisoners are \nreleased, they are expected to obey the law, get a job, and pay taxes \nas they are rehabilitated and reintegrated into their community. With \nthese responsibilities and obligations of citizenship should also come \nthe rights of citizenship, including the right to vote.\n  In 2007, President George W. Bush signed the Second Chance Act into \nlaw, after overwhelming approval and strong bipartisan support in \nCongress. The legislation expanded the Prison Re-Entry Initiative, by \nproviding job training, placement services, transitional housing, drug \ntreatment, medical care, and faith-based mentoring. At the signing \nceremony, President Bush said: ``We believe that even those who have \nstruggled with a dark past can find brighter days ahead. One way we act \non that belief is by helping former prisoners who have paid for their \ncrimes. We help them build new lives as productive members of our \nsociety.''\n  The Democracy Restoration Act is fully consistent with the goals of \nthe Second Chance Act, as Congress and the States seek to reduce \nrecidivism rates, strengthen the quality of life in our communities and \nmake them safer, and reduce the burden on taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                                December 16, 2011.\n       Dear Member of Congress: We, the undersigned organizations, \n     a coalition of civil rights, social and criminal justice, and \n     other legal and advocacy organizations, are writing to urge \n     your support and co-sponsorship of the Democracy Restoration \n     Act of 2011, a bill that seeks to restore voting rights in \n     federal elections to people who are out of prison and living \n     in the community. The current patchwork of laws that \n     disfranchise people with criminal records has created an \n     inconsistent and unfair federal electoral process, \n     perpetuating entrenched racial discrimination. As \n     organizations dedicated to promoting democracy and justice as \n     well as equal rights for all Americans, we strongly support \n     passage of this legislation.\n       Currently, 5.3 million American citizens are denied the \n     right to vote because they have a criminal conviction in \n     their past. Four million of these people are out of prison, \n     living in the community, paying taxes and raising families; \n     yet they remain disfranchised for years, often decades, and \n     sometimes for life. The United States is one of the few \n     western democratic nations that\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\n     excludes such large numbers of people from the democratic \n     process. Congressional action is needed to restore voting \n     rights in federal elections to the millions of Americans who \n     have been released from incarceration, but continue to be \n     denied their ability to fully participate in civic life. \n     Fortunately, Senator Ben Cardin and Representative John \n     Conyers are lead sponsors of the Democracy Restoration Act of \n     2011, which is intended to address these injustices.\n       Criminal disfranchisement laws are rooted in the Jim Crow \n     era. They were enacted alongside poll taxes and literacy \n     tests and were intended to keep African Americans from \n     voting. By 1900, 38 states denied voting rights to people \n     with criminal convictions, most of which disfranchised people \n     until they received a pardon. The intended effects of these \n     laws continue to this day. Nationwide 1-3% of African-\n     American men have lost the right to vote. If current \n     incarceration rates continue, three in ten of the next \n     generation of African American men will lose the right to \n     vote at some point in their lifetimes. This racial disparity \n     also impacts the families of those who are disfranchised and \n     the communities in which they reside by diminishing their \n     collective political voice.\n       In this country, voting is a national symbol of political \n     equality and full citizenship. When a citizen is denied this \n     right and responsibility, his or her standing as a full and \n     equal member of our society is called into question. The \n     responsibilities of citizenship--working, paying taxes and \n     contributing to one's community-- are duties conferred upon \n     those reentering society. To further punish individuals who \n     are back in the community by denying them a right of \n     citizenship counters the expectation that citizens have \n     rehabilitated themselves after a conviction. The United \n     States should not be a country where the effects of past \n     mistakes have countless consequences--and no opportunity for \n     redress.\n       Passage of the Democracy Restoration Act of 2011 will \n     ensure that all Americans living in their communities will \n     have the opportunity to participate in our electoral process. \n     A strong, vibrant democracy requires the broadest possible \n     base of voter participation, and allowing all persons who \n     have completed their prison time to vote is the best way to \n     ensure the greatest level of participation.\n       We urge you to support the passage of the Democracy \n     Restoration Act of 2011.\n       If you have any questions, please contact Deborah J.

As people of \n     faith, we believe all people are created in God's image. We \n     are deeply concerned that state disenfranchisement laws \n     continue to deprive our neighbors of their fundamental right \n     to vote and relegate them to second-class citizenship.\n       From Joseph saving untold numbers from famine, to Peter \n     being the rock upon which Christ's church was built, our \n     scriptures bear powerful witness of the great achievements \n     that can be made by persons who have spent time in prison. It \n     is consistent with the best of our democratic values and our \n     moral heritage to encourage former prisoners to participate \n     constructively with their communities in ways such as voting.\n       Accordingly, we join the many Americans who believe that \n     continuing to deny the franchise to millions of our fellow \n     citizens who have rejoined our communities is unwise and \n     unjust. Our support for the Democracy Restoration Act rests \n     squarely on our obligation to be merciful and forgiving, our \n     commitment to treat others with the respect and dignity that \n     God's children deserve, and our steadfast belief in the human \n     capacity for redemption.\n       We applaud your efforts to restore the franchise to persons \n     who have been released from prison, and we urge you to pass \n     the Democracy Restoration Act.\n           Yours truly,\n         The Aleph Institute, an organization for Jewish renewal; \n           Christian Reformed Church of North America; Crossroad \n           Bible Institute; Evangelicals for Social Action; The \n           Institute for Prison Ministries at the Billy Graham \n           Center; Masjid An-Nur, an Islamic center in \n           Minneapolis, MN; Mennonite Central Committee; National \n           Advocacy Center of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd; \n           National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference; \n           NETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby; \n           Presbyterian Church USA, Office of Public Witness, \n           Washington, DC; Progressive National Baptist \n           Convention, Inc.; Restorative Justice Ministries \n           Network of North America; Sojourners, a Christian \n           ministry based in Washington, DC; United Church of \n           Christ, Justice and Witness Ministries; The United \n           Methodist Church, General Board of Church and Society; \n           Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 December 16, 2011\n       Dear Member of Congress: We, the undersigned law \n     enforcement and criminal justice leaders, urge you to support \n     and co-sponsor the Democracy Restoration Act, a bill which \n     seeks to restore federal voting rights to the nearly four \n     million Americans living, working and paying taxes in our \n     communities who have been disenfranchised because of a \n     criminal conviction in their past. We support the restoration \n     of voting rights because continuing to disenfranchise \n     individuals after release from prison is ineffective law \n     enforcement policy and violates core principles of democracy \n     and equality.\n       There is no credible evidence that denying voting rights to \n     people after release from prison does anything to reduce \n     crime. In our judgment, just the opposite is true. Every year \n     over 600,000 people leave prison. We must find new and \n     effective ways to foster reintegration back into the \n     community and prevent recidivism. We believe that bringing \n     people into the political process makes them stakeholders in \n     the community and helps steer former offenders away from \n     future crimes.\n       The hallmark of a democratic government is that it reflects \n     the views of the governed, views that are most readily \n     expressed through the ballot box. As law enforcement and \n     criminal justice officials, we are deeply committed to \n     securing our system of American democracy. Carving a segment \n     of the community out of the democratic process is \n     inconsistent with America's best traditions and highest \n     values.\n       People who commit crimes must and will serve all terms of \n     their sentence. But once the criminal justice system has \n     determined that they are ready to return to the community, \n     they should receive both the rights and responsibilities that \n     come with the status of being a citizen.

A bill to require the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration to prescribe regulations to reduce helicopter noise \npollution in certain residential areas, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Los Angeles \nResidential Helicopter Noise Relief Act of 2011, which is cosponsored \nby Senator Boxer.\n  This legislation is very simple. It directs the Federal Aviation \nAdministration to develop and enforce regulations to control helicopter \nnoise and improve helicopter safety above Los Angeles.\n  FAA must complete the regulations within three years, in consultation \nwith the local community, and it must include an exemption for public \nsafety aircraft.\n  The bill is a companion to legislation with the same name introduced \nby Representative Berman.\n  This legislation is long overdue.\n  Under current law, helicopter pilots can and do fly practically \nwherever they want above Los Angeles, and no agency limits their \nactivity.\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\n  The Federal Aviation Administration controls our Nation's airspace \nexclusively, but it imposes no restrictions on helicopter flight paths, \nelevation, or hovering.\n  If a helicopter wants to hover over a home in Los Angeles for an \nhour, it can.\n  One neighborhood leader told the New York Times this summer that he \nwas afraid of complaining too loudly about the noise helicopters create \nbecause he feared helicopter operators would retaliate, legally, by \nparking over his house.\n  City officials and State agencies permit the location of helicopter \nlanding pads, but they have absolutely no power to govern what the \nchopper does once it takes off. They can do nothing to discourage \ntourist pilots from flying low and banking hard for the promise of a \ntip.\n  Bottom Line: This is, for all intents and purposes, an unregulated \nindustry.\n  This reality is increasingly frustrating to Los Angeles residents who \nare experiencing what many people say is the most intense period of \nhelicopter use in memory.\n  Every day brings a steady swarm of helicopters buzzing above Southern \nCalifornia's bedroom communities in what many officials say are greater \nnumbers than ever before.\n  There are media helicopters, traffic helicopters, tour helicopters, \npaparazzi and film crew helicopters, corporate helicopters and private \ncommuter helicopters.\n  Downtown L.A. has a helicopter parking lot in the clouds; helipads \nlie atop nearly every skyscraper.\n  But the city's residents may have finally reached their breaking \npoint in July, after two consecutive weekends of extreme helicopter \nnoise.\n  First, the helicopters hovered for hours on end as Prince William and \nhis new bride, Kate, settled into Hancock Park, a Los Angeles \ncommunity.\n  Then, a week later, the helicopters monitoring the impact of closing \nInterstate 405 were even worse.\n  Los Angeles resident Sue Rosen told the New York Times that there \nwere, at any given time, at least five helicopters hovering over her \nhouse watching the 405. ``The noise was nerve-wracking,'' she said. \n``The house was vibrating.''\n  The same week, a helicopter thumped loudly above the Hollywood Bowl \nat the exact moment Gustavo Dudamel was leading the Los Angeles \nPhilharmonic through the adagio in the overture to Mozart's ``Abduction \nFrom the Seraglio.''\n  Although the Hollywood Bowl has worked aggressively with helicopter \noperators to establish a voluntary no-fly zone during concert nights, \nthey have no power to enforce it, and pilots ignore it.\n  Noise from helicopters above the Hollywood bowl has been so loud some \nyears that the Symphony had to stop playing.\n  As one pilot explained: the Hollywood Bowl managers ``are always \ncalling the towers telling them to get us away. But they can't do \nanything.'' Only FAA can act.\n  Only the FAA has the authority to improve the lives of millions of \nCalifornians bothered by helicopters by establishing common sense rules \nthat increase safety and reduce noise.\n  But to date, FAA leaders have ignored this problem. In fact, FAA has \nnot even tracked noise and annoyance complaints.\n  This bill directs the FAA to take this matter seriously.\n  FAA would be required to bring about safer, more pleasant skies above \nLos Angeles in cooperation with the local communities.\n  The air above our cities is a common Federal resource that only \nCongress has the power to protect, and today the air above Los Angeles \nis polluted with helicopter noise.\n  This is therefore a very important bill for the quality of life in \nAmerica's second largest city.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation and work with us \nto enact it as part of FAA reauthorization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2019\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Los Angeles Residential \n     Helicopter Noise Relief Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REGULATIONS TO REDUCE HELICOPTER NOISE POLLUTION IN \n                   CERTAIN RESIDENTIAL AREAS.\n\n       (a) Regulations Required.--Not later than 3 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the \n     Federal Aviation Administration shall prescribe regulations \n     for helicopter operations in Los Angeles County, California, \n     that include requirements relating to the flight paths and \n     altitudes associated with such operations to reduce \n     helicopter noise pollution in residential areas, increase \n     safety, and minimize commercial aircraft delays.\n       (b) Exemptions.--In prescribing regulations under \n     subsection (a), the Administrator shall exempt helicopter \n     operations related to emergency, law enforcement, or military \n     activities from the requirements described in that \n     subsection.\n       (c) Consultations.--In prescribing regulations under \n     subsection (a), the Administrator shall make reasonable \n     efforts to consult with local communities and local \n     helicopter operators in order to develop regulations that \n     meet the needs of local communities, helicopter operators, \n     and the Federal Aviation Administration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN.\n  S. 2020. A bill to protect all school children against harmful and \nlife-threatening seclusion and restraint practices; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, throughout my career in public service I \nhave been committed to ensuring that children in this country receive a \nquality education. I believe that each child should be educated in a \nsupportive, caring, stimulating environment in which they are treated \nas an individual and provided with the tools they need to succeed. I \nalso believe no child should be subjected to abusive disciplinary \nstrategies or violent behavioral interventions while in school and no \nchild should be secluded or unnecessarily restrained. I have fought to \nensure that all children be treated fairly in schools in this country, \nand as a result I am pleased to introduce today the Keeping All \nStudents Safe Act. This important legislation will protect school \nchildren against ineffective harmful and life-threatening seclusion and \nrestraint practices.\n  In 2009 the Government Accountability Office conducted a study on \nseclusion and restraint in schools. This study revealed that although \nthe Children's Health Act of 2000 amended Title V of the Public Health \nService Act and regulated the use of seclusion and restraint on \nresidents and children in hospital facilities that receive Federal \nfunds, there was no Federal law restricting the use of seclusion and \nrestraint in schools. In a hearing on May 19, 2009 parents of children \nwho were injured or killed as a result of the use of seclusion and \nrestraint in schools testified before the House Committee on Education \nand Labor. This testimony from parents highlighted the very real need \nfor this legislation. The Keeping All Students Safe Act addresses many \nof the concerns raised at that hearing and by the G.A.O. study. The act \nspecifically prohibits seclusion, the use of locked or barred rooms \nwhere children are left unattended, without supervision. The act also \nprohibits mechanical and chemical restraints, physical restraints that \nare life-threatening, including those that restrict breathing, and \naversive behavioral interventions that compromise a student's health \nand safety.\n  The G.A.O. study also revealed that restraint and seclusion-related \nfatalities and injuries most often involve children with disabilities. \nThis vulnerable population must especially be protected from this type \nof abuse, and this legislation seeks to do just that. The Keeping All \nStudents Safe Act prohibits the use of all types of restraint and \nseclusion in all schools receiving Federal financial assistance, and \nprevents the use of this type of intervention from being included in \nany child's individualized education plan. This prohibition is included \nin the act because we know that planning for the use of restraint or \nseclusion has been shown to actually increase their use.\n  Although the act does allow for the use of restraint in emergency \nsituations to prevent serious bodily injury to the student, other \nstudents in the classroom, or staff, it also requires\n\n[[Page S8740]]\n\nstaff to be trained and certified by a State-approved crisis \nintervention training program as to how to approach these types of \nemergency situations. This will help to ensure that in the rare \ninstances where restraint is necessary to prevent serious bodily \ninjury, all techniques will be administered appropriately and \nunnecessary injury can be avoided.\n  Another issue uncovered by the G.A.O. study was that no web site, \nFederal agency, or other entity currently collects comprehensive data \nrelated to the use of restraint and seclusion in our Nation's schools. \nThis Act will remedy this situation, as it requires each State \neducational agency to prepare and submit a report documenting, among \nother information, any instances in which physical restraint was \nimposed upon a student. This will allow us to track the use of \nrestraint and to determine if our efforts to decrease it are being \nsuccessful.\n  Support for this Act comes from many sectors of the education \ncommunity. Organizations such as Easter Seals, United Cerebral Palsy, \nThe Arc of the United States, the National Disabilities Rights Network \nand the Council of Parent and Attorney Advocates all support this \nlegislation. In addition, in the House, our colleague, Representative \nGeorge Miller, introduced in April a companion bill with bi-partisan \nsupport.\n  This act is an important step towards protecting all children within \nour Nation's schools from the use of restraint and seclusion. No child \nshould be subjected to physical restraint or seclusion as a \ndisciplinary technique or behavior intervention strategy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2020\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
