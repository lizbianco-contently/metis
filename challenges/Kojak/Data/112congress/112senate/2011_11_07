Mr. President, every man and woman who puts on the uniform \nof the U.S. Armed Forces takes a solemn oath to support and defend the \nConstitution against all enemies. With that oath comes an obligation: \nto defend the freedoms for which this noble Nation stands and upon \nwhich it was founded, without regard to personal price.\n  For this service, the United States makes a promise to our soldiers, \nsailors, marines, and airmen in return. That promise isn't about flag \nwaving or yellow ribbons. It lasts long after the parades and holidays \nare over, through every day and every year of their lives. It is a \nguarantee that the American dream, for which every servicemember \nfights--and for which many of their comrades have died--will be waiting \nfor them when they return.\n  Since September 11, 2001, this country has allowed that promise to \nlapse. Today, there are 240,000 unemployed veterans. These are veterans \nin the fight against global terrorism. Among veterans who have served \nsince September 11, unemployment is more than 12 percent--more than 3 \npercentage points higher than among the general population. Among the \nyoungest veterans--those under age 25--the unemployment rate is 22 \npercent.\n  These young men and women volunteered to fight terrorism abroad, but \ntheir struggles didn't end when they came home. Despite their service \nand experience, one-quarter of a million post-9/11 veterans can't find \nemployment in today's dismal economy and rapidly changing workforce.\n  It is time for this country to make good on its promise. As we pay \ntribute this week to the millions of American veterans who have \nfaithfully served our flag, Democrats want to introduce legislation to \nput those men and women back to work. VOW to Hire Heroes is the name of \nthe legislation. This will offer tax credits to companies that hire \nunemployed veterans or veterans who were discharged in the last 5 \nyears. The legislation will give an additional tax credit to the firms \nthat hire unemployed veterans with service-related disabilities. \nDisabled veterans will also be eligible for an additional year of \nvocational rehab and employment benefits under this legislation.\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\n  The plan makes transition assistance--including resume-writing \nworkshops and career counseling--mandatory for all servicemembers being \ndischarged. Although our veterans are coming home with greater \ntechnical and leadership skills than ever before, those skills don't \nalways translate to a civilian resume. This program will help bridge \nthat gap.\n  Many Federal agencies, such as the VA and Homeland Security, badly \nneed employees with the unique skills veterans possess. This \nlegislation will also make it possible for servicemembers to apply for \nthose jobs before they leave the military. This will allow soldiers to \ntransition from serving their country in uniform to serving the \ncivilian world without a gap in their employment.\n  To keep our promise to older veterans, the legislation will expand \neducation and training opportunities at community colleges and \ntechnical schools for 100,000 unemployed veterans who served before \nSeptember 11. Democrats believe we owe it to the men and women who have \nfought for us to fight for them here at home.\n  The VOW to Hire Heroes is our fourth attempt to pass commonsense \nlegislation that puts Americans back to work and helps jump-start our \neconomy. Senate Republicans unanimously opposed our last three jobs \nbills, although those bills had the support of the vast majority of \nAmericans--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike. Meanwhile, \nRepublicans have yet to propose a single idea of their own to create \njobs. Their obstruction has cost hundreds of thousands of teacher and \nfirst responder jobs, it has cost hundreds of thousands of construction \njobs, and put reconstruction of our Nation's crumbling roads, bridges, \nand runways on hold.\n\n  Now we will see whether the Senate Republicans are willing to put \njobs for veterans at risk as well. I certainly hope they are not. I \nhope they will join us this week in supporting the legislation that \nuses ideas originally proposed by Republicans and Democrats to put this \nNation's veterans back to work without adding a penny to the deficit.\n  I believe every man and woman serving in the Senate today is a \npatriot. I know each and every one of us supports the members of the \nU.S. armed services and is grateful to every veteran who has served. \nThis week we have the opportunity to express our gratitude and our \npatriotism with action.\n  So far, Republicans have stood firm against even the most reasonable \nplan to create millions of jobs for the sake of politics. It is only a \nmatter of time before they break and join Democrats in our efforts to \ncreate jobs and get the economy back on track.\n  As Veterans Day fast approaches, I urge my Republican colleagues to \nabandon partisanship and help us honor our commitment to this country's \nheroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/07/senate-section/article/S7146-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for the past 3 years, President Obama \nand Democratic leaders in Congress have spent most of their time \npushing policies that actually undermine the private sector. They may \nhave the best of intentions, but the fact is they made a bad economy \nworse. Unemployment has now stood at 9 percent for more consecutive \nmonths than for any other period since World War II, and there are now \nmore than 1 million fewer jobs in this country than when the \nPresident's first stimulus bill was signed into law.\n  So the American people gave the President a chance to do something \nabout jobs and the economy and he failed. That is why last year the \nAmerican people put Republicans in charge of the House of \nRepresentatives--so they could try a different approach, and that is \nwhat they have done. For nearly a year now, House Republicans have been \nfollowing through on their pledge to put Americans back to work by \npassing bill after bill aimed at helping businesses create jobs.\n  The problem is, every time Republicans pass one of these bills over \nin the House, Democrats in the Senate refuse to take it up. The \nDemocrats who run the Senate are letting all these bills die.\n  Some people want to know why this is happening. They want to know why \nthe Senate will not take up these bills. The answer is actually pretty \nsimple. President Obama and his political advisers have put out the \nword they do not want Congress to get anything done around here until \nafter next year's election, so the President can go around on the bus \nand blame Congress for the country's problems, and Democrats in the \nSenate are lining up right behind him. They are doing the President's \nbidding.\n  But that is not stopping Republicans in the House from doing the work \nthey were elected to do, and it is not going to keep the Republican \nminority in the Senate from calling on Democrats to act.\n  To date, House Republicans have passed more than 20 pieces of \nlegislation designed to do two things: make it easier for small \nbusinesses to create jobs and bills that would pass on a broad \nbipartisan basis.\n  Last week, I highlighted 15 such bills the House had already passed \nand that Senate Democrats should take up. This week, Senate Republicans \nwill highlight several additional such bills the House passed just last \nweek. We are going to keep on talking about these bills until Senate \nDemocrats realize there is no reason we shouldn't take them up, pass \nthem on a bipartisan basis, and actually do something on jobs around \nhere.\n  For nearly 3 years, President Obama has demanded we pass massive \nlegislation he knows Republicans have problems with. What we are saying \nis, let's start with things that have bipartisan support and that we \nknow can pass instead of that other approach.\n  Since Republicans control the House and Democrats control the Senate, \nwe are not likely to agree on big partisan stuff. But there are a lot \nof other job-creating measures we actually could agree on. Why don't we \nfocus on them? Let's work together on the things we can all agree on, \nas we did last month on the trade agreements.\n  Here is just one example out of many. Last week, the House passed a \nbill called the Small Company Capital Formation Act, H.R. 1070. It got \n421 votes, including 183 Democrats. Only one person in the House voted \nagainst the bill.\n  Here is a jobs bill that is about as popular as Mother's Day. There \nis no reason not to pass it in the Senate right now. Right now, \npromising businesses aren't going public because they simply can't \nafford the high cost of managing the mountain of government paperwork \nthey are required to under current law. So instead of going out there \nand raising money to grow and hire, they are holding back. They are not \nexpanding and they are not hiring.\n  We recently heard from the CEO of a pharmaceutical company from Fort \nWashington, PA, who said companies such as his are at a major \ndisadvantage if they come up with promising new drugs. He has at least \none such promising new drug in the pipeline for chronic kidney disease \nbut can't take it to the next level. If firms such as this want to \nexpand and hire, they need to be able to raise capital from investors \nso they do not go into debt. But current law keeps them from doing so \nbecause of all the regulatory burdens that come along with it. I think \nwe should be removing these barriers to growth for companies such as \nthis one, and 183 Democrats in the House actually agree with me.\n  President Obama actually supports the idea too. He said so in his \nspeech to a joint session of Congress back in September. So this bill \nis as bipartisan as it gets. One will not find a bill any more \nbipartisan than this--passed overwhelmingly in the House and supported \nby the President of the United States. The only thing standing in the \nway right now is Senate Democrats. They just will not take yes for an \nanswer.\n  It is only a matter of time before the American people catch on to \nthe Democrats' refusal to act. Once they do, Republicans will be ready \nwith a long and growing list of bipartisan bills that have already \npassed the House and that we believe the President of the United States \nwould sign. So let's not delay any longer. Let's stop the games, and \nlet's do the work we were sent to do.\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/07/senate-section/article/S7147-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \ncreating more good-paying jobs in America and how tax reform can play a \nkey role in job creation if it is done right. As we all know, no Member \nof Congress has a piece of machinery on their desk that is a job \ncreation device. We cannot just start something like this, press a \nbutton, and then after it whirs around a bunch of times it creates a \nlot of new jobs. New jobs do not just come shooting out that way. \nNobody has a contraption like that in the Senate, and the reality is \nthe President does not have one nor does anybody else in America.\n  But there are policies that are relevant to how we create more good-\npaying jobs, and those involve first looking at what has worked in the \npast and, second, what hard, objective data is relevant to the future. \nNobody can know the ideal, sure-fire way to create jobs, but we can \ndocument what has worked in the past.\n  In the case of comprehensive tax reform, what we know is that after \nthe 1986 Tax Reform Act where Democrats and Republicans cleaned out \nscores of tax preferences to hold down marginal rates and keep \nprogressivity, our country created 6.3 million new jobs in those 2 \nyears after that tax reform was enacted. I am not going to say on the \nfloor of the Senate that each and every one of those jobs was the \nresult of tax reform, but certainly independent authorities point to \nthat tax reform effort as a key factor in creating those jobs. With at \nleast 14 million Americans out of work in our country right now, it \nwould be legislative malpractice for Congress to ignore the facts that \ndocument the results of the last tax reform effort in job creation.\n  When we look at the possibilities should we not pay special attention \nto what has worked in the past? The reality is, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, our country has tried just about every other tool in the \neconomic toolbox. We have seen the Recovery Act. We have seen that the \nFed is essentially all in with its program of quantitative easing. We \nhave had a whole host of other initiatives in the housing area and in \nthe automobile area and a whole host of other areas. The fact is, the \none tool in the economic toolshed that nobody has picked up is \nfundamental tax reform. It is my view that it is time for the Congress, \nworking with the President, to pick up on a proven model that a host of \nprogressive Democrats and conservative Republicans, led by a \nconservative Republican President, deployed 25 years ago to spur \neconomic growth and create millions of new jobs, which I think we all \nunderstand our people in our economy need desperately.\n  Given that success, it is no wonder that Democrats and Republicans, \nas well as economists and think-tanks and bipartisan commissions, are \nagain calling for the Congress to take up the cause of tax reform. We \nare very hopeful the bipartisan Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction \ncan also bring together Democrats and Republicans as part of their work \nto lay out the strategy for moving ahead on tax reform.\n  There is no shortage of good reasons for Congress to look at this \nparticular approach to job creation. It is bipartisan, it has been \nproven before, and certainly the basic principles--simplifying the Tax \nCode, cleaning out the clutter, and holding down rates across the \nboard--make just as much sense today as they did a quarter century ago.\n  It has been argued that since the last change in our tax law there \nhave been close to 15,000 tax changes--one for almost every working day \nyear in and year out. So what we have on our hands now is a \ndysfunctional antigrowth mess. That is why I think it is particularly \nimportant that we look at moving now rather than waiting until another \nelection or taking a detour to reform only the corporate Tax Code \nwhile, for example, leaving small businesses and working families stuck \nwith the same broken Tax Code they have today.\n  Let me point out to those who say we cannot do tax reform in a \ndivisive climate, a divided Congress and White House, as we move into \nan election, the fact is fundamental tax reform was passed on the eve \nof an election a quarter century ago--passed on the eve of an election. \nI say that because I know one of the fundamental architects of that tax \nreform, Senator Packwood, whose seat I now hold in the Senate, was not \navailable for the bill signing because he had a community event back \nhome.\n  The fact is, there is an opportunity now to move ahead with \ncomprehensive tax reform. We have good people who have expertise in tax \nlaw on the supercommittee--Chairman Baucus, Senator Kerry, Congressman \nCamp, Senator Portman--Democrats and Republicans who have been involved \nin budget and tax issues for years and years with great expertise on \nthese issues.\n  I want to take just a minute this afternoon to discuss some eye-\nopening new information on an issue that I know is being debated in the \nCongress, and my sense is the supercommittee is looking at it as well; \nthat is, the question of splitting tax reform into separate corporate \nand individual pieces.\n  Last week, the Joint Committee on Taxation issued an important report \nthat all Members ought to pay close attention to as Congress looks at \ntax reform as part of either a potential debt deal or other \nlegislation. The reason I want to discuss it this afternoon is we all \nunderstand as part of the legislative process just about everything is \nnegotiable, but there is one thing that is not negotiable--that is the \naccuracy of the numbers.\n  When the official number cruncher for taxes says they cannot make the \nnumbers add up, Members of the Senate and the Congress have to pay \nattention. The new report by the Joint Committee on Taxation says--and, \nof course, they are the official scorekeeper for tax policy--the \nCongress essentially has a choice to make. We can either provide all \nAmerican companies significantly lower tax rates or we can allow \nmultinational companies to continue to avoid paying taxes on their \noverseas income. But the Joint Committee on Taxation says it is really \nnot possible to do both. There is not enough money in the corporate Tax \nCode to do both without further increasing the budget deficit.\n  The Joint Committee was asked to provide its estimate of the lowest \ncorporate rate that could be achieved by eliminating corporate tax \nexpenditures, the various credits, deductions, and exemptions that \nlower the actual amount of taxes our businesses pay. In response, the \njoint committee estimated that 28 percent is the lowest possible \ncorporate rate that could be achieved from eliminating corporate tax \nbreaks and still not increase the deficit--in effect, be revenue \nneutral.\n  Mr. President, 28 percent is certainly lower than the current top \nrate, but it is higher than what--certainly many in the business \ncommunity and the Congress have argued--is needed for U.S. companies to \nbe competitive in the global economy. Most in the business community \nwant to lower the top rate to 25 percent or even lower. The joint \ncommittee has determined that 28 percent is the lowest the corporate \nrate can be reduced to without adding to the deficit.\n  This new report by the Joint Committee on Taxation ought to be a real \nwake-up call in Washington, DC. For\n\n[[Page S7148]]\n\nexample, many companies not only argue that Congress can get the \ncorporate rate down to 25 percent or even lower, but they also want to \nkeep many of the tax breaks they now get under the current Tax Code. \nThe joint committee's report makes clear that cannot be done without \nincreasing the Federal deficit. And even the Joint Committee's 28-\npercent rate estimate was filled with all sorts of caveats, little \nkinds of ``look out, there may be more to the story'' kinds of warnings \nabout the difficulty of limiting tax breaks now available to all \nbusinesses so they can no longer be claimed by corporations.\n\n  If tax breaks are eliminated for corporations but not for other \nbusinesses--remember, most businesses, as we know, are sole proprietors \nor limited partnerships and LLCs and the like--corporations may end up \nconverting their businesses into other types of tax structures. If that \nhappens, the savings from eliminating corporate tax rates would be less \nso that the corporate rate could end up even higher than 28 percent. \nThat is one example of how it is very hard to repeal tax breaks just \nfor corporations and not for other businesses.\n  In making their estimate, the Joint Committee looked at repealing \nliterally scores of corporate tax breaks--everything from research to \nspecific breaks for energy, housing, transportation, education, \ntraining, and others. But there is one important tax break that was not \nconsidered as part of the Joint Committee's analysis, and that is the \nability of U.S. multinationals to avoid paying taxes on their overseas \nincome as long as they keep that money overseas. This is the tax break \nthat is known as deferral. Significantly, the Joint Committee has done \na separate analysis of the amount of revenue that could be generated by \nrepealing deferral. If you repeal deferral and impose related limits on \nforeign credits to prevent gaming, you take that step and the total \ncomes to an eye-popping $568 billion over 10 years. That comes from an \nestimate the Joint Committee has done for a bipartisan group of us who \nhave been working on this issue for the last 5 years.\n  I initially started working on this with our former colleague from \nNew Hampshire, Senator Gregg, and most recently with Senator Coats and \nSenator Begich. The four of us have worked very closely on this over \nthe last few years. If you make the changes we have made in deferral \nand related foreign credits that you ought to change to prevent gaming, \nit is possible to slash rates for all of our businesses so you can get \ndown to 24 percent, particularly for the corporate rate, and have \nadditional relief for small businesses. We have some ideas for how you \ncould drive the rate lower than 24 percent. That is something I think \ncould be a real shot in the arm to businesses in Connecticut, Oregon, \nand across the country. It surely would do something about creating \nred, white, and blue jobs so we would have more jobs here in the United \nStates so we could put our people back to work in the manufacturing \nsector and the other parts of our economy that are so important. So \nthat is the choice.\n  According to the Joint Committee's estimate--these are the official \nscorekeepers for taxes--there are two alternative ways to lower \ncorporate tax rates. One keeps deferral, this break for doing business \noverseas, and then the lowest rate, according to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, would be 28 percent. The other takes away the tax breaks for \nshipping jobs overseas, eliminates deferral, and dramatically drives \nthe rate for our businesses down 24 percent.\n  As I have indicated, our bipartisan coalition has some ideas for \ngetting it even lower. So it is important to point out that the lower \n24-percent rate would apply to every U.S. company, whether it has \noverseas operations or not. U.S. manufacturers and retailers and other \ndomestic businesses all would benefit from this kind of approach, lower \ntax rates. All U.S. businesses would have more money to invest in new \nequipment and hiring workers here in our country--in Connecticut, in \nOregon, and all of our States. By contrast, while all businesses would \nget some help from a 28-percent rate, the biggest winners are those \nwith significant operations overseas, thousands and thousands of miles \nfrom our shores. By continuing deferral, those businesses that operate \noverseas, those companies pay a zero rate on their overseas income. \nWith that rate differential, there would still be a strong incentive \nfor some of those very large businesses to target their investments, to \nlower tax overseas operations at the expense of investment and job \ncreation here at home. So it should be obvious that the last thing the \nCongress ought to be doing in this current economic climate is to take \nactions that will hurt job creation. With so many people out of work, \nwe obviously need to focus on steps to create jobs, not reward those \nthat, in effect, ship the jobs overseas, ship the investments overseas, \nthe investments in the jobs we need so much here at home.\n  We can do more for all U.S. businesses, workers, and their families \nthrough comprehensive tax reform than just by going forward with \ncorporate-only reform. In fact, it is possible to do more for \nbusinesses, get a lower rate--I want to emphasize this--for all our \nbusinesses in America, significantly lower so they will be more \ncompetitive in tough global markets. I am not saying that tax policy is \nthe only consideration in terms of creating jobs. I chair the \nInternational Trade Subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee, and I \nhave long taken as my major objective to do more to grow things here in \nAmerica, to make things here in America, to add value to them here, and \nto ship them somewhere. There is a whole host of trade and regulatory \npolicies that factor into this. But certainly we ought to agree that at \na time when comprehensive tax reform is the one tool in the economic \ntoolshed that has not been used--and there is a chance to take away tax \nbreaks for shipping jobs overseas so we can get more tax relief for \nAmericans here at home--we ought to be picking up on that opportunity.\n  I hope all my colleagues who are going to be part of this tax reform \ndebate over the next few weeks--and I think it is inevitable because \nmore and more debate is focused on tax reform, whether it ought to be \ncorporate only--look at how you would go about pursuing it in a \nbipartisan way. I hope those colleagues will take a look at the new \nreport done by the Joint Committee on Taxation. What they have made \nclear is that there is not enough money in the corporate tax code to \nget the lower rate companies want as long as some of these \nmultinationals can continue to keep the money overseas and avoid paying \nU.S. taxes. Having worked on this issue with colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle for about the last 5 years, and watching as the economic \ndebate goes forward, with our people hungry for new jobs, I hope \ncolleagues will see, No. 1, there is a real lesson to be learned from \nwhat was done in 1986 where progressive Democrats and conservative \nRepublicans came together on the eve of an election--by the way, the \n1986 election. I think it is also fair to say that after tax reform, \nboth sides did pretty well. Both sides did pretty well in the Congress \nand in terms of controlling the White House.\n\n  The fact is this is a chance to take a big step to help our people \nwho are hurting now. There are 14 million people out of work. I hope \ncolleagues will look at that new report prepared by the Joint Committee \non Taxation and look at the history of how in 2 years a quarter century \nago we came together, Democrats and Republicans, and passed fundamental \ntax reform based on the same kind of principles Senator Gregg, Senator \nCoats, Senator Begich, and I have worked on for the last 5 years, \ncleaning out special interest breaks, special interest preferences, \ncleaning out scores of them and using that money to hold down marginal \nrates and keeping progressivity so we have a sense of fairness. \nEverybody wins.\n  Many of our colleagues feel passionately about economic fairness. I \ncertainly do. I know the President of the Senate does as well. Many of \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle have focused on economic \nopportunity. With fundamental tax reform, we can have both and do it in \na bipartisan way. It means picking up on the one tool in the economic \ntoolshed that has not been used.\n  I will be back on the floor of this Senate to talk about this again. \nIt is one of the reasons why I wanted to serve on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, to tackle these fundamental\n\n[[Page S7149]]\n\nissues of taxes and health care. We have had a very constructive set of \nhearings on tax reform chaired by Chairman Baucus and ranking minority \nmember Senator Hatch. I am very hopeful that at a time when our people \nare so hungry for new jobs, good jobs, high-paying jobs, that we will \npick up on this opportunity to bring Democrats and Republicans \ntogether, as we were on this issue a quarter century ago in enacting \nfundamental tax reform.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this past Saturday evening in my home town \nof Tuscaloosa, AL, there was quite a scoring event--I think most of the \npeople in the Nation watched it--and that was between the No. 1 ranked \nfootball team in the Nation, LSU, Louisiana State University, and the \nUniversity of Alabama. Senator Sessions and I were there. We had a bet \nthat Senator Sessions and Senator Vitter initiated--and Senator \nLandrieu and I concurred with--on the outcome of the game. All in fun, \nbut you know we all like to win.\n  This was a tremendous football game: no touchdowns on either side, \nfive field goals, overtime. LSU won. I congratulate them. I \ncongratulate my two Senator colleagues here today. It was hard fought \nbetween two great football teams, and today--people have probably seen \nme on the Senate floor a number of times--I have never worn the purple \ntie, but I have one on today because I lost the bet. We lost the game. \nI will not wear it every day, but out of respect for my colleagues from \nLouisiana: congratulations Senator Landrieu, congratulations Senator \nVitter, congratulations to the people of Louisiana and to the football \nteam and the coaching staff in Baton Rouge.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Shelby, a \nUniversity of Alabama graduate and also a University of Alabama law \ngraduate. I am a law graduate myself from the University of Alabama.\n  It was a fabulous spectacle this weekend. There were 103,000 people \nin that fabulous new stadium that has been expanded with all the colors \nand the band and the noise. Truly, I doubt any of us will live to see a \ngame which is any louder than that game was. It was a spectacular event \nand an unusual, special event that happens in the Southeastern \nConference.\n  So we believe in being winners. Alabama played every single play--and \nso did LSU, with every single play--committed to winning the football \ngame. At the end of it, after all had been said and done, it was 6-6. I \nthink the two best teams in the Nation clearly proved they were the two \nbest teams in the Nation. But we had to have an overtime.\n  So to my colleagues, Senator Landrieu and Senator Vitter, \ncongratulations. I am not really proud but I am honored and willing to \nwear the tie of the team that beat the University of Alabama.\n  We look forward to celebrating with you that fabulous game and to \nalso having some fresh Alabama gulf coast seafood. Let the whole world \nknow that our gulf coast seafood industry is back strong, better than \never. So congratulations.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank our Alabama colleagues. They are \nvery gracious, and they are great sports in terms of this whole past \nweek and this bet. So I am honored to be with them as they wear LSU \ncolors for 1 day. Maybe they can keep those ties for January. Maybe \nafter the BCS championship game they will at least wear it for an SEC \nvictor--knock on wood--and we very much look forward to their \ndelivering, as Senator Sessions said, great, delicious, fresh, and \nperfectly safe gulf coast seafood that all of us are going to enjoy.\n  So I thank them for being such great sports, and I congratulate their \nteam for being a superteam. That was a heck of a game. It was \neverything it was cracked up to be. People said it would be a defensive \nstruggle. Yet nobody imagined there would not even be a touchdown: 9-6 \nin overtime.\n  I congratulate the Alabama team that played their hearts out and is a \ngreat Alabama team.\n  Of course, I also want to pause and congratulate everybody in the LSU \ncommunity and the LSU team. That was a hard fought struggle, a hard \nfought win. A lot of folks came together and made extraordinary plays. \nOf course, it ended with Drew Alleman's field goal in overtime. But Mo \nClaiborne and Eric Reid had terrific interceptions, and even the \npunter, Brad Wing, played a pivotal role in terms of his 73-yard punt \nthat won the field position battle.\n  So there are a lot of heroes and a lot of good players on the LSU \nside, and I congratulate the entire LSU community.\n  With the rest of the State of Louisiana, we look forward--knock on \nwood--to several more victories leading up to, hopefully, the BCS \nchampionship game in New Orleans in the Louisiana Superdome. So, of \ncourse, we look forward to that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. At this point, I turn to my colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I begin by thanking my two colleagues \nfrom Alabama for being such great sports. I never thought they would \nactually wear purple and gold on the Senate floor, but I am proud of \nthem for living up to their end of the bet, for showing up \nappropriately dressed this afternoon.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Vitter for initiating this terrific bet. \nI am looking forward to some great gulf coast Alabama seafood. As the \nSenator from Louisiana said--and Senator Sessions alluded to--the \nseafood is not only plentiful, abundant, and affordable, it is also \nvery safe. We are proud to represent the gulf coast and proud of these \ntwo extraordinary universities.\n  As a graduate of LSU, I am particularly proud. But our universities--\nboth the University of Alabama and the University of Louisiana, LSU--\nare tremendous universities that have an extraordinary reach across all \ndisciplines, and their football teams showed that great spirit on the \nfield.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that if LSU is victorious this weekend \nagainst western Kentucky, the Tigers will advance to 10 and 0. This \nwould be the first time they had done that since their national \nchampionship in 1958. So you know how excited our whole State is.\n  I also want to say the great news from this weekend is, whatever \nrecession there was in Alabama, I think it is over because of the \nstimulus brought to their State by our crazy LSU fans who started to \narrive on Wednesday, I understand. No one can tailgate like we can \ntailgate. So I think if they check their economic indicators this \nMonday afternoon, they all will be straight up from the good money and \ngood fun that was had in Alabama.\n  But, seriously, just in conclusion, Les Miles and our team are just \nunbelievable, and our LSU team is just terrific. But both teams played \ntheir hearts out, and I congratulate the men on the field that night. \nIt was an exciting game to watch, and according to the ratings the LSU-\nAlabama game drew the second highest rating of any CBS regular season \ncollege football broadcast since the network began its tracking.\n  So, again, I thank my colleagues for being good sports, and we are on \nthe road to the national championship. We may see them again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. \n674. The vote we have tonight is finally an opportunity to pass a truly \nbipartisan jobs bill, part of the President's jobs package. As I said \nwhen we held the first vote to try to repeal the 3-percent withholding \ntax a couple weeks ago, this vote is a no-brainer. It is pretty simple. \nUnfortunately, some Members objected to a small portion of that bill, \nthe offset. That should not be a concern this time. The bill we will be \nvoting on shortly just passed the House with 405 votes, and when is the \nlast time we heard that? The bill we are going to vote on today has a \nnew offset that has been endorsed by the President, so I say let's get \nit done.\n  If we pass it, every company that does business with the government \ncan go back to thinking about hiring new workers rather than worrying \nabout losing 3 percent of the value of their contracts right upfront, \nright in the beginning. If we pass it, State and local governments will \nnot be saddled with another costly and unfunded mandate. As I said \nbefore, it is a no-brainer. If we pass it, we will finally repeal a tax \nthat costs the government billions more to implement than it actually \nraises in revenue.\n  Let's pass this bill and let's end this stealth tax that is extremely \nexpensive to implement and punishes many for the bad acts of a few.\n  That being said, as we know, we have Veterans Day fast approaching. I \nthank all of our men and women who have served and continue to serve. I \ncannot think of anything more meaningful than to come together in a \ntruly bipartisan, bicameral way to help our jobless veterans. \nUnemployment and homelessness among our Active-Duty veterans and \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserves are a national disgrace and \nwe can do better. We should not leave anyone behind. The Active-Duty \nsoldiers and members of the Guard and Reserves fight side by side for \nour freedom. They face danger together, they are wounded together, and \nthey should be treated as equals when it comes to helping them find \njobs.\n  Back in January, I introduced the Hire-a-Hero Act with Senator Kay \nHagan. It expands the work opportunity tax credit to help companies put \nour veterans and members of the Guard and Reserves back to work. The \nPresident has proposed a similar action in his jobs bill. It did not \ninclude guardsmen and reservists, and that is why I hope when we take \nup the veterans package that I hear is being discussed, the majority \nleader will actually allow for that to be included. Our guardsmen and \nreservists, once again, deserve better.\n  It is time for our Senate colleagues to rally behind the men and \nwomen who have served and continue to serve. They are leaving the \nservice and need this opportunity right now. The unemployment rate for \nveterans is more than 12 percent. For members of the Guard and \nReserves, it is twice the national average, as high as 20 percent in \nsome areas. We need to treat this as a truly bipartisan and hopefully \nbicameral effort. It is something the American people are yearning for. \nThey are looking for us to show leadership, to actually work together. \nIf we can't work together with our heroes who have served and given to \nour country at its time of need, then I am not quite sure what we will \nbe able to work on together.\n  If we do these two things, repeal the 3-percent withholding and help \nour veterans in 1 day, potentially 1 week, maybe it will usher in a new \nera of good will, something I know the Chair and I have worked to \nestablish, as have so many other people in this historic Chamber. One \ngood deed can lead to another good deed and that good deed can lead to \nanother good deed, and so on.\n  Let's start working together. The American people are demanding it. \nAs I have said before, we are Americans first. I may be a Republican--\nand I am proud to be Republican--but we are Americans first. I am way \nmore proud to be an American. I hope others in this historic Chamber \nfeel the same way and we can put our party differences aside and do \nsomething very important for not only our businesses in this country \nbut also for the ones who have given so much in their service to our \ngreat Nation while serving in the military.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to continue an initiative \nthat was actually started by the Presiding Officer's predecessor, \nSenator Kaufman, whereby on a fairly regular basis I try to come down \nand recognize the service of one of our incredible Federal employees. \nWe spend a lot of time in this body talking about policy. We oftentimes \nspend a lot of time also talking about what government does wrong. \nThere are things government does wrong, but too often we don't \nacknowledge what government does right, particularly the incredible \nservice many of the folks who work for our Federal Government perform.\n  Today, I am pleased to honor another great Federal employee, Ms. Ann \nMartin. Ms. Martin is the Senior Intelligence Research Specialist for \nthe Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network or \nFinCEN. She worked with Mexican officials to help disrupt the \nlaundering of billions of dollars derived from illegal U.S. narcotics \nsales.\n  At the age of 29--as the Presiding Officer may recall when he was \nthat age--Ms. Martin led a team of financial experts to compile and \nanalyze hundreds of pieces of data. Her research analysis gave \nunprecedented insight into how Mexican drug cartels finance their \noperations in both Mexico and the United States. It also provided \nAmerican and Mexican law enforcement authorities with a number of leads \ninto cross-border money laundering and transnational organized crime \ngroups.\n  Discussing Ms. Martin's work, James Freis, the Director of FinCEN, \nexplained that ``no one had ever put together a picture of this kind of \nfinancial movement across our borders.'' In other words, nobody put \ntogether in an organized way the kinds of activities in which some of \nthese drug cartels were involved.\n  The exhaustive and comprehensive analysis Ms. Martin conducted \nsupported the Mexican Government's decision in June 2010 to issue new \nregulations to restrict the amount of U.S. dollars that could be \ndeposited into Mexican banks. As a result, more than 700 suspicious \nactivity reports have been filed from Mexican banks. In other words, we \nhave gotten the leads on 700 potential activities that are now being \ninvestigated due to Ms. Martin's work.\n  While her time working for the Federal Government has been relatively \nbrief, she has already made a major impact. Karen Fleischer, the Deputy \nAssociate Director at FinCEN, had this to say:\n\n       I've been in government for 35-plus years and Ann is the \n     kind of person that you want to hold up as an example for \n     others. She is extremely dedicated to the agency's mission.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Ms. Martin, a fellow \nVirginian, for the excellent work she has done and her commitment to \npublic service.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to authorize improvements to flood damage reduction \nfacilities adjacent to the American and Sacramento Rivers near \nSacramento, California, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Natomas \nBasin Flood Protection Improvements Act of 2011.\n  This legislation will authorize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to \nimprove the flood control infrastructure in the Sacramento area, \nsafeguarding many thousands of homes and businesses.\n  There is a pressing need to improve levees in Sacramento, a city that \nis perpetually cited as one of our Nation's most at-risk for severe \nflooding.\n  But even in this high-risk city, there are priority areas. Natomas, \nwhich lies between the American and Sacramento rivers, is the top \npriority for Sacramento flood control.\n  More than 100,000 people in the Natomas flood plain are at high or \nmoderate risk of flooding.\n  The vast majority of these homes would be inundated with over 10 feet \nof water should a levee break.\n  In some places, inundation levels would exceed 20 feet.\n  The risk is clear. Estimates by the Army Corps of Engineers put the \nrisk of levee failure at 1 in 3. Damages from a single flood could top \n$7 billion.\n  Recognizing the need to upgrade the levees in Natomas, the Corps of \nEngineers completed a Chief's Report in December 2010 that identified \n$1.1 billion in essential levee improvements.\n  According to the report, the principal levee modifications include \nthe widening of 41.9 miles of existing levees; installation of about \n34.8 miles of soil bentonite cutoff wall; installation of 8.3 miles of \nseepage berms, and bridge remediation on State Route 99.\n  In addition, the report recommends the creation of 75 acres of canal \nhabitat, 200 acres of Marsh habitat, and 60 acres of woodland habitat \nto ensure the project complies with the Endangered Species Act.\n  The cost of these improvements will be significant, but the burden \nwill be shared. The Chief's Report recommends that the costs of the \nimprovements be split between the federal government and state and \nlocal stakeholders.\n  The report recommends roughly a 65 percent federal share and a 35 \npercent state and local share.\n  The Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency, SAFCA, and the California \nDepartment of Water Resources have taken the cost-share agreement to \nheart and are outpacing the Corps of Engineers. They have begun their \nwork on the project even before the federal work has been authorized.\n  SAFCA and California have already invested more than $320 million in \nthe Natomas Basin project and repaired about 18 miles of the basin's 42 \nmiles of levees. By the end of 2012, this amount will increase to $370 \nmillion.\n  I want to take a moment to recognize SAFCA and the people of \nSacramento for their efforts. They have put their money where their \nmouth is. This project would not be possible without the significant \nleadership and resources they have already committed.\n  County voters twice approved special tax assessments, in 2007 and \n2011, to raise local funds needed to improve the levee system. These \nassessments will provide more than $80 million of local funds for flood \ncontrol projects. In addition, local interests have provided an \nadditional $40 million in advance of federal participation for which \ncredit will be sought, that is a total commitment thus far of $120 \nmillion\n  The most recent assessment passed overwhelmingly, 84.5 percent of \nvoters supported the measure.\n  Sacramento residents and homeowners understand that this levee \nimprovement project is critical to the safety and viability of their \ncommunity. Even during the worst economic downturns in a generation, \nvoters stood together, passed the measure and sent a definitive message \nto Congress.\n  I also want to recognize Representative Doris Matsui, author of \ncompanion legislation in the House and a champion on this issue. I have \nhad the pleasure of working with my good friend from Sacramento on \nflood control for nearly a decade, and her commitment and advocacy is \nunparalleled.\n  I want to reinforce the importance of this legislation. If Sacramento \nlevees fail, the results will be devastating Sacramento International \nAirport, which serves 4.4 million passengers per year and is the \nprimary air-cargo hub for the region, will be largely underwater.\n  Interstate 5, Interstate 80 and State Route 99 will be closed or \nrestricted. These roads serve as freight arteries and facilitate the \npassage of more than 2,500 trucks per day.\n  Access to the Port of West Sacramento, the city's primary seaport, \nwill be jeopardized.\n  Flooding in Sacramento is not a question of if, but when.\n  Recordbreaking storms hit the region in 1951, 1956, 1964, 1986 and \n1997.\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\n  During the 1997 storm, levee failures in the nearby cities of \nOlivehurst, Arboga, Wilton, Manteca and Modesto caused mass evacuations \nand millions of dollars in damages.\n  An even more devastating flood occurred in 1861 when the American \nRiver Levee failed. California's newly elected Governor, Leland \nStanford, was forced to take a row-boat to his inauguration and the \nstate capital was temporarily moved to San Francisco.\n  In January of this year, the U.S. Geological Survey released a study \nentitled ``ARkStorm'' that examined the impacts of an atmospheric river \nstorm event in California. This storm scenario produced rainfall levels \nseen once every 500 to 1,000 years.\n  In this model, the Central Valley would experience 300 miles of \nflooding, 20 or more miles wide. Evacuations could involve 1.5 million \nresidents, with hundreds of landslides damaging roads, highways, and \nhomes.\n  There is a statistical possibility that the cataclysmic scenario run \nby the U.S.G.S. will occur in our lifetime. The possibility is small, \nbut it could happen.\n  So we must be prepared if it does.\n  The Natomas Basin Flood Protection Improvements Act of 2011 is one \nsmall step toward achieving that.\n  This legislation addresses the needs of one of the highest-risk \ncommunities in our Nation.\n  While this legislation isn't cheap, the cost-share relieves a sizable \nshare of the Federal responsibility.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1810\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Natomas Basin Flood \n     Protection Improvements Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROJECT MODIFICATION, AMERICAN AND SACRAMENTO RIVERS, \n                   CALIFORNIA.\n\n       (a) In General.--The project for flood damage reduction, \n     American and Sacramento Rivers, California, authorized by \n     section 101(a)(1) of the Water Resources Development Act of \n     1996 (Public Law 104-303; 110 Stat. 3662; 113 Stat. 319; 117 \n     Stat. 1839; 121 Stat. 1947), is modified to authorize the \n     Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, \n     to construct improvements to flood damage reduction \n     facilities adjacent to the American and Sacramento Rivers in \n     the vicinity of Sacramento, California, substantially in \n     accordance with the report of the Chief of Engineers entitled \n     ``American River Watershed (Common Features) Project, Natomas \n     Basin, Sacramento and Sutter Counties, California'', and \n     dated December 30, 2010, at an estimated total cost of \n     $1,389,500,000, with an estimated Federal cost of \n     $921,200,000 and an estimated non-Federal cost of \n     $468,300,000.\n       (b) Credit for Non-Federal Work.--\n       (1) In general.--The non-Federal interest shall receive \n     credit for expenses and in-kind contributions incurred by the \n     non-Federal interest in carrying out a project described in \n     subsection (a) for planning, design, and construction of the \n     project and acquisition of any land, easement, right-of-way, \n     relocation, and dredged material disposal area for the \n     project.\n       (2) Application of credit.--The credit under paragraph (1) \n     shall be applied toward the non-Federal share of--\n       (A) the project; or\n       (B) any other project for which the non-Federal interest \n     has entered into a cost-sharing agreement with the Secretary.\n       (3) Limitation on statutory construction.--Nothing in this \n     subsection limits the ability of the non-Federal interest to \n     pursue credit or reimbursement for work performed by the non-\n     Federal interest in connection with the project under any \n     other law (including regulations), authority, or procedure, \n     including section 104 of the Water Resources Development Act \n     of 1986 (33 U.S.C. 2214).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 1815. A bill to codify and delay the implemenlation of and \ncompliance dates for a final rule relating to interstate transport of \nair pollution; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, later this week the Senate will vote on \na resolution to disapprove the Clean Air Act rule designed to limit the \nblowing of powerplant pollution from one State to another. In my \nopinion, overturning the rule would throw the matter back to \nregulators, back to courts, back to lawsuits, and back into a delay.\n  Senator Pryor of Arkansas and I are introducing today S. 1815. We \nhave sent it to the desk. It is bipartisan legislation that will \nprovide what we believe is a better approach, and that approach is to \nenact the clean air rule into law but give utilities 1 additional year \nin which to comply with it. Our approach would provide certainty and \ncleaner air at the lowest possible cost to ratepayers.\n  The motion to overturn the clean air rule will be offered by the \njunior Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul.\n  Tennesseans admire much about our Kentucky neighbors. We admire their \nbluegrass, we admire their basketball, we admire their distinguished \nSenators. But Tennesseans don't want Kentucky's State income tax, and \nwe don't want Kentucky's dirty air. We also know our neighbors in North \nCarolina don't want Tennessee's dirty air blowing into North Carolina \nbecause they have told us that through lawsuits in the courts, which \nthey have won.\n  Air pollution blowing from one State into another makes our citizens \nsick, especially our younger Tennesseans and our older Tennesseans. Air \npollution blowing from other States into our State is a jobs issue. \nPollution makes our Great Smoky Mountains more like the ``Great Smoggy \nMountains.'' We like to see our mountains and we like for the 9 million \nvisitors who come to visit us every year to stay a long time and to \nspend a lot of money because that supports our schools and it supports \nour State revenue.\n  Dirty air blowing into Tennessee from other States makes it harder \nfor us to create jobs in yet another way. I remember 30 years ago when \nI was Governor of Tennessee and the Nissan corporation came to our \nState. The very first thing Nissan did when it came to Tennessee was to \ngo down to the State Air Quality Board and ask for an air quality \npermit in order to operate its paint plant. Fortunately, the air \nquality in the Nashville area was clean enough that Nissan could locate \nthere. If Nissan hadn't been able to obtain an air quality permit to \noperate its paint plant, it would have been in Georgia or some other \nState. As a result the auto jobs which have come to Tennessee in the \ntens of thousands over the last 30 years would most likely have went to \nsome other State.\n  So dirty air blowing from Kentucky into Tennessee or Tennessee into \nNorth Carolina or from any State into another State makes it harder for \nthe recipient State's communities to get their quality permits. It \nmakes it harder, for example, for us to say to Volkswagen and its \nsuppliers: We can provide a home to you because our air is clean enough \nso that you can get our air quality permit.\n  Mr. President, in 2005, the Bush administration first put into place \nthe predecessor to the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule that we will be \nvoting on later this week. Federal courts found that the Bush rule was \nflawed in some technical respects and ordered the Environmental \nProtection Agency to write a new rule, which some now seek to overturn \nby means of the Congressional Review Act. The Bush clean air rule that \nwas put in place in 2005 has now been there for 6 years. Many utilities \nhave already taken steps to comply with it.\n  The pollution standards in the new rule we will be voting on are \nabout the same as those established in the 2005 Bush rule. As an \nexample of costs, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Nation's largest \npublic utility, tells us that complying with the amended rule will cost \nits ratepayers between $1 and $2 a month.\n  We often hear, and I will have to say that a lot of those comments \noften come from our side of the aisle, that it is the job of Congress, \nnot the bureaucrats and the courts, to write the clean air rules. The \ncommonsense legislation that Senator Pryor and I offer today is an \nopportunity for Congress to do its job in a way that will clean the air \nat the lowest possible cost to ratepayers.\n\n[[Page S7158]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/07/senate-section/article/S7158-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 312--COMMENDING GIRL SCOUTS OF THE USA ON THE SPECIAL \nOCCASION OF ITS 52ND ANNUAL CONVENTION AND COMMENDING THE COMMITMENT OF \n    GIRL SCOUTS OF THE USA TO THE MISSION OF FOSTERING THE COURAGE, \n CONFIDENCE, AND CHARACTER THAT GIRLS NEED TO BECOME LEADERS AND MAKE \n                        THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Mr. Cornyn) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 465, that the nomination be \nconfirmed with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions \nbe in order to the nomination; that any statements related to the \nnomination be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support the confirmation of the \nPresident's nominee to be the first inspector general of the \nintelligence community, Irvin Charles McCullough III.\n  The position of Inspector General of the Intelligence Community--or \nICIG--was created in the fiscal year 2010 Intelligence Authorization \nAct, after several years of effort to have the position enacted. The \nreason to have a Community-wide inspector general is similar to the \nreason to have a Director of National Intelligence.\n  The ICIG is intended to review, and conduct oversight on, \nintelligence activities across the 16 agencies that make up the \nintelligence community, as well as the Office of the DNI, instead of \nhaving every agency--and its IG--operate within its own stovepipe.\n  In recent years, the intelligence agencies have worked more closely \ntogether. This has improved performance and reduced duplication, but it \nhas also made the oversight work of individual agency inspectors \ngeneral more difficult.\n  The Intelligence Committee saw there was a need to create an \ninspector general with authority and oversight of the entire \nintelligence community, and one who could look at issues that cut \nacross individual agencies.\n  That view was reinforced by the relative weakness of the inspector \ngeneral position in the Office of the DNI that was authorized as part \nof the Intelligence Reform Act of 2004.\n  Thus, the committee pushed to have created the inspector general of \nthe intelligence community, to be confirmed by the Senate and given the \nstatutory authorities and independence of other Senate-confirmed \ninspectors general.\n  Mr. McCullough is well-qualified to be this first ICIG. He has long \nexperience conducting investigations both as an inspector general and a \nFBI agent. He is an attorney and is well-familiar with the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Mr. McCullough currently serves as the deputy inspector general of \nthe DNI's Office of the Inspector General. From 2003 to 2010, he was an \nassistant inspector general for the National Security Agency. He served \nfrom 2001-2003 as senior counsel for law enforcement and intelligence \nin the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Department of the Treasury \nand was for 10 years in the Federal Bureau of Investigation as \nattorney, special agent and supervisory special agent.\n  The Intelligence Committee received Mr. McCullough's nomination in \nAugust. After Mr. McCullough answered the committee's questionnaire and \nprehearing questions, we held a public hearing with him on September \n22. On October 4, the Intelligence Committee voted out Mr. McCullough's \nnomination on a rollcall vote of 15 to 0. His nomination was also \nconsidered in the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee \nand has moved forward by unanimous consent.\n  This important post will now be filled, and Mr. McCullough is \nqualified and prepared to take on the responsibilities and authorities \nof the position.\n  I support his confirmation.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n\n            office of the director of national intelligence\n\n       Irvin Charles McCullough III, of Maryland, to be Inspector \n     General of the Intelligence Community, Office of the Director \n     of National Intelligence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/07/senate-section/article/S7159-5", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
