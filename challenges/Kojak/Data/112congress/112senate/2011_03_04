Mr. President, earlier this week, Republicans showed \nwe can change the status quo in Washington.\n  The American people have made their position quite clear: Reverse the \nreckless spending and out-of-control expansion of government that \nDemocrats have presided over during the past 2 years; stop growing \ngovernment so Americans can grow the economy and the jobs that come \nalong with that. Republicans made a small first step in that direction.\n  Democrats have taken a different approach to these concerns. They \nhave sat on the sidelines hoping the public's concerns would pass or \nhoping that if they made enough of a stink over small cuts, they would \nseem bigger than they are. In other words, the Democrats' whole \napproach is to see what they can get away with rather than to actually \ndo something about the debt and jobs crises Americans want us to \naddress.\n  The White House proposal yesterday is equally unserious.\n  House Republicans have proposed a plan that would reduce spending by \n$61 billion in this year's budget. Earlier this week, we voted on a 2-\nweek piece of that bill that reduces spending by $4 billion.\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\n  The White House proposal, as outlined by the President's economic \nadviser yesterday, is to cut another $6 billion and call it a day. Even \nmore outrageous, they say the proposal meets us halfway. I won't get \ninto their tortured justification. Suffice it to say that Politico says \nit requires Americans to ``suspend disbelief.'' The Washington Post was \nequally unmoved by the White House logic. They said Democrats are \ndisingenuous in suggesting they have worked hard to reduce spending, \nand they agree that calling the latest proposal an effort to meet us \nhalfway is nonsense. That is the Washington Post. They agree that \ncalling this latest proposal an effort to meet us halfway nonsense.\n  So amid all the fanfare yesterday, what the White House is proposing \nis little more than one more proposal to maintain the status quo--to \ngive the appearance of action where there is none. The latest proposal \nis unacceptable and it is indefensible.\n  The American people are tired of hearing the same old talking points \nfrom our Democratic friends. They want action. In fact, they demand \naction. They want us to cut spending to help create a better \nenvironment for job creation. It is time for Washington Democrats to \nget serious.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the American economy is struggling. We are \ncoming out of recession--unfortunately, too slowly for most of us--but \nwe are emerging.\n  I can recall the ominous days when we first learned of the terrible \neconomic crisis facing our country. Some of us who serve in the Senate \nChamber were called into a meeting with the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, Mr. Bernanke, and then Secretary of the Treasury Mr. Paulson, \nand they told us the grim news that if we didn't act and act quickly, \nwe could see the American economy sinking lower, and perhaps even \nexperience a global depression. It was a frightening time. It was a \ntime before this current President came to office, and we had to act \ntogether on a bipartisan basis.\n  Decisions were made by many of us, trusting those in the Bush \nadministration who told us if we didn't act and act quickly, jobs would \nbe lost and businesses would fail and people would lose their savings, \nand it would be catastrophic. So we went forward with a plan that \ninitially I thought to be flawed but the only show in town, trying to \nhelp financial institutions survive the terrible economy and to turn \nthis situation around. We can say now that most of the money--virtually \nall of the money--that was invested in these financial institutions has \nbeen repaid with interest to the Federal Government, which is the right \nthing. And we continue to pursue those such as AIG where the government \nhas a substantial ownership in an effort to make certain that taxpayers \nrecoup the investment that saved a major insurance company. That is a \ngood thing.\n  Meanwhile, our economy moves forward at a slow pace, but at least it \ncontinues to move forward. New unemployment numbers for Illinois were \nreleased yesterday and new Federal numbers were released this morning. \nThose reports show that in Illinois, in the month of January, the \nunemployment rate was 9 percent, down from 9.3 percent. Also, 599,400 \nIllinoisans are looking for work, down from 620,600 last month. \nNationally, in the month of February, the unemployment rate was 8.9 \npercent, down from 9.0 last month, and significantly down from where it \nwas a few months ago. Also, 13.7 million Americans are looking for \nwork, down from 13.9 million last month. The report also shows that the \neconomy added 192,000 new jobs.\n  Unfortunately, the response of Congress has not taken into \nconsideration how fragile this economy is and how important the \nrecovery is. We hear from the other side--from Senator McConnell this \nmorning and others--that the biggest problem facing America today is \nour deficit. I would say to the Presiding Officer, who joins me in a \nbipartisan effort to try to deal with this deficit, we concede that \npoint. The deficit is a major issue. But we want to take care that the \nway we solve the deficit issue is sensitive to the state of the economy \nand our need to work together to end this recession.\n  So that is why H.R. 1, the House Republican budget, is a bill which I \ncan't support. It is not a good budget bill because it takes money out \nof key investments in our economy at a time when we need them the most. \nWhen we need to have better trained workers with skills for new jobs, \nthe House budget on the Republican side devastates worker training \nprograms.\n  Why would you do that in the midst of a recession with so many people \nout of work, at a time when we need more students graduating from \ncollege with diplomas and new skills and opportunities? The House \nRepublican budget cuts the Pell grants--the amount of money given to \nthose students from low-income families--by over $800 a year. Many \nyoung people will have to give up on education and delay it because of \nthat. How does that help us in our recovery? It doesn't.\n  Equally troubling is the House Republican budget, which makes \ndevastating cuts in areas of research and innovation. I am not saying \nthe best jobs in America are going to be government jobs; they are not \nand they should not be. They are going to be private sector jobs. But \ntime and again our private sector turns to our National Laboratories \nfor the research on the products they need to compete in the world.\n  The rollout of the Chevy Volt was announced all across the Nation. \nGeneral Motors was so proud. Here is an all-electric vehicle they are \ngoing to sell to America. I am glad they are doing it. It is not only \nenvironmentally responsible, but it reduces our dependence upon foreign \nenergy.\n  How did General Motors--this great corporation--develop the Chevy \nVolt? The first stop was the Argonne National Laboratory outside of \nChicago, where they worked with government scientists to build the \nbattery to put in the Chevy Volt. That is important.\n  What is going to happen to the Argonne National Laboratory because of \nthe House Republican budget? They will be forced to lay off one-third \nof their scientists, engineers, and support staff for the remainder of \nthe year, and they will cancel up to 50 percent of their research \nactivities, not just in new battery technology but in developing the \nnext generation of computers. Where is the fastest computer in the \nworld today? It is not in the U.S.A.; it is in China. We are trying to \nstep ahead and make sure the next fastest computer that can be used to \ndrive technology, invention, innovation, new companies, and new jobs is \nright here in America. Yet the House Republicans come up with \ndevastating cuts on the national research labs such as Argonne. How can \nwe justify it?\n  At the same time, they are cutting money to the National Institutes \nof Health. If there is one thing we all have in common, all of us--\nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents--it is our own vulnerability \nto illness and disease. That is a fact. When it happens, you want to \nmake sure you or your loved ones are in the hands of the best doctor, \nthe best hospital, with the best medicine and the best technology. We \nget that by investing in medical research.\n  What does the House Republican budget do? It cuts medical research. \nHow could we possibly cut back on research for cancer, Alzheimer's, \nAIDS, and diabetes? How can we do that when so many Americans are \nafflicted and so many costs are associated with those diseases? It is \nso shortsighted, and it is an indication that when they came to write \nthe budget, the House Republican leadership didn't focus thoughtfully \non what we need to cut to reduce the deficit and what we need to invest \nin to build the economy. They put them all together and said it makes \nno difference. If you have government spending, it is not going to \nmatter what it is.\n  Well, there are infrastructure projects--new roads, bridges, \nairports, and ports--that are essential for the growth of our economy.\n\n[[Page S1247]]\n\n  The House Republicans stop many of those very important investments--\nincluding in Illinois, investments where we won in a national \ncompetition to modernize our rail system around Chicago, to make \ncertain we have railroad service in parts of our State that currently \ndon't, and to modernize and make safer the airports, highways, and that \nwhich is critically essential to our future.\n  I say to the Republican side, yes, the deficit is an issue. But \nfirst, understand we will never balance the budget with 15 million \nAmericans out of work. We need to move this economy forward and tackle \nthis budget in a responsible way, not just to cut one small part of it \nunmercifully but to put the entire budget on the table. That is what \nthe deficit commission on which I served did. We need to do that in our \nNation in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I am happy to continue to join my colleagues who will sit down and \ndiscuss this, including the Presiding Officer, Senator Warner of \nVirginia. There are six of us--three Republicans and three Democrats. \nIt is the most unlikely gathering of politicians that you can imagine \nin one room to try to come up with a solution. We are people of good \nwill, and we know our historic responsibility. We are working through \nsome of the hardest issues and questions any Member of Congress can \nface when it comes to this issue.\n  If we are successful--and I underline ``if''--I hope we can move this \ncountry forward in a responsible way, putting the recession behind us \nand starting to get our house in order. We can no longer sustain a \nbudget where we owe 40 cents for every dollar we spend. Whether you are \non the left side of the spectrum, where I live politically, and value \nsuch things as help for education, help for the most vulnerable in \nAmerica, or whether you are on the other side of the spectrum, which \nprobably values national security issues and more investment in the \nmilitary, both of us are in this together. We have to both understand \nthere will not be enough money left for anything if we don't focus on \ndoing this dramatic, historic job of coming up with a way to reduce our \ndebt and our deficit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/04/senate-section/article/S1247-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SPENDING CUTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, thank you. I have a longer statement that I \nwill give after we finish this colloquy.\n  At 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon, we met in the Vice President's \noffice. It was a very fine meeting. Vice President Biden was there. My \nfriend, the Republican leader, me, the Speaker, and the minority leader \nof the House were there--McConnell, Reid, Boehner, and Pelosi. We spent \nabout an hour there.\n  The arrangement was that we would have a vote on H.R. 1 sometime next \nweek and also a vote on the bill that we have just laid down, which is \nour alternative as to what we think should be done with the economy. I \nknow our bill--because it is the way we have to do things here--is a \nlong bill, and I am sure the minority wants to spend some time looking \nat that. But one way or the other we will either do it with an \nagreement or through my filing different procedural motions. We will \nget to a point next week where we will vote on H.R. 1, which we \nDemocrats want to do. We will vote on the bill. Anyway, it has been \nhere for a while. Whatever the number it is, it is a Democratic \nalternative, which Senator Inouye laid down.\n  We believe, and I am confident that the Speaker feels the same way, \nthat we should vote on H.R. 1, which we have had calls for voting on \nfor more than a week now. I have had statements from the press: Why \ndoesn't Reid set up a vote on H.R. 1? We will either do that with a \nunanimous consent agreement with my friend, the Republican leader, or \nwe will do it through a procedural motion that I will file later today.\n  The amendment to that bill is No. 149, and that is Senator Inouye's. \nIt cuts some $51 billion from what the President's budget was.\n  To move the process forward, I think this is a place to start. We \nhave some confidence that we will get votes on our bill, and we will \nmove this matter forward. Regardless, if H.R. 1 does not pass--and it \nwill not pass--and if ours does not pass, we at least know where we \nstand to move this ball down the road a little further.\n  The Speaker said that would allow the negotiations to start. I am \nparaphrasing, but that is about what he said. That is what all of us in \nthe room decided to do yesterday.\n  Today I seek to set those two votes for Tuesday afternoon: one vote \non passing H.R. 1, as it came over from the House, and after that we \nwould have a vote on passing the alternative, which Chairman Inouye has \ndrafted and is amendment No. 149. Once we get that, it would seem a \nfair proposition to move forward.\n  As I said, I know my friend, the Republican leader, has a scheduling \nproblem. I understand that. I would have liked to have come in earlier \ntoday, and so would he, but we were not able to do that. I will give a \nmore full explanatory statement in a few minutes.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Requests--H.R. 1\n\n  But right now, I ask unanimous consent that upon disposition of S. \n23, which is the patent bill, the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 14, H.R. 1, the Defense appropriations long-term \ncontinuing resolution for fiscal year 2011; that Senator Reid be \nrecognized to offer a substitute amendment, the text of which is at the \ndesk; that there be 4 hours of debate equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees prior to a vote in relation to the \nsubstitute amendment; that upon disposition of the substitute \namendment, the Senate proceed to vote on H.R. 1, as amended, if \namended, with no intervening action or debate; that no motions or \namendments be in order to the substitute amendment or to the bill prior \nto the votes; that the substitute amendment and the bill be subject to \na 60-vote threshold; and that if H.R. 1, as amended, if amended, does \nnot achieve 60 affirmative votes, it be returned to the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and for the short term \nI am going to object today, we received this 350-page amendment at \n11:45. We need a chance over the weekend to take a look at what our \nfriends have offered. It could well be by Monday we will conclude this \nproposal the majority leader has laid out as the best way to go \nforward. We will continue to talk about that over the weekend. But for \ntoday I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon \ndisposition of S. 23, the patent bill, the Senate proceed to H.R. 1, \nthe Defense appropriations long-term continuing resolution for fiscal \nyear 2011.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I now withdraw my motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when an American family sits at their table \nin the kitchen and sorts through their finances, as they often do, \npartisan politics do not figure into that equation. When the families \nwe represent calculate their own budgets, when they add up the cost of \ngas and groceries, tuition in some instances, and other necessities, \nthey care more about the bottom lines than news headlines. When a \nfamily desperately counts the dwindling number of weeks before its \nunemployment insurance runs out, that family does not have the time to \nkeep track of which side scored the most political points during any \ngiven week. That is because when you have to make the tough decisions \nthat go into any budget, those decisions have to be practical, not \npolitical. They have to be realistic, not ideological.\n  We often tell ourselves and our colleagues that we should be as \nresponsible as the American people. As their representatives, we \nabsolutely must be sympathetic to the challenges outside this Chamber, \nand we need to come quickly to a resolution that benefits them before \nworrying about whether it benefits us. As careful as we must be not to \nwaste the American people's money, we must be just as mindful not to \nwaste their time.\n  Regrettably, though, the budget debate has turned into a political \nexercise, and I am sorry to say not much more. That is \ncounterproductive. We need to be as serious as the challenge before us. \nI am much more concerned with actually keeping our country running and \ninvesting smartly in our future than I am in this political game we \nsee.\n  When they wake up in the morning, the American people want to send \ntheir children to a good school and then go to a good job. And now they \nare saying ``a job.'' They want their families to come home to a safe \nneighborhood at night, and they want to go to sleep knowing our country \nis safe from those who want to do us harm. They do not care about who \ngets credit. They do not care about who thought of how best to do it. \nThey just want us to do it.\n  The time for politics should be over. We have set up a procedure--it \nwas agreed to in the Vice President's office--to get this H.R. 1 out of \nthe way. Everyone knows it is not going to pass. It is a very \ndifficult, bad piece of legislation. Get rid of that. We will do what \nwe think is responsible and cut spending by $51 billion and not have \nall the mean-spirited riders that are attached to H.R. 1 that on their \nown could not pass over here. It was a mad rush to see who could do the \nmost sensational amendment. Bring it over here in the light of day, \nrefer it to a committee, have a hearing on it. Once that is done, none \nwould come to the floor, with rare exception. But they were not willing \nto do that.\n  The time for pragmatism is overdue also. This is what the Senate is \ngoing to do. We are going to vote early next week on the Democrats' \nplan, and we are going to vote on the Republicans' plan. It seems fair. \nLet the American people decide which is the better of the two. Everyone \nwill have the chance to be on record supporting whichever plan.\n  Let me talk briefly about the merits of each of these plans and what \nthey will do.\n  First of all, H.R. 1, which will go down as probably one of the worst \npieces of legislation ever drafted in the history of this Congress. \nFirst, this reckless Republican plan the tea party has pushed through \nthe House--that irresponsible proposal--slashes investments, cuts jobs, \nand sacrifices security and education. Yes, it cuts a lot of money \ntoday, but America would lose so much tomorrow because these cuts are \nmade arbitrarily without regard for the consequences. That is why \nleading independent economists agree it would hurt our economy, slow \ngrowth, and cost jobs. We cannot afford that. The day before yesterday \non National Public Radio, they had more than 300 economists who were \nsaying with one voice: Do not do this. We can't be blinded by the big \nnumbers in the House Republican plan. We have to scrutinize how they \ncut $63 billion. The truth is, it adds up to $61 billion through \nsignificant subtraction of programs the American people don't want to \nlose. It slashes more than $1 billion from Social Security--$1 \nbillion--which means \\1/2\\ million seniors who paid into Social \nSecurity their entire lives and now are eligible for it would not be \nable to get the benefits promised to them because there is nobody to \nprocess the claims.\n\n  It cuts $700 million from education, which means 1 million \ndisadvantaged students could lose funding and more than 10,000 \nteachers, aides, and school staff would lose their jobs. It would even \ntake 200,000 children out of the Head Start Program.\n  What is the Head Start Program? These are not just words, they are \nprograms to educate the poorest of the poor children. It has worked out \nwell. Try to find someone who criticizes the Head Start Program. These \nlittle boys and girls have no alternative, and it has worked out well \nbecause the parents are involved. They are going to eliminate 200,000 \nchildren from this wonderful program of Head Start.\n  The Republican H.R. 1 closes poison control centers and cuts $100 \nmillion from food safety inspections. That means the food we eat could \nbe both less safe and more expensive. That is a lose-lose proposition.\n  It also cuts $\\3/4\\ billion--$750 million--from renewable energy \ninvestments.\n  The reason that is so important is these investments are incentives \nfor people to do these kinds of jobs. You can drive 36 miles from my \nhome in Searchlight, NV, and get to the 31-mile mark, where you look \noff to the left and there are 1 million solar panels being installed--1 \nmillion solar panels--producing huge amounts of electricity in the \nsummer and winter in what we call the great dry lake. That was done \nbecause of these programs so that we don't have to be beholden to the \nMiddle East tyrants who are shipping us oil.\n  So it cuts $\\3/4\\ billion from renewable energy investments, which \nwill cost us jobs, threaten our energy independence, and delay the day \nAmerica lives and works in a clean energy economy.\n  It also cuts hundreds of millions of dollars from border security and \nport security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. When an \nemergency comes, we need to be able to respond to that. Even Republican \nCongressmen have said, and are now admitting, it is not so smart to \npinch pennies on the backs of the Nation's emergency management and \nfirst responders.\n  In my conference room right across the hall, one of the Shriver boys \ncame in to see me. The Shriver family has done so much for our country. \nThe eldest Shriver, who just died, was head of the Peace Corps. \nProbably their No. 1 mark has been how they have worked with children, \nyoung men and women with physical and emotional challenges. They \nbrought a number of those young men and women--some are not so young \nanymore--in to see me. Some of the great programs being cut in H.R. 1 \nhelp Special Olympics. The Best Buddy Program is another one. And \nShriver told me he had talked to a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, an elected Member of the House of Representatives who \nvoted for H.R. 1, and he asked: How could you do that? How could you do \nthat, when you have a child with Downs Syndrome? Her response was: Oh, \nI didn't know it was in the bill. I didn't know it was in the bill.\n  I have been talking, Mr. President, about H.R. 1. I ask, how many \npages are in H.R. 1?\n  Mr. President, can you tell me how many pages are in H.R. 1?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three hundred and eighty-two pages.\n  Mr. REID. Three hundred and eighty-two pages. Well, Mr. President, I \nhave only talked about enough to take up\n\n[[Page S1249]]\n\ntwo or three pages, but it is full of the same kind of stuff I have \ntalked about today--stuff that is not fair and is mean-spirited.\n  We all want to cut. I represent the State of Nevada. We are in a deep \neconomic problem. We know, though, we have to cut things. The Presiding \nOfficer is from the State of Connecticut. We are both members of the \nDemocratic Party. We have supported these programs because it was the \nright thing to do. We recognize there is going to have to be cuts made, \nbut we have to do it with a scalpel, not a meat cleaver. Then to hear \nthat a Member of the House said: Well, I didn't know it was in the \nbill--eliminating and cutting drastically a program for people with \nemotional, mental, and physical challenges--I didn't know it was in the \nbill. Well, there is a lot of that same type of stuff in this bill, \nH.R. 1. That is why it is going to be defeated here.\n  I would say to my friends, the Republicans, I can't imagine you will \nall vote for this bill. We have to move beyond partisan politics and do \nwhat is right. I don't know how many, but not all Republicans will vote \nfor that.\n  I have been castigated in the press: Why doesn't Reid allow a vote? \nLet's have a vote. Well, I am willing to move on that, but I couldn't \ndo it. I had to file cloture to move to proceed to it. They wouldn't \neven let me do that. But we are going to get to it because I know the \nprocedures around here. I can get to this bill, and I can do it next \nweek.\n  I have just talked about the tip of the iceberg with this mean-\nspirited H.R. 1. Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke said these cuts--and \nthere are many more like them than I have already said there are--will \ncost a significant number of jobs. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at \nMoody's and formerly the chief economic adviser for John McCain, has \nsaid that H.R. 1 will cost our country 700,000 jobs.\n  These cuts place far too heavy a burden on working families, low-\nincome children and seniors, and it asks little, if any, sacrifice from \nthose who rake in unnecessary taxpayer-funded subsidies they do not \nneed. That is no way to recover.\n  Look at oil and gas subsidies. The former head of Chevron Oil said: \nWe don't need them; we are doing fine.\n  Mr. President, I have been very helpful to my farm State Senators. I \nhave helped them work their way through droughts and floods and all \nkinds of things. I understand how important agriculture is. But very \nfew times in the history of our country have commodity prices been so \nhigh--so high. Don't you think they could take a little nick--a little \nnick--rather than take it away from Head Start Programs and programs \nsuch as that?\n  Our plan was filed today by Senator Inouye, who is a very sensitive, \ngood man. I don't need to recount who he is, but he is one of the most \nfamous men in the history of our country. He has been in Congress a \nlong time, but we always remember this man was a hero on the \nbattlefields of Italy where he lost his arm and was badly injured. As a \nresult of his heroic actions there, he received a Congressional Medal \nof Honor. But he is also a hero in these legislative Halls. He was one \nof the leaders in the Watergate hearings, and there are many other \nthings he has done over the years to become a hero in addition to being \na hero on the battlefield. The amendment we have filed is his \namendment.\n  So Democrats have a different plan--the Inouye plan--which represents \nour different priorities, and it is supported by the President. We know \nwe have to make cuts. I have said that this morning several times. We \nalso know when we cut, we have to cut in a way that strengthens our \neconomy not in a way that weakens it. We have to look carefully at the \nquality of these cuts and not get blinded by the quantity of the cuts.\n  I have said before that a person could lose a lot of weight--you, I, \nanybody in this room. We could cut off our arms and legs, and we would \nhave accomplished the purpose of losing a lot of weight. But no doctor \nwould recommend it. That is what they have done with H.R. 1. No well-\nreasoning economist would recommend it.\n  Our plan cuts $51 billion from President Obama's budget but in a much \nmore responsible way. We are eliminating redundancies, ending \nunnecessary bureaucratic programs, and cutting funds for earmarks. We \nhave agreed to cut funding for earmarks. I don't like that. I have told \nthe President I don't like it. I believe we are giving up too much \npower to the President in getting rid of those earmarks. We have \nobligations to do congressionally directed funding. But I have agreed, \nas all of us over here have, to accept that.\n\n  Remember, Mr. President, when we have a budget of $10 and we have 2/\n10 of 1 percent that goes to congressionally directed funding, it is \nstill the same amount of money. It is just that the President didn't \ndetermine where that money is spent; Congress had a say in it. But we \nhave agreed. We have agreed. We have earmarks in here, billions of \ndollars of them, that are going to go toward cutting the deficit. I \nhave agreed to accept that.\n  So ending unnecessary bureaucratic programs and cutting funding, as I \nhave indicated, for other things. I commend my friend, Dr. Coburn, the \nSenator from Oklahoma. He got a GAO report that shows all kinds of \nredundancies and overlapping. Those are places we can cut money. Let's \ndo it.\n  Our plan recognizes we are not in competition to determine who can \ncut the most without regard for the consequences. Rather, we need to \ncooperate to figure out where we can cut the smartest. While the House-\npassed plan is based on ideology, we believe ours is based on reality. \nNot ideology, but reality. These are decisions about real money to \nsolve real problems that affect real lives. Our budget affirms our \ndetermination that we have to also reflect our values.\n  We see our modestly recovering economy, including today's news about \nemployers hiring at the fastest rate in a year, and the national \nunemployment rate fell to a nearly 2-year low. We can't squander this \ncautiously optimistic news with counterproductive cuts--eliminating \n700,000 jobs.\n  I hope when we have these votes next week on H.R. 1 people will run \nfrom that. For the people who vote for that, it will take all their \nlegislative lives and afterwards trying to live down having voted for \nthat bill. But this is what each Senator will vote for or against next \nweek. These votes, like all our votes, are about choices, and what I \nhave just outlined is what these choices represent.\n  Not to spoil the surprise, but we all know how this vote will turn \nout. We know neither will reach the President's desk as written. \nRepublicans likely will not vote for ours. I hope they do. If it were a \nsimple majority vote, we would win that. But Republicans have \nestablished a different standard--60 votes. We accept that. So we will \nend up back at square 1, without consensus, without a budget for the \nrest of this fiscal year, and without assurance that we can keep the \ncountry running.\n  So once these votes are behind us and everyone's voice is heard, I \nhope each Senator and Member of Congress will find renewed motivation \nto do what we have needed to do since the beginning: come together, \nnegotiate in good faith, working on consensus and compromise. \nLegislation is the art of compromise. Legislation is not who can flex \ntheir muscles the biggest, the longest, and the hardest. Legislation is \nthe art of compromise, working out things for the American people.\n  We have to acknowledge that the answer that will allow us to move \nforward lies somewhere between our two positions perhaps. We have to \nrecognize that digging in one's heels threatens our fiscal footing. If \none side stubbornly demands victory, everyone loses. That goes for both \nparties and both Chambers. This negotiation will not happen in the \nmedia, and a solution cannot be found in extreme rhetoric or \nunrealistic idealism. It will happen when we sit down and have an adult \nconversation about what our country and our constituents need. That is \nthe only worthy exercise.\n\n  How we invest taxpayer money, how we create a foundation for our \nfuture, how we articulate our priorities to our citizens and States \nacross the country and allies around the world is not political. It is \namong the most practical things we do.\n  There is no dispute among the 53 Democrats. We are willing to cut. We \nhave cut $51 billion from our President's budget. As we talked about, \nwe\n\n[[Page S1250]]\n\nare willing to do more. But we are not willing to do this with a meat \naxe. We want to do it the right way. We want to take a scalpel and be \nvery careful how we affect people's lives. And when it is over with, we \ndon't want people saying I didn't know it was in the bill, even though \nit affects that person as personally as anything could.\n  When we talk about where to invest and what to cut, everyone is \nconcerned about the budget's bottom line. When we talk about how we can \nget there, here is the bottom line of the negotiation process: Yes, we \nhave to make tough choices, but that is what leadership is all about. \nIt is true that no one here will get everything he or she wants. My \nfriend, the Presiding Officer, was a long-time attorney general of one \nof our--I was going to say most famous States--but one of the original \nStates, who is noted for his fairness. If an attorney general or a \nlawyer is noted for fairness, that person is known to be willing to \ncompromise. That is what it is all about. It is the same in the law as \nit is here in the Senate.\n  When we talk about how we can get there, the bottom line is \nnegotiation. We have to make tough choices. But I repeat, that is what \nleadership is all about.\n  Today marks 150 years since Abraham Lincoln took his first oath of \noffice as the President of our country--whose very existence at the \ntime was in question. Like the incomplete Nation he had just sworn to \nlead, this great Capitol building was unfinished. As he addressed the \nNation for the first time as President, President Lincoln stood on the \neast front of the Capitol building under cranes and scaffolding that \nrepresented growth and uncertainty at the same time. Now, 150 years, \nlater the threats we face are nowhere near as dire as the Civil War \nLincoln's America was about to endure but his words that afternoon are \nuseful to us to hear this afternoon, for we are again at a moment of \nperil in our country. Again, we will sink or swim together.\n  As Lincoln closed that Inaugural Address 150 years ago today, he \nreminded a divided nation that, ``we are not enemies but friends. . . . \nThough passion may have strained it, it must not break our bonds of \naffection.''\n  Lincoln then famously called on us to recall the ``better angels of \nour nature.'' Those are his words. If we listen to his critical lesson \nin leadership at this critical moment in history, we will secure in our \ntime a stronger future for this great Nation we call America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/04/senate-section/article/S1250-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the continuing resolution we introduce \ntoday, which is $51 billion below the President's budget request, \nimposes responsible cuts and terminations across a wide variety of \nprograms. In contrast to the House bill, the Senate proposal will allow \nthe government to continue operating at reduced levels without major \ndisruptions that would set back our economic recovery and eliminate \ncountless American jobs.\n  The House-passed CR would cut $51 billion more than the Senate \nmeasure, with the vast majority of cuts coming from nondefense \nspending. The House bill would jeopardize our economic recovery at a \ncritical time, and severely disrupt the ability of Federal agencies to \ncarry out even their most basic functions. If enacted in its current \nform, the House bill would lead to furloughs and to premature \ntermination or postponement of contracts that will end up costing \ntaxpayers additional dollars in the future. The House bill would cause \nbacklogs in Social Security claims, undermine nuclear weapons safety, \nremove more than 200,000 children from of Head Start, and close poison \ncontrol centers across America. These are just a few specific examples \nof the irresponsible nature of the House Republican bill as a whole.\n  The Senate has put forward a reasonable, fiscally responsible bill \nthat will reduce funding at a rate that is $51 billion below the \nPresident's budget request. This bill is a good faith effort to meet in \nthe middle. It is now time to end political gamesmanship and stop \ngambling with people's lives and livelihoods. I urge our counterparts \nin the House to engage in a constructive dialogue with us that will end \nthe current budget stalemate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/04/senate-section/article/S1250-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1250-S1261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

and\n       (3) the term ``adjudicatory review'' means a proceeding \n     undertaken by the Select Committee after a finding, on the \n     basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Select Committee to conclude that a violation within the \n     jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred.\n       (c) (1) No--\n       (A) adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member or officer \n     of the Senate may be conducted;\n       (B) report, resolution, or recommendation relating to such \n     an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made;

The preliminary inquiry shall be \n     of duration and scope necessary to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a violation \n     within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred. \n     The Select Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice \n     chairman the discretion to determine the appropriate \n     duration, scope, and conduct of a preliminary inquiry.\n       (2) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under \n     paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines by a recorded \n     vote that there is not such substantial credible evidence, \n     the Select Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Select \n     Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice chairman the \n     authority, on behalf of the Select Committee, to dismiss any \n     matter that they determine, after a preliminary inquiry, \n     lacks substantial merit. The Select Committee shall inform \n     the individual who provided to the Select Committee the \n     complaint, allegation, or information, and the individual who \n     is the subject of the complaint, allegation, or information, \n     of the dismissal, together with an explanation of the basis \n     for the dismissal.\n       (3) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under \n     paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that a \n     violation is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de \n     minimis nature, the Select Committee may dispose of the \n     matter by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, \n     which shall not be considered discipline. The Select \n     Committee may issue a public letter of admonition upon a \n     similar determination at the conclusion of an adjudicatory \n     review.\n       (4) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under \n     paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that there is \n     such substantial credible evidence and the matter cannot be \n     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (3), the Select \n     Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review. \n     Upon the conclusion of such adjudicatory review, the Select \n     Committee shall report to the Senate, as soon as practicable, \n     the results of such adjudicatory review, together with its \n     recommendations (if any) pursuant to subsection (a)(2).\n       (e) (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or \n     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection (a)(3) \n     may, within 30 days of the Select Committee's report to the \n     Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of \n     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing \n     written notice of the basis for the appeal to the Select \n     Committee and the presiding officer of the Senate. The \n     presiding officer of the Senate shall cause the notice of the \n     appeal to be printed in the Congressional Record and the \n     Senate Journal.\n       (2) A motion to proceed to consideration of an appeal \n     pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be highly privileged and not \n     debatable. If the motion to proceed to consideration of the \n     appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall be decided on the basis \n     of the Select Committee's report to the Senate. Debate on the \n     appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, which shall be divided \n     equally between, and controlled by, those favoring and those \n     opposing the appeal.\n       (f) The Select Committee may, in its discretion, employ \n     hearing examiners to hear testimony and make findings of fact \n     and/or recommendations to the Select Committee concerning the \n     disposition of complaints.\n       (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no \n     adjudicatory review shall be initiated of any alleged \n     violation of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, \n     rule, or regulation which was not in effect at the time the \n     alleged violation occurred. No provisions of the Senate Code \n     of Official Conduct shall apply to or require disclosure of \n     any act, relationship, or transaction which occurred prior to \n     the effective date of the applicable provision of the Code. \n     The Select Committee may initiate an adjudicatory review of \n     any alleged violation of a rule or law which was in effect \n     prior to the enactment of the Senate Code of Official Conduct \n     if the alleged violation occurred while such rule or law was \n     in effect and the violation was not a matter resolved on the \n     merits by the predecessor Select Committee.\n       (h) The Select Committee shall adopt written rules setting \n     forth procedures to be used in conducting preliminary \n     inquiries and adjudicatory reviews.\n       (i) The Select Committee from time to time shall transmit \n     to the Senate its recommendation as to any legislative \n     measures which it may consider to be necessary for the \n     effective discharge of its duties.\n       Sec. 3.

In any such \n     case an absent member's vote may be announced solely for the \n     purpose of recording the member's position and such announced \n     votes shall not be counted for or against the motion.\n       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph \n     (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held \n     open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the \n     absent Committee member has been informed of the matter on \n     which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested of the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.\n       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered \n     to the Chairman or Vice Chairman to be recorded.\n       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purpose of \n     establishing a quorum.\n       (n) APPROVAL OF BLIND TRUSTS AND FOREIGN TRAVEL REQUESTS \n     BETWEEN SESSIONS AND DURING EXTENDED RECESSES: During any \n     period in which the Senate stands in adjournment between \n     sessions of the Congress or stands in a recess scheduled to \n     extend beyond fourteen days, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     or their designees, acting jointly, are authorized to approve \n     or disapprove blind trusts under the provision of Rule XXXIV.\n       (o) COMMITTEE USE OF SERVICES OR EMPLOYEES OF OTHER \n     AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS: With the prior consent of the \n     department or agency involved, the Committee may (1) utilize \n     the services, information, or facilities of any such \n     department or agency of the Government, and (2) employ on a \n     reimbursable basis or otherwise the services of such \n     personnel of any such department or agency as it deems \n     advisable. With the consent of any other committee of the \n     Senate, or any subcommittee, the Committee may utilize the \n     facilities and the services of the staff of such other \n     committee or subcommittee whenever the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee, acting jointly, determine that \n     such action is necessary and appropriate.\n\n\n     RULE 2: PROCEDURES FOR COMPLAINTS, ALLEGATIONS, OR INFORMATION\n\n       (a) COMPLAINT, ALLEGATION, OR INFORMATION: Any member or \n     staff member of the Committee shall report to the Committee, \n     and any other person may report to the Committee, a sworn \n     complaint or other allegation or information, alleging that \n     any Senator, or officer, or employee of the Senate has \n     violated a law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any \n     rule or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     any individual in the performance of his or her duty as a \n     Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, or has engaged in \n     improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate. Such \n     complaints or allegations or information may be reported to \n     the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a Committee member, or a \n     Committee staff member.\n       (b) SOURCE OF COMPLAINT, ALLEGATION, OR INFORMATION: \n     Complaints, allegations, and information to be reported to \n     the Committee may be obtained from a variety of sources, \n     including but not limited to the following:\n       (1) sworn complaints, defined as a written statement of \n     facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the \n     personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of \n     law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule \n     or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     individuals in the performance of their duties as members, \n     officers, or employees of the Senate;\n       (2) anonymous or informal complaints;\n       (3) information developed during a study or inquiry by the \n     Committee or other committees or subcommittees of the Senate, \n     including information obtained in connection with legislative \n     or general oversight hearings;\n       (4) information reported by the news media; or\n       (5) information obtained from any individual, agency or \n     department of the executive branch of the Federal Government.\n       (c) FORM AND CONTENT OF COMPLAINTS: A complaint need not be \n     sworn nor must it be in any particular form to receive \n     Committee consideration, but the preferred complaint will:\n       (1) state, whenever possible, the name, address, and \n     telephone number of the party filing the complaint;\n       (2) provide the name of each member, officer or employee of \n     the Senate who is specifically alleged to have engaged in \n     improper conduct or committed a violation;\n       (3) state the nature of the alleged improper conduct or \n     violation;\n       (4) supply all documents in the possession of the party \n     filing the complaint relevant to or in support of his or her \n     allegations as an attachment to the complaint.\n\n\n        RULE 3: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING A PRELIMINARY INQUIRY\n\n       (a) DEFINITION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: A ``preliminary \n     inquiry'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee \n     following the receipt of a complaint or allegation of, or \n     information about, misconduct by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.\n       (b) BASIS FOR PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: The Committee shall \n     promptly commence a preliminary inquiry whenever it has \n     received a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or \n     information about, alleged misconduct or violations pursuant \n     to Rule 2.\n       (c) SCOPE OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY:\n       (1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such duration and \n     scope as is necessary to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee \n     may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope, \n     and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary \n     inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman or by the Committee as a whole, the day to day \n     supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, or subpoenas \n     deemed appropriate to obtain information upon which to\n\n[[Page S1256]]\n\n     make any determination provided for by this Rule.\n       (d) OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSE: A preliminary inquiry may \n     include an opportunity for any known respondent or his or her \n     designated representative to present either a written or oral \n     statement, or to respond orally to questions from the \n     Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be \n     transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement \n     or answers.\n       (e) STATUS REPORTS: The Committee staff or outside counsel \n     shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The \n     reports shall be confidential.\n       (f) FINAL REPORT: When the preliminary inquiry is \n     completed, the staff or outside counsel shall make a \n     confidential report, oral or written, to the Committee on \n     findings and recommendations, as appropriate.\n       (g) COMMITTEE ACTION: As soon as practicable following \n     submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the \n     Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee \n     may make any of the following determinations:\n       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such \n     substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the \n     Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of \n     the Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a \n     preliminary inquiry, is determined to lack substantial \n     merit. The Committee shall inform the complainant of the \n     dismissal.\n       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation \n     is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis \n     nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter \n     by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which \n     shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be \n     subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance of a letter of \n     admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote \n     of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence and that the matter cannot be \n     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, \n     the Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review \n     in accordance with Rule 4. No adjudicatory review of conduct \n     of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate may be \n     initiated except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less \n     than four members of the Committee.\n\n\n        RULE 4: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING AN ADJUDICATORY REVIEW\n\n       (a) DEFINITION OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: An ``adjudicatory \n     review'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee after a \n     finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is \n     substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has \n     occurred.\n       (b) SCOPE OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: When the Committee \n     decides to conduct an adjudicatory review, it shall be of \n     such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to \n     determine whether a violation within its jurisdiction has \n     occurred. An adjudicatory review shall be conducted by \n     outside counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) of Senate \n     Resolution 338 unless the Committee determines not to use \n     outside counsel. In the course of the adjudicatory review, \n     designated outside counsel, or if the Committee determines \n     not to use outside counsel, the Committee or its staff, may \n     conduct any inquiries or interviews, take sworn statements, \n     use compulsory process as described in Rule 6, or take any \n     other actions that the Committee deems appropriate to secure \n     the evidence necessary to make a determination.\n       (c) NOTICE TO RESPONDENT: The Committee shall give written \n     notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an \n     adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent to the \n     respondent no later than five working days after the \n     Committee has voted to conduct an adjudicatory review. The \n     notice shall include a statement of the nature of the \n     possible violation, and description of the evidence \n     indicating that a possible violation occurred. The Committee \n     may offer the respondent an opportunity to present a \n     statement, orally or in writing, or to respond to questions \n     from members of the Committee, the Committee staff, or \n     outside counsel.\n       (d) RIGHT TO A HEARING: The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not \n     requiring discipline by the full Senate).\n       (e) PROGRESS REPORTS TO COMMITTEE: The Committee staff or \n     outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee \n     concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review. Such \n     reports shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and \n     shall be confidential.\n       (f) FINAL REPORT OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW TO COMMITTEE: Upon \n     completion of an adjudicatory review, including any hearings \n     held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside counsel or the staff \n     shall submit a confidential written report to the Committee, \n     which shall detail the factual findings of the adjudicatory \n     review and which may recommend disciplinary action, if \n     appropriate. Findings of fact of the adjudicatory review \n     shall be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary \n     action is recommended.\n       (g) COMMITTEE ACTION:\n       (1) As soon as practicable following submission of the \n     report of the staff or outside counsel on the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee shall prepare and submit a report to \n     the Senate, including a recommendation or proposed resolution \n     to the Senate concerning disciplinary action, if appropriate. \n     A report shall be issued, stating in detail the Committee's \n     findings of fact, whether or not disciplinary action is \n     recommended. The report shall also explain fully the reasons \n     underlying the Committee's recommendation concerning \n     disciplinary action, if any. No adjudicatory review of \n     conduct of a Member, officer or employee of the Senate may be \n     conducted, or report or resolution or recommendation relating \n     to such an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made, except \n     by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four \n     members of the Committee.\n       (2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, section 2 (a), \n     subsections (2), (3), and (4), after receipt of the report \n     prescribed by paragraph (f) of this rule, the Committee may \n     make any of the following recommendations for disciplinary \n     action or issue an order for reprimand or restitution, as \n     follows:\n       (i) In the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate \n     for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, \n     recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the \n     Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a \n     combination of these;\n       (ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a \n     recommendation to the Senate of dismissal, suspension, \n     payment of restitution, or a combination of these;\n       (iii) In the case where the Committee determines, after \n     according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and \n     opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred \n     warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the \n     full Senate, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) \n     of this rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote of six \n     members order that a Member, officer or employee be \n     reprimanded or pay restitution or both;\n       (iv) In the case where the Committee determines that \n     misconduct is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de \n     minimis nature, issue a public or private letter of \n     admonition to a Member, officer or employee, which shall not \n     be subject to appeal to the Senate.\n       (3) In the case where the Committee determines, upon \n     consideration of all the evidence, that the facts do not \n     warrant a finding that there is substantial credible evidence \n     which provides substantial cause for the Committee to \n     conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee has occurred, the Committee may dismiss the matter.\n       (4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any, \n     shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy \n     shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The \n     full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and \n     made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded \n     vote of not less than four members of the Committee that it \n     should remain confidential.\n       (h) RIGHT OF APPEAL:\n       (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or \n     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection \n     (g)(2)(iii), may, within 30 days of the Committee's report to \n     the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of \n     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing \n     written notice of the appeal to the Committee and the \n     presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall \n     cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the \n     Congressional Record and the Senate Journal.\n       (2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to proceed to \n     consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be \n     highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed \n     to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall \n     be decided on the basis of the Committee's report to the \n     Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, \n     which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, \n     those favoring and those opposing the appeal.\n\n\n                    RULE 5: PROCEDURES FOR HEARINGS\n\n       (a) RIGHT TO HEARING: The Committee may hold a public or \n     executive hearing in any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory \n     review, or other proceeding. The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand. (See \n     Rule 4(d).)\n       (b) NON-PUBLIC HEARINGS: The Committee may at any time \n     during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) \n     of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to \n     receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive \n     session. If a witness desires to express a preference for \n     testifying in public or in executive session, he or she shall \n     so notify the Committee at least five days before he or she \n     is scheduled to testify.\n       (c) ADJUDICATORY HEARINGS: The Committee may, by the \n     recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee, \n     designate any public or executive hearing as\n\n[[Page S1257]]\n\n     an adjudicatory hearing; and any hearing which is concerned \n     with possible disciplinary action against a respondent or \n     respondents designated by the Committee shall be an \n     adjudicatory hearing. In any adjudicatory hearing, the \n     procedures described in paragraph (j) shall apply.\n       (d) SUBPOENA POWER: The Committee may require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses \n     and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, \n     documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule \n     6.)\n       (e) NOTICE OF HEARINGS: The Committee shall make public an \n     announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any \n     hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).\n       (f) PRESIDING OFFICER: The Chairman shall preside over the \n     hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice \n     Chairman is also absent, a Committee member designated by the \n     Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is \n     required, it shall be administered to a witness by the \n     Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee \n     member.\n       (g) WITNESSES:\n       (1) A subpoena or other request to testify shall be served \n     on a witness sufficiently in advance of his or her scheduled \n     appearance to allow the witness a reasonable period of time, \n     as determined by the Committee, to prepare for the hearing \n     and to employ counsel if desired.\n       (2) The Committee may, by recorded vote of not less than \n     four members of the Committee, rule that no member of the \n     Committee or staff or outside counsel shall make public the \n     name of any witness subpoenaed by the Committee before the \n     date of that witness's scheduled appearance, except as \n     specifically authorized by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly.\n       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Committee at least two working \n     days in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to \n     be presented. The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall determine \n     whether such statements may be read or placed in the record \n     of the hearing.\n       (4) Insofar as practicable, each witness shall be permitted \n     to present a brief oral opening statement, if he or she \n     desires to do so.\n       (h) RIGHT TO TESTIFY: Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     who is specifically identified or otherwise referred to in \n     testimony or in statements made by a Committee member, staff \n     member or outside counsel, or any witness, and who reasonably \n     believes that the statement tends to adversely affect his or \n     her reputation may--\n       (1) Request to appear personally before the Committee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf; or\n       (2) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony or other evidence or statement of which he or she \n     complained. Such request and such statement shall be \n     submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.\n       (i) CONDUCT OF WITNESSES AND OTHER ATTENDEES: The Presiding \n     Officer may punish any breaches of order and decorum by \n     censure and exclusion from the hearings. The Committee, by \n     majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that the offender \n     be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (j) ADJUDICATORY HEARING PROCEDURES:\n       (1) NOTICE OF HEARINGS: A copy of the public announcement \n     of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall \n     be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to all \n     witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or otherwise \n     summoned to testify.\n       (2) PREPARATION FOR ADJUDICATORY HEARINGS:\n       (A) At least five working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the Committee shall provide the \n     following information and documents to the respondent, if \n     any:\n       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the \n     hearing;\n       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as \n     exhibits at the hearing; and\n       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony \n     expected to be given by each witness to be called at the \n     hearing.\n       (B) At least two working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall \n     provide the information and documents described in divisions \n     (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.\n       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and \n     documents to be exchanged under this paragraph shall be \n     subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and \n     disclosure.\n       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and \n     documents to the Committee (see (A) and (B) of this \n     subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual \n     violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the \n     Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that \n     the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (3) SWEARING OF WITNESSES: All witnesses who testify at \n     adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding \n     Officer, for good cause, decides that a witness does not have \n     to be sworn.\n       (4) RIGHT TO COUNSEL: Any witness at an adjudicatory \n     hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own \n     choosing, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of his \n     or her legal rights during the testimony.\n       (5) RIGHT TO CROSS-EXAMINE AND CALL WITNESSES:\n       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent and any other \n     person who obtains the permission of the Committee, may \n     personally or through counsel cross-examine witnesses called \n     by the Committee and may call witnesses in his or her own \n     behalf.\n       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the \n     issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the \n     production of documents on his or her behalf. An \n     application shall be approved upon a concise showing by \n     the respondent that the proposed testimony or evidence is \n     relevant and appropriate, as determined by the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman.\n       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or \n     other individual given permission by the Committee, each such \n     witness shall first be examined by the party who called the \n     witness or by that party's counsel.\n       (D) At least one working day before a witness's scheduled \n     appearance, a witness or a witness's counsel may submit to \n     the Committee written questions proposed to be asked of that \n     witness. If the Committee determines that it is necessary, \n     such questions may be asked by any member of the Committee, \n     or by any Committee staff member if directed by a Committee \n     member. The witness or witness's counsel may also submit \n     additional sworn testimony for the record within twenty-four \n     hours after the last day that the witness has testified. The \n     insertion of such testimony in that day's record is subject \n     to the approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting \n     jointly within five days after the testimony is received.\n       (6) ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE:\n       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the \n     truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall \n     be admissible unless privileged under the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly, \n     but the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly \n     repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight \n     that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.\n       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of \n     the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to \n     the Committee. Such rulings shall be final unless reversed or \n     modified by a recorded vote of not less than four members of \n     the Committee before the recess of that day's hearings.\n       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter \n     before the Committee involving allegations of sexual \n     discrimination, including sexual harassment, or sexual \n     misconduct, by a Member, officer, or employee within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee, the Committee shall be guided \n     by the standards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal \n     Rules of Evidence, except that the Committee may admit \n     evidence subject to the provisions of this paragraph only \n     upon a determination of not less than four members of the \n     full Committee that the interests of justice require that \n     such evidence be admitted.\n       (7) SUPPLEMENTARY HEARING PROCEDURES: The Committee may \n     adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems \n     necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory \n     hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be \n     furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made \n     available upon request to any member of the public.\n       (k) TRANSCRIPTS:\n       (1) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall \n     be made of all public and executive hearings. Any member of \n     the Committee, Committee staff member, outside counsel \n     retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy of \n     the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her own \n     remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any \n     typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter \n     declines to make the requested corrections, the member, staff \n     member, outside counsel or witness may request a ruling by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. Any member or \n     witness shall return the transcript with suggested \n     corrections to the Committee offices within five working days \n     after receipt of the transcript, or as soon thereafter as is \n     practicable. If the testimony was given in executive session, \n     the member or witness may only inspect the transcript at a \n     location determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly. Any questions arising with respect to the processing \n     and correction of transcripts shall be decided by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to \n     the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is \n     practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the \n     transcript of a hearing to be printed without the corrections \n     of a member or witness if they determine that such member or \n     witness has been afforded a reasonable time to correct such \n     transcript and such transcript has not been returned within \n     such time.\n       (3) The Committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost, \n     one transcript copy of that witness's testimony given at a \n     public hearing. If the testimony was given in executive \n     session, then a transcript copy shall be provided upon \n     request, subject to appropriate conditions and restrictions \n     prescribed by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If any \n     individual violates such conditions and restrictions, the \n     Committee may recommend by\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\n     majority vote that he or she be cited for contempt of \n     Congress.\n\n\n                   RULE 6: SUBPOENAS AND DEPOSITIONS\n\n       (a) SUBPOENAS:\n       (1) AUTHORIZATION FOR ISSUANCE: Subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses at depositions or \n     hearings, and subpoenas for the production of documents and \n     tangible things at depositions, hearings, or other times and \n     places designated therein, may be authorized for issuance by \n     either (A) a majority vote of the Committee, or (B) the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, at any time \n     during a preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other \n     proceeding.\n       (2) SIGNATURE AND SERVICE: All subpoenas shall be signed by \n     the Chairman or the Vice Chairman and may be served by any \n     person eighteen years of age or older, who is designated by \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman. Each subpoena shall be served \n     with a copy of the Rules of the Committee and a brief \n     statement of the purpose of the Committee's proceeding.\n       (3) WITHDRAWAL OF SUBPOENA: The Committee, by recorded vote \n     of not less than four members of the Committee, may withdraw \n     any subpoena authorized for issuance by it or authorized for \n     issuance by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. \n     The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may withdraw \n     any subpoena authorized for issuance by them.\n       (b) DEPOSITIONS:\n       (1) PERSONS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE DEPOSITIONS: Depositions may \n     be taken by any member of the Committee designated by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or by any other \n     person designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, including outside counsel, Committee staff, other \n     employees of the Senate, or government employees detailed to \n     the Committee.\n       (2) DEPOSITION NOTICES: Notices for the taking of \n     depositions shall be authorized by the Committee, or the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, and issued by the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman, or a Committee staff member or \n     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. Depositions may be taken at any time during a \n     preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review or other proceeding. \n     Deposition notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition shall \n     be in private, and the testimony taken and documents produced \n     shall be deemed for the purpose of these rules to have been \n     received in a closed or executive session of the Committee. \n     The Committee shall not initiate procedures leading to \n     criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a witness's \n     failure to appear, or to testify, or to produce documents, \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a subpoena \n     authorized for issuance by the Committee, or the Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) COUNSEL AT DEPOSITIONS: Witnesses may be accompanied at \n     a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.\n       (4) DEPOSITION PROCEDURE: Witnesses at depositions shall be \n     examined upon oath administered by an individual authorized \n     by law to administer oaths, or administered by any member of \n     the Committee if one is present. Questions may be propounded \n     by any person or persons who are authorized to take \n     depositions for the Committee. If a witness objects to a \n     question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a \n     document, any member of the Committee who is present may rule \n     on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, direct \n     the witness to answer the question or produce the document. \n     If no member of the Committee is present, the individual who \n     has been designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, to take the deposition may proceed with the \n     deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Committee, who may refer \n     the matter to the Committee or rule on the objection. If the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the Committee upon referral, \n     overrules the objection, the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the \n     Committee as the case may be, may direct the witness to \n     answer the question or produce the document. The Committee \n     shall not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal \n     enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify or produce \n     documents after having been directed to do so.\n       (5) FILING OF DEPOSITIONS: Deposition testimony shall be \n     transcribed or electronically recorded. If the deposition is \n     transcribed, the individual administering the oath shall \n     certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn in \n     his or her presence and the transcriber shall certify that \n     the transcript is a true record of the testimony. The \n     transcript with these certifications shall be filed with the \n     chief clerk of the Committee, and the witness shall be \n     furnished with access to a copy at the Committee's offices \n     for review. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time \n     limit set by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     a witness may request in writing changes in the transcript to \n     correct errors in transcription. The witness may also bring \n     to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the \n     witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about \n     those facts with a request that it be attached to the \n     transcript. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     may rule on the witness's request, and the changes or \n     attachments allowed shall be certified by the Committee's \n     chief clerk. If the witness fails to make any request under \n     this paragraph within the time limit set, this fact shall be \n     noted by the Committee's chief clerk. Any person authorized \n     by the Committee may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure.\n\n\n   RULE 7: VIOLATIONS OF LAW; PERJURY; LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS; \n   EDUCATIONAL MANDATE; AND APPLICABLE RULES AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT\n\n       (a) VIOLATIONS OF LAW: Whenever the Committee determines by \n     the recorded vote of not less than four members of the full \n     Committee that there is reason to believe that a violation of \n     law, including the provision of false information to the \n     Committee, may have occurred, it shall report such possible \n     violation to the proper Federal and state authorities.\n       (b) PERJURY: Any person who knowingly and willfully swears \n     falsely to a sworn complaint or any other sworn statement to \n     the Committee does so under penalty of perjury. The Committee \n     may refer any such case to the Attorney General for \n     prosecution.\n       (c) LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS: The Committee shall \n     recommend to the Senate by report or resolution such \n     additional rules, regulations, or other legislative measures \n     as it determines to be necessary or desirable to ensure \n     proper standards of conduct by Members, officers, or \n     employees of the Senate. The Committee may conduct such \n     inquiries as it deems necessary to prepare such a report or \n     resolution, including the holding of hearings in public or \n     executive session and the use of subpoenas to compel the \n     attendance of witnesses or the production of materials. The \n     Committee may make legislative recommendations as a result of \n     its findings in a preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, \n     or other proceeding.\n       (d) Educational Mandate: The Committee shall develop and \n     implement programs and materials designed to educate Members, \n     officers, and employees about the laws, rules, regulations, \n     and standards of conduct applicable to such individuals in \n     the performance of their duties.\n       (e) APPLICABLE RULES AND STANDARDS OF CONDUCT:\n       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no \n     adjudicatory review shall be initiated of any alleged \n     violation of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, \n     rule, or regulation which was not in effect at the time the \n     alleged violation occurred. No provisions of the Senate Code \n     of Official Conduct shall apply to or require disclosure of \n     any act, relationship, or transaction which occurred prior to \n     the effective date of the applicable provision of the Code.\n       (2) The Committee may initiate an adjudicatory review of \n     any alleged violation of a rule or law which was in effect \n     prior to the enactment of the Senate Code of Official Conduct \n     if the alleged violation occurred while such rule or law was \n     in effect and the violation was not a matter resolved on the \n     merits by the predecessor Committee.\n\n\n  RULE 8: PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING COMMITTEE SENSITIVE AND CLASSIFIED \n                               MATERIALS\n\n       (a) PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING COMMITTEE SENSITIVE MATERIALS:\n       (1) Committee Sensitive information or material is \n     information or material in the possession of the Select \n     Committee on Ethics which pertains to illegal or improper \n     conduct by a present or former Member, officer, or employee \n     of the Senate; to allegations or accusations of such conduct; \n     to any resulting preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review or \n     other proceeding by the Select Committee on Ethics into such \n     allegations or conduct; to the investigative techniques and \n     procedures of the Select Committee on Ethics; or to other \n     information or material designated by the staff director, or \n     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (2) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee shall \n     establish such procedures as may be necessary to prevent the \n     unauthorized disclosure of Committee Sensitive information in \n     the possession of the Committee or its staff.

Mr. President, I rise today as the chairman of the Joint \nCommittee on Printing to recognize the Government Printing Office, GPO, \non the occasion of its 150th anniversary. GPO opened its doors on March \n4, 1861, the same day that President Abraham Lincoln took the oath of \noffice for his first term. Since that time, the agency has used \nconstantly changing technologies to meet the needs of the Congress, \nFederal agencies, and the public. During GPO's early days, employees \nrelied on ink and paper to publish the text of President Lincoln's \nEmancipation Proclamation. Today, as another President from Illinois \nleads the Nation, GPO employees are using the latest digital technology \nto document the activities and decisions of our Government and to \nfulfill GPO's founding mission, which is ``Keeping America Informed.''\n  While GPO's past has been about printing, its present and future are \nbeing defined by electronic publishing. GPO has been investing for more \nthan a generation in digital production and dissemination technology, \nan investment that has yielded significant improvements in \nproductivity, capability, and savings for the taxpayers. The GPO \nestimates that converting to electronic, digital technology has \nresulted in a savings of 66 percent on the cost of congressional \nprinting alone. Deploying such technology has also reduced the number \nof employees to fewer than at any time in the past century. And it has \nreduced dramatically the number of copies of official documents that \nare printed.\n  GPO's partnership with the printing industry supports tens of \nthousands of\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\njobs. At the same time, by using GPO as a central procurement agency, \nthe Federal Government reduces substantially the cost of these \ncontracts to the taxpayers.\n  GPO now has a range of products and services that could only have \nbeen dreamed of 30 years ago: Online databases of Federal documents \nwith state-of-the-art search and retrieval capabilities available to \nthe public without charge, Government publications available as e-\nBooks, and a public presence not only on the Web but also on Twitter, \nFacebook, and You Tube. No longer is GPO primarily a publisher of \nprinted government documents, but a fully integrated electronic \npublisher and clearinghouse whose products are available in many \nInternet-based locations. In addition, the State Department relies on \nGPO to provide highly secure U.S. passports containing sophisticated \nsmart chips. GPO does this in conjunction with the private sector, \nwhich supplies certain critical components.\n  Another key function of GPO is its partnership with more than 1,200 \nFederal depository libraries across the country. These libraries, \nestablished by statute in all 50 States, make Federal documents \navailable to millions of students, researchers, businesses, and others \nevery year in both digital and print formats.\n  In short, GPO is responsible for the production and distribution of \ninformation products and services for all three branches of the Federal \nGovernment, including U.S. passports for the Department of State as \nwell as the official publications of Congress, the White House, and \nother Federal agencies. In addition to publication sales, GPO offers \npermanent public access to Federal Government information at no charge \nthrough GPO's Federal Digital System--www.fdsys.gov--and through \npartnerships with approximately 1,200 libraries nationwide that are \npart of the Federal Depository Library Program.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the GPO on its 150th \nanniversary and on its contributions to keeping the public informed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/04/senate-section/article/S1262-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1262-S1263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JACK CRISTIL\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to commend the \nremarkable 58-year career of Jack Cristil, one of our Nation's \nlegendary radio broadcasters and voice of the Mississippi State \nUniversity Bulldogs. Jack called his last game this past Saturday as \nMississippi State defeated the University of Tennessee in men's \nbasketball.\n  For the better part of six decades, Mississippi State fans welcomed \nJack's professionalism and his unambiguous play-by-play descriptions, \nfree from hyperbole or favoritism, onto their radios. His distinctive \nvoice and irreplaceable wit will be missed.\n  Jack grew up in Memphis, TN, the son of Jewish immigrants from Russia \nand Latvia. After discovering radio broadcasts of sporting events at \nthe age of six, he knew exactly what he was going to do with his life.\n  After high school, Jack went on to study broadcast journalism at the \nUniversity of Minnesota. From there, he worked the minor league \nbaseball circuit in the Southeast before moving to Clarksdale, MI, to \nbroadcast high school football and basketball games. In the summer of \n1953, legendary Mississippi State athletic director C.R. ``Dudy'' Noble \nhired him for $25 a game. Now 58 years later, Cristil has covered 636 \nfootball games and 1,538 basketball games, roughly 63 percent of all \nfootball games played by Mississippi State and about 55 percent of all \nbasketball games.\n  It was not only the number of games he covered that is of note today, \nit was at times the significance of the games themselves. During the \n1963 NCAA men's basketball tournament, Mississippi State ignored an \nunwritten rule in our State that prohibited State universities from \nplaying integrated teams. By sneaking out of town in the dark of night, \nand despite protests from our State's Governor and police, the Bulldogs \nwere able to play an integrated Loyola team in Michigan. This was a \nsignificant blow to segregationist sentiment in Mississippi. Jack was \nright there with the team as it defied its own Governor to help move \nour State forward.\n  Through his microphone, Jack Cristil brought Mississippians some \ngreat moments in college athletics history. As the play-by-play man for \nMississippi State, he also certainly endured some tough losses. Since \nJack first broadcast a game for the Bulldogs in 1953, his tenure has \nspanned 11 head football coaches, 9 head basketball coaches, 11 \nuniversity presidents, 13 Governors of Mississippi, and 11 Presidents \nof the United States. He has truly been an enduring figure in our \nState, throughout the South, and throughout college athletics.\n  In Mississippi, fans of all teams appreciate the talent and longevity \nof Jack Cristil. I think it fitting to close by quoting Jack Cristil in \nsaying, ``You can wrap this one in maroon and white.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article titled, ``It's a wrap for Mr. Maroon and White'' from The \nClarion Ledger.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Clarion-Ledger--Jackson, MS, Feb. 25, 2011]\n\n                  It's a Wrap for Mr. Maroon and White\n\n                          (By Rick Cleveland)\n\n       Doesn't matter which university you pulled for, you \n     listened to Cristil.\n       You listened because he put you there, in the stadium.\n       We knew Jack Cristil couldn't go on forever. Here lately, \n     he has sounded tired, worn out--certainly not himself. So \n     maybe Wednesday's news that Cristil is stepping down after 58 \n     years as the voice of Mississippi State University's football \n     team and 54 years calling basketball wasn't totally \n     unexpected.\n       Still, we don't have to like it.\n       Because of health reasons, Cristil, 85, will broadcast his \n     last MSU sports event when the Bulldog basketball team plays \n     the University of Tennessee today in Knoxville. The game is \n     scheduled to start at 5 p.m., with the radio broadcast \n     beginning 30 minutes before. For many of us, it will be like \n     listening to Sinatra sing his last song.\n       For three generations of Mississippians, our introduction \n     to the Deep South's regional pastime of college football \n     often has been Cristil's gravelly, baritone voice telling us \n     about a 6-tall, 180-pound halfback from Amory or Ackerman or \n     Moss Point. Doesn't matter which university you pulled for, \n     you listened to Cristil. You listened because he put you \n     there, in the stadium. He described the weather and the \n     setting. Told you which team was going which way. He gave you \n     the uniform colors and the context of whatever game he was \n     describing.\n       His voice was so distinct, you could almost taste the \n     cigarettes he was smoking.\n       He gave you down, distance, score and how much time was \n     remaining. He did it regularly.\n       You knew he was for the Mississippi State Bulldogs, but \n     often you couldn't tell it from his account of the game. He \n     didn't cheer. (Although I can't count the times, I saw him \n     slam down his headset, put his hand over the microphone and \n     yell at a basketball official who had just screwed up a \n     call.)\n       His wit was as dry as the Sahara. Who can forget his \n     legendary call on the Sonic Drive of the game after one \n     particularly galling State defeat? The Bulldogs didn't have a \n     significant drive, so Jack just said it would be his drive \n     back home to Tupelo. I was listening on the way home from \n     another game that day. I laughed so hard I almost ran my car \n     off the road.\n\n\n                              Another era\n\n       It's hard to put into perspective how long Cristil has been \n     doing what he did so well. He was hired in August 1952 by \n     Dudy Noble, the man many consider the father of Mississippi \n     State athletics. Joe Fortunato, one of the Chicago Bears' \n     famed Monsters of the Midway from the 1950s, played in the \n     first State game Cristil ever broadcast. Fortunato, now 70 \n     and living here in Natchez, will pretty much tell you what \n     any other State fan will.\n       ``It's hard to believe he has been doing it for that long, \n     that well,'' Fortunato said Thursday.\n       Eight years ago, on the occasion of Cristil's 50th \n     anniversary of describing State football games, I visited him \n     for most of a thoroughly entertaining day and evening at his \n     home and office in Tupelo. Oh, the stories he told. . . .\n       Of growing up in Memphis, the son of Jewish immigrants from \n     Russia and Latvia. His parents bought a huge radio to listen \n     to classical music, but that's when Cristil discovered the \n     games at the age of 6. ``Here I was in Memphis, and I was \n     absolutely enthralled with the idea that a man could be \n     sitting in some stadium in New York or Chicago or Boston, \n     telling me about a game. It was like magic.''\n       Cristil said he knew right then what he was going to do \n     with his life.\n       Of filling up his 1948 Plymouth in Clarksdale in August \n     1952 to drive from Clarksdale to Starkville to be interviewed \n     by Noble.\n       ``I had envisioned a young, energetic, business-type person \n     in a trim suit and a neat hair-do,'' Cristil said. ``But Dudy \n     Noble was a\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\n     big man, over 6 feet tall and quite hefty. He was attired in \n     an old cotton, flannel shirt and baggy britches. He had an \n     unruly shock of gray hair that stuck out.''\n       Noble, Cristil said, gave him the job and then told him, \n     ``You tell that radio audience what the score is and who's \n     got the ball and how much time is left and you cut out the \n     bull.''\n       Said Cristil: ``. . . turns out the best advice I ever \n     got.''\n       Of the 1963 Liberty Bowl in Philadelphia on a day when it \n     was, as Cristil put it, ``colder than a pawnbroker's heart.''\n       Sen. John C. Stennis, another beloved State man, sat in the \n     unheated press box alongside Cristil, both of them bundled in \n     coats and blankets. ``It was so cold, our coffee would freeze \n     before we drank it,'' Cristil said.\n       But Cristil wrapped up a 16-12 State victory over North \n     Carolina in maroon and white.\n       At age 11, I listened with my daddy in the kitchen of our \n     house.\n       Of a State-Alabama football game when Bob Hope was on tour \n     and doing a show that night in Tuscaloosa, unbeknownst to \n     Cristil. Bear Bryant's boys, as usual, were beating up on \n     State when somebody came by the visitors' radio booth and \n     whispered to Cristil, ``Hope is available at halftime if you \n     want him.''\n       Responded Cristil, ``Fellow, I need some hope right now.''\n       Thing is, even during all those many bleak years when \n     Mississippi State fans had little if any hope, they had Jack \n     Cristil. If it sounds trite, then so be it: It will never be \n     quite the same without him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/04/senate-section/article/S1263-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID S. KRIS\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank and honor David \nKris, who is leaving his position this week as the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for National Security at the Department of Justice, DOJ.\n  Many of us in Congress--especially those of us on the Intelligence \nCommittee and the Judiciary Committee who work closely with the \nadministration on national security issues--are very sorry to see David \nKris leave DOJ.\n  As one of the Nation's leading experts on the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, FISA, I will personally miss hearing from David, \nespecially as the Congress moves to extend the sunsets on important \nprovisions of FISA this spring. He testified with clarity and precision \non issues of great complexity in all of his appearances before the \nSenate. I valued his insights.\n  Congress created the position of Assistant Attorney General for \nNational Security in 2006 to bring together the intelligence and the \ncounterterrorism and counterespionage prosecution functions of the \nDepartment of Justice. Over the past 2 years, building on the \nprofessional, nonpolitical foundation established by his predecessors, \nKenneth Wainstein and Patrick Rowan, David has managed the National \nSecurity Division in what has been, arguably, the most dangerous period \nsince the September 11 attacks.\n  Since David was sworn in at DOJ on March 25, 2009, terrorism \ninvestigations and prosecutions have been unfolding at an unprecedented \nscale and pace. Consider the following high profile counterterrorism \narrests and prosecutions involving the National Security Division: the \nal-Qaida plot to bomb the New York subway system by Najibullah Zazi; \nthe attempted bombing of Times Square by Faisal Shahzad; the attempted \nbombing of flight 253 on Christmas Day 2009 by Umar Farouk \nAbdulmutallab; the arrest and prosecution of David Headley, an American \nwho helped plot the Mumbai attacks; and the arrest and prosecution of \nHosam Smadi who was sentenced to 24 years in prison last year for \nplotting to blow up a Dallas skyscraper.\n  Under David's leadership, the National Security Division also played \nan important role in the investigation and prosecution of a number of \nsignificant espionage, export control enforcement, and leak cases. In \nthe summer of 2010, David played a prominent role in the arrest and \nswap of illegal Russian agents. He directed the prosecutions of Cuban \nspies, illegal exports of fighter jet engines and parts to Iran, and \nassistance to China in designing stealth cruise missiles. During his \ntenure, the National Security Division joined the Criminal Division in \nprosecuting more leak cases than ever before.\n  David Kris joined DOJ in March 2009 after being confirmed unanimously \nby the U.S. Senate. He had previously served in the Justice Department \nfrom 1992 to 2003 as an attorney in the Criminal Division and as \nAssociate Deputy Attorney General.\n  I know that prior experience at DOJ served David well because once he \nwas sworn in, he went to work right away to develop partnerships with \nthe Intelligence community, the National Security Council, and \nCongress.\n  And I know David worked hard to ensure that the relevant agencies and \nentities were aware of the National Security Division's activities and \nthat its activities were properly coordinated with the intelligence \ncommunity and the Defense Department.\n  It has been clear to us that David made it a priority to ensure that \nFBI national security investigations were conducted in accordance with \nthe Constitution, statutes, and applicable guidelines. David also \nexpanded the number of oversight attorney staff in his division and, as \na result, the division's oversight section exceeded its annual goal for \nnational security reviews for the first time in its history.\n  I wish David Kris well in his future endeavors in the private sector. \nHis replacement will have big shoes to fill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/04/senate-section/article/S1263-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/04/senate-section/article/S1263-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/04/senate-section/article/S1263-4", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 4.

A bill to reauthorize and improve the SBIR and STTR programs, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nmy colleague and chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, Senator Landrieu, to reauthorize the critical Small \nBusiness Innovation Research, SBIR, and Small Business Technology \nTransfer, STTR, Programs. We are joined by Senators John Kerry, Scott \nBrown, Jeanne Shaheen, Kelly Ayotte, Ben Cardin, Mark Pryor, and Carl \nLevin. Frankly, after nearly 6 years of debate and discussion, it is \nwell past time for us to pass this legislation and set these programs \non a path of certainty.\n  Our Nation's economic recovery is being suppressed by an inflated \nunemployment rate--which has been at or above 9 percent for 21 \nconsecutive months--and, as a result, a small business community that \nremains uncertain about the future and unable to invest in their \nbusinesses and hire new workers. They are looking for market-based ways \nto create jobs with limited government intervention and unleash their \ninnovative potential. That is why I am excited about reauthorizing the \nSBIR and STTR programs, which foster an environment of innovative \nentrepreneurship by directing more than $2 billion annually in Federal \nresearch and development, R, funding to the Nation's small firms that \nare most likely to create jobs and commercialize their products.\n  Small businesses are our Nation's job generators, employing more than \nhalf of all private sector employees and creating 64 percent of the net \nnew jobs over the past 15 years. Furthermore, small businesses are our \nNation's most effective innovators, producing roughly 13 times more \npatents per employee than large firms--patents which are at least two \ntimes as likely to be among the top 1 percent of high-impact patents. \nIn a budgetary environment where the Small Business Administration, \nSBA, will be required to do more with less funding, it is crucial that \nthe SBIR and STTR programs--one of the strongest examples of a \nsuccessful public-private partnership--be a key part of the Agency's \njob creation agenda.\n  These programs have been front and center in improving our Nation's \ncapacity to innovate. According to a report by the Information \nTechnology and Innovation Foundation, SBIR-backed firms have been \nresponsible for roughly 25 percent of the Nation's most crucial \ninnovations over the past decade plus--``a powerful indication that the \nSBIR program has become a key force in the innovation economy of the \nUnited States.''\n  Regrettably, SBIR and expired in September 2008, and it has been \nsubject to a series of 10 short-term, temporary extensions since then, \nplaguing the programs with uncertainty and potentially dissuading some \nof our Nation's most promising firms from participating in them. That \nis why Chair Landrieu and I introduced the SBIR-STTR Reauthorization \nAct, S. 4053, at the end of last Congress after extensive negotiation \nand debate. This bill--which passed the Senate unanimously in \nDecember--is virtually the same legislation we are introducing today. \nIt would reauthorize the programs for 8 years, while making critical \nimprovements, such as increasing the allocation for SBIR from 2.5 \npercent of an agency's extramural research and development, R, budget \nto 3.5 percent over 10 years, and doubling the STTR allocation from 0.3 \npercent over 6 years. Our legislation would also codify increased award \nsizes of $150,000 for phase I and $1 million for phase II in the SBIR \nprogram, and apply those levels to the STTR program as well.\n  Our bill includes stringent oversight and fraud prevention measures, \nrequiring inspectors general of participating Federal agencies to \nestablish fraud detection measures, coordinate fraud-related \ninformation sharing between agencies, and provide fraud prevention \nrelated education and training to agencies administering the program, \namong other initiatives.\n  The SBIR-STTR Reauthorization Act also includes an unprecedented \ncompromise on the ``venture capital'' issue, which has long bogged down \nany serious progress in reauthorizing these valuable programs. It would \nmake firms majority owned and controlled by multiple venture capital \ncompanies eligible for up to 25 percent of SBIR funds at the National \nInstitutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and Department of \nEnergy, and up to 15 percent of the funds at the remaining eight \nparticipating SBIR agencies. Our compromise has the backing of diverse \nstakeholders from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Federation of \nIndependent Business, NFIB, and Small Business Technology Council, \nSBTC, to the Biotechnology Industry Organization, BIO, and the National \nVenture Capital Association, NVCA.\n  So I look forward to ensuring that this will be the Congress to once \nand for all reauthorize these critical nationwide programs, and I am \nconfident that the SBIR-STTR Reauthorization Act is the best way for us \nto get us there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/04/senate-section/article/S1264-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1264-S1265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 146.
