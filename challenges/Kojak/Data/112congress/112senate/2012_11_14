Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 419, S. \n3254, the Defense Department authorization bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (S. 3254) to authorize \n     appropriations for fiscal year 2013 for military activities \n     of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and \n     for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to \n     prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the next hour will be equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nmajority controlling the first half and the Republicans the second \nhalf.\n\n  The filing deadline for first-degree amendments to the Sportsmen's \nbill is 4 o'clock today. We are trying to work on an agreement with the \nRepublicans to vote on the Sportsmen's bill and cyber security and have \na path forward on the Defense authorization bill. We hope to have an \nagreement in the next couple of hours.\n\n\n                    Senator Grassley's 11,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my colleague Chuck \nGrassley on the occasion of his 11,000th vote. Senator Grassley has \ncast more than 6,400 consecutive votes--more consecutive votes than any \nSenators currently holding office in the Senate. This is truly a \nremarkable accomplishment that speaks to his dedication.\n  I know he considers it a sign of respect for his constituents and for \nthe Senate. Senator Grassley is a farmer, assembly line worker, who \nserved in the Iowa State legislature and was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives here in Washington in 1974 and to the Senate in 1980.\n  Senator Grassley learned the value of hard work early on the family \nfarm. Today his son runs that farm but Chuck still dedicates himself to \nworking on the farm on many occasions, and then after that comes back \nto Washington.\n  As ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and past chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Grassley also takes his constitutional \noversight responsibilities very seriously. He has long worked to make \nthe judicial branch more open and transparent. To that end he has \nsponsored a bill to allow cameras in the courtroom and proposed \ncreating the post of inspector general. He has been one of the most \nardent protectors of whistleblowers. As a member of the Agriculture \nCommittee, Senator Grassley brings real-world experience from his Iowa \nfarm to be an advocate for American farmers in Washington.\n  Even when Senator Grassley and I do not agree on issues, I believe we \nalways have the greatest respect for each other. I know I do for him \nand I feel confident he does of me. He is a principled, dedicated \nlawmaker and a genuine person.\n  One little side note. I came to the Senate and was elected in 1986, \nso early in 1987 I gave my maiden speech here in the Senate. It was on \nthe Taxpayer Bill of Rights, something I tried to accomplish in the \nHouse but, frankly, I did not get to first base. That is an \nunderstatement. They paid no attention to\n\n[[Page S6766]]\n\nme. So when I came here, that was my speech. I was way back there by \nthe candy drawer.\n  I gave a speech on the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. The Presiding Officer \nwas David Pryor from Arkansas. He was the chair on the subcommittee \ndealing with the IRS and finance. Senator Grassley was listening to my \nspeech in his office. Senator Pryor sent me a note when I finished that \nhe had written while he was presiding, saying: I really like your \nlegislation. I want to work with you to get it passed. I was stunned. \nOne of the most senior Members of the Senate was interested in what I \nhad to say. In the House, I repeat, they would not listen to me. I \ntried to talk to the chairman of that subcommittee. He would not even \ndo a meeting with me. I still remember his name. I am not going to \nmention it.\n\n  Senator Grassley contacted me and said: I want to work on this \nlegislation. They worked with me. My first year in the Senate we passed \nthe historic Taxpayer Bill of Rights to make the taxpayer a little more \nequal to the tax collector. It was landmark legislation. It would never \nhave happened but for Senator Grassley. So I admire what he has done \nfor America in many different ways but certainly in that manner.\n  I know my friend, the Republican leader, is going to speak about \nSenator Grassley. I explained to his staff I have to run to another \nmeeting so I have a couple of minutes of things to say that I think are \nimportant.\n\n\n                       Rising Above Partisanship\n\n  The work before us in these waning days of this Congress represents a \ntest of our character, that of this body, a test of our willingness to \nrise above partisanship for the good of this great Nation.\n  Although I was disappointed that the Senate was unable to vote on \nfinal passage of Senator Tester's Sportsmen's package, I hold fast to \nmy optimism that we can pass that. We have a great deal to accomplish \nduring the next 6 weeks to safeguard our country's financial health and \nprotect middle-class families. But we will not complete anything \nwithout bipartisan cooperation. As Senate Majority Leader George \nMitchell once said, ``Bipartisanship means you work together to work it \nout.''\n  So I hope to see that type of cooperation on display when the Senate \nvotes to reconsider the stalled cyber security legislation. If we can \nwork together to address these two issues, the Sportsmen's package and \ncyber security, it will set a tone of cooperation that could \ncharacterize the remainder of this Congress and next Congress as well.\n  National security experts say there is no issue facing this Nation \nmore pressing than the threat of cyber attack on our critical \ninfrastructure. Terrorists bent on harming the United States can all \ntoo easily devastate our power grid, our banking system, and our \nnuclear plants. A bipartisan group of Senators has worked for 3 years \nto craft legislation that would do just that. Yet Republicans \nfilibustered this worthy measure in July. It is imperative that \nDemocrats and Republicans work together to address what the national \nsecurity experts have called ``the most serious challenge to our \nnational security since the onset of the nuclear age sixty years ago.''\n  So I found it encouraging when a number of my Republican colleagues--\nSenators McCain, Hutchison, Kyl, Chambliss, Coats, and Blunt--recently \nwrote President Obama advocating legislative action on cyber security.\n  They wrote:\n\n       An issue as far reaching and complicated as cyber security \n     requires . . . formal consideration and approval by Congress \n     . . . Only the legislative process can create the durable and \n     collaborative public-private partnership we need to enhance \n     our cyber security.\n\n  Senator Lieberman, the chairman, and ranking member Collins have \nworked their hearts out. They have compromised with these people and \nmany others to have a bill that is now before us. This group of \nSenators that I have just named say they remain committed to the \nlegislative process. Today they have an opportunity to demonstrate that \ncommitment. On several occasions since Republicans filibustered the \ncyber security bill this summer, I have asked my colleagues to bring me \na list of amendments they wish to debate. As we consider this \nlegislation today, they have yet another opportunity to do so. They can \nshow their commitment to the cyber security threat by advancing this \nworthy measure and moving forward with a productive debate on the \nissue. This is yet another opportunity for this Congress to prove it \ncan cooperate and compromise when it matters most. But it will not be \nour last opportunity.\n  Before the end of the year, we must craft a balanced agreement to \nreduce the deficit and protect middle-class families from a tax hike. \nAs cyber terrorism represents a serious threat to our national \nsecurity, so the looming fiscal cliff represents a serious threat to \nour economic security.\n  I am heartened to see that a number of Republicans, including a \nnumber of prominent conservatives, have opened the door to a balanced \nagreement. Bill Kristol, a leading conservative commentator, said:\n\n       It won't kill the country if we raise taxes a little bit on \n     millionaires. It really won't.\n\n  That is what he said. And Glenn Hubbard, an adviser to the Romney \ncampaign, and an adviser to the last President Bush, conceded that any \nagreement must include revenue increases.\n  It is simple math. To protect the middle class, it will be necessary \nto ask millionaires and billionaires to contribute a little more as we \nwork to reduce the deficit. Democrats understand we will not get \neverything we want from a bipartisan accord, but Republicans should \nrealize they will not get everything they want either. They should not \nprevent us, as my esteemed predecessor said, from working together to \nwork it out. That was Senator Mitchell.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                    Senator Grassley's 11,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Our good friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, has cast \nhis 11,000th vote. Since the founding of the Republic, only 2,000 men \nand women have served in the Senate. Only 23 have cast more votes than \nChuck Grassley. No other current Senator has gone as long as he has \nwithout missing a single vote. He has not missed a vote in 19 years.\n  This year, Senator Grassley marks 54 years of public service to the \npeople of the Hawkeye State. While some Members of Congress have a \ntendency to lose touch with their constituents, Chuck Grassley has \nalways worked hard to make sure he never did that. He has made it his \nbusiness to stay connected to the folks back home by holding at least \none townhall meeting a year in all of Iowa's 99 counties, and by \nresponding to every letter, postcard, e-mail, or phone call. Of course, \nwe are all familiar with his tweets. Much like the Senator himself, \nthey are truly one of a kind.\n  Senator Grassley also stays close to the land by working his family \nfarm. He does that even while keeping up his duties here in Washington. \nHe may be a U.S. Senator, but he has always preferred to be known as \n``a farmer from Butler County.'' Visitors to the Grassley farm say it \nis not uncommon to see Senator Grassley pulling a cell phone out from \nunder his baseball cap while riding on his tractor.\n  Over the years, Chuck Grassley has distinguished himself by his \ntenacity and his commitment to the public interest. His first major \nlegislative achievement was the passage of the Federal False Claims \nAct, which over the years has saved taxpayers more than $17 billion. As \nchairman of the Finance Committee, he led bipartisan bills through \nCongress that cut taxes by $2 trillion, leaving more money in the \npockets of hard-working Americans.\n  Senator Grassley has a lot to be proud of in his career. He and \nBarbara are also rightly proud of their 58 years of marriage. They have \nfive children, and many, many grandchildren. He has been a farmer, a \nfather, a government watchdog, a steward of the Nation's finances; in \nshort, he is a real statesman. The Senate would not be the same without \nhim. The Nation, I firmly believe, would be a lot worse off without the \nremarkable service of Senator Chuck Grassley.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened to the speeches of the majority\n\n[[Page S6767]]\n\nleader and the Republican leader. I would like to add my statement of \ncongratulations to my longtime friend Senator Grassley for reaching \nthis milestone of 11,000 votes in the U.S. Senate and to our State of \nIowa and to our Nation.\n  Senator Grassley and I were elected the same year, sworn in the same \nday of January 1975, although he preceded me to come to the Senate by 4 \nyears, but I can say without any fear of contradiction that Senator \nGrassley and I have had a wonderful working relationship. Obviously, \nanyone who knows our records knows we don't always agree on things all \nthe time, and that is the way it ought to be around here; we have good \ndebates, but we have always been friends.\n  The one thing I also know is that we have always worked together for \nthe betterment of our State of Iowa. I think politics tends to end at \nthat doorstep, and when it comes to Iowa, what is good for our State, \nwe have always worked very closely. We have always had a great \ncamaraderie, and our staffs have worked together very closely over the \nyears. So, again, I wish to commend the senior Senator from the State \nof Iowa.\n  I now have the distinction of being the most senior junior Senator in \nthe Senate. It used to be Fritz Hollings for years. Now I am the most \nsenior junior Senator, and I couldn't ask for a better colleague and a \nbetter friend on that side of the aisle from the State of Iowa than \nSenator Chuck Grassley. I congratulate him on reaching this milestone.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have been here as a colleague in the \nSenate during those 11,000 votes. I don't want to ruin his reputation \nback home, but we have a significant number of those votes where he and \nI voted the same way, and, of course, he and I sit together or sit side \nby side on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I congratulate him. \nThese are milestones worth being noted.\n  Senator Grassley and his wife Barbara are friends of Marcelle's and \nmine, and I congratulate him. His wife Barbara was kind enough both to \nrecommend my wife for a cancer awareness award and then to introduce it \njust before we recessed. It has been that kind of relationship. Those \nof us who live in rural areas, as the distinguished Presiding Officer \nknows, acquire certain bonds, so I applaud the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to thank several of my colleagues \nwho have recognized me for casting my 11,000th vote yesterday. I want \nto acknowledge the fine things Senator Reid, the majority leader, said, \nSenator McConnell, the Republican leader, Senator Stabenow, Senator \nHarkin, and Senator Leahy, and I wanted them to know I appreciate very \nmuch the recognition they brought. I hope it is nothing special, \nbecause I believe I am just exhibiting the work ethic of Iowans \ngenerally, who work very hard.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have another subject, if I might. \nIncidentally, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the following hour \nwill be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, with the majority controlling the first half.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will take from the majority side.\n\n\n               Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. As we all know, Congress is now back from an extended \nrecess. When we left, there were a number of significant items pending \neither on the floor of the House or on the floor of the Senate. \nYesterday I spoke about one major piece of legislation we passed here \nin the Senate by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, and that was the \nfarm bill. It has, of course, implications to a State such as Vermont \nbut also to every single State in this country. It has everything from \nmilk price supports to drought and disaster relief. This was a \nbipartisan vote strongly supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. \nIt has been stalled in the House, and I hope, now that the election is \nover, they can bring it up and pass it.\n  But there is another urgently needed piece of legislation that we \nhave passed here in the Senate, and it is time to pass it in the House. \nI know we have issues such as disaster relief for the victims of \nHurricane Sandy. We should do that. We have the fiscal cliff that \nthreatens our economy. That is extremely important. We should have \nconfirmation votes on scores of judicial nominees. We have 19 of them \npending on the floor. All of that is important. All of these things can \nbe done in the time remaining for us. But one of the important \nlegislative priorities is the VAWA, the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act. I wrote the bill with Republican Mike Crapo of \nIdaho. This was and is a bipartisan piece of legislation. It won the \nsupport of all the women Senators in this body, Republican and \nDemocratic alike. It passed by an overwhelming margin in this body. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer was a strong supporter of it. This \nSenate-passed bill deserves to be on our short list of priorities for \nthe rest of the year.\n  I was pleased to see that the President and Speaker Boehner have \nindicated a willingness to work toward a bipartisan solution to avoid \nthe fiscal cliff. But on VAWA, the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act, the time for posturing has long passed. Congress \nhas failed to pass the bipartisan Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act. It passed the Senate with 68 votes more than 200 \ndays ago. We need to take it up and pass it in the House.\n  I am committed to ensuring that VAWA addresses the changing needs of \nall victims. I stand ready, as I have from the start, to work with all \nMembers of both parties. I look forward to hearing from the Republican \nleaders in the House and to seeing this important measure enacted.\n  You know, both parties could have celebrated the passage of yet \nanother bipartisan VAWA reauthorization bill after the Senate's \nconvincing vote in April. There have been a lot of victims since April. \nThey could be receiving the critical protections included in the \nSenate-passed VAWA reauthorization bill.\n  In the month since the Senate passed the Leahy-Crapo bill, we have \nbeen reminded of the importance of VAWA. I will give you a couple of \nexamples. Let me tell you, these are very grim stories. But let me tell \nyou some very grim stories about what is happening.\n  In Wisconsin, a gunman opened fire in a Milwaukee-area spa. He \nwounded four people and he killed three people, including his estranged \nwife. The Republican Governor of Wisconsin called for tougher domestic \nviolence laws because the gunman had previously abused his estranged \nwife. The Leahy-Crapo bill will strengthen the ability of States and \nservice providers to identify domestic violence cases with a \nsignificant risk of homicide and take effective steps to protect \npotential victims.\n  In another case, an Amherst, MA, college student who was raped by a \nclassmate bravely stepped forward in the pages of her school newspaper \nto describe the lack of response from the school administration. That \nyoung student--she is not alone by any means--along with countless \nothers like her, deserves attentive and respectful treatment in the \nwake of such a heinous act of sexual violence. Our bill would encourage \nsuch a response with new campus protections.\n  If we don't take congressional action, these and other crucial new \nprotections in the Leahy-Crapo bill will not be able to help victims \nand prevent crimes nationwide. These recent events remind us that \ninnocent lives are on the line when it comes to domestic and sexual \nviolence. These victims of rape and domestic violence cannot wait. It \nis unacceptable to delay these protections. I was astounded to hear \nthat some of the objections in the House were because we covered all \nwomen--all women--in the act, immigrants, gays, straight, Native \nAmericans, whoever it might be.\n  Mr. President, I still have nightmares about some of the crime scenes \nI went to as a young prosecutor in Vermont at 2 and 3 o'clock in the \nmorning. I remember seeing the battered bodies of victims, battered and\n\n[[Page S6768]]\n\nbloodied bodies of victims. I never remember a police officer there \nsaying: Wait a minute, we have to find out whether this victim is gay \nor straight, whether this victim is an undocumented immigrant or a \nNative American. We have to determine that before we can decide whether \nwe are going to do anything. The distinguished Presiding Officer was \nmayor of our Queen City of Burlington. He never would have allowed any \nmember of the police force in that city to pick and choose. None of us \nwould.\n  So let's face up to reality. Let's stop saying we can't pass this \nbipartisan bill because we have to limit it and we have to pick and \nchoose who are victims. I have said it over and over again on this \nfloor: A victim is a victim is a victim. So let's come together. Let's \nsend the bipartisan Leahy-Crapo bill to the President without further \ndelay. Let's stop the deaths, the beatings, and the rapes that are \noccurring. How many of us could pick up an article in the paper and \nread of one of these things and not be shocked? Every one of us, as a \nMember of Congress, has the ability to do something to stop this. This \nis an easy bill to pass. It passed by a wide, strong, bipartisan effort \nhere in the Senate. Let's just take it up, call a vote in the House on \nit.\n  I have heard from enough Republicans and Democrats in the House of \nRepresentatives. If this bill came up for a vote, it would pass. I \nthink it is slamming the door in the faces of people who might be \nabused if we don't bring it back.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished chair of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee on the floor, and, as I mentioned earlier, just a \nfew minutes ago and yesterday, her leadership brought about one of the \nmost sweeping, cost-saving, best 5-year farm bills this body has \npassed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to the former \nchair of the Agriculture Committee and a very distinguished Member who \nleads in so many areas, whether it is our dairy producers, whether it \nis organic farmers, whether it is nutrition entitlement. We wouldn't \nhave the 5-year farm bill that we passed in the Senate without Senator \nLeahy's leadership. So his words are very kind, but I am very \nappreciative of all he has done.\n  I so much appreciate our senior Senator from Vermont coming to the \nfloor and speaking out about the need to get a farm bill done. That is \nwhy I am here today as well--to echo the Senator's words from yesterday \nand today. We need to get it done, as we all know. We have seen 45 days \nsince the farm bill expired, and there is absolutely no reason \nwhatsoever not to get this done.\n  Before speaking about that, though, let me also thank our chairman \nfrom the Judiciary Committee for his words about the Violence Against \nWomen Act because every victim of crime, every victim of domestic \nviolence needs to be covered under this law. I am very grateful for all \nthe Senator has done to make sure all victims are covered, and that is \nanother bill that needs to get passed in the House of Representatives.\n  In talking about the farm bill, I also want to say congratulations to \nanother distinguished member of my committee, Senator Grassley, for his \n11,000th vote, which he cast last night. I know Senator Harkin was here \non the floor as well speaking about that--two incredibly talented \nmembers of the Agriculture Committee. I wish to congratulate Senator \nGrassley, who has been a real champion and leader on the reforms that \nare in our bill--really some historic reforms in the bill. He has led \nthat effort, and I congratulate him as he has reached a very important \nmilestone.\n  Farming is the riskiest business in the world, and this year it is \neven riskier. I believe that because of what is happening with climate \nchange, it will be even more risky in the future. It is incredibly \nimportant that we step up and get a farm bill that gives our farmers \nthe tools they need to manage their risks.\n  In the spring, we experienced late freezes that wiped out fruit crops \nin a number of States, including in Michigan, where our cherry growers \nwere just about wiped out and currently have no access to crop \ninsurance, although part of our farm bill is creating a path for them. \nWe are very pleased to be creating a path for them to have crop \ninsurance, but it was devastating in the spring.\n  Then this summer there were recordbreaking droughts that left crops \nwithering in the fields, and in our bill we address issues of drought \nfor lifestyle producers, which is incredibly important and, by the way, \nfully paid for by the savings of our bill.\n  Then we saw Hurricane Isaac flood croplands, and Hurricane Sandy has \ncaused destruction like nothing we could have imagined.\n  In a year when there were so many reminders of the need for risk \nmanagement for our farmers, there is absolutely no excuse not to finish \nthe job and get a farm bill done by the end of this year. I am \noptimistic we are going to be able to do that.\n  I hope my colleagues will remember how we came together in June to \npass the bipartisan Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act in the \nSenate. I thank my ranking member and colleague Senator Roberts for his \nleadership in this effort. We truly did this together, working across \nthe aisle, listening to all the Members of the Senate. As you know, we \neliminated 100 different programs and authorizations that did not make \nsense anymore or were duplicating something else. We streamlined \nprograms to make them work better for farmers and ranchers and we saved \ntaxpayer money and cut $23 billion in spending.\n  At this time, when we are looking at coming up with a way to reduce \nthe deficit and put us on a path for balancing the budget, I cannot \nimagine why we would not want to take the savings from our bipartisan \nfarm bill and include that in this much needed agreement that we need \nto come to by the end of the year.\n  This was not only a bipartisan effort but, because it was deficit \nreduction, it is one of the few deficit reduction bills--maybe the only \none--we actually have passed this year, and we need to make sure it \ngets all the way to the finish line. We cannot afford to walk away from \nthe reforms in this bill. We cannot afford to walk away from our dairy \nfarmers who are right now operating without any kind of safety net. The \ncurrent policy does not work for them so just extending that makes no \nsense. It is a disaster waiting to happen. We cannot afford to walk \naway from our dairy farmers.\n  We cannot afford to walk away from livestock producers who need the \npermanent disaster assistance we passed in the Senate farm bill. By the \nway, it is in the House bill that came out of committee. That is also \nbipartisan.\n  We cannot afford to walk away from the critical priorities in \nconservation of our land, air, and water, of energy, not only of \nbiofuels but the new jobs available in bio-based manufacturing, which I \nam seeing happen in Michigan as well as all across the country. We \ncannot afford to walk away from support for our specialty crop growers, \nfruit and vegetable growers, so important for our families' health and \nfor the economic strength of our country as well. Also, as to forestry \nand nutrition, which affects so many families and so many children in \nschools, we cannot afford to walk away from important funding and \npolicy reforms in each one of these areas.\n  We just need to get this done. This is not rocket science; it is a \nmatter of making it a priority and spending a little bit of time and \ngetting it done. Voters in the election made one thing very clear. They \nwant bipartisanship. They want us to work together as we have done in \nthe Senate, both in the Agriculture Committee and on the floor, to be \nable to get a 5-year farm bill. They want us to simply get things done. \nThe House of Representatives has a chance now to follow our lead, to \npass a bipartisan bill that reforms agricultural programs, that cuts \nthe deficit, ends direct payments and other unnecessary subsidies, and \ngives farmers the risk management tools they desperately need going \nforward.\n  Everywhere I go I hear from farmers who say they need us to get this \ndone. They get up early in the morning. They work hard all day. They \ncome home late. When there is work to be done, they do it. They have to \ndo it. They do not put it off until another day for whatever excuse. \nThey do what has to\n\n[[Page S6769]]\n\nbe done, and they expect us to do what has to be done.\n  Now we are 45 days past the expiration of the last farm bill. We are \nlooking at January and beyond when a series of changes will happen \nautomatically unless we pass a new bill. It will be very difficult on a \nnumber of fronts. We could see chaos in the markets and confusion for \nfarmers as we revert back to what is called permanent law, which is a \ncollection of policies from the Depression era. They are poorly suited \nto the way agriculture is done today. Again, it makes no sense.\n  We cannot let this happen. There is no excuse for not getting the \nbill done by the end of the year. We have done it in the Senate when \neveryone said it was impossible. We put the votes together in just a \ncouple days, with 73 amendments and went through and voted on every \nsingle one of them. Then we voted to pass the bill and got the job \ndone. Now it is time for our House colleagues to do the same. I am \nlooking forward to working with the leadership of the House Agriculture \nCommittee. I have great confidence that we can sit down together and \nproduce a final bill to bring back to the Senate that will allow us to \nget this done before the end of the year.\n  Now is the time to do it. I urge our House colleagues to put this on \nthe top of their list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                 Deficit Reduction and Social Security\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think the American people and Members \nof Congress, now that the election is over, are paying a great deal of \nattention to the so-called fiscal cliff and to deficit reduction in \ngeneral. As we discuss deficit reduction, which is clearly a major \nissue for our country, it is important for us to remember how we got to \nwhere we are today. Where we are today is approximately a $1 trillion \ndeficit and a $16 trillion national debt. I hope everyone does remember \nthat back in January 2001, when Bill Clinton left office and George \nBush assumed the Presidency, at that moment in history this country had \na $236 billion surplus and economists were projecting that surplus \nwould grow and grow in the future.\n  The reason, to a very significant degree, that we are where we are \ntoday in terms of the deficit has everything to do with the fact that \nwe went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, but we did not pay for those \nwars--which, by the way, by the time we take care of our last veteran, \nwill cost us more than $3 trillion. When we do not pay for expensive \nwars, we add to the deficit.\n  When we give out a huge amount in tax breaks, as we did under the \nBush administration, and a lot of those tax breaks went to the \nwealthiest people in this country--when we give tax breaks to \nmillionaires and billionaires and we do not offset them, we also add to \nthe deficit. When we pass a Medicare Part D prescription drug program \nwritten by the insurance companies--more expensive than it should be--\nand we do not pay for that, we add to the deficit.\n  In the midst of this Wall Street-caused recession, one of the points \nmany people have not seen is that today, at 15.2 percent of our GDP, \nrevenue is the lowest it has been in 60 years. When workers lose their \njobs and businesses go under, less revenue comes into the Federal \nGovernment, adding to our deficit crisis. That, to a significant \ndegree, is why we are where we are today.\n  When we talk about deficit reduction and how we go forward, there is \nanother reality we have to address; that is, the middle class of this \ncountry is disappearing. Not only is unemployment, in real terms, close \nto 15 percent, but median family income in the last 10 years has gone \ndown by over $3,000.\n  Meanwhile, in the midst of all that, we have the most unequal \ndistribution of wealth and income of any major country on Earth. We \nhave the top 1 percent owning 42 percent of the wealth in America while \nthe bottom 60 percent owns just 2.3 percent. In the last study we have \nseen on income distribution, between 2009 and 2010, 93 percent of all \nnew income went to the top 1 percent and the bottom 99 percent shared \nthe remaining 7 percent. We are seeing a disappearing middle class--\npeople on top doing fantastically well and very high rates of poverty.\n  I say all that as a prelude to suggest how we should go forward in \nterms of deficit reduction. The main point I wish to make is it is \nabsolutely wrong, it is immoral in my view, and it is bad economics to \nmove forward on deficit reduction on the backs of the elderly, the \nchildren, the sick and the poor. What we as a Congress have to do is to \nmake several points very clear.\n  There are a number of folks out there talking about cutting Social \nSecurity. Let's get the facts straight. Social Security has nothing to \ndo with the deficit because it is independently funded by the payroll \ntax. Let me quote maybe an unlikely source on that issue; that is, on \nOctober 7, 1984, President Ronald Reagan said:\n\n       Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit. Social \n     Security is totally funded by the payroll tax levied on \n     employer and employee. If you reduce the outgo of Social \n     Security that money would not go into the general fund to \n     reduce the deficit. It would go into the Social Security \n     trust fund. So Social Security has nothing to do with \n     balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit.\n\n  That ends the quote from President Ronald Reagan, October 7, 1984. I \ndo not often agree with Ronald Reagan, but he was absolutely right.\n  I am very pleased that just a few days ago majority leader Harry Reid \nsaid pretty much the same thing: Don't mess with Social Security. It \nhas nothing to do with deficit reduction. I hope very much that the \nSenate will agree that as we go forward on deficit reduction, Social \nSecurity should be off the table.\n  Many of us want to make sure Social Security is solvent for the next \n75 years. How do we do it? I have ideas. Others have different ideas. \nBut it is not part of deficit reduction.\n  In my view, at a time of great recession, when so many people are \nhurting, we must not cut Medicare. We must not cut Medicaid. There are \nways to do deficit reduction which are fair. Let me suggest some of the \nways we should do it.\n  The President has been very clear. This is what he campaigned on; \nthat it makes no sense at all from an economic or moral perspective \nthat we continue Bush's tax breaks for the top 2 percent, people who \nare making $250,000 a year or more. If we end those tax breaks, that is \n$1 trillion going to deficit reduction.\n  Right now, one out of four profitable corporations in this country, \nincluding corporations that make billions of dollars a year, is paying \nnothing in taxes. Some of them have actually gotten a rebate from the \nIRS. Before we talk about cutting Medicare, Medicaid or education, \nlet's make sure we do away with the loopholes many large, profitable \ncorporations are currently experiencing.\n  One of the particularly outrageous examples of tax avoidance that is \ntaking place right now has to do with the tax havens that exist in the \nCayman Islands, Bermuda, and in other countries. There are estimates \nthat we are losing over $100 billion a year because corporations and \nwealthy individuals, instead of paying their Federal taxes to this \ncountry, are stashing their money in tax havens in other countries. \nThat is wrong. That is an issue we must address.\n  Last, when we talk about deficit reduction, we have to remember we \nhave tripled defense spending since 1997. We now spend as much money on \ndefense--or almost as much--as the rest of the world combined. No one \ndisagrees that there is enormous waste, bureaucracy, and unnecessary \nweapons systems in the Defense Department that we can eliminate while \nwe maintain the strongest defense in the world.\n\n  Let me conclude by saying this: Yes, we have to go forward with \ndeficit reduction but, no, we cannot and must not do it on the backs of \nthe elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor. There are ways to do \nit that are fair which ask those people who are doing phenomenally well \nto start paying their fair share of taxes, and that is the position \nthis Senate should take.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCain, Mr. Graham, and Ms. Ayotte pertaining to\n\n[[Page S6770]]\n\nthe submission of S. Res. 594 are printed in today's Record under \n``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as the Senate reconvenes this week \nhere in Washington, many States are still working to clean up the \nwreckage left behind by Hurricane Sandy, the largest Atlantic hurricane \non record, and the States are already making new preparations to \nprotect against future extreme weather events.\n  Hurricane Sandy will be remembered both for the large area it \naffected and for the devastation wrought by its fierce winds and \nmassive storm surge--more than 100 lives lost, 8.5 million homes and \nbusinesses without power, $20 billion in property damage, and possibly \nanother $30 billion in lost business. Hurricane Sandy was no doubt an \nextreme weather event and she is likely to be the second costliest \nAtlantic storm in U.S. history at more than $50 billion.\n  Sandy slammed into the east coast, causing destruction from the Mid-\nAtlantic up through New England. The States of New Jersey and New York \nwere hit especially hard, and our thoughts and prayers and our promise \nof prompt and meaningful support go out to all of those affected across \nthe region.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, moderate to major flooding occurred \nalong the entire southern coastline, with some areas experiencing \nsevere erosion and destruction.\n  Houses were swept off their foundations in our southern coast \ncommunities such as Matunuck, shown in this photo I have in the \nChamber. As shown in this picture, here is our former colleague in the \nSenate, now Governor Chafee, inspecting the interior of a house with \nits front having been washed off. And you can see the neighboring \ncottage that is in the ocean. Other small cottages have been actually \ndestroyed by the ocean in that location.\n  Beaches and dunes were driven down by the waves and wind, and thick \nsand and stone deposits covered up roads, as was the case on Atlantic \nAvenue in Misqaumicut, which was just being dug out here in this \nphotograph.\n  Nearly 30 percent of Rhode Island's residents were directly affected \nby this storm. President Obama granted Governor Chafee's request for a \nFederal disaster declaration in four of our State's five counties. More \nthan 130,000 Rhode Islanders lost power and 8 cities and towns were \nforced to implement evacuations. The whole State will be affected by \nthe as of yet unknown millions in damage and lost business.\n  But Rhode Island is resilient. Some businesses hit hard by Sandy and \nthe subsequent nor'easter have already reopened. Others are working \nhard to reopen soon. Here in this picture we can see Atlantic Avenue \nfrom the sky. And the owners of Paddy's Beach Restaurant, shown here, \nas well as their neighbors all along the beach, are determined to \nreopen for the summer tourist season.\n  I remember walking through this little notch here with the owners of \nPaddy's, and looking at this scene of devastation around them, and the \nowners saying: That is not so bad. We can rebuild. We will be back on \nour feet in no time. They already had friends and volunteers on site \nwith hammers and shovels and saws, cleaning up and getting things put \nright.\n  The Ocean State of Rhode Island has a special relationship with the \nseas, and that special relationship requires that we accept challenges \npresented by extreme ocean weather, and it is part of our day-to-day \nlife on the coast to be part of that proud and rewarding tradition.\n  But many of us recognize that this tradition, as President Obama \nreminded us on election night, is--to quote the President--``threatened \nby the destructive power of a warming planet.''\n  It is difficult to say whether extreme weather such as Hurricane \nSandy was specifically caused by climate change. But we do know that a \nwarming planet increases both the severity and the likelihood of these \nstorms; that it, to use one analogy, loads the dice for extreme \nweather.\n  The atmosphere and oceans are getting warmer. We know that. As oceans \nget warmer, storm systems such as Sandy gather more moisture and energy \nfrom them and grow stronger. John T. Fasullo and Kevin Trenberth of the \nNational Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, CO, estimate that \nwhen Hurricane Sandy struck, ocean temperatures along the east coast \nwere nearly 5 degrees above normal, in part attributed to global \nwarming.\n  Warmer oceans expand. We know that too. This expansion, along with \nmelting glaciers and snowpack, has resulted in a measurable and \ncontinuing rise of sea levels along our coasts. And, of course, as sea \nlevels rise, tides and waves and storms and storm surges reach farther \ninland.\n  Sandy caused a whopping storm surge. That is the column of water that \nis formed by the winds and the pressure system of a major storm. That \nsurge peaked at about 5\\1/2\\ feet in Newport, RI, less than the 9\\1/2\\ \nfeet in the Battery in Lower Manhattan but still significant.\n  At the Newport tide gauge, mean sea level is up 10 inches. Mean sea \nlevel is up 10 inches from our devastating famous Hurricane of 1938, \nand these extra inches of sea level increased Sandy's storm surge by at \nleast that amount. Experts predict that the sea level rise will \ncontinue up to 3 to 5 feet more in Rhode Island by the end of the \ncentury.\n  If we do not recognize the need to reduce our greenhouse gas \nemissions and to prepare our infrastructure for climate change, future \nsuperstorms will be even more damaging than Hurricane Sandy. Hurricane \nSandy was, in some respects, a preview of coming attractions. By 2100, \nthe ocean will sit higher, be warmer, and feed more moisture and heat \ninto storms. In addition, the oceans will be far more acidic, but that \nis for another speech.\n  Tomorrow, the Committee on Environment and Public Works, which the \nPresiding Officer serves on with such distinction, will hold a \nlegislative hearing on the Water Resources Development Act. I \nappreciate very much Chairman Boxer's response to storms such as Sandy \nand the foresight she had to include a postdisaster program in the \ndraft that will help States such as mine recover from extreme events \nsuch as Hurricane Sandy.\n  Also included is the Northeast coastal restoration program aimed at \nbuilding the natural and manmade barriers and buffers that helped \nprotect our lives, our infrastructure, and our natural resources from \ngreat storms such as Sandy.\n  When average temperatures rise, we can also expect daily temperature \nrecords to be broken. When the average sea level rises, we can also \nexpect an increase in peak coastal flooding. In fact, we have seen \nthousands of daily temperature records broken and costly coastal \nflooding and the pain and damage caused by these extreme events has \ninevitably turned the Nation's attention to climate change.\n  That is why a growing chorus of voices is convinced and concerned \nabout climate change. A University of Texas poll asked respondents in \nMarch and then again in July of this year if they thought global \nclimate change was occurring. It is interesting. The percentage of \nDemocrats convinced of global climate change went from 83 percent in \nMarch up to 87 percent amid the high heat and drought of the summer of \n2012.\n  Among Independents, the percentage rose from 60 percent in March to \n72 percent in July as news of the unusual weather spread around the \ncountry. Even among Republicans, the number of believers who \nacknowledged that climate change was prevalent went from 45 percent to \n53 percent. The party whose hallmark in Congress is denial of climate \nchange, that put forward the view that climate change is a hoax, now \nactually has a majority of voters who recognize this reality. So this \nChamber is getting further and further apart from the reality of the \npublic, even from the reality of the Republican public.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Mayor Bloomberg of New York \nwrote:\n\n       Our climate is changing . . . And while the increase in \n     extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and \n     around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk \n     that it may be--given the devastation it is wreaking--should \n     be enough to compel all elected leaders to take immediate \n     action.\n\n  The only place where denial still prevails is in Congress where \npolluter\n\n[[Page S6771]]\n\nmoney has such influence. But polluter money cannot change the facts. A \nstudy recently published in Science shows that greenhouse gases \ncaptured in air bubbles stretching back 650,000 years show that the \nlevel of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is now 27 percent higher than \nits highest recorded level at any other point in that time.\n  This year, an Arctic monitor has registered atmospheric \nconcentrations of carbon dioxide at 400 parts per million for the first \ntime; the first time ever that a carbon dioxide sensor has hit this \nominous milestone. For tens of thousands of years, for 800,000 years \nactually, 8,000 centuries, we have been in a range of 170 to 300 parts \nper million of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. Now we are starting to \nsee measures of 400. We are in unprecedented and uncharted territory.\n  We know we will need to adapt our coastal infrastructure to keep \ncommunities safe and prosperous in this changing climate. We will be \nrelocating roads and bridges. We will be bolstering utilities and \nprotecting water and wastewater infrastructure. We will be revising our \nflood maps and our emergency planning.\n  The Senate needs to do its part to ready us for adaptation in the \nface of a changing climate. We can address these issues in legislation \nsuch as WRDA and Defense reauthorization, even in the budget debate. \nBut the overwhelming majority of scientists is convinced that our \nclimate is changing, and all the evidence shows they are right.\n  Indeed, the evidence shows it appears to be their worst-case \nscenarios that are the correct ones. We must be willing to take the \nnecessary actions to prepare both for the new normal climate change is \nbringing and for the new extremes climate change portends.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island for \nhis hard work. I rise to talk for 1 minute about this lameduck session \ntoday. We are in the second day of a lameduck session following the \nelections of a week and a half ago.\n  We face an impending fiscal cliff. We face the end of the year. We \nface a day of calling, a day of reckoning. I think I have an obligation \nas one Member of the Senate, and I think everybody has the same \nobligation, to come to this floor and talk about the solutions and \nresolutions, not problems and what we can and cannot do.\n  We are in a very dangerous position. I have been in this body one \nother time when we faced a fiscal cliff. It was in September of 2008. I \nwill never forget it. The markets had been collapsing. The subprime \nsecurities had been collapsing. The world was in difficult financial \ntimes. The President of the United States, at that time a Republican, \nbrought forward a plan to solve that problem or at least to forestall \nthe collapse of the markets and give us a chance to come back over \ntime.\n  The House of Representatives rejected it and then the markets went \ndown over 800 points in 1 day. Two days later, the Senate came back and \nadopted a plan to move us forward. The markets stabilized, but they \nwere already at the bottom. They had fallen by 50 percent.\n  Now here we are almost 5 years later, still recovering from the \ndepths of the drop of the market at that particular period of time. If \nwe do not address the fiscal cliff and take the first step in this \nlameduck session to move forward in terms of sanity on taxation, sanity \non spending, and sanity on entitlements, then we are going to put \nourselves in the same position again.\n\n  I happen to think one of the best lines in President Obama's speeches \nin his first campaign, and he reiterated it in the last one, was when \nhe talked about we are a country not of the red States of America or \nthe blue States of American but of the United States of America.\n  My predecessor, Zell Miller, former Governor of Georgia, once said: \nWe do not find most Georgians on the very far right or the very far \nleft. We find them in Walmart. They want a fair deal and a fair price \nand a good deal and they want to be treated right. The American people \nwant to be treated right. They do not want to see their taxes go up at \nthe end of the year. They do not want Congress to turn its back on \ncutting its spending where it can. They want us to get entitlements so \nthey are fixed for the long run, not in danger of expiring in the short \nterm.\n  We are this close to being able to find common ground, if we will \nonly take the first step by sitting down at the table. In the last 2 \nweeks I have heard the first step from both sides of the Democratic and \nRepublican Party. John Boehner, 1 week ago, acknowledged that revenues \ncould be a part of the solution. He acknowledged he wanted to do it \nthrough tax reform. President Obama has reiterated, as he did today in \nhis press conference, that he wanted to raise rates on those in the \nupper income. But when pointed to and when asked by a reporter: Mr. \nPresident, that means there is no line in the sand? That means it has \nto be that tax increase or nothing at all, the President refused to \ntake the bait. He said: I will listen to other ideas. He said: I will \nsit at the table. He said: But it has to be meaningful common ground. \nIt has to be plans to truly deal with our fiscal cliff, deal with our \nspending and deal with entitlements and deal with our taxes.\n  Let me just for a second, if I can, opine on what all of us know: It \nis a three-part problem, our debt and our deficit. It is spending. It \nis revenues. It is entitlements. It is not that we do not know what the \nanswers or the solutions are. They are all on the table. They have been \nvisited by the Gang of 6, by Simpson-Bowles, by a lot of the brilliant \npeople in this Chamber, Senator Conrad from North Dakota, who is \nunfortunately leaving us, has talked about it time and again; Senator \nCoburn from Oklahoma. Why don't we put those things on the table, sit \ndown around the table and figure out a formula for success to keep us \nfrom going off the fiscal cliff?\n  It is one thing to gain the confidence of the world and investors and \nthe world body politic; it is quite another to lose it. If we ever lose \nthat confidence, if we ever go off that cliff and people no longer \nthink this is still the greatest place on the face of the Earth to \ninvest their money, then America has a harder struggle to come back \nthan it would ever have by facing our problems now.\n  So for a brief couple minutes, I wish to talk specifically about \nthose things that can be done. First of all, in terms of spending, we \ncan cut discretionary spending. But we all know discretionary spending \nand our deficit are about equal and have been for about the last 5 \nyears, which means if we cut all Federal discretionary spending, cancel \nthe government for 1 year, all we are doing is balancing the budget; we \nare not saving any money. We all know we cannot do it totally by \ncutting spending, but we do know we should, which means we should bring \nappropriations bills to the floor, we should debate those bills on the \nfloor, we should hold our agencies accountable, and manage things on a \ncost-benefit analysis--do what Jeanne Shaheen and I have talked about \nin terms of a biennial budget. Have 1 year dedicated to spending, the \nother year dedicated to oversight. We can find savings and we can find \nrevenue to reduce our deficit, but that will not do all of it.\n  Entitlements. We have to look at entitlements. But that does not mean \nwe take away anyone's Social Security or anybody's Medicare because I \ndo not consider them entitlements in the first place. The Presiding \nOfficer paid 1.35 percent of his income every day of his working life \nfor his Medicare and he deserves to get it.\n  The Presiding Officer paid 6.2 percent of his income for his payroll \ndeduction for his Social Security and he deserves to get it. But we all \nknow those programs were started in 1968 and the 1930s and eligibility \nshould be reformed. We should find a way to make eligibility be \nactuarially sound, as they did in 1983, when Ronald Reagan and Tip \nO'Neill raised the eligibility for me so I could not get Social \nSecurity at age 65, I had to wait until age 66.\n  Did I miss it? No, I did not think I would live that long in the \nfirst place. But when I did get there, I appreciated the fact that they \nsaved Social Security for me in 1983. We need to save it for our \nchildren and our grandchildren today, and we can do it by looking at \neligibility in the formula. We do not have to raise the tax or lower \nthe benefit. We might means test the COLA in terms of Social Security, \nbut we can\n\n[[Page S6772]]\n\nfix it if we just sit around the table and talk about it and not take \naway anybody's eligibility.\n  Medicare is tougher. We can means test benefits in terms of \ncopayments. We can take plans such as Paul Ryan's and give people \noptions. Whatever we do, we can sit down around the table and find a \nway for the future, find a way to save the Medicare the American people \nhave paid for.\n  In terms of the safety net, nobody wants to do away with the safety \nnet. But it is time we looked at the safety net and the cost-benefit \nanalysis and the eligibility for the benefit programs so we manage them \nappropriately such as you would any other expenditure of government.\n  Then we go to the Tax Code. That is where we are today. That is the \nstumbling block, seeing where we are going to move forward on taxes. \nTime is running out. I will be the first person to admit it would be \nhard to come up with a comprehensive reform in 7 weeks to fix the Tax \nCode.\n  But it would not be hard to come up with a comprehensive agreement \nthis month, now in this session, to do it early next year and put off \npushing us off the fiscal cliff. Get a new speed bump next year. Give \nus the time to sit down around the table and find common ground. Maybe \nit is means testing deductions, which raises revenues without raising \nrates. In fact, there is a great argument, and the argument comes from \n1986, when Reagan and O'Neill again lowered the top tax rate from 70 \npercent to 28 percent and raised revenues in the same taxable year, all \nbecause we raised the base upon which the levy was charged.\n  We raised more revenue which, in the end, is the name of the game. My \nmain point is this: We should not be sitting around twiddling our \nthumbs. The clock is running. We face a fiscal cliff. There are some in \nthis Chamber who have said: Oh, we just need to go off it. We will pay \nthe price. Then we will finally sit down and do what is right. I would, \nwith all due respect, say that is pretty stupid. We have gone off a \ncliff once before in 2008. We are still reeling from it today because \nwe did not deal fast enough with the decisions we had to make as a \nCongress to address the problems of the people who elected us to come \nand manage their affairs.\n  I would submit to you that it is about time the American Government \ndid what every American family has had to do in the last 5 years: sit \naround our kitchen table like they have sat around theirs, talk about \nour income like they have talked about theirs, cut their budgets and \nspending where they have had to because they have had to tighten their \nbelts. Don't you think the government ought to at least ask of itself \nwhat it has required every American family to do?\n  So instead of talking about what we can't find agreement on, why \ndon't we start talking about what we can find agreement on? We don't \nhave to just penalize one taxable class of Americans and declare a \npolitical victory but not solve our problem any more than we have some \nobfuscation in terms of tax reform that really is ``now you see it and \nnow you don't.'' We can do meaningful reform that accomplishes the \nraising of revenues and more equity in the Tax Code, we can cut \ndiscretionary spending where appropriate, and we can reform our \nentitlements. Over time we can get our fiscal house in order.\n  The great thing about our problem is that it is not a problem that \nhas to be solved in one fell swoop, but we have to make a commitment to \nbegin to reduce deficits and, in turn, eliminate them so we will reduce \ndebt. We need a game plan over the next decade that causes us to do \nthat. When we do, we will return to the greatness America has always \nknown. But if we don't, it will not be a good place to invest people's \nmoney, our rates will go up on our debt service, and America will have \na hard time returning to the preeminence it has known.\n  So my message today is this: The President, in his press conference, \nsaid all issues were open on the table. John Boehner, in his leadership \nremarks, said the same thing in terms of revenues a week ago. Let's sit \ndown at that table and let's start talking about those solutions. Let's \nstart giving ourselves meaningful goals and not just use the threat of \ndestroying our economy and our investment in our country as a threat to \ncause us to do nothing. Let's do something. Let's do the people's \nbusiness. Let's face the music and make it a symphony.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Agreement--S. 3414\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:30 \np.m., the motion to proceed to the motion to reconsider the vote by \nwhich cloture was not invoked on S. 3414, the Cybersecurity of Act of \n2012, be agreed to; that the motion to reconsider be agreed to and that \nthere be up to 60 minutes of debate equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees on the motion to invoke cloture on S. 3414; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to the \ncloture vote on S. 3414, upon reconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Wind Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I want to start by welcoming \nmy colleagues to what I hope will be a highly productive lameduck \nsession of Congress. We have immense challenges facing our country, but \nI believe we can come together and accomplish the tasks before us, \nhopefully in a truly bipartisan way.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, one of the issues I have been really \nconcerned about for some time is the production tax credit for wind \nenergy, which is known by its acronym of PTC. I would like to \nacknowledge that the Presiding Officer's State, Minnesota, has a big \npresence in wind energy.\n  I have come to the floor, as my colleagues know--and maybe, in some \nof their minds, too often--I come down here every morning we are in \nsession--just about every morning since June--to talk about the \nimportance of extending this job-creating tax credit.\n  The PTC has helped create literally tens of thousands of good-paying \nmiddle-class jobs all across our Nation, it has in turn spurred the \ngrowth of the wind energy industry, and it has strengthened American \nmanufacturing, which we all deeply care about, and it has helped free \nus from foreign sources of energy. That is quite a trifecta of \nsuccesses, make no mistake about it. It has also underlined the fact \nthat energy security is national security.\n  But as the expiration of the PTC draws near--and it draws near at the \nend of this year--the inaction here in the Congress has brought a dark \ncloud literally over this important American industry, and our workers \nare paying the price. Manufacturers across our great Nation and all \nalong the wind industry's supply chain have been forced to lay off \nthousands of workers just in the past several months, and I wish to \nshare one example. Vestas, which is a leading manufacturer of wind \nturbines that has a large presence in my home State of Colorado, has \nlaid off hundreds of workers. Literally, hard-working Americans are \nlosing their good-paying jobs because Congress has delayed action to \nextend this tax credit, which I should point out has broad bipartisan \nand bicameral support, so both the Senate and the House--both parties--\nhave support for extending it. Enough is enough.\n  Luckily, we have made some progress. Earlier this year the Senate \nFinance Committee passed a bipartisan tax extenders bill that would \nextend a number of important tax provisions, and among them was the \nproduction tax credit. Unfortunately, this package, which is critical \nand is so important to our economy, has sat on the shelf for many \nmonths now. As comrades tell me, and I share with you as\n\n[[Page S6773]]\n\nmy colleagues, that is just simply unacceptable.\n  As I mentioned, I have made these regular trips down to the floor, \nand what I have been able to do is highlight individual States and how \nthe wind industry has created jobs and generated power for each of \nthose individual States. In fact, I am 20 States in and I am nowhere \nnear done, and that is because almost every one of the 50 States has a \npresence in the wind energy industry.\n  Today I am going to turn to Wisconsin, which has a well-established \nmanufacturing sector historically, and that manufacturing sector has \nretooled to support the wind industry. In fact, if you look at the map \nhere, Wisconsin has over 22 manufacturing facilities that make parts \nfor the wind energy industry.\n\n  In addition to the manufacturing sector, Wisconsin has also made big \ngains in wind power generation. So you can build turbines, blades, the \ntowers, and the cells, but also, if you have a wind resource, you can \nthen harvest that wind. Wisconsin has made big gains in harvesting that \nwind.\n  The farms there, the wind farms, already provide enough electricity \nto power 150,000 homes, and the projects that are currently proposed in \nWisconsin could multiply that number fourfold. If you look at the \neconomic implications, they are very impressive. In fact, according to \nthe National Renewable Energy Lab, which I have to say is located in \nColorado, if even half of the proposed projects were completed, they \nwould provide a cumulative economic benefit of over $1 billion. That is \n$1 billion. Let's do our part in helping make that investment happen by \nextending the production tax credit.\n  As I have pointed out, the PTC has helped these Wisconsin facilities \nprosper and grow, but this looming expiration would threaten some 3,000 \njobs that are supported by this industry in Wisconsin.\n  It is also important to note that when the big companies that gain \nsome of the attention in the wind energy world, such as Siemens or \nVestas, announce layoffs because of uncertainty over the PTC, there are \na lot of other small businesses in the industry that are affected by \nthose decisions. There are literally thousands of parts in a wind \nturbine--some 8,000, to be exact. So when you see the industry take a \nstep back, a lot of those small businesses are affected, and they feel \nthe downturn as well. We all are really concerned about those families \nand those communities and the small businesses that are hurt by those \nsorts of job losses in Wisconsin and all over our country.\n  As I close, Madam President, there is a tremendous amount of work the \nwind energy industry has done to help restore America's manufacturing \nbase. With all of that potential looming in front of us, we just can't \nlet our inaction stand in the way.\n  My message to all of us is pretty simple. We need to pass the \nproduction tax credit as soon as possible. PTC equals jobs, and we need \nto pass it ASAP. I can't say it enough times. There is no reason for \nthis delay. It has caused the loss of good-paying jobs, and it has set \nback our energy independence goals. If we don't act soon, foreign \ncompetition will get the upper hand and pass us by. There is no \nquestion that the rest of the world is moving very quickly to implement \ntheir own wind energy projects and to build the wind energy turbines. \nLet's not let this scenario become a reality. Let's move in the way the \nSenate Finance Committee has shown us we can move. Let's extend the PTC \nhere in the Senate. I know the House could follow suit.\n  Simply put, let's just pass the production tax credit as soon as \npossible. If we are focused on the economy, if we are focused on jobs--\nit is what we heard from the voters just a short week ago--let's get \nthe production tax credit extended.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I think we all know that everybody \nin America is pretty much talking about the fiscal cliff, and that what \nwill happen at the end of this year will have an enormous impact on the \neconomy of our country and its future. There is no doubt about it. In \nfact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that the \nimpending tax hikes that will take effect at the end of this year if we \ndon't do something along with the spending cuts called sequestration \nwould plunge us into a recession in the first half of 2013. It would \nalso set off credit downgrades and drive up interest rates on credit \ncards, mortgages, and personal and government debt. They predict \nunemployment will rise above 9 percent, and the cuts in spending, half \nof which will be in the defense sector, certainly is going to leave \nAmerica vulnerable.\n  If there is anything Congress and the President are responsible for, \nit is the national security of our country. We can stop this fiscal \ncliff.\n  We can answer the calls of the American people who have said clearly, \nloudly, and repeatedly: Get together and make things happen.\n  I am happy to see our distinguished Madam President is sitting in the \nChair and agreeing because we know there is common ground. We have seen \ngroups of our Senators, Republicans and Democrats--a Gang of 6, a Gang \nof 8, the Simpson-Bowles Commission, all of these entities--that were \nbipartisan in nature and they came up with solutions. Did we agree with \n100 percent of what was in those plans? No. But there are nuggets we \ncan start from, and what we have to do is sit down and start.\n  Republicans are saying tax increases in this economy are not the \nright formula. We know if we tax 100 percent of every person who makes \nover $200,000 it is not going to affect the deficit. It is not going to \nhave the impact I think people expect when they hear: Oh, we will tax \nthe rich, since it will not affect us, and that will solve the deficit \nproblem. It will not. It will have no impact on the deficit.\n  Who will be hit if these tax increases go into effect--which they \nautomatically will at the end of December if we don't do something? Who \nwill be hit? Well, it is going to hit the middle class, small \nbusinesses, family farmers, retirees, and married couples.\n  If the individual income tax brackets are not extended, the current \nsix brackets will be five brackets. It will revert to pre-2001. The \nlowest end is the one that is going to go up in percentage the most. \nThe 10-percent bracket will go to 15 percent, and the 15 percent stays \nat 15 percent. So the people who were paying 10 percent will now go to \n15 percent if we don't do something.\n  The rates of the remaining four brackets will also increase: 25 \npercent becomes 28, 28 to 31, 33 to 36, and 35 to 39.6, almost 40 \npercent. On top of that is the individual alternative minimum tax. We \nhave each year extended the tax relief for what we call the AMT, the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  The alternative minimum tax was put in place to target a few \nmillionaires. Now, because of inflation and wage increases, it is \ntargeted right at the middle class. Unless that relief is renewed this \nyear, it will boost 2012 taxes for 31 million Americans in the $30,000 \nto $40,000 wage range.\n  Now, really, do people making $30,000 or $40,000 deserve to have a \nnew alternative minimum tax on top of the tax they are going to pay, \nwhich will be 25 or 28 percent? I don't think so, Madam President, and \nit is not what the AMT was meant to target.\n  The increase in tax rates are going to certainly affect our small \nbusinesses. The economic engine of America is small business. The \neconomic engine of America is not big business, although big business \nis very important, and it is not government. It is small business. Over \n60 percent of the jobs created in America are created by small \nbusiness. Yet they are the ones who are not hiring. They are the ones \nwho see their slim margins of profit getting so much slimmer they are \nnot hiring people because they think the costs are going to be higher \nbecause of the new taxes that are impending.\n  Seventy-five percent of small businesses pay taxes at an individual \nrate because they are S corporations or are flow-through businesses. So \nif we look at them and then look at those rate increases, that is going \nto be an immediate impact on every small business owner who is \norganized in that way. With over 20 million Americans still looking for \nwork, do we really want to have this kind of economic hit? We need our \nsmall businesses to feel confident, and so we need stability.\n\n[[Page S6774]]\n\n  I have talked to so many small businesspeople in the last month as I \nhave been out talking to people in my home State and in other States. \nWhat most of them say comes down to they just need to know what their \ntax liability is going to be, and they need to know it is going to stay \nthat way for a while. That is how they make their plans. They do not \nwant to hire someone if we are just going to have a 6-month fix or a 1-\nyear fix or a 2-year tax policy. A 2-year tax policy is a nightmare for \nbusinesses because they cannot make a long-term plan. They can't have a \nstrategy that puts three more people on the payroll and then have those \ncosts go up at the end of that 2-year period.\n  It is important we give our businesses stability and that we show we \nunderstand they are the economic engine of America and that we want \nthem to succeed and to hire people and give new jobs and get this \nunemployment rate well below the nearly 8 percent that it is now down \ninto the 6-percent or 5-percent range.\n  Now, let's talk about the elderly. All of these years I have heard \npeople talking about the importance of saving for retirement, and we \nhave encouraged people to do that. The people who have done that are \nlooking at a huge tax increase.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. These are people who have done the right thing. They \nhave saved. They have tried to make sure they didn't need any kind of \ngovernment handout. They have earned Social Security--and that is not a \ngovernment handout--and they want to know they can make it living the \nlifestyle they want to live because they have saved. But here we are \ntalking about raising their taxes on the dividends of any stock they \nmight have invested or might have been in their company 401(k) plan, \nand we are talking about raising the capital gains rate.\n  In fact, the dividends rate could be as much as 39.6 percent. Nearly \nforty percent on dividends is going to kill a plan for retirement, and \nit is just not right to change the rules when we have had a lower \ndividend tax rate or capital gains tax rate for people who have done \nthe right thing and saved for their own security. That is what will \nmake a strong economy, and for our retirees to be able to get the rest \nthey deserve.\n  What about married couples? One of my longstanding priorities in the \nSenate has been to make sure we have a level playing field on \ndeductions of State and local taxes. Some States have income taxes, \nsome States have sales taxes, some have both, and a few have neither. \nBut for those who have both, we give them the choice of a sales tax \ndeduction or income tax deduction. That means on their Federal income \ntax they don't pay taxes on the taxes they pay. If they are paying a \nState income tax or a State sales tax, they should be able to deduct at \nleast one of those because there is no reason to be taxed on taxes. The \nsales tax deduction expired at the end of last year. If we don't renew \nit, the people who have sales taxes and no income tax are going to be \nseverely disadvantaged.\n  In my home State of Texas, that makes at least a $500 difference to \nevery person who takes those deductions. That can be a lot for 2 \nmillion Texans who claim this deduction, to have an average of $500 \nthey are paying on taxes. So it is not a level playing field if we \ndon't renew that extension. There are eight States that have no income \ntax, and they do have sales taxes. So I am hoping we will have that \nkind of parity in taxation, which we must do by the end of the year to \nallow that equity to take hold.\n  A second priority of mine is the marriage penalty. I passed the \noriginal amendment that would double the standard deduction for married \ncouples. This has been a hugely popular tax deduction because in the \npast, when two single people got married, they would go into the higher \nbracket, and they would not get a double standard deduction. Prior to \n2001, 25 million couples paid a penalty for being married, and the \naverage cost to them was $1,400. As an example, if a Houston policeman, \nwith a taxable income of $50,000, is marrying a data entry clerk who \nmakes $30,000, they are going to have a tax increase of about $800 a \nyear because the marriage penalty will come back at the end of this \nyear.\n  We enacted relief in 2001. It was my amendment. And I hope we will \nnot leave here December 31 of this year without renewing the marriage \npenalty tax relief. It will mean $800 for married couples, as an \naverage, and, for sure, that is something they deserve when they get \nmarried. They shouldn't have to pay more for their decision to get \nmarried. So if we don't extend the tax cuts that are in place right \nnow, at the end of this year we are going to see tax relief for the \nmiddle class, small businesses, family farms, retirees, and families go \naway. That relief will go away, and all of their taxes are going to go \nup. That is not even counting the surcharges that are going to take \neffect January 1 of next year in the health care law on dividends and \ncapital gains.\n  So if the dividend rate goes back up to 20 percent, it is going to be \n23.8 percent. If someone is in the 39.6-percent bracket, it is going to \nbe 43.4 percent. So it is something we must deal with.\n  The other side of the equation is spending. Madam President, we must \ndo something about the $1 trillion deficits we have had year after year \nafter year that have made this debt go up from $10.6 trillion 4 years \nago to $16.2 trillion today. We are about to hit our debt limit, and \nthat means we are going to have to increase the debt that is already a \nwet blanket on this economy.\n  So, Madam President, we must come together.\n  We can do it. We can cut spending. We can address entitlement reform \nthat will bring our entitlements into an actuarial soundness. Social \nSecurity and Medicare have already sustained enormous cuts in the \nhealth care plan that was adopted 2 years ago, and we can't sustain \neither of those programs if we continue to go in the direction we have \nbeen going.\n  So rather than the sequestration--which is going to take more than $1 \ntrillion out of federal programs, half of which is going to come from \ndefense--we have got to do something about it now.\n  We have a 10-year plan that could cut the deficits. But we have got \nto do more. We have got to enact the next step in budget cuts, and it \nhas got to include entitlement reform, in my opinion. I know there are \ndisagreements about that, but that is the argument and the discussion \nwe need to have. It is our responsibility.\n  We should be using this time--today, tomorrow, this week--to start \nputting together a framework of discussions, because we will be in \nsession from the end of November probably up until right before \nChristmas, and the American people deserve to have a solution, \nsomething that assures small business that they can count on a tax \nstructure that is fair, that can allow them to make a reasonable \nprofit, and allow them to hire more people.\n  We have got to cut spending so we can manage this government in a \nresponsible way without it encroaching on the vibrancy of our economy. \nThat is our challenge. I hope this Congress is up to it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6774-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6774-S6784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CYBERSECURITY ACT OF 2012\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to begin by thanking the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, for being as steadfast as he has been in \npursuit of a law that will protect America from what I think most \nsecurity experts would say today, surprisingly, is the most serious \nthreat to our security and to our economy, which is from cyber attack \nand cyber theft.\n  The majority leader, with the authority he has over our schedule, has \nnow pulled up the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, S. 3414, for \nreconsideration; that is\n\n[[Page S6775]]\n\nto say, to reconsider the cloture vote that was held in August and \nfailed to get 60 votes, much to my disappointment. I am very grateful \nthat Senator Reid now gives the Senate a second chance to do something \nto protect the American people from cyber attack and cyber theft.\n  If you look at what has happened since the cloture vote on the \nCybersecurity Act failed back in August, I think you will see how \nurgently we need to seize this opportunity to at least vote to proceed \nto the Cybersecurity Act. Senator Reid has made clear that he would \nallow a finite number of amendments--finite because, after all, we are \nin a postelection so-called lameduck session. The amendments can't go \non forever. But a finite list would allow there to be a discussion and \nvote on the major concerns people still seem to have with the \ncompromised bipartisan Cybersecurity Act of 2012.\n  I appeal to my colleagues: Don't be recorded as no. Say yes to at \nleast allowing a discussion of cybersecurity legislation here, offer \nsome amendments, and then, of course, understand that we are not a \nunicameral legislature, to say the obvious. If--as I hope--we can pass \ncyber security legislation here, it has to go to conference with the \nHouse that I would say has--describing it diplomatically--a different \nposition than as reflected in the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 that \nemerged in part from the Homeland Security Committee; which is why I \nhave the honor of managing this debate, brought out with the strong \nsupport from my ranking member and dear friend Senator Collins of \nMaine, and then working together with Senator Feinstein, the chair of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Rockefeller, the chair of \nthe Commerce Committee, and Senator Carper, who has had a real interest \nin cyber security and is a leader on the Homeland Security Committee. \nWe bring this legislation forward.\n  We are being given a second chance to raise our defenses against \nrival nations, enemy nations, industrial spies, cyber terrorists, \norganized anti-American nonstate actors, and international organized \ncriminal gangs who are constantly probing our computer networks for \nweaknesses that they can exploit to steal industrial secrets, to take \nsome of the best results of American innovation and entrepreneurship \noverseas and, with it, the jobs that come with those secrets. And, of \ncourse, to sabotage critical infrastructure--powerplants, financial \nsystems, telecommunications systems, water systems, and so on and so \non--which are the systems that we depend on in our society for our \nquality of life, for our freedom of expression, so many of them owned \nby the private sector and managed and controlled now, operated, by \ncyber systems over the Internet and, therefore, subject to cyber \nattacks.\n  That is what this bill is about, creating standards for public-\nprivate cooperation to raise our defenses against cyber attack and \ncyber theft. Everybody you talk to in the public or private sector says \ntoday that we are vulnerable to attack. This bill only relates to the \nmost critical cyber infrastructure whose compromise, whose attack, \nwhose disabling would result in mass casualties, catastrophic economic \nloss, and assaults on our national security.\n  So let me come back to what I said. The best arguments for this bill \nand for voting on the motion to proceed and going to the bill are not \nthe arguments, frankly, that I will make on behalf of the bill but the \nfacts that have occurred and the limited amount of time since August \nwhen this initial vote to proceed to the Cybersecurity Act occurred.\n  On August 15, just 2 weeks after the last cloture vote, a computer \nvirus called Shamoon erased the hard drives of 30,000 computers owned \nand operated by Saudi Aramco, one of the world's largest energy \ncompanies. What happened as a result of the erasing of those hard \ndrives, the data files were replaced with images of burning American \nflags. It is pretty clear who carried out this attack. The computers \nwere rendered useless and had to be replaced and restored. Some cyber \nexperts that I trust say this was the most destructive cyber attack \nagainst a private company in history. A similar attack was carried out \non the Qatari natural gas company called RasGas. Remember the burning \nAmerican flags? Iran is suspected as the attacker in both instances.\n\n  Thanks to quick work, really extraordinary work by Aramco and many of \nthe world's leading cyber security technologists and experts, the \ndamage to Saudi Aramco was contained. But this attack could have thrown \nglobal oil markets into chaos and a lot of economies--including ours--\ninto greater stress than we are already in if orders couldn't be filled \nor shipments made.\n  That was August, 2 weeks after the last cloture vote on the cyber \nsecurity bill. Then in September, the consumer Web banking sites of \nsome great American financial institutions--Bank of America, JPMorgan \nChase, Wells Fargo, PNC Bank, and some others--came under the largest \nsustained denial of service attack in history. As I am sure most of my \ncolleagues know, this is when the Web sites are essentially overloaded, \nthey are flooded, to make it impossible for them to stay up and provide \nthe service they normally do. These attacks went on in different waves \nfor weeks, knocking many of these sites that are very important to \ncommercial life in our country offline or slowing them to a crawl. Just \ntake a look at how much commerce is now conducted over the Internet and \nI think you can see the potential catastrophe here. These kinds of \nattacks really could bring our banking system and the economy to its \nknees. Again, some intelligence officials that I respect suspect that \nIran or its agents launched these attacks against the American banks.\n  Defense Secretary Panetta warned in a recent speech that these and \nother cyber attacks show that we are approaching a cyber Pearl Harbor \nwhere:\n\n       An aggressor nation or extremist group could use these \n     kinds of cybertools to gain control of critical switches . . \n     . [and] derail passenger trains, or even more dangerous, \n     trains loaded with lethal chemicals.\n       They could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or \n     shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.\n\n  That is not science fiction. That is not an alarmist. That is the \nSecretary of Defense of the United States, Leon Panetta, issuing a \nwarning based on what anybody who works in this field knows is reality.\n  In recent weeks, we have watched one section of our country--in this \ncase the Northeast, including my own State of Connecticut--hit by \nHurricane Sandy and then a follow-on northeaster storm, losing power. \nSome parts of New York and certainly New Jersey were hit harder than \nConnecticut, but we were hit pretty hard ourselves. Some still are \nwithout power, and this is the third week since the hurricane. This is \nexactly the kind of dislocation and suffering that would occur if an \nenemy cyber attacked America's electric power system. It is why we need \nto at least vote to take this bill up now with a sense of urgency in \nthis session. Time is not on our side.\n  The elections are over. The American people through their votes have \ntold us in a clear and certain voice that they want us to work together \nto solve the many challenges our Nation confronts. I know we are \nfocused on avoiding going over the fiscal cliff and the challenge to \nCongress is, Can we solve our fiscal problems? Can we come to a \nbipartisan compromise before we go over the cliff?\n  In this case of cyber security and cyber vulnerability, the challenge \nbefore us is, Can we come to a bipartisan agreement compromise--and we \nthink we have in the bill before us--and create and improve our \ndefenses before a catastrophic cyber attack occurs, as it surely will, \nand then we come rushing back to raise our defenses, as we did after 9/\n11, after we have suffered an attack?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I want to ask the distinguished chairman, who \nreferenced the important word, ``compromise,'' if he has spoken about \nthe extent to which this bill reflects not only the original bipartisan \ncompromise between himself and his ranking member, Senator Susan \nCollins of Maine, but then a second compromise done to reach further to \nour Republican colleagues that is actually already embedded in this \nbill. I think it is important for the people who are watching and \nlistening to us to recognize that not only was this an original\n\n[[Page S6776]]\n\nbipartisan bill that was the product of bipartisan compromise and \ndiscussion, but then a further unilateral step was taken by the \ndistinguished chairman to move even more toward Republican colleagues. \nSo it is not only a compromise but double compromise that is on the \nSenate floor right now.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Rhode Island. I thank my friend \nfor his interest in the area of cyber security and for his leadership. \nI have not talked about that yet--and I will right now--which is to \nsay, following the advice of most of the experts of both political \nadministrations and experts outside, one of the centerpieces of our \noriginal bill was to create a public-private process--government and \npeople who live in these sectors of our economy--to draft best \npractices, not to have them imposed by the Government, and then to make \nit mandatory within a set period of time, and that these practices, \nthese standards, would be general principles, not all do's and don'ts, \nto leave room for the private sector to come up with the best way they \nthought they could meet those standards.\n  Opponents, particularly the business community, and some of our \nfriends on the other side, have said to us that they fear that would be \nmore regulation of business. Senator Collins, my ranking member and \ndear friend, is a leading advocate of regulation reform and lighter \nregulation on business. But she said over and over with such \ncredibility and force: This is not regulation of business; this is \nprotection of our homeland security, of our economy. You reform \nregulation when the regulations seem to be too much and get in the way \nof economic growth. We have a threat that is today stealing billions of \ndollars of American innovation, taking jobs elsewhere in the world.\n  OK, we had it mandatory, but it was clear we were not going to get to \n60 votes. I have said over and over, one of the problems we have in \nCongress now is people seem to say if they do not get 100 percent of \nwhat they want, they are not going to vote for a bill. So I had to \nlisten to my own words because if they wait for 100 percent of what \nthey want on a bill, everybody is going to end up with zero percent. We \nmight as well try to get done what we agree on. So we took a big step, \nwhich was to make those mandatory standards voluntary.\n  Then we threw in an incentive, which is a lot--partial liability, \nimmunity from liability in the case of a cyber attack--as an \nencouragement for those companies that voluntarily opt into the \nstandards that the voluntary process would set up that gets some \nimmunity from liability for prosecution.\n  Incidentally, President Obama has made very clear, first, that he \ntotally gets the seriousness of this challenge to our security, this \ncyber challenge to our security and our prosperity. He has supported \nthis legislation, but he has gone one step further now and said if we \nfail to pass legislation, he will issue an Executive order that does as \nmuch as an Executive order can do to protect America better from cyber \nattack and cyber theft.\n  The President does have the authority to issue an Executive order \nthat will establish standards for cyber security for all 18 critical \ninfrastructure sectors under existing law and require those sectors to \nbe implemented in certain areas where the regulators have the power to \nmandate such observance of the standards. A draft of such Presidential \norder is now being circulated, but the President does not have the \npower under existing law to offer a lot of the benefits that our bill \nwould give private sector owners of critical infrastructure.\n  For one thing the President does not have the ability to offer the \nprivate sector owners the liability protection I have just described. \nIn addition, needed changes to law that permit private companies to \nshare cyber security threat information among themselves and with the \ngovernment will go unmade. So both sides in this debate have \nacknowledged that this is a critical piece in any bill. But it cannot \nbe implemented by executive action. We are the lawmakers. We have the \nability to protect our country better than the President does by \nExecutive order. I have appealed to the President that if we are not \nable to act here that he should issue this Executive order. I am very \nencouraged by the work done on it, and I am confident that if we fail \nto act the President will act. I think he has a responsibility to act \nbecause if we fail to act we are leaving the American people extremely \nvulnerable to a major cyber attack. Therefore, although the legislation \nis preferable, an Executive order will certainly give the American \npeople protection.\n  I have more to say, but I note the presence on the floor of my \ncolleague and partner in this pursuit, the chair of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Feinstein. If she would like to speak, \nI will yield the floor to her.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would, and I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, if I may, I want to compliment \nSenator Lieberman on his steadfast determination to get this bill \npassed. I think he and his ranking member, Senator Collins, have done a \nvery fine job. I think it is important for everyone to know about those \nhours when we sat down with other Members trying to negotiate something \npeople might agree to on this cyber bill. Unfortunately, we could not.\n  I am very worried. I am very worried there will be a major cyber \nattack on this Nation. I do not say that without intelligence to back \nit up. On the Intelligence Committee, we receive regular warnings from \nthe Intelligence Community that tell us cyber attacks are increasing in \nnumber, sophistication, and damage.\n  Unfortunately, despite significant changes made to the Cybersecurity \nAct that Senator Lieberman, Senator Collins, Senator Rockefeller and I \nagreed to in July and August, many on the other side of the aisle \nfilibustered the bill. Since that time we have learned of additional \nmajor cyber attacks.\n  In October and September of this year, at least nine major U.S. banks \nwere hit by a series of attacks that blocked their customers from \naccessing their banking information or making online transactions. This \nlist of victims includes the country's largest, most sophisticated \nfinancial institutions: the Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, \nthe U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo, PNC, Capital One, BB Corporation, and \nHSBC--all cyber attacked.\n  These attacks systematically hit banks for 5 weeks. They disrupted \ntraffic at each bank for a day or two before moving on to the next \nvictim. It was a well planned and coordinated cyber attack from bank to \nbank to bank to bank. It disrupted the banking system, but it did not \ndestroy it. But that doesn't mean the attackers do not have the ability \nto destroy it. This is a real wake-up call, and I think we ignore it at \nour own peril.\n  I have come to believe it is negligent to fail to pass a bill with \nthe warnings that are out there today. I remember, I was on the \nIntelligence Committee when the CIA Director, then-Director Tenet, came \nbefore the committee in the middle of the summer in 2001 and said to \nus: We anticipate an attack. We don't know where. We don't know when. \nThat attack came, and it was 9/11. Today there is the same anticipation \nof a big attack, a big cyber attack. And we need to put in place the \nlegal procedures to prevent that.\n  Let me mention other recent cyber attacks. In August, a foreign \ncountry or organization used computer code to destroy 30,000 computers \nat the world's largest energy company, that is Saudi Aramco, and that \nis Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company. How is this done? According \nto the New York Times, the cyber attackers ``unleashed a computer virus \nto initiate what is regarded as among the most destructive acts of \ncomputer sabotage on a company to date. The virus erased data on three-\nquarters of Aramco's corporate PCs--documents, spreadsheets, e-mails, \nfiles--replacing all of it with an image of a burning American flag.''\n  If anything is a harbinger of things to come, that is clear. Why \nwould one put their signature on a major cyber attack by showing \nburning American flags unless they had some additional intent against \nthe U.S.? We cannot underestimate the threat. To do so is sheer \nnegligence on the part of this body.\n  In the 5 months from October 2011 through February 2012, over 50,000 \ncyber attacks were reported on private and government networks with 86 \nof\n\n[[Page S6777]]\n\nthose attacks taking place on critical infrastructure networks. So we \nhave 86 attacks on critical infrastructure networks.\n  Keep in mind these 50,000 incidents were only the ones reported to \nthe Department of Homeland Security. So they represent but a small \nfraction of cyber attacks carried out against the United States. This \nyear, 2012, Nissan, MasterCard, and Visa joined the ranks of other \nmajor companies already hacked--Sony, Citi, Lockheed Martin, Northrop \nGrumman, Google, Booze Allen Hamilton, RSA, L-3, and the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce as victims of hacking last year.\n  We also know that last year for at least 6 months, 48 companies in \nthe chemical, defense, and other industries were penetrated by a hacker \nlooking to steal intellectual property. The cyber security company \nSymantec has attributed some of these attacks to computers in Hebei, \nChina.\n  Here is the point. We know we are being attacked by other countries. \nI hear it in the Intelligence Committee. It is classified so I cannot \ngo into it here. But suffice it to say that we know it is happening. \nThings are only going to get worse, as Secretary Panetta said in a \nrecent major address in New York. Let me just read one section of his \nspeech:\n\n       The collective result of these kinds of attacks could be a \n     cyber Pearl Harbor, an attack that would cause physical \n     destruction and loss of life. In fact it would paralyze and \n     shock the nation and create a new, profound sense of \n     vulnerability.\n\n  Members of the Senate, we are warned. We are warned clearly, we are \nwarned directly, and we are warned by the Head of Cyber Command, \nGeneral Alexander, as well as the Secretary of Defense. Yet we do \nnothing.\n  I strongly believe we need to pass this bill. Then it will go to the \nHouse. And then there will be a conference. Along the way, there will \nhave to be some accommodations made. But, there is no reason for this \nSenate, knowing what we know, not to pass this bill.\n  We also know the President would sign this bill, and we know the \nPresident would not sign the House bill as is. So we have an \nopportunity by moving forward with this bill.\n  I want to remind my colleagues of efforts made to negotiate an \nagreement on this bill. Before the bill came to the floor in July, and \nwhile the Senate was considering it, there were numerous meetings every \nday by a dozen or more Senators. The authors of the bill met with \nSenators McCain, Chambliss, Hutchison, the sponsors of the SECURE IT \nAct, as well as Senators Kyl and Whitehouse, and a group they convened. \nWe had multiple meetings with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The \nChamber's largest concern with Title VII on information sharing was \nover the liability protections in our bill--which is what the \nIntelligence Committee staff worked on and prepared.\n  I asked the Chamber where they thought our language was deficient. I \nasked them if they could improve on the immunity provisions, to please \nsend us bill language. Did they? No. They did not. I think that is some \ntestimony that is worth thinking about.\n\n  Over the summer, the majority leader offered to vote on a set list of \namendments. He asked if the minority could put together the 10 votes it \nwanted, and as long as they were relevant and germane to the bill, we \nwould consider them. No list was provided. So we voted, and by a vote \nof 52 to 46, cloture was not invoked.\n  Again, after the vote, the staff from both sides of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the Intelligence \nCommittee held numerous meetings to negotiate a compromise. The effort \ndid not succeed. So if we are to address the major problem of cyber \nattacks and potential cyber warfare, we have no option but to bring the \nLieberman-Collins bill back on the floor.\n  I know my time is limited here today. And I know the Nation's cyber \nlaws are woefully out of date. Let me touch on one more thing regarding \nthe information sharing part of the bill. I received a call from a CEO \nof a high-tech company about the homeland security portal or exchange, \nas we call it in the bill. That CEO said, We would like our information \nto go directly into the Department of Defense. Let me note that would \ncreate a big problem. It created a problem with a number of U.S. \nSenators who are concerned about the military getting this kind of \ncyber information. And it created a big concern with the privacy \norganizations throughout our country. So it was changed so that the \nportal would be run most likely by Homeland Security. But here is the \npoint I wish to make. The transfer of cyber information is with the \nclick of a mouse. It moves instantaneously, so that as information----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So as information comes in, it goes instantaneously \ninto the correct area. The CEO who called me said, I didn't know that. \nThank you. I have no problem with that.\n  So I would ask my colleagues who have voted against this bill to \nreconsider. We are never going to do the perfect bill. The bills are \ngoing to have to be changed and amended as time goes on. But I think \npassing a bill is important. I think to leave this country vulnerable, \nnot to pass a bill because somebody doesn't like this part or that \npart, is negligent, it is irresponsible, and God forbid if we have that \nmajor cyber Pearl Harbor that Secretary Panetta referred to in his \nspeech. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.\n  I thank the Chair for the extra time, yield the floor and ask that my \nremaining remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Let me describe what the information sharing title does \n     specifically.\n       First, title VII explicitly authorizes companies to search \n     for cybersecurity threats on their own networks and to take \n     appropriate actions to defend their networks against these \n     threats.\n       Many companies monitor and defend their own networks today, \n     in order to protect themselves and their customers.\n       But we have heard from numerous companies that the law in \n     this area is unclear, and that sometimes it is less risky, \n     from a liability perspective, to just hope attacks don't \n     happen than to take additional steps to defend themselves.\n       So this bill will make the law crystal clear by giving \n     companies explicit authority to monitor and defend their own \n     networks.\n       Second, the bill clearly authorizes private companies to \n     share cyber threat information with each other.\n       There have been concerns that antitrust laws or other \n     statutes prevent companies from cooperating on cyber defense. \n     This bill, section 702, clearly says: ``notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, any private entity may disclose \n     lawfully obtained cybersecurity threat indicators to any \n     other private entity in accordance with this section.''\n       Third, the bill authorizes the government--which will \n     largely mean, in practice, the intelligence community--to \n     share classified information about cyber threats with \n     appropriately cleared organizations, such as companies, \n     outside of the government.\n       Today, only government employees and contractors are \n     eligible to receive security clearances and therefore gain \n     access to national secrets. To put it another way, those with \n     a valid ``need to know'' national security secrets are \n     usually within the government or working for the government.\n       That isn't true for cyber security. The companies that \n     underpin our Nation's economy and way of life have a ``need \n     to know'' about the nature of cyber attacks so they can \n     better secure their systems.\n       So under this bill, companies able to qualify to receive \n     classified information will be certified and then be able to \n     obtain classified information about what cyber threats to \n     look out for.\n       Fourth, the bill establishes a system for any private \n     sector entity--whether a power utility, a defense contractor, \n     a telecom company, or others--to share cyber threat \n     information with the government.\n       This is the piece that General Alexander--the Director of \n     the National Security Agency and the Commander of U.S. Cyber \n     Command--says is absolutely necessary for the protection of \n     the United States.\n       Here is how the provision works:\n       The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with \n     the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, and the \n     Director of National Intelligence, would designate a federal \n     cybersecurity exchange. This would be an office or center \n     that already exists, and already shares and receives cyber \n     threat information.\n       Private companies would share cyber threat information with \n     the exchange directly. The exchange must be a civilian \n     entity; I expect it would be within the Department of \n     Homeland Security.\n       Let me stop there. Why not have this portal or exchange be \n     in the military or the NSA? There are two reasons:\n\n[[Page S6778]]\n\n       First, we are talking here about the protection of the \n     government's network--the dot.gov network--and the computer \n     systems outside of the government. We are not talking about \n     protecting the dot.mil network and the Department of Defense, \n     and we are not talking about actions that the military takes \n     overseas. Protection of the private sector--of the electrical \n     grid or Wall Street--is simply not the military's or NSA's \n     responsibility.\n       Second, there is, for good reason, major concern among \n     privacy advocates not to have private sector information, \n     which could include Americans' banking records, or email \n     traffic, or health care records, being shared by companies \n     with the military or intelligence community.\n       In drafting this bill, we heard from several Senators for \n     whom having a military exchange was a complete non-starter. \n     We worked with Senators Durbin, Franken, Coons, Akaka, \n     Blumenthal, and Sanders, and others to craft this language \n     putting a civilian entity in the lead.\n       General Keith Alexander, the Director of the National \n     Security Agency, also supports this model. He wrote, in his \n     July 31 letter to Senator Reid: ``The American people must \n     have confidence that threat information is being shared \n     appropriately and in the most transparent way possible. \n     That is why I support information to be shared through a \n     civilian entity, with real-time, rule-based sharing of \n     cyber security threat indicators with all relevant Federal \n     partners.'' General Alexander is the top military and \n     intelligence official on cyber saying that he supports a \n     civilian exchange.\n       So we have the Federal exchange. Companies will use the \n     exchange, as a portal and information will be sent \n     automatically and instantaneously to other parts of the \n     government. This is what General Alexander was describing.\n       This part is critical. We are not talking about information \n     going to an office in the Department of Homeland Security and \n     waiting for someone to look at it and figure out whether to \n     share it and with whom.\n       This is an automatic, instantaneous process. Information \n     comes in and is automatically shared with other departments \n     and agencies.\n       The bill requires that procedures be put in place so that \n     information is shared in real-time. This has to be done \n     automatically, so that cyber defense systems can move to \n     identify and disrupt a cyber attack as it is coming over the \n     networks.\n       I discussed this recently with a CEO of a high-tech \n     company. He was concerned that information wouldn't reach the \n     Department of Defense. I explained that our bill would \n     provide instantaneous sharing to DOD. He said that would \n     satisfy his concerns. So this is a major point.\n       Having a single focal point is also more efficient for the \n     government. It will help eliminate stovepipes because right \n     now there are dozens of different parts of the government \n     receiving information from the private sector about the cyber \n     threats they are encountering, and no one agency has the \n     responsibility to ensure the information is shared with other \n     parts of the government.\n       It would also make privacy and civil liberties oversight \n     easier, as I will describe in a moment. Finally, it should \n     save tax payers money, because it is more efficient to manage \n     and oversee the operation of one designated cybersecurity \n     exchange versus a half dozen or more parts of the government.\n       Now let me describe the liability protections, because that \n     is a critical part of title VII.\n       Section 706 of the bill provides liability protection for \n     the voluntary sharing of cyber threat information with the \n     federal cybersecurity exchange.\n       The bill reads: ``no civil or criminal cause of action \n     shall lie or be maintained in any Federal or State court \n     against any entity [meaning a company] acting as authorized \n     by this title, and any such action shall be dismissed \n     promptly for . . . the voluntary disclosure of a lawfully \n     obtained cybersecurity threat indicator to a cybersecurity \n     exchange.''\n       In other words, a company is immune from lawsuit if it \n     shares cyber threat information with a Federal exchange.\n       The same immunity applies to:\n       Companies who monitor their own networks;\n       Cybersecurity companies who share threat information with \n     their customers;\n       Companies that share information with a critical \n     infrastructure owner or operator; or\n       Companies who share threat information with other \n     companies, as long as they also share that information with \n     the Federal cybersecurity exchange within a reasonable time.\n       If a company shared information in a way other than the \n     five ways I just mentioned, it still receives a legal defense \n     under this bill from suit if the company can make a \n     reasonable good faith showing that the information sharing \n     provisions permitted that sharing.\n       Further, no civil or criminal cause of action can be \n     brought against a company or an officer, employee, or agency \n     of a company for the reasonable failure to act on information \n     received through the information sharing mechanisms set up by \n     this bill.\n       Basically, the only way that anyone participating in the \n     information sharing system can be held liable is if they are \n     found to have knowingly violated a provision of the bill or \n     acted in gross negligence.\n       So there are very strong liability protections in this bill \n     for anyone that shares information about cyber threats--which \n     is completely voluntarily.\n       In addition to narrowly defining what information can be \n     shared with an exchange, our bill also requires the Federal \n     government to adopt a very robust privacy and civil liberties \n     oversight regime for information shared under this title. \n     There are multiple layers of oversight from different parts \n     of the executive branch, including the Department of Justice \n     and the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \n     Board, as well as the Congress.\n       Consider this: In October, General Alexander--the Director \n     of the NSA--and Anthony Romero, the Executive Director of the \n     ACLU, spoke together on a cybersecurity roundtable at the \n     Woodrow Wilson Center. General Alexander praised title VII's \n     approach to information sharing, and Mr. Romero said ``I \n     think it strikes the right balance.'' It is not often that \n     the Director of the NSA and the Executive Director of the \n     ACLU agree on legislation. If they can, I would hope that the \n     Senate can come together as well.\n       The time to act is now. The cyber threat we face is real, \n     it is serious, and it is growing. The country is vulnerable, \n     and this legislation is essential. I urge my colleagues to \n     support the motion to proceed and to support the bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Senator Grassley, who is scheduled to speak next, has \nbeen kind to give me 45 seconds, so I appreciate that.\n  In July and August, the cosponsors of both the underlying bill, the \nLieberman-Collins bill, and the SECURE IT bill, of which I am a \ncosponsor, met regularly, and I was hopeful we could resolve the \nsignificant differences between these two bills. Unfortunately, we did \nnot reach an agreement, and even though we had been promised an open \namendment process on this underlying bill, the majority leader once \nagain filled the tree and filed cloture. Unfortunately, nothing has \nchanged since then, so I am compelled to do the same thing today.\n  We all understand the serious threat that is facing our country from \ncyber attacks and intrusions, but that does not mean Congress should \njust pass any bill. Frankly, the underlying bill is not supported by \nthe business community, for all the right reasons, and they are the \nones who are impacted by it. They are the ones who are going to be \ncalled on to comply with the mandates and the regulations. Frankly, it \nis not going to give them the kind of protection they need from cyber \nattacks.\n  So I regret to have to stand up today and say that I intend to vote \nagainst cloture on this bill, and I yield to Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are again discussing the important \ntopic of cybersecurity--a topic we all agree is of the utmost \nimportance and worthy of our attention. Unfortunately, this is like the \nmovie ``Groundhog Day.'' The majority continues to push the same flawed \nlegislation that failed to garner enough votes for consideration just \nthree months ago.\n  No one disputes the need for Congress to address cybersecurity.\n  However, Members do disagree with the notion this problem requires \nlegislation that increases the size of the Federal Government \nbureaucracy and places new burdens and regulation on businesses.\n  Enhancing cybersecurity is important to our national security. I \nsupport efforts to strengthen our Nation against cyber attacks.\n  However, I take issue with those who have come to the floor and \nargued that those who don't support this bill are against strengthening \nour Nation's cybersecurity.\n  As I said in August, disagreements over how to address policy matters \nshouldn't devolve into accusations about a Member's willingness to \ntackle tough issues.\n  The debate over cybersecurity legislation has turned from a \nsubstantive analysis of the merits into a political blame game as to \nwhich side supports defending our Nation more.\n  If we want to tackle big issues such as cybersecurity, we need to \nrise above disagreements and work in a constructive manner. \nDisagreements over policy should be openly and freely debated.\n  Unfortunately, this isn't how the debate on cybersecurity proceeded. \nInstead, before a real debate began last August, the majority cut it \noff.\n  This was contrary to the majority's promise earlier this year of an \nopen\n\n[[Page S6779]]\n\namendment process to address cybersecurity.\n  Aside from process, I also have significant substantive concerns with \nthe bill. Chief among my concerns with the pending bill is the role \nplayed by the Department of Homeland Security. These concerns stem from \noversight I have conducted on its implementation of the Chemical \nFacility Anti-Terrorism Standards, or the CFATS program.\n  CFATS was the Department's first major foray into regulation of the \nchemical sector. DHS spent nearly $500 million on the program. Five \nyears later, they have just begun to approve site security plans for \nthe more than 4,000 facilities designated under the rule.\n  I have continued to conduct oversight on this matter. Despite \nassurances from DHS that they have fixed all the problems with CFATS, I \nkeep discovering more problems.\n  On top of this concern, since the last vote in August, the chairman \nand ranking member of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations have released a report criticizing DHS and the fusion \ncenters they operate. The subcommittee report criticized DHS's fusion \ncenters as ``pools of ineptitude, waste, and civil liberties \nintrusions.''\n  And that is the evaluation after DHS spent as much as $1.4 billion on \nthis program.\n  Given these examples, I am baffled why the Senate would take an \nagency that has proven problems with overseeing critical infrastructure \nand give them chief responsibility for our country's cybersecurity.\n  Additionally, I am concerned with provisions that restrict the way \ninformation is shared.\n  The restrictions imposed under title VII of this bill are a step \nbackward from other information-sharing proposals. This includes the \nbill I have co-sponsored, the SECURE IT bill.\n  The bill before us places DHS in the role of gatekeeper of cyber \nthreat information. The bill calls for DHS to share the information in \n``as close to real time as possible'' with other agencies. However, \nthis will create a bottleneck for information coming into the \ngovernment.\n  Further, title VII includes restrictions on what types of information \ncan be shared, limiting the use of it for criminal prosecutions except \nthose that cause imminent harm.\n  This is exactly the type of restriction on information sharing that \nthe 9/11 Commission warned about.\n  In fact, the 9/11 Commission said, ``the [wall] resulted in far less \ninformation sharing and coordination.'' The Commission further added, \n``the removal of the wall that existed before 9/11 between intelligence \nand law enforcement has opened up new opportunities for cooperative \naction.''\n  Why would we even consider legislation that could rebuild these walls \nthat threaten our national security?\n  We haven't had any real debate on these issues. The lack of a real \nprocess in the Senate on this current bill amplifies my substantive \nconcerns.\n  In fact, this is eerily reminiscent of the debate surrounding \nObamaCare.\n  Here we are once again, in a lame duck session the week before \nThanksgiving, tackling a serious problem that hasn't been given the \nbenefit of the Senate's full process.\n  I don't want cybersecurity legislation to become another ObamaCare. \nIf we are serious about our Nation's security, then shouldn't we treat \nit as such?\n  Additionally, the staff of the sponsors of the legislation before us \ncontinue behind-the-scenes efforts to negotiate changes to the bill we \nare being asked to vote on. If the bill sponsors are still negotiating \nchanges, why don't we have the benefit of a full and open amendment \nprocess to try and fix it before we vote for cloture? It simply doesn't \nmake sense.\n  Instead, it appears today's vote is about something other than \ncybersecurity. It is yet another attempt by the majority to paint the \nminority as obstructing the work of the Senate. Most likely, this vote \nwill be used simply as fuel for the majority's effort to dismantle the \nfilibuster. So much for tackling cybersecurity without putting politics \ninto the mix.\n  This isn't the way we are supposed to legislate. The people who \nelected us expect more.\n  How many Senators are prepared to vote on something this important, \nwithout knowing its impact because we haven't followed regular order? \nAre we to once again pass a bill so that the American public can then \nread it and find out what is in it?\n  These are questions that all Senators should consider. And our \ncitizens should know in advance what we are actually considering.\n  If we are serious about addressing this problem, then let's deal with \nit appropriately.\n  Rushing something through that will impact the country in such a \nmassive way isn't the way we should do business.\n  It is not good for the country and it is not good for this body.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to support the \nCybersecurity Act of 2012. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I \nknow that cyber security is the most pressing economic and national \nsecurity threat facing our country.\n  There still needs to be a sense of urgency in addressing this issue, \nand we must pass this legislation. Doing so will allow us to defend our \ncomputer networks and critical infrastructure from a hostile, predatory \nattack. Such an attack is meant to humiliate, intimidate, and cripple \nus. If we wait until a major attack occurs, we will likely end up over-\nreacting, over-regulating, and overspending in order to address our \nweakness.\n  The threat of a cyber attack is real. Our Nation is already under \nattack. We are in a cyber war, and cyber attacks are happening every \nday. Cyber terrorists are working to damage critical infrastructure \nthrough efforts to take over the power grid or disrupt our air traffic \ncontrol systems. Those carrying out these attacks are moving at \nbreakneck speeds to steal state secrets and our Nation's intellectual \nproperty. They are stealing financial information and disrupting \nbusiness operations.\n  Cyber attacks can disrupt critical infrastructure, wipe out a \nfamily's entire life savings, and put human lives at risk. They can \ntake down entire companies by hacking into computer networks where they \nremain undiscovered for months, even years.\n  FBI Director Mueller testified before the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, stating that cyber crime will eventually surpass terrorism \nas the No. 1 threat to America. The economic losses of cyber crime \nalone are stunning. A Norton Cybercrime Report valued losses from cyber \nattacks at $388 billion in 2011.\n  I have been working on cyber issues since I was elected to the \nSenate. The National Security Agency--our cyber warriors--are in \nMaryland. I have been working with the NSA to ensure that signals \nintelligence is a focus of our national security even before cyber was \na method of warfare.\n  In 2007, Estonia was attacked. Estonia was strengthening its ties to \nNATO, and Russian hackers swiftly struck back. They waged war on \nEstonia and threatened its government, rendered Estonia's networks \nobsolete for days. This attack was designed to intimidate, manipulate, \nand distort.\n  The cyber attacks on Estonia raised important questions. Would \narticle 5 of the NATO Charter be invoked? Since the attack was on one \nmember of NATO--was it an attack on all members? How would the U.S. and \nother allies need respond to future attacks? What would happen if \nAmerica experienced a similar cyber attack?\n  As member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I served on the Cyber \nWorking Group where we developed core findings to guide Congress. The \nneed to get governance right, the need to protect civil liberties, and \nthe need to improve the cyber workforce.\n  As chair of the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I fund critical cyber security agencies: the FBI which \ninvestigates cyber crime, NIST, which works with the private sector to \ndevelop standards for cyber security technology, and NSF, which does \nresearch.\n  As a member of Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I work to ensure \ncritical funding for Intel and cyber agencies such as the NSA, CIA, and \nIARPA. These organizations are coming up with the new ideas that will \ncreate jobs and keep our country safe.\n\n[[Page S6780]]\n\nFunding is critical to build the workforce, provide technology and \nresources, and to make our cyber security smarter, safer, and more \nsecure.\n  Yet technology will mean nothing unless we have a trained workforce. \nIn order to fight the cyber security war, we have to maintain our \ntechnological development, maintain our qualitative advantage, and have \nour cyber warriors ready at battle stations. In order to develop our \ncyber shield, we need to train cyber warriors so they can protect our \nNation. I have been working with Maryland colleges and universities to \ncreate world-class programs, a national model, and for training our \nnext generation of cyber warriors.\n  I asked Senator Reid to conduct a cyber security exercise, which \nshowed us in real time how the U.S. Government would respond to a \npredatory cyber attack of great magnitude. I asked for the Senate cyber \nexercise for three reasons. First, we need a sense of urgency here in \nthe Senate to pass cyber security legislation. Second, we need to put \nthe proper legislative policy in place. Third, I wanted to create a \nsense of bipartisanship camaraderie.\n  One example of the impact a cyber attack would have is the power \noutages caused by our freak storms this summer. We got a glimpse of \nwhat an attack on the grid would be like. At least Pepco has the \nability to respond and restore and turn the power back on. With an \nattack on the grid we could lose the power to turn electricity back on \nbecause it was shut down by power manipulation. Imagine our largest \ncities, like New York and Washington, like the Wild West with no power, \nschools shut down, parents stuck in traffic, public transit crippled, \nno traffic lights, and 9-1-1 systems failing.\n  In the financial industry, the FBI currently has 7,600 pending bank \nrobbery cases and over 9,000 pending cyber investigations. According to \nthe FBI, the Bureau is currently investigating over 400 reported cases \nof corporate account takeovers where cyber criminals have made \nunauthorized transfers from the bank accounts of U.S. businesses. These \ncases involve the attempted theft of over $255 million and actual \nlosses of approximately $85 million.\n  Hackers have repeatedly penetrated the computer network of the \ncompany that runs the Nasdaq Stock Market. The New York Stock Exchange \nhas been the target of cyber attacks. In the future, successful \nattempts to shut down or steal information from our financial exchanges \ncould wreak havoc of untold proportions on our economy.\n  In the 2010 ``flash crash'', the Dow Jones plunged 1,000 points in \nmatter of minutes when automatic computerized traders shut down. This \nwas the result of turbulent trading, not a cyber attack and the market \nrecovered. But this is a micro-example of what could happen if stock \nmarket computers are hacked, infected, or go dark.\n\n  In November 2008 the American credit card processor RBS Worldpay was \nhacked--$9 million was stolen in less than 12 hours. The hackers broke \ninto accounts and changed limits on payroll debit cards employees use \nto withdraw their salaries from ATMs. The cards were used at over 2,100 \nATMs in at least 280 cities around the world, United States, Russia, \nUkraine, Estonia, Italy, Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, stealing over $9 \nmillion from unsuspecting employers and employees.\n  This heist, one of the most sophisticated and organized computer \nfraud attacks ever conducted proves that you don't need a visa to steal \nsomeone's visa card.\n  From 2008 to 2010, a Slovenian citizen created ``Butterfly Bot'' and \nsold it to other criminals worldwide. Cyber criminals developed \nnetworks of infected computers. The Mariposa variety from Spain was the \nmost notorious and largest. Mariposa infected personal computers, stole \ncredit card and bank account information, launched denial attacks to \nshut down online services, and spread viruses to disable computers and \nnetworks.\n  Industry experts estimated the Mariposa Botnet may have infected as \nmany as 8 million to 12 million computers. The size and scope of the \ninfection makes it difficult to quantify financial losses but could \neasily be tens of millions of dollars.\n  Speaking simply, this bill does two key things from a national \nsecurity perspective. It helps businesses voluntarily get cyber \nstandards that they can use to protect themselves, and it allows \nbusinesses and the government to share information with each other \nabout cyber threats. That is, to help ``.gov'' to protect ``.com.''\n  In a constitutional manner, these two things are not necessarily \nconnected, but they can be. The reason why these provisions are such an \ninnovation is that despite all the amazing talent and expertise that \ncompanies have, many are being attacked and don't know it. And this \nlegislative framework gives the structure to allow for unprecedented \n``.com'' and ``.gov'' cooperation.\n  There are also other several other key components in the bill \nfocusing on research and development, workforce development, and FISMA \nreform.\n  Why do we need a bill to make some of these vital partnerships and \nexchanges happen?\n  Because, as I have outlined, America is under attack every second of \nevery day. General Alexander, the head of NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, \nhas said that we have witnessed the greatest transfer of wealth in \nhistory in the heist that foreign actors have perpetrated on our \ncountry. By stealing our secrets, stealing our intellectual property, \nand stealing our wealth. It is mindboggling. Take just one example. A \ntheft by a foreign actor that took, among other things, key plans for \nour F-35 fighter. One attack on the Pentagon made off with so many \nsensitive documents that they would have filled delivery trucks end-to-\nend stretching from Washington, DC to Baltimore Harbor.\n  But don't take my word for it that this issue is urgent and that we \nneed to address critical infrastructure. Who else says it is urgent? \nExperts from both side of the aisle do. Folks like former CIA Director \nMike McConnell, DHS head Michael Chertoff, Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff James Cartwright, former cyber czar Richard Clarke, and \nmany others have said we need to address critical infrastructure.\n  And our top defense and military leaders such as Defense Secretary \nLeon Panetta, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dempsey, Director \nof National Intelligence Clapper, and again, GEN Keith Alexander. The \nthreat is here and it is now. And if we do not act, if we let the \nperfect be the enemy of the good, then this country will be more \nvulnerable than ever before, and Congress will have done nothing.\n  This bill is not perfect, but I want to say upfront that Senators \nLieberman and Collins have heard the critics and tried to incorporate \ntheir views. DHS's role has been criticized by many, myself included. I \nhave been skeptical that they could perform some of the duties assigned \nin this bill.\n  To be honest, I still am skeptical, although less so than before, but \nI think this bill takes important steps to diversify the government and \nprivate sector actors involved. So we are not just focusing on DHS, but \nalso the right civilian agencies in charge because in the end we cannot \nhave intelligence agencies leading this effort with the private sector. \nSome would like to see that go further, and that is what the amendment \nprocess is there for.\n  We have had people in the civil liberties community worried about \nwhether this bill could allow intrusions by the government into \npeople's privacy. As a Marylander, this was a tantamount concern for me \nas well. If we don't protect our civil liberties, then all this added \nsecurity is for naught because we would have lost what we value most, \nour freedom.\n  Again, I think the authors of this bill, especially Senator \nFeinstein, have made key improvements on issues of law enforcement \npowers and protecting core privacy concerns. I know not everyone is \ntotally pleased. But I think this bill has made important strides to \nbalance information sharing and privacy.\n  We all have been concerned that the business community has opposed a \nlot of key critical infrastructure elements of this bill. They fear \nstrangulation and over-regulation. They fear that they will open \nthemselves up to lawsuits if they participate in the program with the \ngovernment. These are valid concerns, and I have heard them from \nMaryland businesses. I think this new bill has made the most strides in \ntrying to accommodate business and\n\n[[Page S6781]]\n\nbuilding a voluntary framework to allow businesses to choose \nprotection.\n  Protection does not come without responsibility for participants, but \nI think this bill links the need for cyber security with appropriate \nliability protection and the expertise of our business community in a \nway that answers a lot of companies' concerns. We cannot eliminate all \ngovernment involvement in this issue. That won't work. And we will lose \nkey government expertise in DOD, FBI, and elsewhere. But we work to try \nto minimize it while maintaining government's role in protecting our \nnational security.\n  I am so proud that the Senate came together in a bipartisan way to \ndraft this legislation. The Senate must pass this legislation now. \nWorking together we can make our Nation safer and stronger and we can \nshow the American people that we can cooperate to get an important job \ndone.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, for 4 years, we have been pushing the \nUnited States Senate to pass a bill to improve our Nation's \ncybersecurity. During this time, the cybersecurity threat to our \ncountry--to our way of life--has only grown. We have now seen cyber \nattacks against our Nation's pipelines, against our financial industry, \nand even against nuclear power plants.\n  The good news is we have not yet suffered a devastating cyber attack. \nAt this point, we are still only talking about the potential impacts. \nWe have not yet suffered an attack that greatly disrupts our financial \nindustry, or an attack that cripples our electric grid. But these \npotential outcomes are real. And it is imperative that we begin \naddressing the risks.\n  Today, we have the opportunity to begin this important work by moving \nforward with the Cybersecurity Act of 2012. We have the opportunity to \nshow the American people that we can rise above politics to do the job \nthat they expect of us.\n  National security is one of our most sacred obligations as Members of \nthis body. If a vote on cybersecurity fails today, we will have failed \nto meet that obligation for the 112th Congress.\n  I will be the first person to admit that this bill is not perfect. I \nhave been clear that I believe a regulatory approach was the best \napproach to ensure that our country's most critical infrastructure \naddresses its cybersecurity vulnerabilities. We moved to a voluntary \napproach to seek a compromise. Yet it was not enough for some of our \ncolleagues. Frankly, I do not understand why.\n  I know the Chamber of Commerce decided that it did not like this \nbill. But sometimes we need to make decisions that the Chamber of \nCommerce is not happy with. Because it is not the Chamber's job to \nworry about national security. That is the job of our military. And \nthey have been quite clear about what is needed. They have told us that \nthey need this legislation. They have implored us to act. General \nAlexander, the Director of the National Security Agency, knows what is \nat stake. And his warnings have been dire.\n  He has said: ``The cyber threat facing the Nation is real and demands \nimmediate action.''\n  He has said: ``the time to act is now.''\n  General Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote me \na letter earlier this year about the urgent need for comprehensive \ncybersecurity legislation. In the letter, he explained that our: \n``adversaries will increasingly attempt to hold our Nation's core \ncritical infrastructure at risk.''\n  He stated that: ``we cannot afford to leave our electricity grid and \ntransportation system vulnerable to attack.''\n  Both Generals agreed that we must do something and they both pushed \nthe Senate to adopt comprehensive cybersecurity legislation that tracks \nthe specifics of the bill we have been debating. Despite this urgent \nadvice from our nation's top military advisors, that we need to act and \nthat we need to do it now, some Senators suggested in August that we \nneeded more time to debate cybersecurity. I strongly disagreed with \nthis notion. But now we have had another few months to think about this \nbill. Today, there is simply no more reason for delay.\n  We passed a Cybersecurity bill out of the Commerce Committee in March \n2010. And it passed unanimously. The Homeland Security Committee, led \nby Senators Lieberman and Collins, passed their cybersecurity bill by a \nvoice vote in June 2010. The bills both went through Committees well \nover 2 years ago. Since that time, we have had hundreds of meetings \nwith the private sector, interest groups, and national security \nexperts. Senators have received multiple classified briefings about the \nnature of this threat. Everyone has had plenty of time to think about \nthis issue. And we have made it quite clear that we are looking to \ncompromise on this legislation. But to compromise you need a partner. I \nam hoping that our Republican colleagues are now willing to be our \npartners on this legislation.\n  I hope that my colleagues will reconsider the path we are on. At some \npoint, if we do not do anything, there will be a major cyber attack and \nit will do great damage to the United States. After it is over, the \nAmerican people will ask, just as they asked after 9/11, what could we \nhave done to stop this?\n  If we do not pass this legislation, they will learn about days like \nthis one and their disappointment in us and the United States Senate \nwill grow. And we will deserve their disappointment. Because we have \nhad the opportunity to act and we have failed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you. Are there other speakers on our side? Let \nme ask the Chair to notify me when there is 10 minutes left in case \nSenator Collins comes or someone else. So I would like to have up to 10 \nminutes and be notified.\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak against revoting this cloture motion, \nand the main reason is that we are not going to be allowed to have \namendments. That is unacceptable because although we have worked \ndiligently with the sponsors of the cyber security bill on the floor, a \nnumber of the ranking members of the relevant committees that have \njurisdiction over cyber security have an alternative bill, the SECURE \nIT Act, that we would like to be able to put forward as an alternative \nor have an amendment process that would allow our approach to have a \nchance to prevail anyway.\n  Now, we are aware that the President is signaling his intention to \nissue an Executive Order, but an Executive Order is not sufficient to \nreally give the encouragement and the protection to the companies to \nallow them to share information with other companies that might have \nthe same types of threats in the same industry area or with the Federal \nGovernment. I am sorry we are not going to be able to have amendments \nthat would allow us to perfect this bill.\n  Let me say that the proponents of S. 3414 acknowledge that it is \nimportant to have a collaborative effort between the businesses that \nrun almost 90 percent of our Nation's critical infrastructure and the \nFederal Government. We agree with that, which is why we have worked \nwith the companies that run the private networks to fashion a bill that \nwould give them immunity if they share information and give them the \ndirect sharing capabilities to go directly to the defense agencies \nbecause we believe the agencies that work with the communications and \nthe military industrial base companies would have more of an \nunderstanding of the needs and what can be done to employ \ncountermeasures in a direct way. The bill that is on the floor, \nhowever, requires everything to go through the Homeland Security \nDepartment, and those of us who are supporting SECURE IT believe there \nshould be the ability to direction share information with other \nagencies including the defense agencies.\n  The sponsors of our bill are the ranking members of eight committees \nand subcommittees that have jurisdiction in this area: Senators McCain, \nChambliss, Grassley, Murkowski, Coats, Burr, Johnson, myself and \nMinority Leader McConnell. We believe the consensus items in our bill \nare preferable to the bill that is before us that we are not going to \nbe allowed to amend.\n  SECURE IT offers a balanced approach that will significantly advance \ncyber security in both the public and private sectors--first, to \nfacilitate\n\n[[Page S6782]]\n\nsharing of cyber threat information between the private sector and \ngovernment, allowing the information to go to the defense agencies \nwhere the response can be direct, not filtered through Homeland \nSecurity. Secondly, it gives immunity from liability for sharing among \nthe industries that might be affected as well as the defensive actions \nthat are taken. This is essential because you even need antitrust \nprotection if you are going to share vital information on this issue so \nthat you are not going to get sued for collaborating with a competitor. \nIt is in our country's interest, and I think our private sector \ncompanies want the ability to help secure all of our networks because \nwe know this is a real threat.\n  Secure IT has the overwhelming support of the network operators that \nare trying to gear up to defend against cyber threats. Because it will \nhelp their members protect their networks, we have the endorsement of \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce dated November 14 of this \nyear.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2012.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and \n     region, continues to have serious concerns with S. 3414, the \n     ``Cybersecurity Act of 2012,'' including the related \n     manager's amendment, which was debated in the Senate before \n     the August recess.\n       The Chamber believes that Congress should approve a \n     workable cybersecurity bill focused on information sharing. \n     The waning days of a lame-duck session are hardly the \n     appropriate place to address the fundamental flaws in a bill \n     that remain unresolved since it was last on the Senate floor. \n     The underlying issues are simply too crucial to our economy \n     for treatment in a rushed legislative product.\n       First, there is a healthy and robust disagreement about the \n     proper role of government in regulating the business \n     community--given the incredibly dynamic nature of \n     cybersecurity risks--that is far from resolved. Title I of S. \n     3414 would create a National Cybersecurity Council that would \n     give federal departments and agencies overwhelming authority \n     over what actions businesses could take to protect their \n     computers and information systems.\n       Critical infrastructure owners and operators are concerned \n     that core threats to enterprise cybersecurity--including \n     nation states or their proxies, organized criminals, and \n     other nefarious actors--could go unchallenged because they \n     would be compelled to redirect resources toward meeting \n     government mandates. Indeed, any cybersecurity program must \n     afford businesses maximum input and flexibility with respect \n     to implementing best cybersecurity practices.\n       In addition, insufficient attention has been paid to the \n     likelihood of creating a well-intended program that, in \n     practice, becomes slow, bureaucratic, and costly. An \n     ineffective program would tie businesses in red tape but \n     would do little to deter bad actors. Businesses do not have \n     unlimited capital and human talent to devote to regulatory \n     regimes that are inadequately managed or out of date as soon \n     as they are written.\n       Second, the Chamber agrees with most lawmakers that federal \n     legislation is needed to cause a sea change in the current \n     information-sharing practices between the public and private \n     sectors. Title VII of the bill would actually impede the \n     sharing of information between business and government. The \n     bill's framework and strict definition of cyber threat \n     information would erect, not bring down, barriers to \n     productive information sharing.\n       Third, the liability ``protection'' provisions throughout \n     the bill need to be further clarified and strengthened. \n     Private-sector entities should be fully protected against \n     liability if they ``voluntarily'' adopt a federally directed \n     cybersecurity program and suffer a cyber incident. Strong \n     liability protections are essential to spur businesses to \n     share threat data with their peers and government partners.\n       Fourth, the ``Marketplace Information'' provision of S. \n     3414 seems intended to compel businesses that suffer from a \n     cybersecurity event to publicly disclose the occurrence. This \n     section of the bill would essentially ``name-and-shame'' \n     companies and could compromise their security. The Chamber \n     strongly rejects disclosing businesses' sensitive security \n     information publicly, and draws your attention to a June 2011 \n     letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the \n     Senate where the agency stated that investors have not asked \n     for more disclosure in this area.\n       Finally, the bill has not been scored, making the cost of \n     the bill unknown to lawmakers and to the public.\n       These are some of the Chamber's high-level concerns with S. \n     3414. The Chamber and our members have invested considerable \n     time and energy working with lawmakers to develop smart and \n     effective cybersecurity legislation. The business community \n     is fully prepared to work with Congress and the \n     Administration to advance efforts that would truly help \n     business owners and operators counter advanced and \n     increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.\n       Cybersecurity is a pressing issue that the Chamber remains \n     committed to addressing in a constructive way. Moving a \n     large, problematic bill within a short legislative timeframe \n     would not lay the necessary groundwork to help businesses \n     deflect or defeat novel and highly adaptive cyber threats. \n     Any new legislative program must foster timely and actionable \n     information, be dynamic in its execution, and promote \n     innovation in order to increase collective cybersecurity and \n     allow electronic commerce to grow.\n       The Chamber recognizes the leadership of the sponsors and \n     cosponsors of the bill on cybersecurity. We appreciate the \n     degree to which they have listened to the concerns of the \n     Chamber and the broader business community, and have sought \n     to address them in whole or in part. This legislation came \n     directly to the floor for consideration without proceeding \n     through regular order. Legislative hearings and a committee \n     mark-up of the bill would have properly allowed Senators who \n     have concerns with the bill to question experts and offer \n     amendments in order to improve the bill before a Senate floor \n     debate.\n       The Chamber appreciates the steps that the Administration \n     has taken to engage the Chamber on cybersecurity. Despite all \n     this engagement, and despite the best intentions of the \n     sponsors of S. 3414, it would be ill-advised to craft a \n     cybersecurity bill on the Senate floor during a lame-duck \n     session.\n       The Chamber strongly opposes S. 3414, the ``Cybersecurity \n     Act of 2012,'' and may consider including votes on, or in \n     relation to S. 3414 in our annual How They Voted scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                                               Government Affairs.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. We also have the endorsement of the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the American Fuel & Petrochemical \nManufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, US Telecom, the \nNational Retail Federation, Financial Services Roundtable, the Internet \nSecurity Alliance, and CTIA The Wireless Association.\n  We can come together to pass the areas of SECURE IT that would allow \nbetter cooperation and also an information sharing relationship that \nthey understand and know will help them defend against the cyber \nattacks. We believe SECURE IT is a superior bill, and we would like the \nability to amend the bill that is on the floor to perfect it so we \ncould send a bill to the House.\n  If we are not able to get this bill this year, certainly I hope it \nwill be started again with all of the relevant committees doing the \nmarkups, doing the discussion that is required for a bill of this \nmagnitude. Many of the committees did not have markups. They did not \nhave input into the bill. The committee process does work when we are \nable to use it, and I hope we will be able to go back to the drawing \nboard, or if the majority would allow amendments down the road, if we \nhave the time later this year, we would love to continue working with \nthe sponsors of the legislation to see if we could come up with the \namendments to which everyone could agree.\n  It has been a tough road. We have all tried hard. I think the \nsponsors of the bill are sincere in wanting to improve the systems. The \nranking members who have cosponsored SECURE IT, who also have \njurisdiction of this area, also are sincere. I hope we can come \ntogether, hopefully later this year, but if not, certainly in the new \nyear, with the new session, let's start from the beginning and go \nthrough all the committees of jurisdiction so there can be a real \nconsensus and a give-and-take.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 1 minute and not have the time taken out of the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to respond to the concern of my \nfriend from Texas that if cloture is granted on this motion, there will \nnot be an opportunity to amend the bill. I understand why she is saying \nthat, but I do want to say that Senator Reid has made it clear--I think \ntwice today--that if cloture is granted, he is open\n\n[[Page S6783]]\n\nto--he will allow amendments. He said he cannot allow endless \namendments because we are in a lameduck session with limited time but \nthat he will allow a finite number of amendments, if you will, on both \nsides.\n  So I want to assure my colleagues and appeal to my colleagues to vote \nto at least consider this measure. I mean, our cyber enemies are at the \ngates. In fact, they have already broken through the gates. The least \nwe can do is debate and vote on amendments to determine how we can \nstrengthen our cyber defense.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from \nTexas for reserving some time for me while I was at a briefing and on \nmy way to the floor. I will attempt to be very quick because I know our \ncolleagues are eager to vote on this important issue. And, Mr. \nPresident, that is my point. This is a critically important issue. How \nmany more warnings do we need to hear from the experts that we are \nextremely vulnerable to a cyber security attack? Cyber attacks are \nhappening every day.\n  Just recently there was an attack on several of our financial \ninstitutions. According to press reports, it was launched by Iranian \nsources. We know that Iran, Russia, and China are extremely active in \nprobing our cyber systems, including those that control our critical \ninfrastructure--not only our financial systems, our transportation \nsystems, our water treatment plants, but also our electric grid.\n  Recently we have seen what Hurricane Sandy, the superstorm, has done \nto States--so many States--destroying lives and property and leaving \npeople without power for days on end. Well, multiply that many times. \nIf it were a deliberate cyber attack that knocked out the electric grid \nalong the entire east coast, that is what we are talking about. That is \nthe kind of risk that calls us to act.\n  We have heard from the experts over and over again that this \nvulnerability is huge and escalating. We know that the number of cyber \nattacks that have been reported to the Department of Homeland Security \nhas increased by 200 percent in just the last year. And those are just \nthe attacks that have been reported. That is just the tip of the \niceberg. Undoubtedly, there are many more on our critical \ninfrastructure that have not been reported. We know there have been \nattempts to probe the security of the computer systems that run some of \nour natural gas pipelines.\n  This problem is very real, and it is not only a threat to our \nnational and homeland security, it is also a threat to the economic \nprosperity of this country. How many more thefts of research and \ndevelopment, of intellectual property of businesses right here in our \ncountry that are providing good jobs for Americans do we need to endure \nbefore we act to secure our cyber systems?\n  I have worked on the cyber security bill for years with my friend, \ncolleague, and chairman, Joe Lieberman. We have held countless \nhearings. We have marked up a previous bill. It is so ironic that we \nare being criticized for not doing yet another markup on this bill when \nall of the changes reflect our attempts to address the criticisms of \nthe opponents of this bill. We made a huge change by making this bill \nvoluntary rather than mandatory and by providing incentives such as \nliability protections for businesses that voluntarily agree to adopt \ncyber standards. We have created a system where there would be a \ncooperative process between the public and the private sectors to share \ninformation and to develop the best practices so that information can \nbe shared.\n  In all the time I have worked on homeland security issues, I cannot \nthink of another threat where our vulnerability is greater and where we \nhave failed to act and have done less.\n  This is not a Republican or a Democratic or an Independent issue. The \nexperts, regardless of their political leanings, from the Bush \nadministration to the current administration have urged us to act, have \npleaded with us to act.\n  General Alexander, the nonpartisan general who is the head of Cyber \nCommand and the head of the National Security Agency, has urged this \nCongress over and over again to give this administration, to give our \ncountry the tools it needs to protect critical infrastructure and to \nhelp safeguard our economic edge.\n  I urge our colleagues to listen to the wisdom of former Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Michael Chertoff and former NSA chief GEN Michael \nHayden from the previous administration, from President Bush's \nadministration. They wrote the following:\n\n       We carry the burden of knowing that 9/11 might have been \n     averted with the intelligence that existed at the time. We do \n     not want to be in the same position again when ``cyber 9/11'' \n     hits--it is not a question of ``whether'' this will happen; \n     it is a question of ``when.''\n\n  This time all the dots have been connected. This time we know cyber \nattacks are occurring each and every day. This time the warnings are \nloud and clear. How can we ignore these dire warnings? How? How can we \nfail to act on the cyber security bill, especially since the majority \nleader has indicated he is willing to allow for amendments, as he \nshould, to make this process fair. Germane amendments would be allowed.\n  I urge our colleagues to heed the warnings from the experts and to \nvote for cloture on the cyber security bill so we can proceed to its \nconsideration. I do not want to be here 1 year from now saying, why did \nwe not act? Why did we not listen to the cyber experts from the Bush \nadministration, from the Obama administration, from GEN Keith \nAlexander, the premier expert in our government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this is the first opportunity we will have \nhad since returning from the election to cast a vote on a meaningful \npiece of legislation. As legislation goes, it is about as meaningful as \nany we are going to come across for a while.\n  If we were in the minority and the Republicans were coming to the \nfloor and asking us to support moving to a bill so we could debate it, \noffer amendments to the bill, I would hope we would do that. For our \nRepublican friends who are fearful they are not going to have a chance \nto offer these amendments, Senator Lieberman, the chairman, the ranking \nRepublican Susan Collins and myself, all cosponsors of the bill, say we \nwill work very hard to make sure any amendments that are relevant and \ngermane to the bill can be offered, can be debated.\n  We worked a similar process with the postal bill. We ended up having \n50 or 60 amendments. They were not all relevant or germane. At the end, \nwe had a lot of amendments and the chance for everyone to be heard. \nSome of those amendments were not relevant or germane. As long as \namendments are relevant and germane to this underlying legislation on \ncyber security, we will work very hard to make sure they have their \nopportunity to be heard and to vote on their proposals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, although we have different views on this \nissue, I would yield 1 minute to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation \nfor Senator Lieberman's and Senator Collins' hard work. We have had \nsome disagreements. I still believe that if we could have, say, five \namendments that would be voted and debated, I think we could move \nforward with this bill. I truly believe that.\n  I would like to see, possibly even right after this vote, if we could \nreach some agreement between the leaders and ourselves that we could \nsay there would be five pending amendments and perhaps we could go \nahead and debate and vote on those. I, again, think we have some very \nsignificant differences, but the fact that the chairman and the two \ncochairmen or whatever they call themselves have worked incredibly hard \non this issue, they deserve debate. I hope they would understand we are \nseeking like five amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S6784]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in the remaining time, I appreciate \nwhat my friend from Arizona said. I not only join him in that request, \nbut I am confident because I have talked to Senator Reid about this--he \nsaid that if we invoke cloture tonight, he will allow a finite number \nof amendments. I do not want to encourage anyone. He said not 15. I \ntook that to be some number less than 15.\n  I think five amendments is well within the term ``finite.'' So I \nwould ask my colleagues, give it a chance, and let's vote for cloture. \nI am sure Senator Reid will allow five amendments.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to begin by thanking the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, for being as steadfast as he has been in \npursuit of a law that will protect America from what I think most \nsecurity experts would say today, surprisingly, is the most serious \nthreat to our security and to our economy, which is from cyber attack \nand cyber theft.\n  The majority leader, with the authority he has over our schedule, has \nnow pulled up the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, S. 3414, for \nreconsideration; that is\n\n[[Page S6775]]\n\nto say, to reconsider the cloture vote that was held in August and \nfailed to get 60 votes, much to my disappointment. I am very grateful \nthat Senator Reid now gives the Senate a second chance to do something \nto protect the American people from cyber attack and cyber theft.\n  If you look at what has happened since the cloture vote on the \nCybersecurity Act failed back in August, I think you will see how \nurgently we need to seize this opportunity to at least vote to proceed \nto the Cybersecurity Act. Senator Reid has made clear that he would \nallow a finite number of amendments--finite because, after all, we are \nin a postelection so-called lameduck session. The amendments can't go \non forever. But a finite list would allow there to be a discussion and \nvote on the major concerns people still seem to have with the \ncompromised bipartisan Cybersecurity Act of 2012.\n  I appeal to my colleagues: Don't be recorded as no. Say yes to at \nleast allowing a discussion of cybersecurity legislation here, offer \nsome amendments, and then, of course, understand that we are not a \nunicameral legislature, to say the obvious. If--as I hope--we can pass \ncyber security legislation here, it has to go to conference with the \nHouse that I would say has--describing it diplomatically--a different \nposition than as reflected in the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 that \nemerged in part from the Homeland Security Committee; which is why I \nhave the honor of managing this debate, brought out with the strong \nsupport from my ranking member and dear friend Senator Collins of \nMaine, and then working together with Senator Feinstein, the chair of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Rockefeller, the chair of \nthe Commerce Committee, and Senator Carper, who has had a real interest \nin cyber security and is a leader on the Homeland Security Committee. \nWe bring this legislation forward.\n  We are being given a second chance to raise our defenses against \nrival nations, enemy nations, industrial spies, cyber terrorists, \norganized anti-American nonstate actors, and international organized \ncriminal gangs who are constantly probing our computer networks for \nweaknesses that they can exploit to steal industrial secrets, to take \nsome of the best results of American innovation and entrepreneurship \noverseas and, with it, the jobs that come with those secrets. And, of \ncourse, to sabotage critical infrastructure--powerplants, financial \nsystems, telecommunications systems, water systems, and so on and so \non--which are the systems that we depend on in our society for our \nquality of life, for our freedom of expression, so many of them owned \nby the private sector and managed and controlled now, operated, by \ncyber systems over the Internet and, therefore, subject to cyber \nattacks.\n  That is what this bill is about, creating standards for public-\nprivate cooperation to raise our defenses against cyber attack and \ncyber theft. Everybody you talk to in the public or private sector says \ntoday that we are vulnerable to attack. This bill only relates to the \nmost critical cyber infrastructure whose compromise, whose attack, \nwhose disabling would result in mass casualties, catastrophic economic \nloss, and assaults on our national security.\n  So let me come back to what I said. The best arguments for this bill \nand for voting on the motion to proceed and going to the bill are not \nthe arguments, frankly, that I will make on behalf of the bill but the \nfacts that have occurred and the limited amount of time since August \nwhen this initial vote to proceed to the Cybersecurity Act occurred.\n  On August 15, just 2 weeks after the last cloture vote, a computer \nvirus called Shamoon erased the hard drives of 30,000 computers owned \nand operated by Saudi Aramco, one of the world's largest energy \ncompanies. What happened as a result of the erasing of those hard \ndrives, the data files were replaced with images of burning American \nflags. It is pretty clear who carried out this attack. The computers \nwere rendered useless and had to be replaced and restored. Some cyber \nexperts that I trust say this was the most destructive cyber attack \nagainst a private company in history. A similar attack was carried out \non the Qatari natural gas company called RasGas. Remember the burning \nAmerican flags? Iran is suspected as the attacker in both instances.\n\n  Thanks to quick work, really extraordinary work by Aramco and many of \nthe world's leading cyber security technologists and experts, the \ndamage to Saudi Aramco was contained. But this attack could have thrown \nglobal oil markets into chaos and a lot of economies--including ours--\ninto greater stress than we are already in if orders couldn't be filled \nor shipments made.\n  That was August, 2 weeks after the last cloture vote on the cyber \nsecurity bill. Then in September, the consumer Web banking sites of \nsome great American financial institutions--Bank of America, JPMorgan \nChase, Wells Fargo, PNC Bank, and some others--came under the largest \nsustained denial of service attack in history. As I am sure most of my \ncolleagues know, this is when the Web sites are essentially overloaded, \nthey are flooded, to make it impossible for them to stay up and provide \nthe service they normally do. These attacks went on in different waves \nfor weeks, knocking many of these sites that are very important to \ncommercial life in our country offline or slowing them to a crawl. Just \ntake a look at how much commerce is now conducted over the Internet and \nI think you can see the potential catastrophe here. These kinds of \nattacks really could bring our banking system and the economy to its \nknees. Again, some intelligence officials that I respect suspect that \nIran or its agents launched these attacks against the American banks.\n  Defense Secretary Panetta warned in a recent speech that these and \nother cyber attacks show that we are approaching a cyber Pearl Harbor \nwhere:\n\n       An aggressor nation or extremist group could use these \n     kinds of cybertools to gain control of critical switches . . \n     . [and] derail passenger trains, or even more dangerous, \n     trains loaded with lethal chemicals.\n       They could contaminate the water supply in major cities, or \n     shut down the power grid across large parts of the country.\n\n  That is not science fiction. That is not an alarmist. That is the \nSecretary of Defense of the United States, Leon Panetta, issuing a \nwarning based on what anybody who works in this field knows is reality.\n  In recent weeks, we have watched one section of our country--in this \ncase the Northeast, including my own State of Connecticut--hit by \nHurricane Sandy and then a follow-on northeaster storm, losing power. \nSome parts of New York and certainly New Jersey were hit harder than \nConnecticut, but we were hit pretty hard ourselves. Some still are \nwithout power, and this is the third week since the hurricane. This is \nexactly the kind of dislocation and suffering that would occur if an \nenemy cyber attacked America's electric power system. It is why we need \nto at least vote to take this bill up now with a sense of urgency in \nthis session. Time is not on our side.\n  The elections are over. The American people through their votes have \ntold us in a clear and certain voice that they want us to work together \nto solve the many challenges our Nation confronts. I know we are \nfocused on avoiding going over the fiscal cliff and the challenge to \nCongress is, Can we solve our fiscal problems? Can we come to a \nbipartisan compromise before we go over the cliff?\n  In this case of cyber security and cyber vulnerability, the challenge \nbefore us is, Can we come to a bipartisan agreement compromise--and we \nthink we have in the bill before us--and create and improve our \ndefenses before a catastrophic cyber attack occurs, as it surely will, \nand then we come rushing back to raise our defenses, as we did after 9/\n11, after we have suffered an attack?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I want to ask the distinguished chairman, who \nreferenced the important word, ``compromise,'' if he has spoken about \nthe extent to which this bill reflects not only the original bipartisan \ncompromise between himself and his ranking member, Senator Susan \nCollins of Maine, but then a second compromise done to reach further to \nour Republican colleagues that is actually already embedded in this \nbill. I think it is important for the people who are watching and \nlistening to us to recognize that not only was this an original\n\n[[Page S6776]]\n\nbipartisan bill that was the product of bipartisan compromise and \ndiscussion, but then a further unilateral step was taken by the \ndistinguished chairman to move even more toward Republican colleagues. \nSo it is not only a compromise but double compromise that is on the \nSenate floor right now.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Rhode Island. I thank my friend \nfor his interest in the area of cyber security and for his leadership. \nI have not talked about that yet--and I will right now--which is to \nsay, following the advice of most of the experts of both political \nadministrations and experts outside, one of the centerpieces of our \noriginal bill was to create a public-private process--government and \npeople who live in these sectors of our economy--to draft best \npractices, not to have them imposed by the Government, and then to make \nit mandatory within a set period of time, and that these practices, \nthese standards, would be general principles, not all do's and don'ts, \nto leave room for the private sector to come up with the best way they \nthought they could meet those standards.\n  Opponents, particularly the business community, and some of our \nfriends on the other side, have said to us that they fear that would be \nmore regulation of business. Senator Collins, my ranking member and \ndear friend, is a leading advocate of regulation reform and lighter \nregulation on business. But she said over and over with such \ncredibility and force: This is not regulation of business; this is \nprotection of our homeland security, of our economy. You reform \nregulation when the regulations seem to be too much and get in the way \nof economic growth. We have a threat that is today stealing billions of \ndollars of American innovation, taking jobs elsewhere in the world.\n  OK, we had it mandatory, but it was clear we were not going to get to \n60 votes. I have said over and over, one of the problems we have in \nCongress now is people seem to say if they do not get 100 percent of \nwhat they want, they are not going to vote for a bill. So I had to \nlisten to my own words because if they wait for 100 percent of what \nthey want on a bill, everybody is going to end up with zero percent. We \nmight as well try to get done what we agree on. So we took a big step, \nwhich was to make those mandatory standards voluntary.\n  Then we threw in an incentive, which is a lot--partial liability, \nimmunity from liability in the case of a cyber attack--as an \nencouragement for those companies that voluntarily opt into the \nstandards that the voluntary process would set up that gets some \nimmunity from liability for prosecution.\n  Incidentally, President Obama has made very clear, first, that he \ntotally gets the seriousness of this challenge to our security, this \ncyber challenge to our security and our prosperity. He has supported \nthis legislation, but he has gone one step further now and said if we \nfail to pass legislation, he will issue an Executive order that does as \nmuch as an Executive order can do to protect America better from cyber \nattack and cyber theft.\n  The President does have the authority to issue an Executive order \nthat will establish standards for cyber security for all 18 critical \ninfrastructure sectors under existing law and require those sectors to \nbe implemented in certain areas where the regulators have the power to \nmandate such observance of the standards. A draft of such Presidential \norder is now being circulated, but the President does not have the \npower under existing law to offer a lot of the benefits that our bill \nwould give private sector owners of critical infrastructure.\n  For one thing the President does not have the ability to offer the \nprivate sector owners the liability protection I have just described. \nIn addition, needed changes to law that permit private companies to \nshare cyber security threat information among themselves and with the \ngovernment will go unmade. So both sides in this debate have \nacknowledged that this is a critical piece in any bill. But it cannot \nbe implemented by executive action. We are the lawmakers. We have the \nability to protect our country better than the President does by \nExecutive order. I have appealed to the President that if we are not \nable to act here that he should issue this Executive order. I am very \nencouraged by the work done on it, and I am confident that if we fail \nto act the President will act. I think he has a responsibility to act \nbecause if we fail to act we are leaving the American people extremely \nvulnerable to a major cyber attack. Therefore, although the legislation \nis preferable, an Executive order will certainly give the American \npeople protection.\n  I have more to say, but I note the presence on the floor of my \ncolleague and partner in this pursuit, the chair of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Feinstein. If she would like to speak, \nI will yield the floor to her.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would, and I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, if I may, I want to compliment \nSenator Lieberman on his steadfast determination to get this bill \npassed. I think he and his ranking member, Senator Collins, have done a \nvery fine job. I think it is important for everyone to know about those \nhours when we sat down with other Members trying to negotiate something \npeople might agree to on this cyber bill. Unfortunately, we could not.\n  I am very worried. I am very worried there will be a major cyber \nattack on this Nation. I do not say that without intelligence to back \nit up. On the Intelligence Committee, we receive regular warnings from \nthe Intelligence Community that tell us cyber attacks are increasing in \nnumber, sophistication, and damage.\n  Unfortunately, despite significant changes made to the Cybersecurity \nAct that Senator Lieberman, Senator Collins, Senator Rockefeller and I \nagreed to in July and August, many on the other side of the aisle \nfilibustered the bill. Since that time we have learned of additional \nmajor cyber attacks.\n  In October and September of this year, at least nine major U.S. banks \nwere hit by a series of attacks that blocked their customers from \naccessing their banking information or making online transactions. This \nlist of victims includes the country's largest, most sophisticated \nfinancial institutions: the Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, \nthe U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo, PNC, Capital One, BB Corporation, and \nHSBC--all cyber attacked.\n  These attacks systematically hit banks for 5 weeks. They disrupted \ntraffic at each bank for a day or two before moving on to the next \nvictim. It was a well planned and coordinated cyber attack from bank to \nbank to bank to bank. It disrupted the banking system, but it did not \ndestroy it. But that doesn't mean the attackers do not have the ability \nto destroy it. This is a real wake-up call, and I think we ignore it at \nour own peril.\n  I have come to believe it is negligent to fail to pass a bill with \nthe warnings that are out there today. I remember, I was on the \nIntelligence Committee when the CIA Director, then-Director Tenet, came \nbefore the committee in the middle of the summer in 2001 and said to \nus: We anticipate an attack. We don't know where. We don't know when. \nThat attack came, and it was 9/11. Today there is the same anticipation \nof a big attack, a big cyber attack. And we need to put in place the \nlegal procedures to prevent that.\n  Let me mention other recent cyber attacks. In August, a foreign \ncountry or organization used computer code to destroy 30,000 computers \nat the world's largest energy company, that is Saudi Aramco, and that \nis Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company. How is this done? According \nto the New York Times, the cyber attackers ``unleashed a computer virus \nto initiate what is regarded as among the most destructive acts of \ncomputer sabotage on a company to date. The virus erased data on three-\nquarters of Aramco's corporate PCs--documents, spreadsheets, e-mails, \nfiles--replacing all of it with an image of a burning American flag.''\n  If anything is a harbinger of things to come, that is clear. Why \nwould one put their signature on a major cyber attack by showing \nburning American flags unless they had some additional intent against \nthe U.S.? We cannot underestimate the threat. To do so is sheer \nnegligence on the part of this body.\n  In the 5 months from October 2011 through February 2012, over 50,000 \ncyber attacks were reported on private and government networks with 86 \nof\n\n[[Page S6777]]\n\nthose attacks taking place on critical infrastructure networks. So we \nhave 86 attacks on critical infrastructure networks.\n  Keep in mind these 50,000 incidents were only the ones reported to \nthe Department of Homeland Security. So they represent but a small \nfraction of cyber attacks carried out against the United States. This \nyear, 2012, Nissan, MasterCard, and Visa joined the ranks of other \nmajor companies already hacked--Sony, Citi, Lockheed Martin, Northrop \nGrumman, Google, Booze Allen Hamilton, RSA, L-3, and the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce as victims of hacking last year.\n  We also know that last year for at least 6 months, 48 companies in \nthe chemical, defense, and other industries were penetrated by a hacker \nlooking to steal intellectual property. The cyber security company \nSymantec has attributed some of these attacks to computers in Hebei, \nChina.\n  Here is the point. We know we are being attacked by other countries. \nI hear it in the Intelligence Committee. It is classified so I cannot \ngo into it here. But suffice it to say that we know it is happening. \nThings are only going to get worse, as Secretary Panetta said in a \nrecent major address in New York. Let me just read one section of his \nspeech:\n\n       The collective result of these kinds of attacks could be a \n     cyber Pearl Harbor, an attack that would cause physical \n     destruction and loss of life. In fact it would paralyze and \n     shock the nation and create a new, profound sense of \n     vulnerability.\n\n  Members of the Senate, we are warned. We are warned clearly, we are \nwarned directly, and we are warned by the Head of Cyber Command, \nGeneral Alexander, as well as the Secretary of Defense. Yet we do \nnothing.\n  I strongly believe we need to pass this bill. Then it will go to the \nHouse. And then there will be a conference. Along the way, there will \nhave to be some accommodations made. But, there is no reason for this \nSenate, knowing what we know, not to pass this bill.\n  We also know the President would sign this bill, and we know the \nPresident would not sign the House bill as is. So we have an \nopportunity by moving forward with this bill.\n  I want to remind my colleagues of efforts made to negotiate an \nagreement on this bill. Before the bill came to the floor in July, and \nwhile the Senate was considering it, there were numerous meetings every \nday by a dozen or more Senators. The authors of the bill met with \nSenators McCain, Chambliss, Hutchison, the sponsors of the SECURE IT \nAct, as well as Senators Kyl and Whitehouse, and a group they convened. \nWe had multiple meetings with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The \nChamber's largest concern with Title VII on information sharing was \nover the liability protections in our bill--which is what the \nIntelligence Committee staff worked on and prepared.\n  I asked the Chamber where they thought our language was deficient. I \nasked them if they could improve on the immunity provisions, to please \nsend us bill language. Did they? No. They did not. I think that is some \ntestimony that is worth thinking about.\n\n  Over the summer, the majority leader offered to vote on a set list of \namendments. He asked if the minority could put together the 10 votes it \nwanted, and as long as they were relevant and germane to the bill, we \nwould consider them. No list was provided. So we voted, and by a vote \nof 52 to 46, cloture was not invoked.\n  Again, after the vote, the staff from both sides of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, the Commerce Committee, and the Intelligence \nCommittee held numerous meetings to negotiate a compromise. The effort \ndid not succeed. So if we are to address the major problem of cyber \nattacks and potential cyber warfare, we have no option but to bring the \nLieberman-Collins bill back on the floor.\n  I know my time is limited here today. And I know the Nation's cyber \nlaws are woefully out of date. Let me touch on one more thing regarding \nthe information sharing part of the bill. I received a call from a CEO \nof a high-tech company about the homeland security portal or exchange, \nas we call it in the bill. That CEO said, We would like our information \nto go directly into the Department of Defense. Let me note that would \ncreate a big problem. It created a problem with a number of U.S. \nSenators who are concerned about the military getting this kind of \ncyber information. And it created a big concern with the privacy \norganizations throughout our country. So it was changed so that the \nportal would be run most likely by Homeland Security. But here is the \npoint I wish to make. The transfer of cyber information is with the \nclick of a mouse. It moves instantaneously, so that as information----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So as information comes in, it goes instantaneously \ninto the correct area. The CEO who called me said, I didn't know that. \nThank you. I have no problem with that.\n  So I would ask my colleagues who have voted against this bill to \nreconsider. We are never going to do the perfect bill. The bills are \ngoing to have to be changed and amended as time goes on. But I think \npassing a bill is important. I think to leave this country vulnerable, \nnot to pass a bill because somebody doesn't like this part or that \npart, is negligent, it is irresponsible, and God forbid if we have that \nmajor cyber Pearl Harbor that Secretary Panetta referred to in his \nspeech. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.\n  I thank the Chair for the extra time, yield the floor and ask that my \nremaining remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Let me describe what the information sharing title does \n     specifically.\n       First, title VII explicitly authorizes companies to search \n     for cybersecurity threats on their own networks and to take \n     appropriate actions to defend their networks against these \n     threats.\n       Many companies monitor and defend their own networks today, \n     in order to protect themselves and their customers.\n       But we have heard from numerous companies that the law in \n     this area is unclear, and that sometimes it is less risky, \n     from a liability perspective, to just hope attacks don't \n     happen than to take additional steps to defend themselves.\n       So this bill will make the law crystal clear by giving \n     companies explicit authority to monitor and defend their own \n     networks.\n       Second, the bill clearly authorizes private companies to \n     share cyber threat information with each other.\n       There have been concerns that antitrust laws or other \n     statutes prevent companies from cooperating on cyber defense. \n     This bill, section 702, clearly says: ``notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, any private entity may disclose \n     lawfully obtained cybersecurity threat indicators to any \n     other private entity in accordance with this section.''\n       Third, the bill authorizes the government--which will \n     largely mean, in practice, the intelligence community--to \n     share classified information about cyber threats with \n     appropriately cleared organizations, such as companies, \n     outside of the government.\n       Today, only government employees and contractors are \n     eligible to receive security clearances and therefore gain \n     access to national secrets. To put it another way, those with \n     a valid ``need to know'' national security secrets are \n     usually within the government or working for the government.\n       That isn't true for cyber security. The companies that \n     underpin our Nation's economy and way of life have a ``need \n     to know'' about the nature of cyber attacks so they can \n     better secure their systems.\n       So under this bill, companies able to qualify to receive \n     classified information will be certified and then be able to \n     obtain classified information about what cyber threats to \n     look out for.\n       Fourth, the bill establishes a system for any private \n     sector entity--whether a power utility, a defense contractor, \n     a telecom company, or others--to share cyber threat \n     information with the government.\n       This is the piece that General Alexander--the Director of \n     the National Security Agency and the Commander of U.S. Cyber \n     Command--says is absolutely necessary for the protection of \n     the United States.\n       Here is how the provision works:\n       The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with \n     the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, and the \n     Director of National Intelligence, would designate a federal \n     cybersecurity exchange. This would be an office or center \n     that already exists, and already shares and receives cyber \n     threat information.\n       Private companies would share cyber threat information with \n     the exchange directly. The exchange must be a civilian \n     entity; I expect it would be within the Department of \n     Homeland Security.\n       Let me stop there. Why not have this portal or exchange be \n     in the military or the NSA? There are two reasons:\n\n[[Page S6778]]\n\n       First, we are talking here about the protection of the \n     government's network--the dot.gov network--and the computer \n     systems outside of the government. We are not talking about \n     protecting the dot.mil network and the Department of Defense, \n     and we are not talking about actions that the military takes \n     overseas. Protection of the private sector--of the electrical \n     grid or Wall Street--is simply not the military's or NSA's \n     responsibility.\n       Second, there is, for good reason, major concern among \n     privacy advocates not to have private sector information, \n     which could include Americans' banking records, or email \n     traffic, or health care records, being shared by companies \n     with the military or intelligence community.\n       In drafting this bill, we heard from several Senators for \n     whom having a military exchange was a complete non-starter. \n     We worked with Senators Durbin, Franken, Coons, Akaka, \n     Blumenthal, and Sanders, and others to craft this language \n     putting a civilian entity in the lead.\n       General Keith Alexander, the Director of the National \n     Security Agency, also supports this model. He wrote, in his \n     July 31 letter to Senator Reid: ``The American people must \n     have confidence that threat information is being shared \n     appropriately and in the most transparent way possible. \n     That is why I support information to be shared through a \n     civilian entity, with real-time, rule-based sharing of \n     cyber security threat indicators with all relevant Federal \n     partners.'' General Alexander is the top military and \n     intelligence official on cyber saying that he supports a \n     civilian exchange.\n       So we have the Federal exchange. Companies will use the \n     exchange, as a portal and information will be sent \n     automatically and instantaneously to other parts of the \n     government. This is what General Alexander was describing.\n       This part is critical. We are not talking about information \n     going to an office in the Department of Homeland Security and \n     waiting for someone to look at it and figure out whether to \n     share it and with whom.\n       This is an automatic, instantaneous process. Information \n     comes in and is automatically shared with other departments \n     and agencies.\n       The bill requires that procedures be put in place so that \n     information is shared in real-time. This has to be done \n     automatically, so that cyber defense systems can move to \n     identify and disrupt a cyber attack as it is coming over the \n     networks.\n       I discussed this recently with a CEO of a high-tech \n     company. He was concerned that information wouldn't reach the \n     Department of Defense. I explained that our bill would \n     provide instantaneous sharing to DOD. He said that would \n     satisfy his concerns. So this is a major point.\n       Having a single focal point is also more efficient for the \n     government. It will help eliminate stovepipes because right \n     now there are dozens of different parts of the government \n     receiving information from the private sector about the cyber \n     threats they are encountering, and no one agency has the \n     responsibility to ensure the information is shared with other \n     parts of the government.\n       It would also make privacy and civil liberties oversight \n     easier, as I will describe in a moment. Finally, it should \n     save tax payers money, because it is more efficient to manage \n     and oversee the operation of one designated cybersecurity \n     exchange versus a half dozen or more parts of the government.\n       Now let me describe the liability protections, because that \n     is a critical part of title VII.\n       Section 706 of the bill provides liability protection for \n     the voluntary sharing of cyber threat information with the \n     federal cybersecurity exchange.\n       The bill reads: ``no civil or criminal cause of action \n     shall lie or be maintained in any Federal or State court \n     against any entity [meaning a company] acting as authorized \n     by this title, and any such action shall be dismissed \n     promptly for . . . the voluntary disclosure of a lawfully \n     obtained cybersecurity threat indicator to a cybersecurity \n     exchange.''\n       In other words, a company is immune from lawsuit if it \n     shares cyber threat information with a Federal exchange.\n       The same immunity applies to:\n       Companies who monitor their own networks;\n       Cybersecurity companies who share threat information with \n     their customers;\n       Companies that share information with a critical \n     infrastructure owner or operator; or\n       Companies who share threat information with other \n     companies, as long as they also share that information with \n     the Federal cybersecurity exchange within a reasonable time.\n       If a company shared information in a way other than the \n     five ways I just mentioned, it still receives a legal defense \n     under this bill from suit if the company can make a \n     reasonable good faith showing that the information sharing \n     provisions permitted that sharing.\n       Further, no civil or criminal cause of action can be \n     brought against a company or an officer, employee, or agency \n     of a company for the reasonable failure to act on information \n     received through the information sharing mechanisms set up by \n     this bill.\n       Basically, the only way that anyone participating in the \n     information sharing system can be held liable is if they are \n     found to have knowingly violated a provision of the bill or \n     acted in gross negligence.\n       So there are very strong liability protections in this bill \n     for anyone that shares information about cyber threats--which \n     is completely voluntarily.\n       In addition to narrowly defining what information can be \n     shared with an exchange, our bill also requires the Federal \n     government to adopt a very robust privacy and civil liberties \n     oversight regime for information shared under this title. \n     There are multiple layers of oversight from different parts \n     of the executive branch, including the Department of Justice \n     and the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \n     Board, as well as the Congress.\n       Consider this: In October, General Alexander--the Director \n     of the NSA--and Anthony Romero, the Executive Director of the \n     ACLU, spoke together on a cybersecurity roundtable at the \n     Woodrow Wilson Center. General Alexander praised title VII's \n     approach to information sharing, and Mr. Romero said ``I \n     think it strikes the right balance.'' It is not often that \n     the Director of the NSA and the Executive Director of the \n     ACLU agree on legislation. If they can, I would hope that the \n     Senate can come together as well.\n       The time to act is now. The cyber threat we face is real, \n     it is serious, and it is growing. The country is vulnerable, \n     and this legislation is essential. I urge my colleagues to \n     support the motion to proceed and to support the bill.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Senator Grassley, who is scheduled to speak next, has \nbeen kind to give me 45 seconds, so I appreciate that.\n  In July and August, the cosponsors of both the underlying bill, the \nLieberman-Collins bill, and the SECURE IT bill, of which I am a \ncosponsor, met regularly, and I was hopeful we could resolve the \nsignificant differences between these two bills. Unfortunately, we did \nnot reach an agreement, and even though we had been promised an open \namendment process on this underlying bill, the majority leader once \nagain filled the tree and filed cloture. Unfortunately, nothing has \nchanged since then, so I am compelled to do the same thing today.\n  We all understand the serious threat that is facing our country from \ncyber attacks and intrusions, but that does not mean Congress should \njust pass any bill. Frankly, the underlying bill is not supported by \nthe business community, for all the right reasons, and they are the \nones who are impacted by it. They are the ones who are going to be \ncalled on to comply with the mandates and the regulations. Frankly, it \nis not going to give them the kind of protection they need from cyber \nattacks.\n  So I regret to have to stand up today and say that I intend to vote \nagainst cloture on this bill, and I yield to Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are again discussing the important \ntopic of cybersecurity--a topic we all agree is of the utmost \nimportance and worthy of our attention. Unfortunately, this is like the \nmovie ``Groundhog Day.'' The majority continues to push the same flawed \nlegislation that failed to garner enough votes for consideration just \nthree months ago.\n  No one disputes the need for Congress to address cybersecurity.\n  However, Members do disagree with the notion this problem requires \nlegislation that increases the size of the Federal Government \nbureaucracy and places new burdens and regulation on businesses.\n  Enhancing cybersecurity is important to our national security. I \nsupport efforts to strengthen our Nation against cyber attacks.\n  However, I take issue with those who have come to the floor and \nargued that those who don't support this bill are against strengthening \nour Nation's cybersecurity.\n  As I said in August, disagreements over how to address policy matters \nshouldn't devolve into accusations about a Member's willingness to \ntackle tough issues.\n  The debate over cybersecurity legislation has turned from a \nsubstantive analysis of the merits into a political blame game as to \nwhich side supports defending our Nation more.\n  If we want to tackle big issues such as cybersecurity, we need to \nrise above disagreements and work in a constructive manner. \nDisagreements over policy should be openly and freely debated.\n  Unfortunately, this isn't how the debate on cybersecurity proceeded. \nInstead, before a real debate began last August, the majority cut it \noff.\n  This was contrary to the majority's promise earlier this year of an \nopen\n\n[[Page S6779]]\n\namendment process to address cybersecurity.\n  Aside from process, I also have significant substantive concerns with \nthe bill. Chief among my concerns with the pending bill is the role \nplayed by the Department of Homeland Security. These concerns stem from \noversight I have conducted on its implementation of the Chemical \nFacility Anti-Terrorism Standards, or the CFATS program.\n  CFATS was the Department's first major foray into regulation of the \nchemical sector. DHS spent nearly $500 million on the program. Five \nyears later, they have just begun to approve site security plans for \nthe more than 4,000 facilities designated under the rule.\n  I have continued to conduct oversight on this matter. Despite \nassurances from DHS that they have fixed all the problems with CFATS, I \nkeep discovering more problems.\n  On top of this concern, since the last vote in August, the chairman \nand ranking member of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations have released a report criticizing DHS and the fusion \ncenters they operate. The subcommittee report criticized DHS's fusion \ncenters as ``pools of ineptitude, waste, and civil liberties \nintrusions.''\n  And that is the evaluation after DHS spent as much as $1.4 billion on \nthis program.\n  Given these examples, I am baffled why the Senate would take an \nagency that has proven problems with overseeing critical infrastructure \nand give them chief responsibility for our country's cybersecurity.\n  Additionally, I am concerned with provisions that restrict the way \ninformation is shared.\n  The restrictions imposed under title VII of this bill are a step \nbackward from other information-sharing proposals. This includes the \nbill I have co-sponsored, the SECURE IT bill.\n  The bill before us places DHS in the role of gatekeeper of cyber \nthreat information. The bill calls for DHS to share the information in \n``as close to real time as possible'' with other agencies. However, \nthis will create a bottleneck for information coming into the \ngovernment.\n  Further, title VII includes restrictions on what types of information \ncan be shared, limiting the use of it for criminal prosecutions except \nthose that cause imminent harm.\n  This is exactly the type of restriction on information sharing that \nthe 9/11 Commission warned about.\n  In fact, the 9/11 Commission said, ``the [wall] resulted in far less \ninformation sharing and coordination.'' The Commission further added, \n``the removal of the wall that existed before 9/11 between intelligence \nand law enforcement has opened up new opportunities for cooperative \naction.''\n  Why would we even consider legislation that could rebuild these walls \nthat threaten our national security?\n  We haven't had any real debate on these issues. The lack of a real \nprocess in the Senate on this current bill amplifies my substantive \nconcerns.\n  In fact, this is eerily reminiscent of the debate surrounding \nObamaCare.\n  Here we are once again, in a lame duck session the week before \nThanksgiving, tackling a serious problem that hasn't been given the \nbenefit of the Senate's full process.\n  I don't want cybersecurity legislation to become another ObamaCare. \nIf we are serious about our Nation's security, then shouldn't we treat \nit as such?\n  Additionally, the staff of the sponsors of the legislation before us \ncontinue behind-the-scenes efforts to negotiate changes to the bill we \nare being asked to vote on. If the bill sponsors are still negotiating \nchanges, why don't we have the benefit of a full and open amendment \nprocess to try and fix it before we vote for cloture? It simply doesn't \nmake sense.\n  Instead, it appears today's vote is about something other than \ncybersecurity. It is yet another attempt by the majority to paint the \nminority as obstructing the work of the Senate. Most likely, this vote \nwill be used simply as fuel for the majority's effort to dismantle the \nfilibuster. So much for tackling cybersecurity without putting politics \ninto the mix.\n  This isn't the way we are supposed to legislate. The people who \nelected us expect more.\n  How many Senators are prepared to vote on something this important, \nwithout knowing its impact because we haven't followed regular order? \nAre we to once again pass a bill so that the American public can then \nread it and find out what is in it?\n  These are questions that all Senators should consider. And our \ncitizens should know in advance what we are actually considering.\n  If we are serious about addressing this problem, then let's deal with \nit appropriately.\n  Rushing something through that will impact the country in such a \nmassive way isn't the way we should do business.\n  It is not good for the country and it is not good for this body.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to support the \nCybersecurity Act of 2012. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I \nknow that cyber security is the most pressing economic and national \nsecurity threat facing our country.\n  There still needs to be a sense of urgency in addressing this issue, \nand we must pass this legislation. Doing so will allow us to defend our \ncomputer networks and critical infrastructure from a hostile, predatory \nattack. Such an attack is meant to humiliate, intimidate, and cripple \nus. If we wait until a major attack occurs, we will likely end up over-\nreacting, over-regulating, and overspending in order to address our \nweakness.\n  The threat of a cyber attack is real. Our Nation is already under \nattack. We are in a cyber war, and cyber attacks are happening every \nday. Cyber terrorists are working to damage critical infrastructure \nthrough efforts to take over the power grid or disrupt our air traffic \ncontrol systems. Those carrying out these attacks are moving at \nbreakneck speeds to steal state secrets and our Nation's intellectual \nproperty. They are stealing financial information and disrupting \nbusiness operations.\n  Cyber attacks can disrupt critical infrastructure, wipe out a \nfamily's entire life savings, and put human lives at risk. They can \ntake down entire companies by hacking into computer networks where they \nremain undiscovered for months, even years.\n  FBI Director Mueller testified before the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, stating that cyber crime will eventually surpass terrorism \nas the No. 1 threat to America. The economic losses of cyber crime \nalone are stunning. A Norton Cybercrime Report valued losses from cyber \nattacks at $388 billion in 2011.\n  I have been working on cyber issues since I was elected to the \nSenate. The National Security Agency--our cyber warriors--are in \nMaryland. I have been working with the NSA to ensure that signals \nintelligence is a focus of our national security even before cyber was \na method of warfare.\n  In 2007, Estonia was attacked. Estonia was strengthening its ties to \nNATO, and Russian hackers swiftly struck back. They waged war on \nEstonia and threatened its government, rendered Estonia's networks \nobsolete for days. This attack was designed to intimidate, manipulate, \nand distort.\n  The cyber attacks on Estonia raised important questions. Would \narticle 5 of the NATO Charter be invoked? Since the attack was on one \nmember of NATO--was it an attack on all members? How would the U.S. and \nother allies need respond to future attacks? What would happen if \nAmerica experienced a similar cyber attack?\n  As member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I served on the Cyber \nWorking Group where we developed core findings to guide Congress. The \nneed to get governance right, the need to protect civil liberties, and \nthe need to improve the cyber workforce.\n  As chair of the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I fund critical cyber security agencies: the FBI which \ninvestigates cyber crime, NIST, which works with the private sector to \ndevelop standards for cyber security technology, and NSF, which does \nresearch.\n  As a member of Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I work to ensure \ncritical funding for Intel and cyber agencies such as the NSA, CIA, and \nIARPA. These organizations are coming up with the new ideas that will \ncreate jobs and keep our country safe.\n\n[[Page S6780]]\n\nFunding is critical to build the workforce, provide technology and \nresources, and to make our cyber security smarter, safer, and more \nsecure.\n  Yet technology will mean nothing unless we have a trained workforce. \nIn order to fight the cyber security war, we have to maintain our \ntechnological development, maintain our qualitative advantage, and have \nour cyber warriors ready at battle stations. In order to develop our \ncyber shield, we need to train cyber warriors so they can protect our \nNation. I have been working with Maryland colleges and universities to \ncreate world-class programs, a national model, and for training our \nnext generation of cyber warriors.\n  I asked Senator Reid to conduct a cyber security exercise, which \nshowed us in real time how the U.S. Government would respond to a \npredatory cyber attack of great magnitude. I asked for the Senate cyber \nexercise for three reasons. First, we need a sense of urgency here in \nthe Senate to pass cyber security legislation. Second, we need to put \nthe proper legislative policy in place. Third, I wanted to create a \nsense of bipartisanship camaraderie.\n  One example of the impact a cyber attack would have is the power \noutages caused by our freak storms this summer. We got a glimpse of \nwhat an attack on the grid would be like. At least Pepco has the \nability to respond and restore and turn the power back on. With an \nattack on the grid we could lose the power to turn electricity back on \nbecause it was shut down by power manipulation. Imagine our largest \ncities, like New York and Washington, like the Wild West with no power, \nschools shut down, parents stuck in traffic, public transit crippled, \nno traffic lights, and 9-1-1 systems failing.\n  In the financial industry, the FBI currently has 7,600 pending bank \nrobbery cases and over 9,000 pending cyber investigations. According to \nthe FBI, the Bureau is currently investigating over 400 reported cases \nof corporate account takeovers where cyber criminals have made \nunauthorized transfers from the bank accounts of U.S. businesses. These \ncases involve the attempted theft of over $255 million and actual \nlosses of approximately $85 million.\n  Hackers have repeatedly penetrated the computer network of the \ncompany that runs the Nasdaq Stock Market. The New York Stock Exchange \nhas been the target of cyber attacks. In the future, successful \nattempts to shut down or steal information from our financial exchanges \ncould wreak havoc of untold proportions on our economy.\n  In the 2010 ``flash crash'', the Dow Jones plunged 1,000 points in \nmatter of minutes when automatic computerized traders shut down. This \nwas the result of turbulent trading, not a cyber attack and the market \nrecovered. But this is a micro-example of what could happen if stock \nmarket computers are hacked, infected, or go dark.\n\n  In November 2008 the American credit card processor RBS Worldpay was \nhacked--$9 million was stolen in less than 12 hours. The hackers broke \ninto accounts and changed limits on payroll debit cards employees use \nto withdraw their salaries from ATMs. The cards were used at over 2,100 \nATMs in at least 280 cities around the world, United States, Russia, \nUkraine, Estonia, Italy, Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, stealing over $9 \nmillion from unsuspecting employers and employees.\n  This heist, one of the most sophisticated and organized computer \nfraud attacks ever conducted proves that you don't need a visa to steal \nsomeone's visa card.\n  From 2008 to 2010, a Slovenian citizen created ``Butterfly Bot'' and \nsold it to other criminals worldwide. Cyber criminals developed \nnetworks of infected computers. The Mariposa variety from Spain was the \nmost notorious and largest. Mariposa infected personal computers, stole \ncredit card and bank account information, launched denial attacks to \nshut down online services, and spread viruses to disable computers and \nnetworks.\n  Industry experts estimated the Mariposa Botnet may have infected as \nmany as 8 million to 12 million computers. The size and scope of the \ninfection makes it difficult to quantify financial losses but could \neasily be tens of millions of dollars.\n  Speaking simply, this bill does two key things from a national \nsecurity perspective. It helps businesses voluntarily get cyber \nstandards that they can use to protect themselves, and it allows \nbusinesses and the government to share information with each other \nabout cyber threats. That is, to help ``.gov'' to protect ``.com.''\n  In a constitutional manner, these two things are not necessarily \nconnected, but they can be. The reason why these provisions are such an \ninnovation is that despite all the amazing talent and expertise that \ncompanies have, many are being attacked and don't know it. And this \nlegislative framework gives the structure to allow for unprecedented \n``.com'' and ``.gov'' cooperation.\n  There are also other several other key components in the bill \nfocusing on research and development, workforce development, and FISMA \nreform.\n  Why do we need a bill to make some of these vital partnerships and \nexchanges happen?\n  Because, as I have outlined, America is under attack every second of \nevery day. General Alexander, the head of NSA and U.S. Cyber Command, \nhas said that we have witnessed the greatest transfer of wealth in \nhistory in the heist that foreign actors have perpetrated on our \ncountry. By stealing our secrets, stealing our intellectual property, \nand stealing our wealth. It is mindboggling. Take just one example. A \ntheft by a foreign actor that took, among other things, key plans for \nour F-35 fighter. One attack on the Pentagon made off with so many \nsensitive documents that they would have filled delivery trucks end-to-\nend stretching from Washington, DC to Baltimore Harbor.\n  But don't take my word for it that this issue is urgent and that we \nneed to address critical infrastructure. Who else says it is urgent? \nExperts from both side of the aisle do. Folks like former CIA Director \nMike McConnell, DHS head Michael Chertoff, Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff James Cartwright, former cyber czar Richard Clarke, and \nmany others have said we need to address critical infrastructure.\n  And our top defense and military leaders such as Defense Secretary \nLeon Panetta, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dempsey, Director \nof National Intelligence Clapper, and again, GEN Keith Alexander. The \nthreat is here and it is now. And if we do not act, if we let the \nperfect be the enemy of the good, then this country will be more \nvulnerable than ever before, and Congress will have done nothing.\n  This bill is not perfect, but I want to say upfront that Senators \nLieberman and Collins have heard the critics and tried to incorporate \ntheir views. DHS's role has been criticized by many, myself included. I \nhave been skeptical that they could perform some of the duties assigned \nin this bill.\n  To be honest, I still am skeptical, although less so than before, but \nI think this bill takes important steps to diversify the government and \nprivate sector actors involved. So we are not just focusing on DHS, but \nalso the right civilian agencies in charge because in the end we cannot \nhave intelligence agencies leading this effort with the private sector. \nSome would like to see that go further, and that is what the amendment \nprocess is there for.\n  We have had people in the civil liberties community worried about \nwhether this bill could allow intrusions by the government into \npeople's privacy. As a Marylander, this was a tantamount concern for me \nas well. If we don't protect our civil liberties, then all this added \nsecurity is for naught because we would have lost what we value most, \nour freedom.\n  Again, I think the authors of this bill, especially Senator \nFeinstein, have made key improvements on issues of law enforcement \npowers and protecting core privacy concerns. I know not everyone is \ntotally pleased. But I think this bill has made important strides to \nbalance information sharing and privacy.\n  We all have been concerned that the business community has opposed a \nlot of key critical infrastructure elements of this bill. They fear \nstrangulation and over-regulation. They fear that they will open \nthemselves up to lawsuits if they participate in the program with the \ngovernment. These are valid concerns, and I have heard them from \nMaryland businesses. I think this new bill has made the most strides in \ntrying to accommodate business and\n\n[[Page S6781]]\n\nbuilding a voluntary framework to allow businesses to choose \nprotection.\n  Protection does not come without responsibility for participants, but \nI think this bill links the need for cyber security with appropriate \nliability protection and the expertise of our business community in a \nway that answers a lot of companies' concerns. We cannot eliminate all \ngovernment involvement in this issue. That won't work. And we will lose \nkey government expertise in DOD, FBI, and elsewhere. But we work to try \nto minimize it while maintaining government's role in protecting our \nnational security.\n  I am so proud that the Senate came together in a bipartisan way to \ndraft this legislation. The Senate must pass this legislation now. \nWorking together we can make our Nation safer and stronger and we can \nshow the American people that we can cooperate to get an important job \ndone.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, for 4 years, we have been pushing the \nUnited States Senate to pass a bill to improve our Nation's \ncybersecurity. During this time, the cybersecurity threat to our \ncountry--to our way of life--has only grown. We have now seen cyber \nattacks against our Nation's pipelines, against our financial industry, \nand even against nuclear power plants.\n  The good news is we have not yet suffered a devastating cyber attack. \nAt this point, we are still only talking about the potential impacts. \nWe have not yet suffered an attack that greatly disrupts our financial \nindustry, or an attack that cripples our electric grid. But these \npotential outcomes are real. And it is imperative that we begin \naddressing the risks.\n  Today, we have the opportunity to begin this important work by moving \nforward with the Cybersecurity Act of 2012. We have the opportunity to \nshow the American people that we can rise above politics to do the job \nthat they expect of us.\n  National security is one of our most sacred obligations as Members of \nthis body. If a vote on cybersecurity fails today, we will have failed \nto meet that obligation for the 112th Congress.\n  I will be the first person to admit that this bill is not perfect. I \nhave been clear that I believe a regulatory approach was the best \napproach to ensure that our country's most critical infrastructure \naddresses its cybersecurity vulnerabilities. We moved to a voluntary \napproach to seek a compromise. Yet it was not enough for some of our \ncolleagues. Frankly, I do not understand why.\n  I know the Chamber of Commerce decided that it did not like this \nbill. But sometimes we need to make decisions that the Chamber of \nCommerce is not happy with. Because it is not the Chamber's job to \nworry about national security. That is the job of our military. And \nthey have been quite clear about what is needed. They have told us that \nthey need this legislation. They have implored us to act. General \nAlexander, the Director of the National Security Agency, knows what is \nat stake. And his warnings have been dire.\n  He has said: ``The cyber threat facing the Nation is real and demands \nimmediate action.''\n  He has said: ``the time to act is now.''\n  General Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote me \na letter earlier this year about the urgent need for comprehensive \ncybersecurity legislation. In the letter, he explained that our: \n``adversaries will increasingly attempt to hold our Nation's core \ncritical infrastructure at risk.''\n  He stated that: ``we cannot afford to leave our electricity grid and \ntransportation system vulnerable to attack.''\n  Both Generals agreed that we must do something and they both pushed \nthe Senate to adopt comprehensive cybersecurity legislation that tracks \nthe specifics of the bill we have been debating. Despite this urgent \nadvice from our nation's top military advisors, that we need to act and \nthat we need to do it now, some Senators suggested in August that we \nneeded more time to debate cybersecurity. I strongly disagreed with \nthis notion. But now we have had another few months to think about this \nbill. Today, there is simply no more reason for delay.\n  We passed a Cybersecurity bill out of the Commerce Committee in March \n2010. And it passed unanimously. The Homeland Security Committee, led \nby Senators Lieberman and Collins, passed their cybersecurity bill by a \nvoice vote in June 2010. The bills both went through Committees well \nover 2 years ago. Since that time, we have had hundreds of meetings \nwith the private sector, interest groups, and national security \nexperts. Senators have received multiple classified briefings about the \nnature of this threat. Everyone has had plenty of time to think about \nthis issue. And we have made it quite clear that we are looking to \ncompromise on this legislation. But to compromise you need a partner. I \nam hoping that our Republican colleagues are now willing to be our \npartners on this legislation.\n  I hope that my colleagues will reconsider the path we are on. At some \npoint, if we do not do anything, there will be a major cyber attack and \nit will do great damage to the United States. After it is over, the \nAmerican people will ask, just as they asked after 9/11, what could we \nhave done to stop this?\n  If we do not pass this legislation, they will learn about days like \nthis one and their disappointment in us and the United States Senate \nwill grow. And we will deserve their disappointment. Because we have \nhad the opportunity to act and we have failed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you. Are there other speakers on our side? Let \nme ask the Chair to notify me when there is 10 minutes left in case \nSenator Collins comes or someone else. So I would like to have up to 10 \nminutes and be notified.\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak against revoting this cloture motion, \nand the main reason is that we are not going to be allowed to have \namendments. That is unacceptable because although we have worked \ndiligently with the sponsors of the cyber security bill on the floor, a \nnumber of the ranking members of the relevant committees that have \njurisdiction over cyber security have an alternative bill, the SECURE \nIT Act, that we would like to be able to put forward as an alternative \nor have an amendment process that would allow our approach to have a \nchance to prevail anyway.\n  Now, we are aware that the President is signaling his intention to \nissue an Executive Order, but an Executive Order is not sufficient to \nreally give the encouragement and the protection to the companies to \nallow them to share information with other companies that might have \nthe same types of threats in the same industry area or with the Federal \nGovernment. I am sorry we are not going to be able to have amendments \nthat would allow us to perfect this bill.\n  Let me say that the proponents of S. 3414 acknowledge that it is \nimportant to have a collaborative effort between the businesses that \nrun almost 90 percent of our Nation's critical infrastructure and the \nFederal Government. We agree with that, which is why we have worked \nwith the companies that run the private networks to fashion a bill that \nwould give them immunity if they share information and give them the \ndirect sharing capabilities to go directly to the defense agencies \nbecause we believe the agencies that work with the communications and \nthe military industrial base companies would have more of an \nunderstanding of the needs and what can be done to employ \ncountermeasures in a direct way. The bill that is on the floor, \nhowever, requires everything to go through the Homeland Security \nDepartment, and those of us who are supporting SECURE IT believe there \nshould be the ability to direction share information with other \nagencies including the defense agencies.\n  The sponsors of our bill are the ranking members of eight committees \nand subcommittees that have jurisdiction in this area: Senators McCain, \nChambliss, Grassley, Murkowski, Coats, Burr, Johnson, myself and \nMinority Leader McConnell. We believe the consensus items in our bill \nare preferable to the bill that is before us that we are not going to \nbe allowed to amend.\n  SECURE IT offers a balanced approach that will significantly advance \ncyber security in both the public and private sectors--first, to \nfacilitate\n\n[[Page S6782]]\n\nsharing of cyber threat information between the private sector and \ngovernment, allowing the information to go to the defense agencies \nwhere the response can be direct, not filtered through Homeland \nSecurity. Secondly, it gives immunity from liability for sharing among \nthe industries that might be affected as well as the defensive actions \nthat are taken. This is essential because you even need antitrust \nprotection if you are going to share vital information on this issue so \nthat you are not going to get sued for collaborating with a competitor. \nIt is in our country's interest, and I think our private sector \ncompanies want the ability to help secure all of our networks because \nwe know this is a real threat.\n  Secure IT has the overwhelming support of the network operators that \nare trying to gear up to defend against cyber threats. Because it will \nhelp their members protect their networks, we have the endorsement of \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce dated November 14 of this \nyear.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2012.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing the interests of more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector, and \n     region, continues to have serious concerns with S. 3414, the \n     ``Cybersecurity Act of 2012,'' including the related \n     manager's amendment, which was debated in the Senate before \n     the August recess.\n       The Chamber believes that Congress should approve a \n     workable cybersecurity bill focused on information sharing. \n     The waning days of a lame-duck session are hardly the \n     appropriate place to address the fundamental flaws in a bill \n     that remain unresolved since it was last on the Senate floor. \n     The underlying issues are simply too crucial to our economy \n     for treatment in a rushed legislative product.\n       First, there is a healthy and robust disagreement about the \n     proper role of government in regulating the business \n     community--given the incredibly dynamic nature of \n     cybersecurity risks--that is far from resolved. Title I of S. \n     3414 would create a National Cybersecurity Council that would \n     give federal departments and agencies overwhelming authority \n     over what actions businesses could take to protect their \n     computers and information systems.\n       Critical infrastructure owners and operators are concerned \n     that core threats to enterprise cybersecurity--including \n     nation states or their proxies, organized criminals, and \n     other nefarious actors--could go unchallenged because they \n     would be compelled to redirect resources toward meeting \n     government mandates. Indeed, any cybersecurity program must \n     afford businesses maximum input and flexibility with respect \n     to implementing best cybersecurity practices.\n       In addition, insufficient attention has been paid to the \n     likelihood of creating a well-intended program that, in \n     practice, becomes slow, bureaucratic, and costly. An \n     ineffective program would tie businesses in red tape but \n     would do little to deter bad actors. Businesses do not have \n     unlimited capital and human talent to devote to regulatory \n     regimes that are inadequately managed or out of date as soon \n     as they are written.\n       Second, the Chamber agrees with most lawmakers that federal \n     legislation is needed to cause a sea change in the current \n     information-sharing practices between the public and private \n     sectors. Title VII of the bill would actually impede the \n     sharing of information between business and government. The \n     bill's framework and strict definition of cyber threat \n     information would erect, not bring down, barriers to \n     productive information sharing.\n       Third, the liability ``protection'' provisions throughout \n     the bill need to be further clarified and strengthened. \n     Private-sector entities should be fully protected against \n     liability if they ``voluntarily'' adopt a federally directed \n     cybersecurity program and suffer a cyber incident. Strong \n     liability protections are essential to spur businesses to \n     share threat data with their peers and government partners.\n       Fourth, the ``Marketplace Information'' provision of S. \n     3414 seems intended to compel businesses that suffer from a \n     cybersecurity event to publicly disclose the occurrence. This \n     section of the bill would essentially ``name-and-shame'' \n     companies and could compromise their security. The Chamber \n     strongly rejects disclosing businesses' sensitive security \n     information publicly, and draws your attention to a June 2011 \n     letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the \n     Senate where the agency stated that investors have not asked \n     for more disclosure in this area.\n       Finally, the bill has not been scored, making the cost of \n     the bill unknown to lawmakers and to the public.\n       These are some of the Chamber's high-level concerns with S. \n     3414. The Chamber and our members have invested considerable \n     time and energy working with lawmakers to develop smart and \n     effective cybersecurity legislation. The business community \n     is fully prepared to work with Congress and the \n     Administration to advance efforts that would truly help \n     business owners and operators counter advanced and \n     increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.\n       Cybersecurity is a pressing issue that the Chamber remains \n     committed to addressing in a constructive way. Moving a \n     large, problematic bill within a short legislative timeframe \n     would not lay the necessary groundwork to help businesses \n     deflect or defeat novel and highly adaptive cyber threats. \n     Any new legislative program must foster timely and actionable \n     information, be dynamic in its execution, and promote \n     innovation in order to increase collective cybersecurity and \n     allow electronic commerce to grow.\n       The Chamber recognizes the leadership of the sponsors and \n     cosponsors of the bill on cybersecurity. We appreciate the \n     degree to which they have listened to the concerns of the \n     Chamber and the broader business community, and have sought \n     to address them in whole or in part. This legislation came \n     directly to the floor for consideration without proceeding \n     through regular order. Legislative hearings and a committee \n     mark-up of the bill would have properly allowed Senators who \n     have concerns with the bill to question experts and offer \n     amendments in order to improve the bill before a Senate floor \n     debate.\n       The Chamber appreciates the steps that the Administration \n     has taken to engage the Chamber on cybersecurity. Despite all \n     this engagement, and despite the best intentions of the \n     sponsors of S. 3414, it would be ill-advised to craft a \n     cybersecurity bill on the Senate floor during a lame-duck \n     session.\n       The Chamber strongly opposes S. 3414, the ``Cybersecurity \n     Act of 2012,'' and may consider including votes on, or in \n     relation to S. 3414 in our annual How They Voted scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                                               Government Affairs.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. We also have the endorsement of the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the American Fuel & Petrochemical \nManufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, US Telecom, the \nNational Retail Federation, Financial Services Roundtable, the Internet \nSecurity Alliance, and CTIA The Wireless Association.\n  We can come together to pass the areas of SECURE IT that would allow \nbetter cooperation and also an information sharing relationship that \nthey understand and know will help them defend against the cyber \nattacks. We believe SECURE IT is a superior bill, and we would like the \nability to amend the bill that is on the floor to perfect it so we \ncould send a bill to the House.\n  If we are not able to get this bill this year, certainly I hope it \nwill be started again with all of the relevant committees doing the \nmarkups, doing the discussion that is required for a bill of this \nmagnitude. Many of the committees did not have markups. They did not \nhave input into the bill. The committee process does work when we are \nable to use it, and I hope we will be able to go back to the drawing \nboard, or if the majority would allow amendments down the road, if we \nhave the time later this year, we would love to continue working with \nthe sponsors of the legislation to see if we could come up with the \namendments to which everyone could agree.\n  It has been a tough road. We have all tried hard. I think the \nsponsors of the bill are sincere in wanting to improve the systems. The \nranking members who have cosponsored SECURE IT, who also have \njurisdiction of this area, also are sincere. I hope we can come \ntogether, hopefully later this year, but if not, certainly in the new \nyear, with the new session, let's start from the beginning and go \nthrough all the committees of jurisdiction so there can be a real \nconsensus and a give-and-take.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 1 minute and not have the time taken out of the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to respond to the concern of my \nfriend from Texas that if cloture is granted on this motion, there will \nnot be an opportunity to amend the bill. I understand why she is saying \nthat, but I do want to say that Senator Reid has made it clear--I think \ntwice today--that if cloture is granted, he is open\n\n[[Page S6783]]\n\nto--he will allow amendments. He said he cannot allow endless \namendments because we are in a lameduck session with limited time but \nthat he will allow a finite number of amendments, if you will, on both \nsides.\n  So I want to assure my colleagues and appeal to my colleagues to vote \nto at least consider this measure. I mean, our cyber enemies are at the \ngates. In fact, they have already broken through the gates. The least \nwe can do is debate and vote on amendments to determine how we can \nstrengthen our cyber defense.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from \nTexas for reserving some time for me while I was at a briefing and on \nmy way to the floor. I will attempt to be very quick because I know our \ncolleagues are eager to vote on this important issue. And, Mr. \nPresident, that is my point. This is a critically important issue. How \nmany more warnings do we need to hear from the experts that we are \nextremely vulnerable to a cyber security attack? Cyber attacks are \nhappening every day.\n  Just recently there was an attack on several of our financial \ninstitutions. According to press reports, it was launched by Iranian \nsources. We know that Iran, Russia, and China are extremely active in \nprobing our cyber systems, including those that control our critical \ninfrastructure--not only our financial systems, our transportation \nsystems, our water treatment plants, but also our electric grid.\n  Recently we have seen what Hurricane Sandy, the superstorm, has done \nto States--so many States--destroying lives and property and leaving \npeople without power for days on end. Well, multiply that many times. \nIf it were a deliberate cyber attack that knocked out the electric grid \nalong the entire east coast, that is what we are talking about. That is \nthe kind of risk that calls us to act.\n  We have heard from the experts over and over again that this \nvulnerability is huge and escalating. We know that the number of cyber \nattacks that have been reported to the Department of Homeland Security \nhas increased by 200 percent in just the last year. And those are just \nthe attacks that have been reported. That is just the tip of the \niceberg. Undoubtedly, there are many more on our critical \ninfrastructure that have not been reported. We know there have been \nattempts to probe the security of the computer systems that run some of \nour natural gas pipelines.\n  This problem is very real, and it is not only a threat to our \nnational and homeland security, it is also a threat to the economic \nprosperity of this country. How many more thefts of research and \ndevelopment, of intellectual property of businesses right here in our \ncountry that are providing good jobs for Americans do we need to endure \nbefore we act to secure our cyber systems?\n  I have worked on the cyber security bill for years with my friend, \ncolleague, and chairman, Joe Lieberman. We have held countless \nhearings. We have marked up a previous bill. It is so ironic that we \nare being criticized for not doing yet another markup on this bill when \nall of the changes reflect our attempts to address the criticisms of \nthe opponents of this bill. We made a huge change by making this bill \nvoluntary rather than mandatory and by providing incentives such as \nliability protections for businesses that voluntarily agree to adopt \ncyber standards. We have created a system where there would be a \ncooperative process between the public and the private sectors to share \ninformation and to develop the best practices so that information can \nbe shared.\n  In all the time I have worked on homeland security issues, I cannot \nthink of another threat where our vulnerability is greater and where we \nhave failed to act and have done less.\n  This is not a Republican or a Democratic or an Independent issue. The \nexperts, regardless of their political leanings, from the Bush \nadministration to the current administration have urged us to act, have \npleaded with us to act.\n  General Alexander, the nonpartisan general who is the head of Cyber \nCommand and the head of the National Security Agency, has urged this \nCongress over and over again to give this administration, to give our \ncountry the tools it needs to protect critical infrastructure and to \nhelp safeguard our economic edge.\n  I urge our colleagues to listen to the wisdom of former Homeland \nSecurity Secretary Michael Chertoff and former NSA chief GEN Michael \nHayden from the previous administration, from President Bush's \nadministration. They wrote the following:\n\n       We carry the burden of knowing that 9/11 might have been \n     averted with the intelligence that existed at the time. We do \n     not want to be in the same position again when ``cyber 9/11'' \n     hits--it is not a question of ``whether'' this will happen; \n     it is a question of ``when.''\n\n  This time all the dots have been connected. This time we know cyber \nattacks are occurring each and every day. This time the warnings are \nloud and clear. How can we ignore these dire warnings? How? How can we \nfail to act on the cyber security bill, especially since the majority \nleader has indicated he is willing to allow for amendments, as he \nshould, to make this process fair. Germane amendments would be allowed.\n  I urge our colleagues to heed the warnings from the experts and to \nvote for cloture on the cyber security bill so we can proceed to its \nconsideration. I do not want to be here 1 year from now saying, why did \nwe not act? Why did we not listen to the cyber experts from the Bush \nadministration, from the Obama administration, from GEN Keith \nAlexander, the premier expert in our government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this is the first opportunity we will have \nhad since returning from the election to cast a vote on a meaningful \npiece of legislation. As legislation goes, it is about as meaningful as \nany we are going to come across for a while.\n  If we were in the minority and the Republicans were coming to the \nfloor and asking us to support moving to a bill so we could debate it, \noffer amendments to the bill, I would hope we would do that. For our \nRepublican friends who are fearful they are not going to have a chance \nto offer these amendments, Senator Lieberman, the chairman, the ranking \nRepublican Susan Collins and myself, all cosponsors of the bill, say we \nwill work very hard to make sure any amendments that are relevant and \ngermane to the bill can be offered, can be debated.\n  We worked a similar process with the postal bill. We ended up having \n50 or 60 amendments. They were not all relevant or germane. At the end, \nwe had a lot of amendments and the chance for everyone to be heard. \nSome of those amendments were not relevant or germane. As long as \namendments are relevant and germane to this underlying legislation on \ncyber security, we will work very hard to make sure they have their \nopportunity to be heard and to vote on their proposals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, although we have different views on this \nissue, I would yield 1 minute to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation \nfor Senator Lieberman's and Senator Collins' hard work. We have had \nsome disagreements. I still believe that if we could have, say, five \namendments that would be voted and debated, I think we could move \nforward with this bill. I truly believe that.\n  I would like to see, possibly even right after this vote, if we could \nreach some agreement between the leaders and ourselves that we could \nsay there would be five pending amendments and perhaps we could go \nahead and debate and vote on those. I, again, think we have some very \nsignificant differences, but the fact that the chairman and the two \ncochairmen or whatever they call themselves have worked incredibly hard \non this issue, they deserve debate. I hope they would understand we are \nseeking like five amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S6784]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in the remaining time, I appreciate \nwhat my friend from Arizona said. I not only join him in that request, \nbut I am confident because I have talked to Senator Reid about this--he \nsaid that if we invoke cloture tonight, he will allow a finite number \nof amendments. I do not want to encourage anyone. He said not 15. I \ntook that to be some number less than 15.\n  I think five amendments is well within the term ``finite.'' So I \nwould ask my colleagues, give it a chance, and let's vote for cloture. \nI am sure Senator Reid will allow five amendments.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the bill that was, and is, most important to \nthe intelligence community and to the Pentagon was just killed. I am \nspeaking of the cyber security bill.\n  I have had a number of people come to me during the day and say: Are \nyou going to allow relevant amendments on this? I said: Sure. They \nsaid: How about five? I said: Fine. But whatever we do on this bill, it \nis not enough for the Chamber of Commerce. It is not enough.\n  So everyone should understand, cyber security is dead for this \nCongress. What an unfortunate thing. But that is the way it is.\n  I filed cloture on the Sportsmen's bill yesterday. Unless we can \nagree to a limited number of amendments, we will have a cloture vote on \nthe bill early tomorrow morning, probably around 9 o'clock. If we get \ncloture, there will be a potential 30 hours of debate under the rules, \nas we all know too well. I have been told someone on the other side \nalso plans to make a Budget Act point of order against the Sportsmen's \nbill.\n  We have Members representing the States of New York and New Jersey \nwho are going to be in their States tomorrow because of the tremendous \ndamage caused by Sandy, but they will be back here tomorrow evening and \nwe will have a vote in the morning on cloture on the Sportsmen's bill, \nand then we could have votes later tomorrow or on Friday.\n  On DOD authorization--Senator Levin is here, Senator McCain was here \nearlier. I have had conversations with Senator Levin. I haven't spoken \nto Senator McCain this week but have spoken to him previously on a \nnumber of occasions. This is a bill we should get done. It is an \nimportant piece of legislation. I know we have the Defense \nappropriations bill at a later time, but this is something we have to \ndo now because it changes policy toward our fighting men and women \naround the world. It does a lot of good for them. We need to get this \nbill done, I repeat.\n  Probably what we are going to do is move to the bill. I don't know \nwhy in the world we have to file cloture on a motion to proceed to it. \nI don't quite understand that. But I haven't understood that about \nalmost 400 times the last few years. So what we are going to do, and \neveryone should understand--listen to this, everybody--we are going to \nmove to the bill. If we get permission to go to the bill, we will have \nan open amendment process on this bill. I have been assured by Senator \nLevin and Senator McCain, through Senator Levin, that on all these \nnonrelevant, vexatious amendments they will help us table them or \ndispose of them in some appropriate manner. And that is how we should \nlegislate around here.\n  I hope Senator McCain, after speaking to Senator Levin, will agree to \nmove forward on this bill. And that is my proposal. I hope it is \nsomething that everyone would agree to. We will start legislating on \nthis bill the day we get back after the Thanksgiving recess.\n  Mr. CARPER. Would the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. CARPER. I am pleased to hear the leader say he would be most \nwilling to allow the minority to offer five relevant, germane \namendments to the cyber security legislation. Literally within the last \n30 minutes we have had on the floor both the leader saying this, and I \nhave heard him saying it before, that a limited number of relevant \namendments--Senator McCain came to the floor, who, as you know, has not \nbeen anxious to support the bipartisan legislation developed by \nSenators Lieberman and Collins and others--but we have had one of the \nantagonists to that legislation and the majority leader both saying \nthat five relevant and germane amendments would be allowed for the \nminority to offer, so we could at least take up the bill, debate the \nbill. At the end of the day, we still need 60 votes to get the bill off \nthe floor.\n  I have heard so many of my colleagues say it is not a matter of if \nbut it is when, and I don't want us to leave and go home for \nThanksgiving with this hanging, if we could actually do something \nrelevant.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just so everyone listening to my friend \nunderstands--and he also has worked so hard on the bill that was just \nkilled--when he says it is not a question of if, it is when, he is not \ntalking about passing this bill, he is talking about a cyber attack, a \ngargantuan cyber attack on our country.\n  Here we are in this beautiful Capitol building today, and all around \nAmerica we have government officials and private sector officials who \nare trying to thwart the people trying to destroy businesses and parts \nof our country's infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S6785]]\n\n  As I have said here so many different times--and Senator Lieberman \nand Senator Feinstein, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee are \non the floor--the record is here. We have told everybody for months and \nmonths that something is going to happen. And we have laid the \ngroundwork, I am sorry to say, to blame you guys for not doing \nsomething to take care of this issue. It is a big issue and it is an \nimportant issue for our country. This should have nothing to do with \npartisan politics. And why the Chamber of Commerce is doing what they \nare doing is beyond my ability to comprehend.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6785-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6785-S6787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DOD INSPECTOR GENERAL OVERSIGHT FAILURE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am getting the runaround from the \ninspector general at the Department of Defense, and my remarks, which \nare fairly lengthy, will be connected with that problem I am having. \nWith sequestration looming on the horizon, Congress needs a truly \nindependent Department of Defense audit oversight capability. We need \nit to root out waste.\n  As my friend from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, knows all too well, \nrooting out Department of Defense waste is no easy task. His new report \nidentifies some excellent examples of waste ready for removal. I \ncommend Senator Coburn for his outstanding work and stand ready to help \nhim.\n  But to successfully root out waste day in and day out, there must be \na topnotch audit quality and capability in the hands of an inspector \ngeneral who is ready and willing to use it effectively.\n  I am reluctant to say this, but it needs to be said. I fear, and I \nsuspect, that the independence of the inspector general's audit \ncapability may have been compromised. I say this because of the story I \nam about to tell. This story is about a difficult audit, where the \ninspector general apparently got a bad case of weak knees and caved \nunder pressure. The inspector general dropped the ball on an audit that \nshould be a critical component in Secretary Panetta's good-faith effort \nto bring the Defense Department into compliance with the Chief \nFinancial Officers Act.\n  Today, the Department of Defense is the only Federal agency that \ncannot pass the test. So Secretary Panetta turned up the pressure. He \nwants to move the audit readiness date up to no more than 3 years from \nthe congressionally mandated date of 2017 to 2014. This is a daunting \ntask, which I spoke about here on the floor almost 12 months ago now, \non December 11 of last year. I say it is a daunting task because there \nis a big pothole in the road the Secretary faces that he may not know \nabout, hence the reason I am speaking.\n  The kingpin of this initiative--the Department's flagship accounting \nagency known as the Defense Finance and Accounting Service--may not be \nready to produce credible financial statements. It claims to have \nearned a clean opinion. Yet when its financial statements were put \nunder the inspector general's microscope, they were found to be very \nlacking. They did not meet the prescribed audit standards.\n  To make matters worse--far worse--all the evidence suggests the \ninspector general may have quashed this negative audit report, allowing \nthe charade to continue unchecked. This oversight failure could leave a \ngaping hole in Secretary Panetta's master plan.\n  Except for the Corps of Engineers, the Defense Finance and Accounting \nService handles all the Department's financial transactions. It should \nbe the foundation of Secretary Panetta's initiative. It was created \nover 20 years ago to clean up the Department's financial mess. It \nshould be exerting leadership in this arena and showing the rest of the \nDepartment how to balance the books. Its audit needs to be as clean as \na whistle. If the Department's central accounting agency can't earn a \nclean opinion, then who can earn a clean opinion?\n  Today the central accounting agency's claim of a clean opinion may be \nhollow. The inspector general, who is responsible for making those \njudgments, rejected that opinion. The inspector general reviewed it and \nconcluded that it did not pass muster. Unfortunately, the inspector \ngeneral dropped the ball and quit before the job was done.\n  The inspector general's report, known as a nonendorsement report, was \nfinalized but never signed and issued. It was simply buried in some \ndeep hole and covered with dirt. Were it not for whistleblowers who are \nin touch with my office, we might think the Defense Finance and \nAccounting Service's statements were somehow squeaky clean. I now have \nthe nonendorsement report and other relevant audit workpapers, and they \ntell a very different story.\n  The financial statements produced by smaller organizations, such as \nthe Defense Finance and Accounting Service, are audited by certified \npublic accounting firms. But this is always done under the watchful eye \nof the inspector general. In the end, the inspector general must \nvalidate those opinions produced by a CPA firm.\n  The firm Urbach Kahn and Werlin, UKW, examined the defense accounting \nagency's statements. It awarded an unqualified opinion or passing \ngrade. The inspector general, by comparison, reached a different \nopinion. It concluded that those statements did not meet standards. The \ninspector general announced that it would issue a nonendorsement \nreport, but that report was never issued.\n  That is why this Senator is here on the floor today. What happened to \nthe nonendorsement report? All the evidence appears to indicate that \nthe inspector general may have quashed the nonendorsement report. That \nassessment is based on a continuing review of all the pertinent \ndocuments. I would like to briefly review those facts so my colleagues \ncan understand where I am coming from.\n  Seven red flags have popped up on my radar screen.\n  Red flag No. 1. The contract, which governed the audits in question, \nis a good place to start because it sets the stage for what followed. \nThe contract was supposed to put the inspector general in the driver's \nseat. Section 3 of the contract clearly specifies that ``all \ndeliverables are subject to final Department of Defense Inspector \nGeneral approval.'' The opinion prepared by the public accounting firm \nwas the main deliverable. Two members of the inspector general's audit \nteam were designated as contracting officer representatives. They had \nexclusive authority to determine whether that opinion met audit \nstandards and deserved endorsement and to approve invoices for payment. \nUnfortunately, as I will explain, none of the parties involved showed \nmuch respect for this contract. In fact, when the crunch came, they \ntrashed it.\n  Red flag No. 2. The inspector general's decision memorandum and final \nversion of the nonendorsement letter, both dated February 16, 2010, \ncontain compelling evidence. The evidence points in just one direction: \nThere was a lack of credible audit evidence to justify a clean opinion. \nBoth the inspector general's audit team and its Quantitative Methods \nand Analysis Division reported major deficiencies in the CPA firm's \nwork. Once the inspector general determined that the CPA's audit \nopinion did not meet prescribed standards, the inspector general's \nrepresentative prepared a nonendorsement letter and instructed that \npayments on outstanding invoices be stopped. Those decisions \nprecipitated a classic bureaucratic impasse.\n  Red flag No. 3. The impasse came to a head at the Defense Finance and \nAccounting Service's audit committee meeting held on January 27, 2010, \nwhere three options were considered: first option, the IG would issue a \nnonendorsement letter; second option, the CPA firm would do more work \non accounts payable and undelivered orders issued; and third option, \nthe IG would do additional work. Just 1 day later, January 28, a senior \nofficial from the Inspector General's Office, Ms. Patty Marsh, \nannounced the results of the meeting. Ms. Marsh reported that a \nconsensus was reached: No additional work would be performed. She then \ndeclared that the\n\n[[Page S6786]]\n\nInspector General's Office would issue a nonendorsement letter.\n  Red flag No. 4. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service \nimmediately implemented a series of measures that appeared to bypass \nand eliminate oversight by the inspector general.\n  In what appeared to be overt defiance of the inspector general's \ndecision, the accounting agency's Director of Resource Management, \nElaine Kingston, in a letter to the accounting firm, unilaterally \ndeclared that her agency had ``proudly achieved an unqualified \nopinion.'' Kingston's letter was dated February 19. At that point, this \nopinion had been explicitly and unambiguously rejected by the inspector \ngeneral, and Kingston knew it. She also authorized that all disputed \ninvoices be paid. The invoices authorized for payment by Ms. Kingston \nwere the very same ones previously rejected by the inspector general's \ncontract officer representative. Their rejection was based on advice \nfrom the inspector general's legal counsel. Kingston's actions showed \nblatant disregard for the contract and authorized payments alleged to \nbe fraudulent.\n  Then, on April 15, the central accounting agency's contract officer, \nNormand Gomolak, effectively eliminated independent oversight by the \ninspector general. He issued a letter terminating the two inspector \ngeneral contract officer representatives. A known flaw in the contract \nallowed this to happen. Gomolak's termination order was retroactive to \nJanuary 27, 2010--the very same day the inspector general revealed its \nintention to issue the nonendorsement letter. It is as if Mr. Gomolak \nhad superhuman powers and could reach back in time and wipe the \nnonendorsement report clean off the slate, like it never really \nhappened. As one witness put it, ``DFAS virtually kicked us--the \nInspector General--out of the contract, and without so much as a \nwhimper from the duly designated junkyard dog.''\n  Red flag No. 5. Under the circumstances, the stop-work order blessed \nby the audit committee was not surprising. That it would be accepted \nand tolerated by the inspector general is astonishing indeed. The \nconsensus reached was between the three main targets of the audit: the \naccounting agency, the CPA firm, and the chief financial officer, who \nsupervises the central accounting agency--such a consensus, as it was. \nAll appeared to share one common goal: Just simply stop the audit. That \nis a predictable response from audit targets, especially if there is \nsomething to hide.\n\n  The inspector general's initial response was appropriate. The \nInspector General's Office expressed a willingness to do more work, and \nwhen it became evident that was not a viable option, it declared that a \nnonendorsement letter would be issued. Of course, those were good \nmoves. Unfortunately, however, the Inspector General's Office quickly \nbegan to backpedal and to align itself with the stop-the-audit \ncoalition. First, it issued a stop-work order to the audit team. That \noccurred February 4. Then on April 13 the IG informed the accounting \nagency by telephone that the nonendorsement report would not be issued. \nThis was, of course, a bolt out of the blue.\n  Red flag No. 6. In a letter to me dated May 26, the Inspector \nGeneral's Office attempted to provide a plausible explanation for why \nthis report never saw the light of day. First, the letter suggested \nthat a formal nonendorsement report was unnecessary because the \nInspector General's Office had already informed the audit committee of \nits decision to nonendorse the opinion. Is the inspector general \nimplying that Ms. Marsh's verbal nonendorsement announcement \nconstituted de facto or unofficial nonendorsement? If that is indeed \nthe case, then how come the central accounting agency still pretends to \nhave earned a clean bill of health? There is something wrong with this \nreasoning. Failing to issue the nonendorsement report left the opinion \nunder a dark cloud, where it remains today.\n  In addition, the inspector general also suggested that doing a mere 2 \nto 3 weeks of additional work to finalize the nonendorsement letter \nwould not have constituted a ``good use of audit resources''--that is, \nit would have been a waste of money. The need for 2 to 3 weeks of extra \nwork appears to be a real stretch. I have the nonendorsement letter. It \nwas finished. All it lacks is Ms. Marsh's signature.\n  More importantly, however, the Inspector General's Office does not \nseem to understand either the purpose or the importance of this audit \noversight project. For starters, I recommend the inspector general \ncheck section 7 of the contract. It states:\n\n       The DoD OIG will perform oversight of the Contractor's work \n     to support the decision about whether to endorse the \n     Contractor's opinion report.\n\n  That was the stated purpose of this costly audit project--to make a \ndecision on endorsement. From day one, however, this was a significant \neffort to resolve a difficult and sensitive question: Did the Defense \nFinance and Accounting Service deserve a clean opinion--yes or no? \nSince the focus of this audit was the kingpin of Secretary Panetta's \ninitiative in the first place, well, that makes this work inherently \nimportant.\n  Red flag No. 7 and the last red flag. One of my main concerns about \nthis entire matter is that it appears to point to a failure of \noversight. So I ask this question: Did the Inspector General's Office \ncave under pressure and surrender its oversight responsibilities? By \naccepting and tolerating the central accounting agency's actions, the \nOffice of the Inspector General appears to have allowed a Defense \nDepartment entity to effectively block its ability to perform one of \nits core missions; that is, auditing the books of a key defense agency. \nIf true, this would be a cardinal sin for the inspector general.\n  The central accounting agency allegedly violated the terms of the \ncontract. It allegedly made fraudulent payments, and it unilaterally \nterminated oversight. Yet, in the face of such blatant defiance, the \nInspector General's Office turned a blind eye to this challenge.\n  So you have to ask the question, Why did the IG just roll over? Why \ndid the IG fail to assert its independent audit authority? Stopping \nwork at this critical juncture does not appear to have been a \nresponsible oversight option. Why did top management fail to allow the \noversight team to finish its work and render a decision on the opinion? \nWhy quit when it was on the very edge of issuing a nonendorsement \nreport on the flawed opinion? Was that report quashed to spare the \nchief financial officer another black eye for the unending accounting \nscrewups or did the IG drop the ball because everyone involved knew \nthese financial statements were in such bad shape they could never pass \nthe test?\n  While we may never know the reasons for what happened, I feel certain \nabout one thing. On this audit, effective oversight collapsed. Congress \nand the citizens of this country need some answers, but one is \nparamount: Did the Defense Finance and Accounting Service earn a clean \nopinion? A simple yes or no. As the drive to audit readiness begins in \nearnest, and that is under Secretary Panetta's leadership, the \nSecretary and the Congress need a straight answer right upfront. \nLeaving it in limbo is unacceptable.\n  In closing, I would like to emphasize one point. My inquiry is about \nsome very important principles. True, the preparation of these \nfinancial statements and all the attendant audit work probably costs \nthe taxpayers somewhere between $10 and $20 million. To the average \nAmerican, those are big bucks. Since the audit came to nothing, waste \nsurely occurred. Any waste, whatever it is, is unacceptable.\n  But putting important principles at risk was as egregious as the \ndollar waste. What I am talking about are ethical standards, audit \nstandards, and the integrity of the audit process. Those standards must \nbe protected at all cost. That is one of the inspector general's jobs, \nto watchdog and follow those guiding principles.\n  The record appears to show that these standards got trampled and this \nmay have happened with the IG's knowledge and approval. That is what \nthe evidence appears to suggest so far. If the integrity and the \ncredibility of that process were undermined, then the effectiveness of \none of our primary oversight weapons would be gravely impaired. When \nand if those lines are crossed, the inspector general and anyone else \ninvolved would be treading on dangerous territory. If such \ntransgressions occurred, then there must be corrective action and \naccountability.\n\n[[Page S6787]]\n\n  When I complete this oversight investigation, I will submit a final \nreport to Secretary of Defense Panetta. It will contain findings and \nrecommendations for the Secretary's consideration. To facilitate this \nprocess, I ask Deputy Inspector General Halbrooks to answer all my \noutstanding questions promptly. In other words, I am getting tired of \nbeing jerked around.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \nrespected historian of my hometown of Louisville, KY, who has sadly \npassed away. Samuel Wilson Thomas died on Thursday, October 4, of this \nyear, at his home at the age of 74.\n  Louisville is a wonderful city, and I am always pleased to sing its \npraises. This is much easier to do thanks to the work of Mr. Thomas. He \nwrote 18 books touching on every corner of Louisville history, from the \nfamous Churchill Downs to the legendary Cave Hill Cemetery, from Oxmoor \nFarm to Crescent Hill.\n  Sam Thomas received his bachelor's degree and Ph.D. from the \nUniversity of Louisville. He is best known for serving as the first \ndirector and curator of Locust Grove, a National Historic Landmark that \nwas the home to George Rogers Clark, the founder of Louisville. Locust \nGrove also hosted three U.S. Presidents--Monroe, Jackson, and Taylor--\nand was a stopping point for famed explorers Meriwether Lewis and \nWilliam Clark upon their return from their expedition to the Pacific.\n  The log cabin at Locust Grove was Sam Thomas's home for two decades. \nIn his role as director and curator, he oversaw Locust Grove's \nrestoration with careful attention paid to the preservation of its \nhistory.\n  Mr. Thomas also taught at the University of Louisville, edited \nnumerous local publications, and published a host of articles. His role \nin preserving the history of Louisville and the legacy of its famous \ninhabitants was tremendous and will not be forgotten.\n  I know my colleagues join me in expressing gratitude for Sam Thomas's \nbody of work and in extending sympathies to his family, including his \nwife, Debbie; his brother and sister-in-law, Jim and Susanna; his \nniece, Sheena McGuffey; his nephews, Ian Thomas, Mason Thomas, and Cas \nMcGuffey; and many other beloved friends and family members.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an obituary for Mr. \nSamuel Wilson Thomas printed in the Louisville Courier-Journal be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Oct. 6, 2012]\n\n Samuel Wilson Thomas, 74, Died Thursday, October 4, 2012, at His Home\n\n       Born on January 21, 1938, in Chestnut Hill, Penn., Sam \n     moved to Louisville shortly after his graduation from \n     Chestnut Hill Academy. He received his B.A. (1960) and Ph.D. \n     (1964) in chemistry from the University of Louisville.\n       Although Sam taught for a short time at UofL, his life and \n     career were forever changed when he began his long \n     association with Locust Grove, overseeing its restoration and \n     serving as its first director and curator. The log house \n     there was his home for nearly two decades.\n       Sam is the author of 18 seminal books on Kentucky topics, \n     all meticulously researched and primarily focused on \n     Louisville: its neighborhoods, landmarks, and corporations.\n       His most recent work includes histories of St. Matthews, \n     Anchorage, the Cherokee Triangle, Crescent Hill, Oxmoor Farm, \n     Cave Hill Cemetery, and Churchill Downs, but the project \n     closest to his heart was an overview of early Louisville \n     architecture.\n       He edited numerous publications for the Courier-Journal's \n     book division and published many articles on a host of \n     Kentucky subjects. He also co-authored with his brother Jim \n     ``The Simple Spirit,'' a pictorial history of Shaker Village \n     of Pleasant Hill.\n       He was also involved in the restoration of the Jefferson \n     County Courthouse, the Ferguson Mansion headquarters of The \n     Filson Historical Society, and the 1785 log house at Oxmoor. \n     He was a founder of Preservation Alliance and the George \n     Rogers Clark Press, a member of the Louisville Landmarks and \n     Preservation Districts Commission, and archivist of Jefferson \n     County.\n       Sam is survived by his wife, Debbie; brother, Jim \n     (Susanna); niece, Sheena McGuffey; and nephews, Ian Thomas, \n     Mason Thomas and Cas McGuffey.\n       Sam chose cremation and requested that no funeral or \n     memorial service be held. The family will receive friends \n     from 4 to 7 p.m. Monday, October 8, 2012, in the Audubon Room \n     at Locust Grove, 561 Blankenbaker Lane.\n       Memorial gifts may be directed to Locust Grove or to the \n     University of Louisville Photographic Archives, to which Sam \n     gave his collection of photographs and research materials.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6787-3", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JOE LILES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I stand before you today to pay tribute \nto a man who has spent a significant amount of his life working for the \nKentucky Rural Water Association and the National Rural Water \nAssociation. Mr. Joe Liles helped in founding the Kentucky Rural Water \nAssociation in 1979. He has also been an employee of the National Rural \nWater Association since 1999, when he was first elected to the Board of \nDirectors.\n  He has progressed through numerous positions within the association, \nand as of September 2010, Mr. Liles has been President of the National \nRural Water Association.\n  I would like to congratulate Mr. Liles on his achievements. I would \nalso like to acknowledge the Kentucky Rural Water Association \nLeadership Award that Mr. Liles was given in 2008. He was presented \nthis prestigious award based on his exemplary service, leadership, and \ncommitment to Kentucky's water and wastewater utilities. Most recently, \nMr. Liles received the 2012 Man of the Year Award from the National \nRural Water Association.\n  After 38 years of dedication to the water systems of Warren, Butler, \nand Simpson counties, Mr. Liles retired in 2005 from his managerial \nposition. However, he currently serves as the utilities' community and \ngovernment relations assistant.\n  Mr. Joe Liles resides in Bowling Green, KY, with his wife, Sally, and \nhis four daughters. He is a grandfather to six. Liles earned his \nbachelor's degree with an area of concentration in management from \nWestern Kentucky University.\n  Mr. Liles has shown tremendous loyalty, devotion, and consideration, \nnot only to his job and career, but also to the Bluegrass State. I \nappreciate all that Mr. Liles has done for the Commonwealth of \nKentucky.\n  Mr. President, the National Rural Water Association recently \npublished an article about the accomplishments of Mr. Joe Liles, and I \nwould ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed as \nfollows:\n\n [From the National Rural Water Association Newsletter, Oct. 23, 2012]\n\n       The National Rural Water Association recently honored Joe \n     Liles as the 2012 Man of the Year. A long-standing leader in \n     rural water, Liles was honored during the Tribute to \n     Excellence awards ceremony, held on Sept. 24th in Nashville, \n     Tenn. Joe Liles, outgoing NRWA president and founding member \n     of the Kentucky Rural Water Association board of directors, \n     has served in numerous positions on the boards for both \n     Kentucky Rural Water and NRWA.\n       The Man of the Year Award is a prestigious award that \n     recognizes individuals for their many years of exemplary \n     service, leadership, and commitment to our nation's water and \n     wastewater utilities.

Mr. President, now that the elections are over, I renew my \ncall\n\n[[Page S6788]]\n\nfor all of us to come together to do what is right and to act in the \ninterests of the American people. We should come together to avert the \nfiscal cliff and the automatic cuts that will otherwise occur in \ndomestic and defense spending.\n  I am hopeful that, working together, Democrats and Republicans can \ncome to an agreement so that we can avoid sequestration. The automatic \ncuts from sequestration would further damage our Federal courts. \nAccording to the sequestration report released by the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the sequestration would lead to a $555 million \nreduction below fiscal year 2012 levels for our independent judiciary. \nThe impending across-the-board cuts under sequestration would reduce \nFederal court allotments to fiscal year 2006 levels, despite \nconsiderably higher caseloads. The impact of sequestration on Federal \ncourt operations nationwide could be devastating. It could result in \nthe Federal courts eliminating as many as 6,300 employees, about one-\nthird of their staff, or implementing court employees furloughs for \nmore than a month system-wide.\n  If we do not find a solution to both the vacancy crisis and the \nthreat to judicial resources, it will be harder for Americans to obtain \njustice in our Federal courts. Our courts are already overburdened, and \nthe sequester will result in cuts that will force courts to hear fewer \ncases, which means that court proceedings will be delayed even longer. \nThis will be especially damaging in civil cases, where there are \nalready over 40,000 cases that have been pending for more than 3 years. \nSequestration cuts could even result in the suspension of civil jury \ntrials. Even more alarming is what is at stake in the criminal context. \nIf probation and pretrial services offices are downsized or closed, \nFederal courts and their staff will be unable to properly supervise \nthousands of persons under pretrial release and convicted felons \nreleased from Federal prisons. It is critical, then, that we work \ntogether.\n  And we should complete the task of considering the judicial nominees \nwho have already had their hearings before the Senate recessed for the \nelections. There is no justification for holding up final Senate action \non these judicial nominations. These are not judgeships that \nRepublicans can claim they wish to keep open in order to be filled by \nnominees from President Obama's successor next year. The American \npeople have decided that President Obama will continue to lead our \nNation. In accordance with the will of the American people, it is time \nfor the obstruction to end and for the Senate to complete action on \nthese nominees so that they may serve the American people without \nfurther delay. Even Senate Republicans' contorted application of the \nThurmond Rule can no longer serve as any sort of rationale for \ninaction. Delay for delay's sake is wrong and should end. The Senate \nshould start by acting on the 19 judicial nominations that have been \napproved by the Judiciary Committee and have been awaiting final Senate \naction without further delay.\n  Two months ago, the Senate recessed without taking action on 19 \njudicial nominations. All were supported by their home State Senators, \nRepublican and Democratic. Almost all had bipartisan support. I cannot \nremember a time when the Senate refused to act on nominees with such \nbipartisan support. There was no precedent for the filibuster of Robert \nBacharach of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit and that filibuster should \nend. After Senator Coburn failed to vote for cloture to end the \nfilibuster of the Bacharach nomination last July, he indicated that he \nexpected Judge Bacharach to be confirmed before the end of the year if \nPresident Obama was reelected. The junior Senator from Texas also \nindicated that the circuit judges would be voted on if President Obama \nwas reelected. Well, now that the people of this country have spoken, \nwe should be working together to approve these judicial nominees so \nthey can provide justice for the American people.\n  I urge Senate Republicans to come together and work with us to \nconsider these judicial nominees without further delay. They should \nagree to debate and then to let the Senate vote on the nominations of \nJudge Patty Shwartz of New Jersey to the Third Circuit, Richard Taranto \nto the Federal Circuit, William Kayatta of Maine to the First Circuit, \nRobert Bacharach of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit, and the district \ncourt nominees from Connecticut, Maryland, Florida, Oklahoma, Michigan, \nCalifornia, New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. I am also working to \nhave the Judiciary Committee complete its consideration of five more \njudicial nominees who had their hearing in September. With the \nconfirmation of these nominees, we can eliminate the backlog here in \nthe Senate and take a significant step toward filling a good portion of \nthe judicial vacancies that have been plaguing our courts, including \nfilling over a dozen judicial emergency vacancies.\n  The president of the Hispanic National Bar Association wrote a letter \nto the Senate Leaders in September saying: ``The fact that Congress is \nadjourning without confirming these candidates is of great concern, and \nis a disservice to the Federal Courts and the people they serve.'' He \nwas right. Now that the election is over, let us come together as the \nSenate of the United States and make progress on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  The New York Times noted in an editorial last month entitled \n``Politics and the Courts'' that: ``During the Obama years, nominees \npresenting no ideological threat have been held up in the Republicans' \ncampaign of partisan attack and obstruction--even against trial judges. \n* * * The holdups have cost Americans dearly--in justice delayed (it \nnow generally takes two years to get a federal civil trial) and justice \ndenied.'' Now that the election is over, let us do what we can to \nmitigate the damage and move forward.\n  The number of judicial vacancies has, again, risen above 80. I have \nheard from judges around the country whose courts have vacancies. They \nare working hard to keep their courts functioning, but they need help \nto ensure that all Americans have access to courts and to justice. \nRecently, Professor Carl Tobias summed up the vacancy crisis that has \nbeen plaguing us for the last four years. Professor Tobias is right, \nand we need to expeditiously confirm our judicial nominees so they can \ndeliver justice for the American people. I ask consent that his full \narticle in The Hill, entitled, ``Obstruction in Senate Taking Its Toll \non the Courts,'' appear in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  We can begin to help address the vacancy crisis by confirming the 19 \nnominees who are currently waiting for final Senate action. The four \ncircuit court nominees have each been waiting at least 5 months for a \nvote. One has been stalled for more than 8 months. The 15 district \ncourt nominees have all been waiting at least 3 months, with some \nstalled for as long as 7 months.\n  The Republican Senator from Pennsylvania wrote a letter to the \nMajority leader and Senator McConnell asking that the two nominees for \nthe Middle District of Pennsylvania be considered. I want to see those \nnominees, as well as the dozen whose Senate votes have been delayed \neven longer, and all the judicial nominees who have had a hearing, \nacted upon by the Senate.\n  The Senate should not continue down the path of unprecedented \nobstruction and delay. President Obama had not sought to pick an \nideological fight with the Senate on judicial nominees as his \npredecessor had done. By way of example, the Republican Senators from \nOklahoma have said that they support Robert Bacharach, and the \nRepublican Senators from Maine strongly support William Kayatta. It is \nunprecedented to have this many consensus judicial nominees not acted \nupon before the election recess in a presidential election year.\n  The American people deserve better, and I know the Senate can do \nbetter. After the midterm election in 2002, Senate Democrats worked \nwith Senate Republicans to confirm 20 of President Bush's judicial \nnominees in 1 week, including 18 in just 1 day. Again, in 2010, the \nSenate proceeded to confirm 19 judicial nominees during the lameduck \nsession after the election. Unfortunately, Republican delays in 2010 \nhad backlogged 38 judicial nominees and the confirmations of 19 went \nonly halfway to what we should have done.\n  When Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush were \nPresident, Senate Democrats cleared the calendar of all but the most \ncontroversial and extreme ideological judicial\n\n[[Page S6789]]\n\nnominations. The Senate needs to be allowed to vote on President \nObama's judicial nominees now so that our Federal courts are better \nable to function and fulfill the fundamental guarantee of providing \naccess to justice. I hope that now that President Obama has been \nreelected, Senate Republicans will work with us to fill these \nlongstanding judicial vacancies. The American people deserve no less.\n  When an injured plaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her \nmedical expenses, or when two small business owners disagree over a \ncontract, they should not have to wait years for a court to resolve \ntheir dispute. Americans are rightfully proud of our legal system and \nits promise of access to justice and speedy trials. This promise is \nembedded in our Constitution. When overburdened courts make it hard to \nkeep this promise, the Senate should work in a bipartisan manner to \nhelp.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Hispanic National Bar Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: On behalf of the Hispanic \n     National Bar Association (HNBA), which represents the \n     interests of the 100,000 Hispanic attorneys, judges, and law \n     professors in the United States and Puerto Rico, we write \n     expressing our concern that Congress is adjourning without \n     confirming the remaining Latino nominees and HNBA endorsed \n     nominees pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. As a bar \n     association, one of our greatest priorities is to advocate \n     for a diverse judiciary and legal profession, and we believe \n     that having a judiciary that is reflective of the citizenry \n     should be one of Congress' priorities.\n       Fernando Olguin and Jesus Bernal, who have been nominated \n     for seats in the Central District of California, and William \n     Kayatta, who has been nominated to the First Circuit in \n     Maine, are all highly qualified, noncontroversial candidates \n     with bipartisan support who were voted out of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee by voice. Despite their qualifications \n     and the lack of any substantive opposition to their \n     nominations, they have been pending on the Senate calendar \n     for months--Mr. Olguin and Mr. Bernal for over two months, \n     and Mr. Kayatta for over five months--waiting to be \n     confirmed. This is especially concerning considering both Mr. \n     Bernal and Mr. Olguin are nominated to seats that have been \n     deemed judicial emergencies, and Mr. Kayatta is nominated for \n     the First Circuit. The fact that Congress is adjourning \n     without confirming these candidates is of great concern, and \n     is a disservice to the Federal Courts and the people they \n     serve.\n       It is of utmost importance for the operational capacity and \n     overall integrity of our judicial system that we appoint and \n     confirm quality and experienced individuals to serve in the \n     Federal judiciary in a timely manner. Given the number of \n     judicial emergencies and growing caseloads across the \n     country, the need to fill vacancies efficiently and \n     expeditiously has become paramount. It is of vital importance \n     that qualified, noncontroversial nominees are confirmed as \n     quickly as possible. With that, we again urge your \n     consideration of the Latino nominees and HNBA endorsed \n     nominees currently pending on the Senate Calendar.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Peter M. Reyes, Jr.,\n\n                             National President, Hispanic National\n     Bar Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 16, 2012]\n\n                        Politics and the Courts\n\n       The winner of the presidential election will have scores of \n     federal judgeships to fill and the chance to shape the \n     courts--even aside from potential Supreme Court vacancies \n     should one or more of the current justices retire.\n       After a slow start, the Obama administration picked up the \n     pace in filling judgeships, but it will end up with more \n     vacancies on Election Day than the day the president took \n     office. Currently, 32 positions, considered ``judicial \n     emergencies'' by court administrators, are unfilled, creating \n     heavy workloads for judges on those courts.\n       On the federal appeals courts, the final arbiters on all \n     but the tiny percentage of cases decided by the Supreme \n     Court, there are now 14 judgeships open out of 179 total \n     seats. With about six judges a year taking senior status, \n     working only part time, the next president could have as many \n     as 40 appellate openings to fill by the end of 2016.\n       On the trial courts, which resolve around 325,000 cases a \n     year, six times the number of appeals court cases, there are \n     now 62 vacancies out of 677 positions.\n       Much of the problem, of course, has been the broken \n     confirmation process in the Senate, where Republicans have \n     used the filibuster to block judicial nominees for no reason \n     except to prevent President Obama from filling the seats. In \n     the next Congress, the Senate should ensure every nominee an \n     up-or-down vote within 90 days.\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia, one of the nation's most important courts, has \n     suffered particularly in this process, with three unfilled \n     seats and no judge confirmed for the court since 2006.\n       Politicization has also crept into the process for \n     approving district court nominees. In the 101st Congress in \n     1989 and 1990, 96 percent of the district court nominees \n     picked by President George H. W. Bush were confirmed, and the \n     confirmation process took on average just 77 days. Twenty \n     years later, only 56 percent of President Obama's nominees \n     were confirmed and the process took on average 174 days.\n       During the Obama years, nominees presenting no ideological \n     threat have been held up in the Republicans' campaign of \n     partisan attack and obstruction--even against trial judges \n     whose decisions are rarely ideological and can be appealed.\n       The holdups have cost Americans dearly--in justice delayed \n     (it now generally takes two years to get a federal civil \n     trial) and justice denied. It is time to adopt a more \n     efficient, less political approach to district court \n     confirmations. The courts must be brought to full strength so \n     they can meet the demands for justice. The next president and \n     the new Senate should make reforming the confirmation process \n     a paramount priority.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [The Hill's Congress Blog, Oct. 31, 2012]\n\n           Obstruction in the Senate Takes Its Toll on Courts\n\n                            (By Carl Tobias)\n\n       Halloween is the perfect occasion for analyzing scary \n     federal judicial selection with three judges assuming senior \n     status on October 31. The bench experiences 83 vacancies in \n     the 858 appellate and district judgeships. The openings first \n     spiked to 90 in August 2009 and have since remained near ten \n     percent. These empty seats are ghost-like apparitions that do \n     nothing to resolve huge caseloads. Thus, President Barack \n     Obama must promptly nominate, and the Senate expeditiously \n     confirm, lower court nominees, or the nation will confront \n     the nightmare of a judiciary that cannot deliver justice.\n       Since 1987, Republican and Democratic accusations, \n     countercharges and paybacks have haunted selection mainly \n     because of divided government. Democrats now control the \n     White House and the Senate. However, the party should \n     continue cooperating with Republicans to reduce these \n     counterproductive dynamics because the process has stopped \n     until the November lame duck session.\n       President Obama has vigorously consulted with Republican \n     and Democratic senators from states where vacancies \n     materialized before actual nominations. Obama has proffered \n     uncontroversial nominees, of even temperament, who are smart, \n     ethical, diligent and independent and diverse in terms of \n     ethnicity, gender and ideology.\n       Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Judiciary Committee \n     chairman, has rapidly conducted hearings and votes, \n     condemning (sending) nominees to unending nights of the \n     living dead on the floor where many languished over months. \n     For example, in late September, the Senate confirmed two \n     nominees, although it could easily have voted on another 19 \n     nominees with committee approval. Indeed, the Senate recessed \n     without considering any of those well qualified nominees, \n     most of whom the committee reported absent substantive \n     opposition, because the GOP refused to vote.\n       Republicans should stop their tricks and treat the process \n     more cooperatively. The primary bottleneck has been the \n     floor. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the minority leader, \n     has played the role of Dracula, sucking the lifeblood out of \n     qualified nominees' candidacies by rarely agreeing to final \n     votes. Even the dreaded Ninth Circuit nominee Goodwin Liu--\n     whom McConnell and his colleagues outrageously characterized \n     as the Second Coming of Earl Warren and refused any vote--has \n     proved to be a remarkably mainstream California Supreme Court \n     Justice. Most problematic has been Republican rejection of \n     votes on noncontroversial strong nominees, inaction that \n     violates Senate customs. When the chamber has ultimately \n     voted, it has approved many nominees unanimously or by \n     substantial majorities.\n       The 179 appellate judgeships, 15 of which are open, are \n     crucial because the dozen circuits are courts of last resort \n     in their regions for 99 percent of appeals. Obama has \n     proposed seven exceptional nominees, and he should keep \n     working with Leahy and Senator Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the \n     majority leader, who arranges floor votes, and their \n     Republican counterparts to facilitate smooth confirmation \n     while nominating strong candidates for the eight openings \n     that lack nominees. On June 13, the GOP leadership invoked \n     the ``Thurmond Rule,'' which masqueraded as a binding \n     mandate, saying it would oppose votes on all appellate \n     nominees until the election. Because this notion does not \n     apply to excellent, consensus nominees, like First, Tenth, \n     and Federal Circuit nominees William Kayatta, Robert \n     Bacharach and Richard Taranto, the Senate must vote on them \n     soon.\n       The 679 district judgeships, 68 of which are open, are \n     essential, as district judges conduct federal trials and \n     ascertain the facts, while appeals courts uphold 80 percent \n     of\n\n[[Page S6790]]\n\n     lower court decisions. Obama has nominated 27 excellent \n     individuals and must quickly suggest candidates for the 41 \n     vacancies without nominees. For its part, the Senate must \n     swiftly confirm nominees.\n       The vacancies in 83 judgeships resulting from GOP \n     obstruction have, like Dr. Frankenstein, created monstrous \n     dockets that jeopardize expeditious, inexpensive and fair \n     case resolution. Thus, President Obama must promptly \n     nominate, and senators rapidly confirm, numerous superb \n     judges, so the courts can deliver justice.

Mr. President, today I am proud to call to the Senate's \nattention the record of accomplishment of a military officer who has \nretired after 33 years of outstanding service to the Vermont Air and \nArmy National Guard.\n  LTC Lloyd Goodrow served five Adjutant Generals. He distinguished \nhimself in the position of State Public Affairs Officer. Through \ndiligence, honesty, and integrity he forged a strong and \nstraightforward relationship with the media and the Vermont \nCongressional Delegation.\n  In the years after the attacks of September 11, 2001, Lieutenant \nColonel Goodrow provided strong, meaningful support to deployed troops \nand their families. He helped Vermonters to make a human connection to \nthe Guard during this difficult time. His empathy and deep \nunderstanding of the tragedy and suffering of Gold Star families not \nonly aided those families in the healing process but left a lasting \nimpression on Lloyd.\n  Lloyd is an outstanding family man. Marcelle and I are fortunate to \ncount as friends Lloyd, his wife Margo, and their son Daniel. Daniel \nhas been recognized at the State and national level for his swimming in \nthe Special Olympics. Like his parents, he has been a strong advocate \nfor people with special needs.\n  In recognition of Lieutenant Colonel Goodrow's service to our country \nand to our State of Vermont, I ask that an article, ``Spokesman for Vt. \nNational Guard retires,'' written by Matt Ryan in the November 1, 2012, \nedition of the Burlington Free Press, be entered into the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [The Burlington Free Press, Nov. 1, 2012]\n\n                   Goodrow Reflects on 33-Year Career\n\n                             (By Matt Ryan)\n\n       Lt. Col. Lloyd Goodrow said during his tenure as spokesman \n     for the Vermont National Guard, he has considered reporters \n     and soldiers alike his colleagues.\n       ``It's easier if you have a relationship with the media, \n     and you understand where each other came from,'' Goodrow \n     said. ``Have we always agreed? No. Have we agreed to \n     disagree? Yes.''\n       Goodrow, 58, of Essex Junction retired at midnight \n     Wednesday, ending a 33-year career with the Vermont National \n     Guard. He said his next order of business is to find a new \n     job.\n       ``Today's bittersweet,'' he said earlier on Halloween. ``I \n     walk out of here tonight at midnight. The joke is I'm turning \n     into a pumpkin.''\n       The University of Vermont graduate worked much of his \n     career with the Guard in public affairs. He typed his first \n     news release in 1987, about a man who built a cheap device \n     that could detect infrared light for the U.S. military. The \n     story circulated nationally for two years, he said.\n       Goodrow has since spoken on behalf of soldiers who deployed \n     to Iraq and Afghanistan and returned home to rebuild Vermont \n     in the wake of Tropical Storm Irene.\n       ``The hardest thing was dealing with the deaths of \n     soldiers,'' he said. ``The first time I looked into the eyes \n     of a gold star mother, it changed my life forever.''\n       That was the mother of Vermont Army Guard Spec. Scott \n     McLaughlin, a 29-year-old husband and father of two from \n     Hardwick who was shot and killed by a sniper in Iraq in 2005.\n       Goodrow said he helped the family gather photos of \n     McLaughlin for the media and later convinced them to allow \n     reporters in the church for the funeral services.\n       ``The media is there to represent the community, and to \n     help the community as well,'' he said. ``I reminded them that \n     you help the community mourn.''\n       Goodrow said he leaves media relations in the good hands of \n     Capt. Chris Gookin. Gookin stood to lead the Guard's public \n     affairs office upon Goodrow's retirement.\n       ``It's important that the public knows who we are, what we \n     represent and what we can do for them,'' Goodrow said. \n     ``Because we belong to the people. We belong to the public.''\n       Goodrow's retirement party is scheduled for noon Thursday \n     at the American Legion in Colchester. His formal retirement \n     ceremony is slated for 2 p.m. Sunday at the Green Mountain \n     Armory at Camp Johnson.\n       ``I really have been blessed,'' he said. ``I've been part \n     of a group that's been second to none.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6790-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6790-S6791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING ETHAN ALLEN FURNITURE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of Vermont's premier businesses is \ncelebrating its 80th anniversary this year. Ethan Allen Furniture has \ncome to represent the very highest standards and quality that Vermont \nhas to offer.\n  In 1932, two brothers-in-law from New York City established a \nwholesale company that sold small housewares. Four years later, they \npurchased a bankrupt furniture factory in Beecher Falls, VT, and began \nmanufacturing early American furniture branded as the Ethan Allen line. \nThey eventually renamed the company after Ethan Allen, a Revolutionary \nWar hero who played an integral role in America's fight for \nindependence and Vermont's admission to the Union as the 14th State.\n  Over the years, Ethan Allen Furniture has grown into one of the \nworld's most prominent furniture makers and interior design \nspecialists, with over 300 stores worldwide and manufacturing centers \naround the globe.\n  This world-renowned company has remained close to its Vermont roots \nand continues to employ many Vermonters because of their unique talent \nand experience in finely crafted furniture. It was great to see that \nthe company's president, CEO, and chairman, Farooq Kathwari, recently \nvisited with employees at the Orleans, VT, facility to celebrate the \ncompany's anniversary and its return to profitability.\n  I congratulate Ethan Allen Furniture on this monumental anniversary, \nand I wish them much success in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the September 26, 2012, Caledonian \nRecord article entitled ``Ethan Allen Celebrates 80 Years'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Caledonian Record, Sept. 26, 2012]\n\n                    Ethan Allen Celebrates 80 Years\n\n                            (By Robin Smith)\n\n       Ethan Allen CEO, President and Chairman Farooq Kathwari \n     praised his employees in Vermont Tuesday afternoon and \n     announced performance raises as part of the company's 80th \n     anniversary.\n       Ethan Allen plants in Orleans and Beecher Falls are \n     profitable now for the first time since the Great Recession, \n     Kathwari told employees who gathered in a plant storage \n     facility at the Orleans facility to eat cake and celebrate.\n       The company wanted to begin the big anniversary celebration \n     in Vermont where it began 80 years ago in Beecher Falls.\n       This morning, Kathwari and Ethan Allen officials will ring \n     the bell to open the New York Stock Exchange. And in the next \n     several weeks, the company will unveil a new line of American \n     furniture and launch a marketing campaign, Kathwari said.\n       The company converted its operation in Orleans and \n     elsewhere from mass production to custom-manufacturing over a \n     year and a half, he said. The profitability and efficiency in \n     Orleans is up 30 to 40 percent in the last two years, he \n     added.\n       And now, instead of buying products from China, Kathwari \n     said Ethan Allen is selling its furniture to China.\n       Ethan Allen received a fairly large order from China last \n     year and has retail stores there.\n       ``You folks will make orders for China. Think of that,'' he \n     said.\n       ``If someone had said . . . we would make lamps for China, \n     we would have said `That's crazy.' ''\n       Kathwari invited a select group of company retailers, \n     marketers, designers, board members and initial investors, \n     plus local legislators, to a tour of the Orleans plant before \n     he spoke to employees. Kathwari recognized long-time \n     employees at the plant, one of whom had been at the plant for \n     53 years and introduced company leaders who had longevity \n     with the company.\n       That's how Ethan Allen has survived 80 years and grown, he \n     said, because experience and longevity allows nimble \n     adaptability. ``To be around for 80 years, you have to by \n     plan or by accident reinvent it,'' he said.\n       Ethan Allen survived the Great Depression, he said, and now \n     the Great Recession.\n       The company kept 70 percent of its manufacturing in the \n     U.S., Kathwari said, ``which is remarkable.''\n       The company is committed to the Orleans plant, where 320 \n     employees make tables, chairs and other furniture that has \n     the name of the customer on the bar code label. Each piece \n     being manufactured in Orleans is already sold ``and our \n     people know it,'' Kathwari said.\n       The Orleans staff have tremendous experience and knowledge, \n     the Orleans and Beecher\n\n[[Page S6791]]\n\n     Falls plants have technological improvements from ongoing \n     investments over the years and the area has the best \n     sustainable hardwood resources in the world, he said.\n       Because of these things and the productivity and quality in \n     Orleans, Kathwari announced the reintroduction of performance \n     raises this year.\n       ``Those who have done a good job will get an increase,'' he \n     said.\n       He said the new plant in Honduras, like the Mexican plant, \n     turns raw resources into materials for the upholstery \n     manufacturing plant in North Carolina, he said.\n       Without that Mexican plant, Ethan Allen would not have been \n     profitable during the recession, he said.\n       The company's vertical integration, from bringing in raw \n     wood at Beecher Falls, to wood work in Orleans to the \n     company's own stores and interior designers, means it was \n     able to survive and change in reaction to globalization and \n     mass market changes.\n       The company is public but is fortunate in being able to \n     think long term, Kathwari said, noting that he has served as \n     CEO for 40 years.\n       Challenges remain for the company in Vermont, including the \n     high price of electricity, at two times that in North \n     Carolina and three to four times that of overseas where the \n     price is kept down by government, he said.\n       Also the increasing cost of health care is a concern, he \n     said.\n       The founders bought the Beecher Falls wood plant and \n     renamed it Ethan Allen, a mark of the colonial American \n     furniture the company made.\n       Kathwari said the company will unveil five new American \n     lifestyle lines of furniture, from modern to classic--\n     reflecting the global style of America today. Sneak peeks \n     were available from the classic-lined wood chairs and tables \n     and headboards, in Fiesta Ware type colors, and other \n     beautiful pieces in various stages of construction at the \n     plant Tuesday.\n       He hopes to see sales continue to increase, as they have \n     for the past two years, he said by about 15 percent each \n     year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6791-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6791-S6792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RITA MARKLEY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, homelessness is not something found only in \nlarge urban areas or that is isolated to city limits; it is just as \neasily found in small towns and rural areas. Vermont, like the rest of \nthe Nation, struggles each day with homelessness. It is estimated that \nin any given year, there are 4,000 homeless Vermonters, and on any \ngiven night, children, as well as adults, find refuge in a shelter.\n  The Committee on Temporary Shelter, known in Vermont as COTS, has \nbeen serving the homeless in Chittenden County since 1982. While COTS \nrelies on the talents of more than 60 dedicated staff members, it is \nthe tireless leadership of their executive director, Rita Markley, that \nis the heartbeat of this critically important organization.\n  I have been so proud of the work of Rita and COTS in their service to \nthe people of Chittenden County. During her time with COTS, Rita has \nworked tirelessly to provide emergency shelter to those in need, while \nadvocating for long-term solutions to end homelessness. Beyond \nproviding emergency shelter for those in need, COTS' prevention program \nextends a crucial safety net for those on the brink of losing their \nhomes.\n  Under Rita's leadership more than 100 families found shelter through \nCOTS in 2011, including 115 parents and 122 children. Since 2008, COTS' \nprevention program has helped 1,264 people to stay in their apartments \nand has stopped 55 foreclosures.\n  Rita is known throughout Vermont for her overwhelming generosity, \ntireless determination, and sharp sense of humor. She truly embodies \nthe Vermont spirit, dedicating herself to helping her neighbors and \nreminding us that we are all in this together. Vermont is truly lucky \nto call Rita Markley one of our own.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of an article from September 20, \n2012, entitled, ``Innovation, and passion, in the nonprofit world,'' \nfrom The Burlington Free Press, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Sept. 20, 2012]\n\n Innovation, and Passion, in the Nonprofit World--Rita Markley of COTS \n Talks About the Importance of Partnerships in a World of Great Need, \n                             Limited Funds\n\n                            (By Lynn Monty)\n\n       Work is missed when children get sick. Gas for trips to the \n     doctor's office is costly. Rent payments become late, and \n     medical bills loom. Homelessness strikes after a long list of \n     setbacks in a person's life . . . a family's life.\n       Unforeseen expenditures happen to everyone, but when they \n     come about on a fixed income it can cause a domino effect of \n     devastation. Financial insecurity has plagued households \n     nationwide since the economic downturn, and Burlington is no \n     exception.\n       Rita Markley, 53, of Burlington knows all too well what our \n     community has had to endure. She is executive director of the \n     Committee on Temporary Shelter, where she's tasked daily with \n     providing distressed people with emergency shelter and \n     services, but her ultimate goal is to find long-term \n     solutions to end homelessness altogether.\n       More than a hundred families stayed in COTS shelters in \n     2011. This included 115 parents and 122 children. An average \n     of 53 people a day used the COTS Daystation, the only drop-in \n     center for homeless adults in Chittenden County, before a \n     storm flooded the Daystation in July.\n       Among her myriad responsibilities, and scrambling to find a \n     new home for the much needed community resource before snow \n     flies, surprisingly, Markley finds time to laugh.\n       Humor is part of the fuel she needs to forge ahead, to \n     build community partnerships, and to get through tough times. \n     ``You might as well have fun while you are doing what you \n     do,'' she said. ``Laughter is a way to connect, and you feel \n     better when you laugh. It makes you feel alive.''\n       We spoke to Markley about these philosophies, her life and \n     her innovations at the nonprofit in an interview at her North \n     Avenue office on Sept. 5. A fuller version of this interview \n     is available online at BurlingtonFreePress.com.\n       Burlington Free Press: What does an average day look like \n     for you at COTS?\n       Markley: Very few days look the same. That's what I love \n     about this job. Some days it's meetings with community \n     partners, other days is brainstorming with staff, writing \n     reports, looking at our numbers. I stay in touch with the \n     people we serve. I advocate to fix problems that put \n     ridiculous burdens on struggling families.\n       In the past five weeks, I've been running to every last \n     corner of Burlington looking for a new Daystation.\n       Our whole approach isn't about how we help the homeless, \n     that is the wrong premise, it's about how we can end \n     homelessness. What can we do so that 20 years from now people \n     don't need shelters in the first place?\n       BFP: What fuels your passion?\n       Markley: It's an underlying belief that everybody has \n     infinite promise, and potential, and that they deserve a \n     chance to try to reach that.\n       I spent the first five years of my life in an orphanage. I \n     know I would be a very different person today without the \n     volunteers who would come and rock the babies and read to us. \n     They came three or four times a week to make us feel loved \n     and special. I think I would have been one of those kids who \n     could have otherwise fallen through the cracks, or given up, \n     before I had even stepped out the door.\n       I was very lucky to be adopted by the Markleys. It was a \n     privileged household, but I remember well what holidays are \n     like when you don't have a home, like the home you read about \n     in storybooks. Or when you feel embarrassed because of the \n     fact you are an orphan.\n       When I think of the kids there, I still remember their \n     names. I remember who we were and how much useful creativity, \n     imagination and joy every single one of us had. We were \n     encouraged when we could have been shut down. The volunteers \n     and staff there really cared about what they were doing, and \n     launched us into lives that became meaningful.\n       I know when you don't get the opportunities for college and \n     travel and exposure that I was given by the Markleys, you can \n     start out with that bright shining light, and it gets darker \n     and darker as each year passes by, and you stop believing \n     that there are better things that are possible for you. This \n     underlies everything that I am.\n       I have never been a woe-is-me kind of person. I believe in \n     joy, touching that joy, and touching what is most wonderful \n     in humans who have the capacity to care about each other when \n     we don't have to. There is no reason that most of the \n     volunteers need to come to a place like COTS every day, but \n     they do because they can't bear the idea that somebody is \n     going to sleep in a car, or not have a chance without their \n     support.\n       BFP: How would Burlington be different without COTS?\n       Markley: I believe in working toward a world where \n     everybody gets a chance. A lot of the work and the way we do \n     things at COTS is driven from the principles of finding that \n     strength, that spark, to help people believe again that more \n     is possible for them than simply a shelter bed and hoping \n     they will have enough food day to day. To help them see that \n     you cannot only survive, but have a rich life.\n       Without the work we do every day, Burlington would be a \n     place with shelter upon shelter upon shelter with people \n     never getting out in front of it. It takes so long to save \n     for a security deposit, especially when you are only bringing \n     in $400 a week or less. We help people with this.\n       In 2008, COTS launched an innovative new prevention program \n     with $250,000 that we had been fundraising since 2005. We got \n     tired of\n\n[[Page S6792]]\n\n     seeing so many people miss paying rent because the alternator \n     on their car went, or had to miss work because of a sick \n     child. Homelessness is often the result of this unraveling.\n       The trajectory was so clear. Incomes were flat, or going \n     down, and rents were going up. Utilities were skyrocketing, \n     gasoline was going up, and it was a housing market where if \n     you lose your place, there are 10 other people who want it. \n     We saw this and started raising money.\n       Our goal in mind was to keep families whole, helping them \n     keep in good financial standing and to regain their footing. \n     We kept 293 families in their homes that first year.\n       Since 2008, COTS' prevention program has helped 1,264 \n     people stay in their apartments and stopped 55 foreclosures. \n     We break their fall.\n       Far more people than you see now would be sleeping in \n     doorways without our services. There would be far more \n     children without a fixed address. Even with this successful \n     homeless prevention program in place, we still have people \n     becoming homeless at a quicker rate than we can break their \n     fall.\n       BFP: What sustains this organization?\n       Markley: The community sustains this organization. The \n     people who come out to contribute time and money have such a \n     profound impact on so many lives. The amazing thing about \n     COTS is the people who come out to support it.\n       They are the ones who make sure no one in our community is \n     without a safe, warm place to go during the worst of times. \n     What sustains us is the belief that we are so much more \n     together than we are alone.\n       It's because this community is far better informed about \n     who the homeless really are. They know that the guy in the \n     doorway might be a veteran, but we have more work to do as an \n     origination. I think many Vermonters would be shocked to know \n     that at the start of the school year last year there were 141 \n     homeless children in our area, or that our waiting list is \n     high right now.\n       That is the hardest part of this work, when you don't have \n     enough to help everyone. Last year we had the least amount of \n     money to give out for prevention, and all of the school \n     systems felt it keenly because we were not able to keep the \n     same amount of families stable because of state and federal \n     funding cuts and donations were down.\n       BFP: In what other ways have you been innovative in your \n     approach in leading COTS?\n       Markley: I have brought a lot of new constituencies to \n     COTS. I look further up the stream. Where people are used to \n     hearing nothing but no, I find a way to get to yes.\n       For people with really awful credit or behavior issues, \n     every door is slammed. No landlord will take the risk. \n     Instead of accepting that as a no, we figure out how to help \n     people build relationships with landlords through a new risk \n     guarantee program.\n       We ask landlords to take a chance on our clients who we \n     know are a challenge. We put up all of the costs of an \n     eviction as a guarantee, and hold it for a year and a half.\n       My goal is to make sure nobody loses the hope entirely that \n     they will ever be back into housing. Once a person gives up, \n     there is so little you can do. It's like a life lost \n     prematurely. As long as we can hold out that carrot, you can \n     work with people to change behaviors, to try a different \n     approach, and to keep believing in themselves and in having a \n     home.\n       BFP: If you could do anything you wanted to innovate at \n     COTS, with no barriers, what would you do? The sky is the \n     limit.\n       Markley: I would triple our prevention fund, and link it to \n     our follow-up services two years out to make sure families \n     are still doing OK. I would focus on employment initiatives \n     and bring together more partnerships. I would integrate the \n     use of technology and bring together the disparate programs \n     right now that are hard to navigate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6792-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6792-S6793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PROTECTING ECONOMIC VITALITY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, shortly after the Senate recessed in \nSeptember, a compelling article was published in the Burlington Free \nPress which I would like to share with this Senate.\n  John Ewing is a true public servant in Vermont. His vision and \nability to work with diverse groups to protect Vermont's environment \nhas been an inspiration to many. His September 30, 2012, column \nentitled, ``I Believe'' reviews the important steps Vermont has taken \nto achieve smart growth to help our natural resources and the State's \neconomy hand in hand. John also looks to the future and what we must \ncontinue to do in Vermont to ensure we are planning for our best future \npossible with vibrant communities, a working landscape, and the natural \nbeauty of our open spaces. Vermonters have a history of approaching \nthese issues in a collaborative and objective fashion and I know that \nif we continue to do that we will be able to move Vermont forward to a \nbright and sustainable future.\n  John's column is a roadmap to how States can protect their natural \nheritage while maintaining their economic vitality. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Sept. 30, 2012]\n\n I Believe: ``Economic Vitality and Protecting Natural Heritage Are Not \n                         at All Incompatible''\n\n                           (By John T. Ewing)\n\n       Vermont is defined by its natural beauty, its towns and \n     villages and its working landscape. But the question always \n     remains: Can Vermont encourage growth, provide jobs and at \n     the same time retain these special qualities? Will we be able \n     to avoid the negative impacts of unplanned growth and \n     suburbanization?\n       When I first came to Vermont in the 1950s, the site of the \n     Sheraton Hotel on Williston Road beyond the University of \n     Vermont was a dairy farm. Burlington had three hardware \n     stores, and its banks stayed open on Friday nights to \n     accommodate the farmers who came to town.\n       So much has changed. And yet Vermont has worked hard to \n     retain its traditional settlement patterns--its compact \n     communities and a healthy working landscape.\n       State policy has long recognized the need to protect these \n     special qualities. The principle of ``compact settlement and \n     a working landscape'' has been imbedded as an official vision \n     since the 1960s. Act 250, with its set of principles to guide \n     growth, was enacted in 1972. The Vermont Housing and \n     Conservation Trust Fund was enacted in 1987 to pay for the \n     conservation of farms and natural areas, and to invest in \n     affordable housing in our villages and downtowns.\n       Under Gov. Madeleine Kunin, several efforts were made to \n     strengthen state and community planning, and under Gov. \n     Howard Dean, the state provided substantial funding to \n     conserve farms, forests and natural areas. Recently the \n     Legislature enacted downtown legislation and growth centers \n     to encourage growth in and around existing population centers \n     and towns.\n       However, not all is rosy. As I traveled across the state as \n     chairman of the Environmental Board in the late 1990s, the \n     suburbanization of Vermont was all too clear in certain \n     areas. So we founded the nonprofit Smart Growth Vermont \n     (originally named the Vermont Forum on Sprawl) in 1998. Our \n     aim was to work with the administration and the Legislature \n     to better preserve our heritage, and to assist local \n     communities in their planning and regulatory functions to \n     more effectively guide their growth. This ``smart growth'' \n     organization has now been merged into the Vermont Natural \n     Resources Council, where its director, Brian Shupe, and his \n     staff are well positioned to carry forward the initiatives \n     and the tools we developed, and to work with individual \n     towns.\n       The smart growth movement believes that the twin goals of \n     economic vitality and the protection of our natural heritage \n     are not at all incompatible. In fact, much of the success of \n     Vermont is attributable to its beauty and special qualities, \n     supporting all facets of economic activity: tourism, farming, \n     businesses and jobs all integrated so that there is no need \n     to sacrifice our basic values.\n       We are blessed in Vermont with so many organizations \n     working together to achieve these goals. I doubt that any \n     state is so well served by the quality of its leaders and its \n     organizations. I have already mentioned the Vermont Natural \n     Resources Council, which just celebrated its 50th \n     anniversary; a sampling of other groups include:\n       Land trusts, such as the Vermont Land Trust and many of its \n     local counterparts.\n       Conservation organizations: the Nature Conservancy and \n     countless similar groups.\n       Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility.\n       Preservation Trust of Vermont.\n       The Vermont Council on Rural Development and its initiative \n     on the working landscape.\n       The housing nonprofits, exemplified by the Champlain \n     Housing Trust.\n       The ``buy local'' food movement, which is so important in \n     ensuring that our land resources are used productively.\n       There's also the important Vermont Housing and Conservation \n     Board, which over the years has contributed to the \n     development or protection of:\n        10,750 permanently affordable housing units.\n       144,000 acres of agricultural lands.\n       253,000 acres of natural areas and recreation.\n       57 downtown historic properties.\n       And most importantly, there are the local planning \n     commissions, zoning boards and town councils that are on the \n     front line in confronting the complex proposals in their \n     communities.\n       There always will be apparent conflict between growth and \n     preserving the Vermont that we cherish. A current example \n     involves the proposals for industrial wind power, fields of \n     solar collectors, and bio-mass. There is an obvious conflict \n     with those who cherish our ridgelines, mountains, forests and \n     fields.\n       I believe these tensions can be relieved if we correct the \n     current lack of planning and develop a more impartial \n     regulatory system. As we have done in the past on other \n     issues, Vermont can integrate the need for renewable energy \n     with the environment if we provide the planning, systems for \n     approval and opportunity for citizen involvement.\n       Compact and vibrant communities, natural beauty and a \n     working landscape: I believe we\n\n[[Page S6793]]\n\n     should never allow these special qualities to be eroded and \n     lost; they are what define Vermont. But we have a history of \n     addressing these issues in an objective and collaborative \n     manner--that also is what defines Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6793-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICE OF OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

The Department has also refused to \nprovide the documents we requested.\n  In addition, my staff has, on several occasions, attempted to \nschedule briefing times that are convenient for the Department. The \nTreasury Department has cancelled each of these briefings and failed to \ncooperate in rescheduling at a mutually agreeable time.\n  Because everything from home mortgages to credit cards was pegged to \nLIBOR, its manipulation affects almost every American. Given the \nwidespread effects of this manipulation, it is disturbing to see that \nthe Treasury Department has thus far refused to answer basic questions \nand provide essential documents.\n  It is critical for Congress to be able to ask questions and to have \naccess to administration documents in order to conduct vigorous and \nindependent oversight.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating the 2012 World Series champion San Francisco Giants. \nThis season the Giants earned their second World Series title in 3 \nyears by sweeping the Detroit Tigers in 4 games.\n  All season, the Giants truly exemplified what it means to be a team. \nEven though this season saw historic accomplishments from individuals, \nincluding Matt Cain's perfect game and Pablo Sandoval's three home runs \nin game one of the World Series, no one player carried the Giants. \nContributions from all players on an outstanding roster of perennial \nall-stars, reliable veterans and promising young players led the Giants \nto win the National League Western Division.\n  On their road to the World Series, the Giants showed true grit and \ndetermination. They won a record-tying six consecutive games when \nfacing elimination, fighting their way to a historic championship. In \nthe division series, the team made history by battling back from a two \ngames to nothing deficit to beat the Cincinnati Reds--the first come-\nfrom-behind win of its kind in National League history.\n  When the Giants made it to the National League Championship Series \nagainst the defending World Series Champion St. Louis Cardinals, they \nonce again found themselves on the brink of elimination. The team \nbanded together and roared back, winning three hard-fought games in a \nrow to capture their second National League pennant in 3 years. With a \npowerful combination of great pitching, excellent defense, and clutch \nhitting, this Giant team always found a way to win.\n  All 25 players on the playoff roster should be congratulated for \ntheir contributions to this true team effort: Jeremy Affeldt, Joaquin \nArias, Brandon Belt, Gregor Blanco, Madison Bumgarner, Matt Cain, \nSantiago Casilla, Brandon Crawford, Aubrey Huff, George Kontos, Tim \nLincecum, Javier Lopez, Jose Mijares, Guillermo Mota, Xavier Nady, \nAngel Pagan, Hunter Pence, Buster Posey, Sergio Romo, Hector Sanchez, \nPablo Sandoval, Marco Scutaro, Ryan Theriot, Ryan Vogelsong, and Barry \nZito.\n  In addition to the players, I also congratulate Chief Executive \nOfficer Larry Baer, General Manager Brian Sabean, and Manager Bruce \nBochy for the tremendous job they did in assembling and guiding this \nteam to the 2012 World Series.\n  As Giants fans in the Bay Area and around the world celebrate, I \ncongratulate their team on a remarkable season, a seventh World Series \ntitle, and a place in the history books.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6793-3", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6793-S6794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senate is being asked today to approve \nthe intelligence authorization bill for 2013 by unanimous consent. I \nbelieve that significant changes need to be made to this bill before it \nis passed, so I object to this unanimous consent request.\n  When the Senate Intelligence Committee approved this bill in July, I \nwas the only member of the committee to vote against it, and I would \nlike to take a few minutes to explain my concerns, so that my \ncolleagues who are not on that committee can get a better sense of what \nthis debate is about.\n  This bill contains a number of worthwhile provisions, and I wish that \nI had been able to support it. Unfortunately, it also contains several \nprovisions that I find very troubling, all of them located in Title V \nof the bill. These provisions are all intended to reduce unauthorized \ndisclosures of classified information, but I am concerned that they \nwill lead to less-informed public debate about national security \nissues, and also undermine the due process rights of intelligence \nagency employees, without actually enhancing national security.\n  I agree with my colleagues that unauthorized disclosures of national \nsecurity information, which are also known as ``leaks,'' can be a \nserious problem. Unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information can \njeopardize legitimate military and intelligence operations, and even \nput lives at risk. So I think it can be entirely appropriate for \nCongress to look for ways to help the executive branch protect \ninformation that intelligence agencies want to keep secret, as long as \nCongress is careful not to do more harm than good. I myself spent 4 \nyears working on legislation to increase the criminal penalty for \npeople who are convicted of deliberately exposing covert agents, and I \nam proud to say that with help from a number of my Republican and \nDemocratic colleagues, this legislation was finally signed into law in \n2010.\n  So I am all for Congress recognizing that leaks can be a serious \nproblem, and for doing things to show the men and women of the U.S. \nintelligence community that we recognize the seriousness of this issue. \nThe problem, though, is that Congress can't actually legislate this \nproblem away, and attempts to do so can have serious negative \nconsequences.\n  One of the best analyses I have seen of the problem of unauthorized \ndisclosures was a report published last year by the National \nIntelligence University. The report observed that this problem has been \naround for several decades, and noted specifically that ``The relative \nconsistency in the number of unauthorized disclosures over the past 30 \nyears demonstrates their persistent nature, independent of which \npolitical party controls the White House or Congress.'' This report, \nlike a number of previous reports on the subject, also suggested that \nbecause it is very difficult to identify government employees \nresponsible for disclosing classified information to the media, \nunauthorized disclosures are not a problem that can be solved with \nlegislation.\n  Again, this doesn't mean that Congress shouldn't try to find ways to \nhelp the executive branch when it can. But it does mean that Congress \nand the public should be generally skeptical of anti-leaks bills, and \nremember that not everything that is done in the name of stopping leaks \nis necessarily wise policy.\n  In particular, I think Congress should be extremely skeptical of any \nanti-leaks bills that threaten to encroach upon the freedom of the \npress, or that would reduce access to information that the public has a \nright to know.\n  As most of my colleagues are aware, my father was a journalist who \nreported on national security issues. Among other things, he wrote what \nmany consider to be the definitive account of the Bay of Pigs invasion, \nas well as an authoritative account of how the U.S. came to build and \nuse the first atomic bomb. Accounts like these\n\n[[Page S6794]]\n\nare vital to the public's understanding of national security issues. \nWithout transparent and informed public debate on foreign policy and \nnational security topics, American voters would be ill-equipped to \nelect the policymakers who make important decisions in these areas.\n  Congress, too, would be much less effective in its oversight if \nMembers did not have access to informed press accounts on foreign \npolicy and national security topics. And while many Members of Congress \ndon't like to admit it, members often rely on the press to inform them \nabout problems that congressional overseers have not discovered on \ntheir own. I have been on the Senate Intelligence Committee for 12 \nyears now, and I can recall numerous specific instances where I found \nout about serious government wrongdoing--such as the NSA's warrantless \nwiretapping program, or the CIA's coercive interrogation program--only \nas a result of disclosures by the press.\n  With all of that in mind, I am particularly concerned about sections \n505 and 506 of this bill, both of which would limit the flow of \nunclassified information to the press and to the public. Section 505 \nwould prohibit any government employee with a Top Secret, compartmented \nsecurity clearance from, and I quote, ``entering into any contract or \nother binding agreement'' with, quote, ``the media'' to provide \n``analysis or commentary'' concerning intelligence activities for a \nfull year after that employee leaves the government. This provision \nwould clearly lead to less-informed public debate on national security \nissues. News organizations often rely on former government officials to \nhelp explain complex stories or events, and I think it is entirely \nappropriate for former officials to help educate the public in this \nway. I am also concerned that prohibiting individuals from providing \ncommentary could be an unconstitutional encroachment on free speech. \nFor example, if a retired CIA Director wishes to publish an op-ed \ncommenting on a public policy debate, I see no reason to try to ban him \nfrom doing so, even if he has been retired less than a year.\n  I understand my colleagues' desire to prohibit unauthorized \ndisclosures by retired officials, but these officials are already \nlegally bound not to disclose classified information that they learned \nwhile in government service. And I would also note that this bill does \nnot define who is and who isn't a member of the media, and that this \nambiguity could present a variety of problems. When this bill was being \nconsidered in committee, I suggested that we get feedback from outside \ngroups before we voted on it, so that we could address problems like \nthis, and I hope that the committee will take that step in the future.\n  Section 506 would also lead to a less-informed debate on national \nsecurity issues, by prohibiting nearly all intelligence agency \nemployees from providing briefings to the press, unless those employees \ngive their names and provide the briefing on the record. The bill makes \nan exception for agency directors and deputy directors, and their \npublic affairs offices, but no one else. It seems to me that \nauthorized, unclassified background briefings from intelligence agency \nanalysts and experts are a useful way to help inform the press and the \npublic about a wide variety of issues, and there will often be good \nreasons to withhold the full names of the experts giving these \nbriefings. I haven't seen any evidence that prohibiting the \nintelligence agencies from providing these briefings would benefit \nnational security in any way, so I see no reason to limit the flow of \ninformation in this manner.\n  The third provision that I am most concerned about is section 511, \nwhich would require the Director of National Intelligence to establish \nan administrative process under which he and the heads of the various \nintelligence agencies would have the authority to take away pension \nbenefits from an intelligence agency employee, or a former employee, if \nthe DNI or the agency head determines that the employee has knowingly \nviolated his or her nondisclosure agreement and disclosed classified \ninformation.\n  I am concerned that the Director of National Intelligence himself has \nsaid that this provision would not be a significant deterrent to leaks, \nand that it would neither help protect sensitive national security \ninformation nor make it easier to identify and punish actual leakers. \nBeyond these concerns about the provision's effectiveness, I am also \nconcerned that giving intelligence agency heads broad new authority to \ntake away the pensions of individuals who haven't been formally \nconvicted of any wrongdoing could pose serious problems for the due \nprocess rights of intelligence professionals, particularly when the \nagency heads themselves haven't told Congress how they would interpret \nand implement this authority. As many of my colleagues will guess, I'm \nespecially concerned about the rights of whistleblowers who report \nwaste, fraud and abuse to Congress or Inspectors General.\n  I outlined these due process concerns in more detail in the committee \nreport that accompanied this bill, so I won't restate them all here. I \nwill note, though, that I am particularly confused by the fact that \nsection 511 creates a special avenue of punishment that only applies to \naccused leakers who have worked for an intelligence agency at some \npoint in their careers. There are literally thousands of employees at \nthe Departments of Defense, State and Justice, as well as the White \nHouse, who have access to sensitive national security information. I \ndon't see a clear justification for singling out intelligence community \nemployees with this provision, when there is no apparent evidence that \nthese employees are responsible for a disproportionate number of leaks. \nAnd I am concerned that it will be harder to attract qualified \nindividuals to work for intelligence agencies if Congress creates the \nperception that intelligence officers have fewer due process rights \nthan other government employees.\n  While I have a number of smaller concerns regarding the language of \nthese anti-leaks provisions, the issues that I have just laid out \nrepresent my central concerns, and I hope that my colleagues now have a \nbetter sense of why I oppose this bill. I would add that my view seems \nto be widely shared outside of Congress, and that when USA Today ran an \neditorial criticizing these anti-leaks provisions, they couldn't find a \nsingle senator who was willing to publicly defend them.\n  I know that the sponsors of this bill have worked hard on it, and I \nam still happy to sit down with them at any time to discuss my concerns \nin more detail, and help them make the major changes that I believe \nmust be made before this authorization bill moves forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6794-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SPORTSMEN'S ACT OF 2012\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

However, I remain concerned about the \nprovision that would allow the importation of polar bear trophies taken \nin sport hunts in Canada before February 18, 1997. This provision would \napply to trophies regardless of whether they were taken from an \napproved polar bear population. Prior to 1997, U.S. trophy hunters were \nonly permitted to take bears and import trophies from approved \npopulations; thus, only trophy hunters who killed polar bears from \nunapproved populations would benefit from this provision of the bill.\n  I find this very disturbing. This provision of the Sportsmen's Act \nundermines current wildlife protections, and further imperils an \nalready threatened species by encouraging future killings for sport. \nFor this reason, I am proud to cosponsor the amendment introduced by my \ntwo colleagues from Massachusetts to strike this provision. It would be \nmy hope that the Senate would pass this important amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6794-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6794-S6795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING CAPTAIN SHAWN G. HOGAN\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to honor the service of a brave \nNew Hampshire son, U.S. Army Special Forces CPT Shawn G. Hogan, who was \nkilled in a tragic accident during a military training exercise on \nOctober 17 in Golden Pond, KY. Captain Hogan was commander of Company \nA, 4th Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group headquartered at Fort \nCampbell, KY.\n\n[[Page S6795]]\n\nHe received his Green Beret earlier this year.\n  Shawn was born in Albany, NY and grew up in the Town of Salem, New \nHampshire. An alumnus of Salem High School, Shawn attended the Virginia \nMilitary Institute where he was captain of both the cross-country team \nand the track and field team. He joined the U.S. Army upon graduation \nin 2006.\n  Shawn's military honors include the Bronze Star Medal, two Army \nCommendation Medals, two Army Achievement Medals, the Army Service \nRibbon, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Iraq Campaign \nMedal with one Campaign Star, the National Defense Service Medal, the \nArmy Service Ribbon, the Sapper Tab, the Ranger Tab, the Special Forces \nTab, and the Parachutist Badge.\n  Shawn was an avid runner, hiker, rock climber, and skier and is \nremembered for his love of the great outdoors and for his impressive \nathletic ability. At the Virginia Military Institute, for instance, \nShawn placed seventh out of 3,600 cadets in an Army ROTC competition. \nWhen he wasn't outperforming the competition on the playing field, \nShawn was outperforming his peers in the classroom. Friends and \nteachers recall Shawn's intense intellectual curiosity and independent \nmind. He was a finalist in the prestigious Rhodes and Marshal \nScholarship competitions, won an award for the best thesis in science \nand engineering, and was valedictorian of his class at the Institute.\n  Shawn is also remembered for the kindness he showed others and for \nhis willingness to help anyone in need. He stood out as an athlete, a \nstudent, and a person, and his death is a huge loss for all who knew \nhim, for New Hampshire, and for the country.\n  Shawn dedicated his talents and his life in the service of his \ncommunity and his country. He answered the call of duty to defend our \nway of life, and for that, all Americans are forever grateful.\n  Sadly, Shawn is the fifth Salem High School graduate in recent years \nto die while serving our country. To honor Shawn and all others who \nhave served before him, it is our duty to remain committed to the cause \nof freedom and to our returning veterans and their families.\n  Shawn is survived by his parents, Jean and Richard Hogan of Salem; \nand his sister, Nicole, also of Salem.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in honoring the \nbright life and service of CPT Shawn G. Hogan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6795-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      REMEMBERING DR.

Mr. President, today I wish to speak about a \ngreat West Virginian, Lewis D'Antoni, and his extraordinary family. I \ndo so because the D'Antoni family is being honored tonight for the \ncountless lives they have influenced and the untold students they have \ninspired to reach for the stars. At its annual dinner in Charleston, \nthe Education Alliance of West Virginia will celebrate the D'Antonis. \nAnd I wish to add my salute to this remarkable family and to thank its \npatriarch for all he has done for the people of West Virginia in a \nlifetime of almost 99 years--as a dedicated educator, as an innovative \ncoach, as an inspiring man of integrity and industry.\n  Lewis D'Antoni had a long career as an educator but he is best known \nthroughout West Virginia as the ``coach's coach.'' And for good reason! \nHe was one of West Virginia's greatest high school basketball coaches, \nwith 450 victories, including a State championship, while coaching at \nMullens High School in Wyoming County. He believed in fast-forward \nbasketball even before there was a shot clock. So it should not \nsurprise anyone that two of his sons, Mike and Dan, have been advocates \nof the run-and-gun offense in their NBA coaching careers. And with Mike \nnamed just this week as the new coach of the Los Angeles Lakers--\nreunited with point guard Steve Nash--look for a lot of full-court play \nat The Forum this season.\n  All four of the children Lewis parented with his late wife, Betty Jo, \nare accomplished and respected throughout West Virginia. Their youngest \nson, Mark, was an Academic All-American basketball player at Coastal \nCarolina College and is a partner in a Charleston law firm. And their \ndaughter, Kathy, is an assistant state superintendent of schools in \nWest Virginia and the author of two books on adult education. The \nD'Antonis personify the power of families--working hard, supporting \neach other and standing together, no matter how tough times may get. \nThese are the values of the D'Antoni family. These are the families of \nthe West Virginia family.\n  Lewis D'Antoni's father, Andrea, came from Italy to West Virginia in \n1910. He was so proud to be an American that he initiated what is \nprobably a very unique tradition in any American household, especially \nthese days. Every April 15, after paying his taxes, Andrea D'Antoni \nwould open a bottle of wine and celebrate Tax Day with the entire \nfamily. Kathy D'Antoni remembers stories of how happy her grandfather \nwas to pay his taxes because, as she explains, ``he loved America and \nhe wanted to show his appreciation and to give something back to this \ngreat country.''\n  That has been the hallmark of the D'Antoni family ever since Andrea \nD'Antoni's Tax Day celebrations. That certainly has been the hallmark \nof Lewis D'Antoni's life work--through his many years as a coach, a \nteacher and school administrator. He taught discipline on the court and \nin the classroom. He emphasized that success depends on ``how well you \nprepare'' and ``how you react to the ebb and flow'' of the game. And \nnever, ever give up. And that has also been the hallmark of the careers \nof his children, Mike, Dan, Mark and Kathy. All have given great \nservice to their communities, their State and their country.\n  The Education Alliance is a non-profit organization that works to \nkeep students in school and on track to graduate through various \nprograms, including mentoring. And every year, at its annual dinner, \nthe organization honors West Virginians who have had a positive impact \non the lives of students, as role models for discipline and hard work. \nThis year, the Education Alliance is honoring the D'Antoni family whose \nown lives bear witness to the fact that talent is unstoppable, that \ntenacity has rewards and that dreams can come true. They have lived \nlives that made Andrea D'Antoni's dream come true--that the D'Antoni \nfamily name would be honored in America and in West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6795-3", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6795-S6796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE JUNEAU EMPIRE CENTENNIAL\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. On November 2, 1912, the Alaska Daily Empire \npublished its first edition in Juneau. Over the next one hundred years \nit would bear the names Daily Alaska Empire, the Juneau Alaska Empire, \nthe Southeast Alaska Empire and today, The Juneau Empire. I wish to pay \ntribute to The Juneau Empire on the occasion of its centennial \nanniversary.\n\n[[Page S6796]]\n\n  From the Gold Rush days and through much of the 20th Century, Juneau \nwas quite a competitive newspaper town. The Empire was not Juneau's \nfirst newspaper. That distinction belongs to the Alaska Free Press, \nwhich was first published in 1887. But in rough and tumble Juneau, \nnewspapers came and went. The Empire is the only one of perhaps 18 \nnewspapers that survived.\n  In 1912, when the Empire was founded, there was but one daily \nnewspaper in Juneau, the Daily Alaska Dispatch, which was Republican \noriented and reflected the progressivism of Theodore Roosevelt's era.\n  Franklin Alexander Strong was a Democrat at a time when his party in \nAlaska was conservative and business oriented. A newspaper man who had \nalready established The Nome Nugget, Alaska's oldest newspaper in 1900, \nStrong had already relocated to Seattle when he was wooed back to \nAlaska. There were plans to make Strong Alaska's second Territorial \nGovernor at the time. Fortunately, Strong left a printing press in \nIditarod, AK, another Gold Rush town, and moved it to Juneau upon his \nreturn to launch the Empire as well as his political career.\n  In spite of his political aspirations, Strong promised that the paper \nwould be politically independent, ``reserving the right to comment or \nfairly criticize any political party that may be in control of the \nfederal or territorial administrations.'' Strong had much to criticize.\n  Strong's initial editorial read in part:\n\n       Notwithstanding the many disabilities under which Alaska \n     has labored for years past, partly due to ignorance, \n     misinformation and misdirected zeal on the part of the \n     national school of ultra-conservationists, the growth and \n     development of this great commonwealth has been greatly \n     retarded, if not absolutely prohibited in important sections. \n     A change in policy by the federal administration we believe \n     to be indispensible to the end that the people of Alaska may \n     be permitted to enjoy the fruits of their labors, in \n     developing its great latent natural resources.\n\n  This is a man who understood Alaska. Sadly, Strong was prescient \nabout the challenges that Alaska would face dealing with the Federal \nGovernment in the coming years. His 1912 editorial could very easily \nappear in Alaska newspapers during this 21st century.\n  Strong would achieve his dream of becoming Alaska's second \nTerritorial Governor in 1913, a role he would hold until April 1918 \nwhen it was discovered that Strong was not eligible to hold the job \nbecause he was a Canadian who had never obtained US citizenship. \nAnother of the Empire's leaders, John Weir Troy, would serve as \nAlaska's Territorial Governor, serving as publisher after Strong from \n1914 until he became Governor in 1933. From 1933 to 1955 the Empire's \npublisher was one of the first women to run a newspaper in Alaska, \nHelen Troy Bender Monsen. She was followed by William Prescott Allen \nfrom 1955 to just after Statehood in 1960 and then by Donald W. \nReynolds until 1969.\n  The Empire's modern period began in 1969 when the Morris newspaper \nchain of Augusta, Georgia acquired and brought stability to the \npublication. This would be a godsend to Juneau in its fight to \nforestall repeated efforts to move Alaska's capital out of the \nSoutheast city. The Empire would be a vehement opponent of the move.\n  The Empire was unusual at its founding in that it was a non-partisan \nnewspaper, not supposedly favoring either national political party. It \nmade that point in its first edition when it said:\n\n       It may well be here to emphasize that the Empire is not in \n     politics. Politics is a mere incidental to a legitimate \n     business industry. As a matter of fact, Alaska has been \n     suffering, and is still suffering from a glut of politics. \n     More work and less talk of partisan politics may accomplish \n     something tangible.\n\n  The newspaper was unusual in other ways. While crime news was a \nfixture--the paper's first crime stories were focused on Robert Stroud, \nwho became famous as the Birdman of Alcatraz after he shot and killed a \nbartender in Juneau to start his criminal record--became one of the \nfirst papers in the Nation to run an obituary of a dog on its front \npage. On March 31, 1942, the paper ran the obituary of Patsy Ann, a pit \nbull, who met every steamship to dock in downtown Juneau for more than \na decade, often posing for pictures with visitors ``with an aloof . . . \ndignity that befitted her official position,'' as the town's official \nmascot, the dog being the only animal that the City Council itself paid \nfor her dog license.\n  The Empire over the years made its living covering ``hard'' news--\nfrom the town's first industry, gold mining, to fisheries and \ngovernment affairs, highlighted by World War I, World War II and the \nCold War with Russia. But the paper also found time to cover visiting \ndignitaries to Alaska's Capital City, from President Warren Harding who \narrived on July 10, 1923 to movie stars John Barrymore, Ingrid Bergman \nand Gary Grant and from comedians Bob Hope and Edgar Bergen, to a four-\nlegged movie star--Lassie.\n  Over the years the Empire has been home to a number of writers who \nwould go on to play significant roles in Alaska public policy issues. \nLarry Persily, who once served as the Empire's Managing Editor, today \nserves as Federal Coordinator for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation \nProjects. Kim Elton, who served as editor from March 1976 until June \n1978 would go on to represent Juneau in the Alaska Legislature and \ncurrently serves as Director of Alaska Affairs at the US Department of \nthe Interior under Secretary Ken Salazar.\n  On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I congratulate the staff of the \nJuneau Empire on the occasion of the newspaper's 100th birthday and \nwish the Juneau Empire many more years of service to the people of \nAlaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6796-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING RUBY RIDDLE\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, they call Fairbanks in my home \nState of Alaska the ``Golden Heart City.'' Ruby Riddle, who moved to \nFairbanks from North Carolina in 1963 called it ``heaven.'' Ruby would \nknow this. She was designated Official Hostess of the City of Fairbanks \nin 2001 and of the Fairbanks North Star Borough in 2006. With the \nMayors of the City of Fairbanks and the Fairbanks North Star Borough at \nher bedside, ``Miss Ruby'' passed away on November 1, 2012. I rise \ntoday to speak in memory of a lovely lady who epitomized all that is \nspecial about Interior Alaska.\n  Ruby Lenore Riddle was reportedly eighty something when she died. A \ntrue Southern woman never admits her age. She was born on St. Patrick's \nDay, March 17, in Lenoir, NC. An independent spirit, Ruby came north \nwith her husband in 1963. He passed away in 1989 and she decided to \nstay in Alaska. Fairbanks was Miss Ruby's home from the day she \narrived. She worked for the Northern Commercial Company which later \nbecame Nordstrom. When Nordstrom closed, Miss Ruby went to work for \nLamont's until her retirement. Retirement, said Miss Ruby, is when life \nbegins.\n  Miss Ruby lived her life with gusto. She was an impeccable dresser--\nalways. If something was going on in Fairbanks, Miss Ruby was there \nwith a camera. She shot thousands of photographs with visitors and \nlocals at events and functions. After the function she would have the \nfilm processed and send it with a handwritten note card. Those notes \nwere signed, ``Southern Ms. Ruby.'' Miss Ruby was involved in the \nFairbanks community like none other. She attended the local assembly \nmeetings, city council meetings, chamber meetings, townhalls and \nmilitary functions. She had a reserved seat in the Fairbanks North Star \nBorough Assembly Chamber and rarely if ever missed a meeting.\n  Following Miss Ruby's passing that reserved seat was adorned with a \nsimple lavender vase holding pink and white flowers ringed by pieces of \ncandy that Miss Ruby would often hand out.\n  Ruby Riddle was not an Alaskan by birth but she was surely a \nFairbanks original, and we miss her greatly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6796-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6796-S6797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING PAT'S PIZZA OLD PORT\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, each year on the November 11, as a \nnation, we celebrate the service of all U.S. military veterans. \nVeterans Day is a chance to honor those who protect our freedom while \nthey give others the opportunity to pursue the American dream. It is \nour veteran entrepreneurs who know the sacrifices and struggles both of \nmilitary service and of pursuing that dream first hand. Today I rise to \nrecognize and commend two such veteran entrepreneurs, Chris and\n\n[[Page S6797]]\n\nJen Tyll, who own and operate Pat's Pizza Old Port located in Portland, \nME.\n  Chris and Jen Tyll are graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy. Chris is \na former Navy SEAL and platoon leader, and served four tours in Iraq. \nChris and Jen have 23 years of military experience between them and \nhave completed six deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom \nand Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  Chris first visited Maine at the age of 18 while visiting with his \nNaval Academy roommate. He fell in love with the State and believed \nMaine would be a great place to raise a family. After moving around the \ncountry and living in eight States, the Tylls decided to establish \nroots in Maine. As Chris transitioned out of the military, he knew he \nwanted to own a business. Subsequently, he opened a Pat's Pizza in the \nheart of Portland's Historic Old Port in 2009.\n  The original Pat's Pizza, located in Orono, is an undeniable favorite \nof University of Maine students. It has been said that an education at \nthe University of Maine at Orono is not complete without sampling a \npizza from Pat's. Pat's Pizza is known for its sauce, developed by the \nfounder, which gives its pizza a distinct home-grown flavor. The dough \nis made fresh daily, delivering customers the same authentic taste in \nevery location. Pat's Pizza Old Port offers the same great Pat's taste \nand all of the amenities Mainers and their families have come to enjoy.\n  While Pat's Pizza Old Port provides Chris the opportunity to be a \nsuccessful business owner, he has not forgotten his former comrades and \nfinds time to reach out to veterans. Chris understands the challenges \nthat await current veterans as they transition from the military into \ncivilian life. He is the chairman of the new Portland Veterans Network, \na Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce program. The network offers \nfree career assistance to veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and \nOperation Enduring Freedom, including mentoring, wellness services, \nresume writing and interview skills training, and chamber membership. \nAt its heart, the program consists of pairing 50 Portland-area veterans \nwith business leaders who will act as mentors, introducing the veterans \nat networking events and guiding them in their job search.\n  I applaud Chris and Jen Tyll for demonstrating the leadership and \ncan-do attitude that are truly a reflection of the talent and \nentrepreneurial spirit found in my home State of Maine. As we pay \ntribute to our servicemembers on Veterans Day, I offer my gratitude and \ncongratulations to our Nation's veteran-owned small businesses and \nextend my best wishes to Chris, Jen, and Pat's Pizza Old Port for their \ncontinued growth and success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6797-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6797-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6797-3", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1956.

Res. 594\n\n       Whereas, on September 11, 2012, Glen A. Doherty, Tyrone S. \n     Woods, Sean P. Smith, and Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens \n     were murdered during a sophisticated assault on the United \n     States Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, conducted by a group of \n     militants affiliated with al-Qaeda;\n       Whereas this tragedy has raised many important questions \n     that affect the national security of the United States and \n     the safety of Americans who serve our country abroad;\n       Whereas Congress has an unique and essential responsibility \n     under the Constitution to conduct oversight of the Executive \n     Branch;\n       Whereas more than two months have passed since the tragic \n     deaths of these four Americans in Benghazi, and many \n     essential questions remain unanswered;\n       Whereas Members of Congress have sent numerous letters to \n     senior Executive Branch officials requesting information on \n     the events of September 11, 2012, most of which have not been \n     answered;\n       Whereas the Executive Branch has not been forthcoming in \n     providing answers to the many questions that have emerged \n     regarding those events;\n       Whereas the failures that led to the deaths of four \n     Americans traverse multiple Executive Branch agencies and \n     come under the jurisdiction of a number of Senate committees, \n     including the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence;\n       Whereas several different committees of jurisdiction in \n     both the Senate and the House of Representatives are \n     currently holding briefings and hearings to analyze narrow \n     aspects of the overall failure in Benghazi before, during, \n     and after the attacks;\n       Whereas the death of four Americans in Benghazi was the \n     result of a whole-of-government failure, and any solution to \n     prevent such events from happening again will need to be \n     holistic and comprehensive, cutting across agency \n     jurisdictions and jurisdictions of committees of Congress;\n       Whereas a full and independent accounting of the failures \n     in Benghazi and the development of a comprehensive solution \n     to prevent such tragedies in the future require the \n     establishment of a temporary Select Committee in the Senate;\n       Whereas many other important investigations have been \n     conducted in the past through the creation of a select \n     committee of the Senate for a specific purpose and a set \n     time; and\n       Whereas the American people deserve straight answers to the \n     many questions that have been raised about the terrorist \n     attacks in Benghazi and what actions should be taken to \n     prevent similar attacks in the future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That\n\n     SECTION 1.

I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  This resolution calls for the establishment of a select committee of \nthe Senate to make a thorough and complete investigation of the facts \nand circumstances surrounding the response of the United States \nGovernment to the September 11, 2012, terrorist attacks against the \nUnited States consulate and personnel in Benghazi, Libya, and to make \nrecommendations to prevent similar attacks in the future. I send the \nresolution to the desk in behalf of myself, Senator Graham of South \nCarolina, and Senator Ayotte of New Hampshire.\n  Before I go into the need for this select committee--and there \nclearly is a need because there is a huge credibility gap amongst the \nAmerican people because of the now going on 8 weeks of contradictory \nreports, contradictory statements, beginning with the President of the \nUnited States. The President of the United States, on the day of \nSeptember 12, went to the Rose Garden and stated that he opposed \nterrorist attacks. Then, that evening, as we found out after the \nelection via an interview with ``60 Minutes,'' the President stated--\nand I will provide the quotes for the record: ``We don't know who was \nresponsible for these attacks.'' So he went from condemning terrorist \nattacks to saying to Mr. Croft of ``60 Minutes'' that he didn't know \nwho was responsible, and then in the days following, in various venues, \nwhether they be late night talk shows or the United Nations, the \nPresident went on to allege that this was a hideous video that \ntriggered a spontaneous demonstration. Not true. Not true. The \nPresident of the United States did not tell the American people the \ntruth about the attacks that took the lives of four brave Americans and \nthat went on for 7 hours, for which we were totally unprepared.\n  Four brave Americans died. It has now been 8 weeks. The American \npeople have received nothing but contradictory statements from all \nlevels of our government.\n  One of the more salient events occurred 5 days after, when clearly it \nhad been identified as an al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist attack. The \nUnited Nations Ambassador, at the direction of the White House, went on \nall the Sunday talk shows to allege that this was a spontaneous \ndemonstration triggered by a hateful video, as did our Secretary of \nState, as did, most regrettably, the President of the United States.\n  The American people deserve the facts. The American people need to \nknow why the security at the consulate was so inadequate despite two \nprevious attacks on that facility, including an assassination attempt \non the British Ambassador. What did the President know, when did he \nknow it, and what did he do about it? Did the President's national \nsecurity staff make him aware of these attacks and, if they did, why \ndid he not take the lead? What actions, if any, were taken to respond \nto a classified cable that was sent from our Embassy in Libya to the \nState Department on August 16, weeks before the September 11 attack, \nstating there were numerous armed groups in Benghazi that posed a \nthreat to American interests, and that the consulate in Benghazi could \nnot survive a sustained attack such as the one that eventually occurred \na month later at the hands of one of these militia groups which was al-\nQaida-affiliated? What actions, if any, did the Secretary of State take \nin response to these repeated warnings?\n  I saw Christopher Stevens in Tripoli on July 7. He told me of his \nsecurity concerns then. The Senator from South Carolina and others \nwrote an article in the Wall Street Journal talking about the need for \nsecurity, the problems that the nascent Libyan Government was having. \nObviously, those were ignored.\n  Why were repeated requests for greater security in Libya turned down \nby officials at the State Department? On the anniversary of the worst \nterrorist attack in American history and after multiple attacks this \nyear on our consulate in Benghazi and other western interests there, \nwhy were U.S. Armed Forces in the region not ready--not ready--and \npositioned to respond to what was clearly a foreseeable emergency?\n  The fight went on for 7 hours. Why did senior administration \nofficials seek to blame a spontaneous demonstration when there was no \nspontaneous demonstration, which they were seeing in real-time, which \nthe surveillance cameras within and without our consulate clearly \nindicated? Why is it that anyone, including our Ambassador to the\n\n[[Page S6804]]\n\nUnited Nations, would believe that spontaneous demonstrations are \ncomposed of people with mortars, with rocket-propelled grenades and \nheavy weapons? No one believes that. Why did President Obama insist \nthat he labeled events in Benghazi an act of terrorism on September 12 \nwhen we know now--I repeat, we know now--that in an interview with ``60 \nMinutes'' on the same day he explicitly refused to characterize the \nattack in this way and he then spent nearly 2 weeks putting the \nemphasis on a spontaneous protest to a hateful video, including in his \naddress to the United Nations on September 25?\n  We need a select committee. Americans deserve to know. The families \nof those slain and murdered Americans need to know. And why in the \nworld the administration or our friends on the other side of the aisle \nor anyone would resist the appointment of a select committee I do not \nknow. We have to have a select committee. The people of the United \nStates deserve it and the families of those murdered deserve it. They \ndeserve answers. For 8 weeks now, they have not gotten the answers. The \nonly credible way of getting those answers is with a select committee.\n  Today I understand that the President of the United States took some \numbrage at statements Senator Ayotte, Senator Graham, and I have made \nconcerning this issue. We believe whoever it is must be held \nresponsible, I say to the President of the United States. Most \nimportantly, the President of the United States, who is Commander in \nChief, who so far, in my view, has not exercised those responsibilities \nand has not informed the American people of the facts--this President \nand this administration have either been guilty of colossal \nincompetence or engaged in a coverup, neither of which is acceptable to \nthe American people.\n  If it appears that I feel strongly about this issue, I speak with the \nfamilies, I believe, of those who were murdered. I speak as a friend of \nChristopher Stevens. I speak as a person who knows something about \nwarfare. I speak with some authority that this attack clearly could \nhave been prevented if the facts on the ground had been taken into \nconsideration, including the ample warnings--including the warnings \nthat were sent on August 16--stating that the consulate could not \nsuccessfully resist a concentrated attack by al-Qaida-affiliated \ngroups. That alone convinces me, and I believe most Americans when they \nfind out, that the actions to prevent these murders were clearly \ninsufficient, if not totally incompetent.\n  I see the Senator from South Carolina is here to join me as well as \nthe Senator from New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with both the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very grateful to engage. Here is the \nrequest of the body: Benghazi needs to be investigated. We need to find \nout what happened so it never happens again. We have four Americans \nkilled, the first Ambassador killed in the line of duty in 33 years. \nThat is worthy of our time. Dianne Feinstein is doing a very good job \nwith Saxby Chambliss on the intel side. General Petraeus must testify. \nI think Secretary Clinton must testify.\n  Here is the problem that I have with the approach we are taking. \nArmed services need to ask DOD: How could you not come to the aid of \nthe consulate for almost 8 hours on September 11, of all days? The \nState Department needs to be asked: Why did you deny additional \nsecurity requests that had been made for months, and could you not see \nthis coming? And the CIA needs to be asked a lot of questions also.\n  A select committee where we have members of intel, foreign relations, \nand armed services listening to all three agencies explain themselves I \nthink is essential to get to the truth. I will not know what General \nPetraeus says in the intel committee, and I want to get to ask him \nquestions. There will be people on the intel committee who will not be \nable to ask Secretary Panetta, General Hammond, and others about the \nDOD piece. This is a failure on many fronts and I think the best thing \nfor the Senate to do is have a bipartisan select committee where we \ncombine the resources of all three of the committees that have \njurisdiction over different pieces, and create a professional approach \nto solving the problem. It will be run by our Democratic colleagues \nbecause they are in charge of the body, and should be.\n\n  There have been times in the past--Iran Contra and other examples--of \nwhere committees combined their resources to make sure they fully \nunderstood what was being said. If we stovepipe this and one committee \ngoes one way and the other committee goes another way, we are not going \nto get the complete picture of what happened in Benghazi. That is what \nwe are asking, that the minority leader and majority leader create a \nselect committee of the three committees that have primary jurisdiction \nover each moving part so we can get to the bottom of this.\n  Here is why it is important: There are a lot of conspiracy theories \ngoing around on the Internet, and I wish to be able to say that is just \nnot so because here is what we found. There are a lot of accusations \nbeing made against people I know and like. I wish to be able to say \nthis accusation is unfounded. If unfortunately there is some \naccountability to be had by somebody I like, I can say here is why we \nhad to do it. It would help us all to go to the public and say we did \nthis together and in a professional and logical way and here are the \nresults of our work product, so we can get Benghazi behind us and move \nforward. Until we do that, I think we are failing the American people.\n  I think the process we are engaging in today is going to lead to \nuncoordinated fact-finding and pieces of the puzzle will never be put \ntogether because we are not talking and working together. I think we \nare going to let families down. The process we are engaging in today \nwill not get to the truth.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. One of the most salient points of this whole scenario was \n5 days after the attack when the Ambassador of the United Nations went \non all the Sunday talk shows to allege that this was a spontaneous \ndemonstration triggered by a hateful video. Those talking points the \nAmbassador used didn't come from the CIA, it is my understanding; they \ncame from the White House. Who in the White House--was it the President \nof the United States, was it one of his people--who was it that gave \nher talking points that clearly indicated something for which there was \nno basis in fact, certainly not after 5 days? Did the President ask \nabout this situation? Did the President of the United States say, Wait \na minute, is she going out there, when right after, on the program I \nwas on, ``Face The Nation,'' the President and the Libya national \nassembly came on right after and said this is an al-Qaida attack, this \nis a terrorist attack, and then for days afterwards, the President of \nthe United States goes out--including the United Nations--saying that \nthis was a hateful video that triggered a flash mob. None of this has a \nshred of credibility.\n  So when we talk about the need for a select committee, when the White \nHouse is responsible for these talking points, if they were, then that \ncovers all of the different oversight committees that we have in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will turn this over to the Senator from New Hampshire, \nbut my response would be as follows: There is a news article coming \nfrom somewhere within the State Department suggesting the CIA was \nresponsible for consulate security because this mostly was a CIA \noperation. But there is an article coming out of the CIA corners \nbasically saying: We responded very quickly and efficiently to the \nattack.\n\n  Here is my problem. If you do not have a select committee listening \nto all the stories, it is pretty hard to put the puzzle together. My \nresponse would be, why did the people in the State Department assigned \nto Benghazi ask for support from the State Department if this was, in \nfact, a CIA responsibility? I want to hear the State Department explain \nthat. In a news article, you are trying to create the impression that \n``we are a secondary player.'' That would be news to every State \nDepartment official in Libya because they were asking the State \nDepartment for security.\n  I wish to challenge the CIA's narrative of what they did and how they \ndid it. But I want to hear the complete story.\n\n[[Page S6805]]\n\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has been an attorney general \nprosecuting cases, and I wish to get her input into how efficient she \nthinks it would be for three committees to do their own investigations, \nnever talk to each other in a coordinated fashion, have a stovepipe \ninvestigation versus a coordinated, one-body-listening-to-everybody \napproach?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I would answer the Senator from South Carolina by saying \nif we do not establish a select committee and bring everyone together, \nwhat you can envision is an incomplete story from each.\n  First of all, we know that CIA sources put out a timeline for the \nCIA. You have the State Department talking about prior security \nrequests and their view on it and e-mails that they sent on it. And \nthen you have the Department of Defense talking about putting out \nanother timeline. Where you are left is: No investigation would be \nconducted in that way, from your most basic incident to this, which is, \nof course, where four brave Americans were murdered during what appears \nto be a terrorist attack.\n  So how are we then going to follow up to make sure we get the \ncomplete picture for the American people to make sure it does not \nhappen again, so we can understand what went wrong, and so we can \nunderstand what lessons we need to learn from this?\n  But if each committee--the Senate Foreign Relations Committee deals \nwith the State Department piece and the Senate Armed Services Committee \ndeals with the Armed Services piece--meaning, why was the greatest \nmilitary in the world not in a position to respond when the attack \noccurred over 7 hours?--that is an important question that has to be \nanswered in the military context--and then also thinking about the \nintelligence piece, the intelligence beforehand about the prior \nattacks--what was happening at the annex? What response, what \ninformation was provided?--also to the President, in terms of the prior \nattacks, so that he could be informed to make sure that the consulate \nwas protected, and why was the consulate not protected?\n  If we conduct this separately we will not have a full picture for the \nAmerican people in order to make sure that we take the lessons learned \nso that this does not happen again. We saw that. That is why we had a \npost 9/11 Commission, because many agencies were involved in wanting to \nget to the bottom of it. This is so important with four brave Americans \nwho have been killed. So many more questions are raised than there are \nanswers right now.\n  Most of all, we need to make sure that the complete picture of facts \ncomes forward. As the Senator from South Carolina said, many people \nhave very different impressions about this, and there are a lot of \nconspiracy theories. So a full bipartisan committee that has full \njurisdiction over every area of this to come up with a complete picture \nand recommendations makes sense, and it is a way for us to answer these \nimportant questions for the American people and, of course, the \nfamilies of those who lost their loved ones in Benghazi.\n  Finally, I would say, with respect to my colleague from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, today the President did say that with respect to \nAmbassador Susan Rice on the Sunday shows, that she did that on behalf \nof the White House. Well, one of the questions that needs to be \nanswered is, within hours there were e-mails sent to the White House \nfrom the State Department that explained that a terrorist group, Ansar \nal-Sharia, was taking responsibility for this attack. So I think a \nquestion that needs to be answered is, why then would the Ambassador to \nthe U.N. on behalf of the White House, 5 days after the attack--even \nthough this e-mail went to the White House within hours stating that a \nterrorist group is taking responsibility--go on every major news \nstation and say this was a spontaneous reaction to a video? She \nexpressly said: This was not a preplanned or premeditated attack. Why \nwas that done?\n  I think those are important questions that need to be addressed by \nthis committee as well because, clearly, this was not what happened. It \nwas a misstatement of what occurred, and we need to understand why that \nwas done. The American people deserve answers when you have four brave \nAmericans who were murdered in a terrorist attack.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I only have one additional comment, and that is, I \nunderstand at the President's press conference today, he said not to, \nquote, pick on his Ambassador to the United Nations, to, quote, pick on \nhim. That statement is really remarkable in that if the President \nthinks that we are picking on people, he does not have any idea of how \nserious this issue is. I am a U.S. Senator. The Senator from New \nHampshire is. We have our obligations. We have our duties representing \nthe people who sent us here, and we are not picking on anybody. I doubt \nif the families of these brave Americans who were murdered would \nbelieve we are, quote, picking on anyone, that when we are trying to \nfind out the facts, the American people deserve to know the facts.\n  We cannot ever let this happen again. We cannot let a security \nsituation evolve that our lives are in danger. We cannot ignore \nrecommendations. We cannot not have sufficient military available on a \nSeptember 11, where we know that tensions are incredibly high. The \nAmerican people are owed an explanation, and it is our duty to try to \nget that explanation for them. And if someone carried a message to the \nAmerican people that was totally and utterly false with no basis in \nfact, then that person also has to be held accountable as well.\n  But first and foremost, the President of the United States, the \nCommander in Chief, is the most responsible. I hope the President has \nno illusions about our view of his responsibility, which I believe is \nthat of the American people as well.\n  So we need this select committee. There is no credibility left \nbecause of all the conflicting stories that have come out and the \ndifferent rumors and different statements and contradictory statements \nand finger pointing. The American people deserve answers, not only \nbecause of those who were murdered, but to make sure that a tragedy \nlike this never happens again.\n  I repeat, everybody has their responsibilities. We have ours. The \nPresident has his. And we intend to pursue this until the American \npeople have the answers they deserve and they have confidence that \nthese kinds of mistakes will never be repeated. We take that very \nseriously, and we have some disagreement when it is called ``picking on \nsomeone.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6805-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6805-S6806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 595--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE GOALS OF NATIONAL \n    ADOPTION DAY AND NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH BY PROMOTING NATIONAL \n AWARENESS OF ADOPTION AND THE CHILDREN AWAITING FAMILIES, CELEBRATING \nCHILDREN AND FAMILIES INVOLVED IN ADOPTION, AND ENCOURAGING THE PEOPLE \n OF THE UNITED STATES TO SECURE SAFETY, PERMANENCY, AND WELL-BEING FOR \n                              ALL CHILDREN\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 595\n\n       Whereas there are millions of unparented children in the \n     world, including 400,540 children in the foster care system \n     in the United States, approximately 104,000 of whom are \n     waiting for families to adopt them;\n       Whereas 59 percent of the children in foster care in the \n     United States are age 10 or younger;\n       Whereas the average length of time a child spends in foster \n     care is approximately 2 years;\n       Whereas for many foster children, the wait for a loving \n     family in which they are nurtured, comforted, and protected \n     seems endless;\n       Whereas in 2011, nearly 26,000 youth ``aged out'' of foster \n     care by reaching adulthood without being placed in a \n     permanent home;\n       Whereas every day, loving and nurturing families are \n     strengthened and expanded when committed and dedicated \n     individuals make an important difference in the life of a \n     child through adoption;\n       Whereas a 2007 survey conducted by the Dave Thomas \n     Foundation for Adoption demonstrated that though ``Americans \n     overwhelmingly support the concept of adoption, and in \n     particular foster care adoption . . . foster care adoptions \n     have not increased significantly over the past five years'';\n       Whereas while 4 in 10 Americans have considered adoption, a \n     majority of Americans have misperceptions about the process \n     of\n\n[[Page S6806]]\n\n     adopting children from foster care and the children who are \n     eligible for adoption;\n       Whereas 71 percent of those who have considered adoption \n     consider adopting children from foster care above other forms \n     of adoption;\n       Whereas 45 percent of Americans believe that children enter \n     the foster care system because of juvenile delinquency, when \n     in reality the vast majority of children who have entered the \n     foster care system were victims of neglect, abandonment, or \n     abuse;\n       Whereas 46 percent of Americans believe that foster care \n     adoption is expensive, when in reality there is no \n     substantial cost for adopting from foster care and financial \n     support is available to adoptive parents after the adoption \n     is finalized;\n       Whereas family reunification, kinship care, and domestic \n     and inter-county adoption promote permanency and stability to \n     a far greater degree than long-term institutionalization and \n     long-term, often disrupted foster care;\n       Whereas both National Adoption Day and National Adoption \n     Month occur in the month of November;\n       Whereas National Adoption Day is a collective national \n     effort to find permanent, loving families for children in the \n     foster care system;\n       Whereas since the first National Adoption Day in 2000, \n     nearly 40,000 children have joined forever families during \n     National Adoption Day;\n       Whereas in 2011, a total of 365 events were held in 47 \n     States and the District of Columbia, finalizing the adoptions \n     of 4,187 children from foster care and celebrating an \n     additional 1,030 adoptions finalized during November or \n     earlier in the year; and\n       Whereas the President traditionally issues an annual \n     proclamation to declare the month of November as National \n     Adoption Month, and National Adoption Day is on November 17, \n     2012: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Adoption Day \n     and National Adoption Month;\n       (2) recognizes that every child should have a permanent and \n     loving family; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to consider \n     adoption during the month of November and all throughout the \n     year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/14/senate-section/article/S6806-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 596--PERMITTING THE SOLICITATION OF DONATIONS IN \n     SENATE BUILDINGS FOR THE RELIEF OF VICTIMS OF SUPERSTORM SANDY\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Rubio, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Coons, Mr. \nCarper, Mr. Menendez, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Durbin, \nMr. Lieberman, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Reed, Mr. Warner, Mr. Wyden, \nMr. Leahy, and Mr. Enzi) submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Harmful Algal Blooms and \n     Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 302. AMENDMENT OF HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOM AND HYPOXIA \n                   RESEARCH AND CONTROL ACT OF 1998.\n\n       Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this \n     title an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an \n     amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the \n     reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \n     other provision of the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia \n     Research and Control Act of 1998 (16 U.S.C. 1451 note).\n\n     SEC. 303. FINDINGS.\n\n       Section 602 is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 602. Findings\n\n       ``Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) Harmful algal blooms and hypoxia--\n       ``(A) are increasing in frequency and intensity in the \n     Nation's coastal waters and Great Lakes;\n       ``(B) pose a threat to the health of coastal and Great \n     Lakes ecosystems;\n       ``(C) are costly to coastal economies; and\n       ``(D) threaten the safety of seafood and human health.\n       ``(2) Excessive nutrients in coastal waters have been \n     linked to the increased intensity and frequency of hypoxia \n     and some harmful algal blooms. There is a need to identify \n     more workable and effective actions to reduce the negative \n     impacts of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia on coastal \n     waters.\n       ``(3) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n     through its ongoing research, monitoring, observing, \n     education, grant, and coastal resource management programs \n     and in collaboration with the other Federal agencies on the \n     Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia, \n     along with States, Indian tribes, and local governments, \n     possesses the capabilities necessary to support a near and \n     long-term comprehensive effort to prevent, reduce, and \n     control the human and environmental costs of harmful algal \n     blooms and hypoxia.\n       ``(4) Increases in nutrient loading from point and nonpoint \n     sources can trigger and exacerbate harmful algal blooms and \n     hypoxia. Since much of the increases originate in upland \n     areas and are delivered to marine and freshwater bodies via \n     river discharge, integrated and landscape-level research and \n     control strategies are required.\n       ``(5) Harmful algal blooms and hypoxia affect many sectors \n     of the coastal economy, including tourism, public health, and \n     recreational and commercial fisheries. According to a recent \n     report produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration, the United States seafood, restaurant, and \n     tourism industries suffer estimated annual losses of at least \n     $82,000,000 due to the economic impacts of harmful algal \n     blooms.\n       ``(6) The proliferation of harmful and nuisance algae can \n     occur in all United States waters, including coastal areas \n     (such as estuaries), the Great Lakes, and inland waterways, \n     crossing political boundaries and necessitating regional \n     coordination for research, monitoring, mitigation, response, \n     and prevention efforts.\n       ``(7) Federally funded and other research has led to \n     several technological advances, including remote sensing, \n     molecular and optical tools, satellite imagery, and coastal \n     and ocean observing systems, that--\n       ``(A) provide data for forecast models;\n       ``(B) improve the monitoring and prediction of these \n     events; and\n       ``(C) provide essential decision making tools for managers \n     and stakeholders.''.\n\n     SEC. 304. PURPOSES.\n\n       The Act is amended by inserting after section 602 the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 602A. Purposes\n\n       ``The purposes of this title are--\n       ``(1) to provide for the development and coordination of a \n     comprehensive and integrated national program to address \n     harmful algal blooms and hypoxia through baseline research, \n     monitoring, prevention, mitigation, and control;\n       ``(2) to provide for the assessment of environmental, \n     socioeconomic, and human health impacts of harmful algal \n     blooms and hypoxia on a regional and national scale, and to \n     integrate this assessment into marine and freshwater resource \n     decisions; and\n       ``(3) to facilitate regional, State, tribal, and local \n     efforts to develop and implement appropriate harmful algal \n     bloom and hypoxia response plans, strategies, and tools, \n     including outreach programs and information dissemination \n     mechanisms.''.\n\n     SEC. 305.
