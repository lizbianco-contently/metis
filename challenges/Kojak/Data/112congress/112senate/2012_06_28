Mr. President, the next hour will be divided between the \nRepublicans and Democrats. The Republicans will control the first half \nand the majority will control the final half.\n  It was last night, but just barely, when we finally worked out some \nagreement on a piece of legislation we are dealing with. The House \nposted that last night just before midnight to meet their rules. It \nincludes the transportation conference and flood insurance and student \nloans in one package. I say to all of my Senators that we are going to \nfinish this before we leave. I hope we can do it today. We certainly \ncan if the will is there. Otherwise, if it takes tomorrow or whenever, \nwe have to finish the bill. I know everyone has a lot of work to do, \nbut we have to finish this legislation. The student loan program \nexpires at the end of the month. The highway program has to be \ncompleted by the end of the month. The work that has been done has been \nhard.\n  I met with the Democratic chairs yesterday at noon. I explained to \neveryone that we were trying to work our way through this. These are \nveteran legislators, the chairmen of all of the committees here in the \nSenate. We talked a lot about compromise being what legislation is all \nabout. Legislation is the art of compromise, consensus building, but \nwhen it comes right down to doing that, it is hard for Senators to give \nup what they want. But this is a bill that affects almost 3 million \npeople. That is just the transportation part of it--the flood part, 7 \nmillion people, and the student loan, 7 million people. So everyone had \nto give a little bit or we could not have gotten this done.\n  I am terribly disappointed on a part of what did not get done. I have \nalways been a big fan of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I do not \nhave a better friend in the world than Ken Salazar. This is something \nhe wanted so very much, but we could not get it done. So there is a lot \nof disappointment in many different areas.\n  But this is legislation at its best. I say that purposefully. It is \nhard to get these pieces of legislation done, but we got it done. And \nas I said, we are going to work through the process. With the Senate \nbeing such that it is, people can hold measures up, but they cannot \nhold them up forever. So we are going to work through this. It is for \nthe betterment of our country if we complete this legislation as \nquickly as possible.\n\n\n                Measure Placed on the Calendar--S. 3342\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, S. 3342 is at the desk and due for its \nsecond reading.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the title of \nthe bill for the second time.\n\n[[Page S4690]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3342) to improve information security, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would object to any further proceedings \nwith respect to this matter at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a lot going on in Washington today. \nI so admire the Supreme Court's ability to keep everything quiet. I \nmean, it is really incredible that we are going to have two major \ndecisions this week--one dealing with immigration, one dealing with \nhealth care--and there has not been a single word that has come out of \nthe Supreme Court. I am so impressed. That is the way it has always \nbeen, and I hope it stays that way.\n  Today the Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality of the \nlandmark health reform that made affordable, quality care a right for \nevery American. Millions of Americans are already seeing the benefits \nof this law--I repeat, millions of Americans. The Democrats are very \nproud that we stood for the right of every man, woman, and child to \nlifesaving medical care instead of standing for insurance companies \nthat worry more about making money than making people better.\n  The Supreme Court's decision, being a lawyer myself--I know the \nPresiding Officer was the chief legal officer for the State of New \nMexico, the attorney general--when you are in the area of law and are a \nlawyer, whatever the Court does, you accept that. That is our form of \ngovernment. We are a nation of laws, not a nation of men. So whatever \nthe Court does, we will work through that. If they uphold it, that is \ngreat. If they do not uphold it, whatever it is, we stand ready, \nwilling, and able to work to make sure Americans have the ability to \nget health care when they are sick.\n  I look forward to the opinion coming out in the next half hour or so, \nand we will see what that holds. I know that will cause a lot of \ninterest here in the Senate, but we cannot take our eyes off what we \nhave to do today; that is, figure a way forward on these other matters \nwith which we have to deal--flood insurance, student loans, and the big \nTransportation bill.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nfollowing hour will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the Republicans controlling the first \nhalf and the majority controlling the final half.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                            Debt and Deficit\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I come to floor to talk about a bit of a \ncrisis the United States is in right now. We are out of money, but we \nare not recognizing that we are out of money. We must make that \nrealization soon. We are going to have to do some work for this country \nto keep it operating so that the next generation has the same hope as \nthe present generation.\n  I think the best example of where we are is probably this highway \nbill. Highways are important to this country. We need them to get from \none place to another. We need them to move the goods across this \ncountry to keep the economy going--highways are extremely important. \nHighways have always been funded from a gas tax, until now. Using \ndifferent funding is a prime example of what is about to happen in all \nof the bills that we do because we have run out of money and we haven't \ntaken the necessary steps to solve that crisis.\n  When the highway bill came to the Finance Committee, I suggested that \nwe ought to change the gas tax so that there was an inflationary rate \nadded each year for the following year. That was the least that I could \nthink of to do for highways. It would have added half a cent a gallon. \nThe price fluctuates at the pump more than half a cent a day.\n  I have to tell you, though, that I really thought there would be \nstrong support for doing something like that, taking a minimal step. I \nhad the amendment devised so that it could be changed easily to \nincrease that amount. The Simpson-Bowles deficit commission said--and \nthis was over a year and a half ago--that for the next 3 years, we \nneeded to raise the gas tax 5 cents per year for 3 years. So we really \nought to be at 7\\1/2\\ cents or 10 cents in increase already. Now, if we \ndid that, the highway bill could be funded from highway funds. And that \nis a user fee. If you drive, you buy gas. If you buy gas, you pay for \nthe highways on which you drive.\n  I have been talking about this ever since we started on the highway \nbill, and I have not had anybody say to me: You are wrong, we should \nnot raise the gas tax. I was really surprised. I thought there would be \na huge outcry and that I would be in a lot of trouble for suggesting a \nraise in the gas tax. But America understands we are broke better than \nCongress understands.\n  Both parties told me we would not vote on my amendment. And we didn't \nvote on that amendment in committee, and we didn't vote on that \namendment on the floor. Of course, by my count, I think I had two \nDemocrats supporting me and two Republicans supporting me, but we \ndidn't even really get to debate it. We should debate it. We should go \nto the logical spot for highway money, the spot that through the \nhistory of highways has been used to fund highways.\n  So where are we getting the money? Well, we did raise the tax on \npeople who have pensions, and that is very important. There is a trust \nfund--the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has a trust fund to see \nthat if a company goes out of business and it had promised pensions, \nthen the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's trust fund makes up \npart of that. They do not make up all of it, but they make it part of \nit. So it is an insurance policy for people across America who have \npensions. And we said: That needs a little bit more of a jolt. So we \ndid a couple of things. One of the things was to do some smoothing so \ncompanies would not have to put quite as much money into the fund, and \ntherefore they would have maybe more profit, and on the profit they \nwould pay taxes, and we can steal those taxes to put in the highway \ntrust fund so that we can build the highways. We have never stolen \nmoney to pay for highways before. Never use the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty trust before. But this bill does that. And then there is \nanother little bit of money that comes right out of the Pension Benefit \nGuarantee trust fund that goes into the highway bill. That is the wrong \nway to do business. We should not violate trust funds.\n\n  Wait until the seniors who said ``don't touch my Social Security'' \nrealize that Social Security is a trust fund and that we are stealing \nfrom trust funds. I think we will hear a furor across this country that \nwill be unmatched if Social Security is touched. So we are not touching \nthat one--yet.\n  We have maxed out our credit cards. You know what a maxed-out credit \ncard is. That is when you buy something and the clerk says: I am sorry, \nbut there is a hold on your card. When you check on it, you find out \nthat you have so much debt with that credit card company that they are \nnot going to let you charge any more. Well, we have maxed out a lot of \nour credit cards. We are relying on foreign countries to help us out \nwith our debt. There is a problem in Europe right now. The euro is \nhaving a real tough strain. Eight of the banks that have a lot of euros \nhave invested that in U.S. bonds because we are the safest place in the \nworld. But if those banks collapse, they will need their money. Between \nthose eight euro banks and the four Japanese banks, that is 40 percent \nof the money, almost 40 percent of the money we borrow from other \ncountries in order to keep our government going. We are at $16 trillion \nworth of debt. What is worse, we have quadrupled the bottom line on the \nFederal Reserve. We have made money--we have printed money to four \ntimes the amount of money we had 3 years ago.\n  We are facing some really difficult times, and we are going to have \nto deed up to those. One of those ways would be to raise the gas tax \nand to do the highway bill the way the highway bill ought to be done.\n  Now, I mention these trust funds, and I mention them for a very \nspecific reason; that is, they found a trust fund\n\n[[Page S4691]]\n\nthey could violate. They did it very cleverly. They did not mention it \nto anybody who is going to be affected by the trust fund. Fortunately, \nthere were some diligent people who took a look at that highway trust \nfund bill, and they said: Wow, they are going after abandoned mine land \nmoney in this bill.\n  That is an abandoned mine land trust fund. The money comes from coal \nthat is mined, and the money, the tax on that coal, is supposed to go \nto fix abandoned mines across the country. The conference report's \ndrafters found $700 million in that trust fund. That trust fund hasn't \nmaxed out its credit cards because, so far, we are still mining coal in \nthis country, and so far there is money going into it.\n  But there are uses for that money that need to be achieved. It helps \nfix abandoned mine lands. Another use is taking care of orphan miners. \nI mentioned the pension folks before; when their company goes out of \nbusiness, they get a little help. Under the abandoned mine land trust \nfund, if a coal company goes out of business and the miners don't have \nany health insurance then part of this abandoned mine land money goes \nto make them whole in the health insurance area.\n  This system was part of a grand coalition that came together to solve \nsome problems that are involved with mining in America. The companies \nand the employees and the States that were involved said this probably \nisn't the perfect solution, but it helps a lot of people, so we were \ngoing to do it, and we did it. We were able to override a point of \norder on the budget in order to maintain that trust fund and move the \nmoney from the trust fund to where it was supposed to be used.\n  For more than a decade, the money wasn't even taken out of the trust \nfund, and do you know why? Anytime I asked about it and said we needed \nsome of the money, the government said: Oh, I am sorry. You will have \nto put some money in there so we can take the money out. I said: What \nkind of a trust fund do you have to put money into twice before you can \nget money out? The money already went in there once before. Here is how \nit works. The money goes into bonds and the bonds go into the drawer \nand the money gets spent. Think about that. Seniors have been \ncomplaining about the Social Security trust fund and how we have been \nspending money from the Social Security trust fund. They were more \nclever than most people who are involved in trust funds because they \nfigured it out.\n  The Social Security trust fund has a whole bunch of bonds in the \ndrawer. It doesn't have money in the drawer. But don't worry, those \nbonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of \nAmerica, and Europe is about to have a huge problem.\n  It is kind of interesting. In America, every single man, woman, and \nchild owes more than $49,000 in national debt--and it is growing daily. \nIn one meeting I attended, I mentioned that figure and somebody said: \nCan I pay my $49,000 and not be responsible for the rest of it? I said \nthat is not the way it works. Even if we could do that, that is not the \nway it works. So it is $49,000 for every man, woman, and child in the \nUnited States. If a child is born today, we can tag him or her with a \n$49,000 debt immediately.\n  Why is that significant? You have probably watched Greece and Italy. \nGreece and Italy had to do 19 percent cuts. They cut pension plans 19 \npercent. They cut employees 19 percent. They cut the number of \nemployees 19 percent. They cut the services they provide by 19 percent. \nThey cut everything by 19 percent. You probably saw there were some \nriots in their countries. If we cut 19 percent, there would be riots in \nthis country. Here is an interesting fact. In Italy, they only owe \n$40,000 per person. In Greece, they only owe $39,000 per person. We owe \n$49,000 per person. We are considered to be the safest place in the \nworld to put your money, and I think that is right--at the moment--and \nit will change if we don't act soon.\n  If we keep doing what we are doing in the highway trust fund--and it \nshows better there than any other place I can think of--we won't be a \nsecure place to invest. The way we are fiddling with funds and \nshuffling credit cards so we are not using the maxed-out ones, has to \nstop, my friends.\n  With the highway bill before us, the conferees did construct a bill \nso they could get quite a few votes on it. They put a limit on the \namount of money certified states could get from the abandoned mine land \ntrust fund. It doesn't discriminate against very many States. It does \ndiscriminate against Wyoming, and so I make a plea that they not do \nthat and remove the section of the bill. Trust fund money needs to go \nfor what the trust fund said the money would go for.\n  Even if they decide to steal from Wyoming--and I hope they don't--but \neven if they do, the money ought to go into the other States that are a \npart of the trust fund that need to do mine clean up. Over the 10 years \nof the bill, it takes about $715 million worth of money from the \nabandoned mine land trust fun--10 years. I did mention 10 years.\n  There is a reason I mentioned 10 years. This highway bill we are \ntalking about doesn't get all the money from all the places we are \nstealing from in a short enough period to pay for the highways we are \ngoing to build over the life of that bill. After the bill expires and \nall those things have been built, we will still be trying to collect \nthe money from the sources it has been stolen from in order to pay for \nwhat has already been built. OK. What happens when we get to the end of \nthis highway bill, and we are still waiting for all the places we stole \nthe money from to get the money in? Where do we steal the next money \nfrom? We better raise the gas tax. We better take a look at what we are \ndoing, and make changes. If there is a user fee--and that is what the \ngas tax is--if we use the highways, we buy gas; if we buy gas, we pay \ninto the trust fund. We should use the user fee to pay for highways. We \nhave an additional problem that is the user fee is probably diminishing \nbecause there are cars that run on electricity now, and that will \nprobably be increasing. Alternative fuels will be increasing, and that \nwill affect how much money goes into the trust fund.\n  But just to meet the immediate needs, there needs to be something \ndone, and stealing from other trust funds is not the way to do it. If \nwe get in the habit of stealing from trust funds, Social Security will \nhave to watch out. Of course, that will be the end of the road for a \nlot of people in this body if they start stealing from Social Security. \nBut it ought to be the end of the road for people if they are stealing \nfrom other trust funds because it starts the habit, and we can't afford \nthat habit.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy, I am pleased to see the Supreme \nCourt put the rule of law ahead of partisanship and ruled that the \naffordable care act is constitutional.\n  This is a long opinion. We know when we come back here after the \nelections there may be some work we need to do to improve the law, and \nwe will do it together. But today millions of Americans are already \nseeing the benefits of the law we passed. Seniors are saving money on \ntheir prescriptions and checkups, children can no longer be denied \ninsurance because they have a preexisting condition--protection that \nwill soon extend to every American. No longer will American families be \na car accident or heart attack away from bankruptcy.\n  Every Thursday I have a ``Welcome to Washington.'' Today we had a \ngroup of people from Nevada who have or have relatives who have cystic \nfibrosis.\n  It has been so hard for these young people to get insurance. It is \nnot going to be that way anymore. No longer will Americans live in fear \nof losing their health insurance because they lose a job. No longer \nwill tens of millions of Americans rely on emergency room care or go \nwithout care entirely because they have no insurance at all. Soon, \nvirtually every man, woman, and child in America will have access to \nhealth insurance they can afford and the vital care they need.\n  Passing the Affordable Care Act was the single greatest step in \ngenerations toward ensuring access to affordable, quality health care \nfor every person in America, regardless of where they live or how much \nmoney they make.\n\n[[Page S4692]]\n\n  Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress continue to target the rights \nand benefits guaranteed under this law. They would like to give the \npower of life and death back to the insurance companies. Our Supreme \nCourt has spoken. This matter is settled.\n  No one thinks this law is perfect. The Presiding Officer doesn't and \nneither do I. Democrats have proven we are willing to work with \nRepublicans to improve whatever problems exist in this law or, in fact, \nany other law.\n  Millions of Americans are struggling to find work today, and we know \nthat. Our first priority must be to improve the economy. It is time for \nRepublicans to stop refighting yesterday's battles. Now that this \nmatter is settled, let's move on to other issues such as jobs.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Ruling\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, 2\\1/2\\ years ago a Democratic President \nteamed up with a Democratically led Congress to force a piece of \nlegislation on the American people they never asked for and that has \nturned out to be just as disastrous as many of us predicted. Amid \neconomic recession, a spiraling Federal debt, and accelerated increases \nin government health spending, they proposed a bill that made all those \nproblems worse.\n  Americans were promised lower health care costs, and they are going \nup. Americans were promised lower premiums, and they are going up. Most \nAmericans were promised their taxes wouldn't change, and they are going \nup. Seniors were promised Medicare would be protected. It was raided to \npay for a new entitlement instead. Americans were promised it would \ncreate jobs. The CBO predicts it will lead to nearly 1 million fewer \njobs. Americans were promised they could keep their health plans if \nthey liked it. Yet millions have learned they can't.\n  The President of the United States promised up and down that this \nbill was not a tax. This was one of the Democrats' top selling points \nbecause they knew it would never have passed if they said it was a tax. \nThe Supreme Court has spoken. This law is a tax. The bill was sold to \nthe American people on a deception. It is not just that the promises \nabout this law weren't kept; it is that it made the problems it was \nmeant to solve even worse. The supposed cure has proven to be worse \nthan the disease.\n  So the pundits will talk a lot about what they think today's ruling \nmeans and what it doesn't mean, but I can assure you this: Republicans \nwill not let up whatsoever in our determination to repeal this terrible \nlaw and replace it with the kind of reforms that will truly address the \nproblems it was meant to solve.\n  Look, we have passed plenty of terrible laws around here that the \nCourt finds constitutional. Constitutionality was never an argument to \nkeep this law in place, and it is certainly not one we will hear from \nRepublicans in Congress. There is only one way to truly fix ObamaCare--\nand only one way--and that is a full repeal that clears the way for \ncommonsense, step-by-step reforms that protect Americans' access to the \ncare they need from the doctor they choose at a lower cost. That is \nprecisely what Republicans are committed to doing.\n  The American people weren't waiting on the Supreme Court to tell them \nwhether they supported this law. That question was settled 2\\1/2\\ years \nago. The more the American people have learned about this law, the less \nthey have liked it.\n  Now that the Court has ruled, it is time to move beyond the \nconstitutional debate and focus on the primary reason this law should \nbe fully repealed and replaced--because of the colossal damage it has \nalready done to our health care system, to the economy, and to the job \nmarket.\n  The Democrat's health care law has made things worse. Americans \nwanted repeal, and that is precisely what we intend to do. Americans \nwant us to start over, and today's decision does nothing to change \nthat. The Court's ruling doesn't mark the end of the debate. It marks a \nfresh start on the road to repeal. That has been our goal from the \nstart. That is our goal now, and we plan to achieve it. The President \nhas done nothing to address the problems of cost, care, and access. We \nwill.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Our Armed Forces\n\n                   Army Staff Sergeant Israel Nuanes\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, just last month we \ncommemorated Memorial Day. Memorial Day is a day of remembrance, a day \nof mourning, and a day of gratitude. It is a day when Americans from \nall walks of life gather to thank and honor the people we have lost, to \nhonor the men and women who gave their lives in service to our country, \nand to acknowledge a debt that can never truly be paid.\n  I rise today to honor Army SSG Israel Nuanes. Staff Sergeant Nuanes \ndied on Saturday, May 12, while serving in Kandahar Province in \nAfghanistan. He was fatally injured by the detonation of an improvised \nexplosive device. He was 38 years old.\n  In the decade that our Nation has been at war in Afghanistan, \nthousands of men and women have volunteered to serve our country. In \norder to protect others, they put their own lives at risk. They leave \ntheir homes and their loved ones to defend the freedoms we hold dear. \nNearly 2,000 of them, thus far, will not come home.\n  Staff Sergeant Nuanes was from Las Cruces, NM. He lived most of his \nadult life as a soldier. He was assigned to the 741st Ordnance Company, \n84th Explosive Ordnance Disposal Battalion, 71st Ordnance Group. He \nserved two tours of duty in Iraq. After returning from Iraq in 2010, he \nenlisted for 6 more years. His unit deployed to Afghanistan earlier \nthis year.\n  Time and again he answered the call of his country. President Kennedy \nsaid:\n\n       Stories of past courage . . . can teach, they can offer \n     hope, they can provide inspiration. But, they cannot supply \n     courage itself. For this, each man must look into his own \n     soul.\n\n  In Iraq, in Afghanistan, wherever his country needed him, Staff \nSergeant Nuanes had that courage. Despite the danger, despite the risk, \nhe went where his country sent him with commitment, with determination, \nand with an unflinching sense of duty. He was awarded the Bronze Star \nand the Purple Heart. There is sorrow in his death, but also \ninspiration in his life.\n  This courageous soldier loved his family. He loved his country. He \nmade the ultimate sacrifice defending it. He leaves behind two \nchildren, Israel and Laurissa. He has left them far too soon.\n  Abraham Lincoln said it best almost 150 years ago. There is little \nour words can do to add or detract on these solemn occasions. But I \noffer my deepest sympathies to the family of SSG Israel Nuanes. We \nhonor his courage, we honor his sacrifice, and we mourn your loss.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. President, we have all heard the historic ruling on the \nAffordable Care Act today. I know the Presiding Officer has been \nfollowing this closely. We all have been following this closely. The \nSupreme Court has upheld the Affordable Care Act.\n  The Affordable Care Act has moved us forward, but now the call on the \nRepublican side is for full repeal of the law. So it seems their \nlegislative objective is going to be to introduce a piece of \nlegislation--and we will have a vote on the Senate floor--for full \nrepeal. I wish to remind New Mexicans in particular what is at stake \nwhen we talk about full repeal.\n  First of all, insurance companies today, with the Affordable Care Act \nin place, cannot deny coverage if a person has a preexisting condition. \nThat is something that is tremendously important to New Mexicans. If \nsomeone has a young child who has cancer and they\n\n[[Page S4693]]\n\nhave to get insurance, they can't deny them because of a preexisting \ncondition.\n  There is no doubt that we can improve upon the law, but New Mexico \nhas already received more than $200 million in grants and loans to \nestablish an insurance exchange, strengthen community health centers, \ntrain new health professionals, and so much more.\n  Since passing the law, more than 26,000 young adults under 26 years \nold have been allowed to stay on their parents' insurance plans. Almost \n20,000 New Mexico seniors on Medicare received a rebate to help cover \nprescription costs when they hit the doughnut hole in 2010. And 285,000 \nNew Mexicans with private health insurance no longer have to pay a \ndeductible or copay for preventive health care such as physicals, \ncancer screenings, and vaccinations. More is yet to come under the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  So this is the contrast: There are some who are calling for full \nrepeal; there are others of us who recognize that there are significant \naccomplishments, and we want to work further with the other side in a \nbipartisan way to put aside partisanship and move forward with \nimproving our health care system.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Health Care Decision\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this morning's decision by the Supreme \nCourt has clarified some things and has made other things more muddled. \nOne, it has clarified the importance of the upcoming election on \nNovember 6, 2012. The only way to stop the overreaching by the Federal \nGovernment, including the President's flawed health care bill, is to \nelect a new President and a Congress that will repeal and replace this \nfundamentally flawed law.\n  Before the health care bill became law, the President repeatedly \nassured the American people he would not raise taxes on the middle \nclass. He declared emphatically that the individual mandate was \n``absolutely not a tax increase.'' But the Supreme Court has made \nabsolutely clear the only way ObamaCare can be upheld as within the \nconstitutional power of Congress is for it to be considered a tax \nincrease, and a tax increase on every single American, regardless of \nincome.\n  The President told us his health care law would reduce premiums by \n$2,500 for the average family. That was another broken promise. Last \nyear, the average American family, with employer-sponsored insurance, \nsaw their premiums rise by $1,200.\n  The case against this health care legislation is very simple: It \nrelies on massive tax increases, job-killing regulations, and \ngovernment coercion. It will place Washington bureaucrats between \npatients and their doctors and it will cause millions of Americans to \nlose their current insurance coverage. So much for ``if you like it, \nyou can keep it.'' And as we now know, ObamaCare has made the problem \nof rising health care costs worse, not better.\n  For these reasons and more, we need to repeal this entire piece of \nlegislation and start over. We all share the goal of expanding health \ncare coverage, but there are good ways and bad ways to do it. The \nauthors of ObamaCare chose a fundamentally flawed way: Yet another \ngovernment takeover.\n  Perhaps one of the most telling things Congress has done in the last \n2 years is pass a bill under Medicare for prescription drug coverage \nfor seniors. Rather than a government-run program, we created a \nmarketplace for competition, where prescription providers can compete \nfor consumers' favor by improved or lower cost and better service. \nIndeed, by using the cost discipline of a consumer-oriented approach to \nhealth care, that government program came in 40 percent under projected \ncost. That is the only time I know of in the health care field where \nthe government has actually created a program that people like and that \nhas come in significantly under cost.\n  We cannot continue to cut health care payments to providers because, \nquite simply, fewer and fewer providers are going to provide that \nservice. We know that is true in Medicare, where many seniors can't \nfind a doctor to take them as a patient because providers won't accept \nMedicare's low reimbursement rates. We know it is even worse for \nMedicaid patients, because that government program pays providers a \nfraction of what they would be paid if they were simply covered by \nprivate insurance.\n  All Americans should have access to high-quality coverage and high-\nquality care. The best way to make quality coverage and care more \naccessible is to reduce the cost. ObamaCare increases the cost. We need \nto reduce the cost and make it more affordable, and the best way to \nreduce cost is through patient-driven reforms that increase \ntransparency, eliminate government distortions, and boost private \ncompetition. Those are the reforms Americans want, and those are the \nreforms they deserve.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama has made clear he views health care \nreform as a vehicle for expanding the size of government and its \nintrusion into the decisions that should be reserved for patients in \nconsultation with their private doctors.\n  Time and time again the President has put ideology ahead of basic \nlogic and sound economics. Therefore, to ensure future health care \nreforms empower patients and reduce cost and make it more affordable, \nwe need to put a new President in the White House.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, as chair of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee in the Senate--the committee that drafted \nlarge portions of the Affordable Care Act--in looking back at all of \nthe hearings we had, the long markup sessions, working across the aisle \nwith Republicans, working with the administration, finally getting it \npassed and signed into law, this is a great day.\n  There has been a cloud hanging over this because of those who didn't \nwant to reform the health care system. They wanted to keep insurance \ncompanies in charge. Well, we said, no, we are going to change this; we \nare going to reform the system and make it work for people, not just \nfor insurance companies.\n  There are those out there who didn't want to change, who didn't want \nto reform the system, and so they brought cases to court. And as we \nknow, this issue has wound its way through the courts--some deciding \nyes and some deciding no--and then went to the Supreme Court.\n  I remember being in the Court this spring for the arguments on this \nlaw, and we have been waiting since for the Supreme Court to make its \ndecision. Well, this morning, the Supreme Court gave a resounding \nconfirmation that the Affordable Care Act is indeed constitutional.\n  Some have been saying President Obama wins this or the Democrats win \nor the Republicans lose--that kind of thing. I don't see it that way. \nWhat I see is that this is a great victory for the American people, for \nthe businesses of America, and for our economy. That is what this is \nall about. It moves us forward so that every American--every single \nAmerican--will have quality, affordable health care coverage--something \nwe have never done in this country. That is why this is such a landmark \nbill and such a landmark decision by the Supreme Court.\n  The Supreme Court's decision allows us to move ahead and replaces \nwhat I have often called a sick-care system--a system that will maybe \nget to you, if you are lucky, in the emergency room if you are sick, \nbut not one that gets to you before that to keep you healthy. That is \nwhat the Affordable Care Act is moving toward--a system of more \npreventive health care, more promoting of wellness and keeping people \nhealthy in the first place by giving them the coverage they can use to \naccess affordable wellness and preventive health care.\n  The Supreme Court has made it clear what we have known all along, \nthat those who want to block this law and who are now clamoring to \nrepeal it are on the wrong side of this issue. They are on the wrong \nside of history. We can go all the way back to those who didn't want to \nhave a Social Security System. They were on the wrong side\n\n[[Page S4694]]\n\nof history. There were those who didn't want to have a Medicare system. \nThey were on the wrong side of history. And those who want to repeal \nthis law can stand with them. They can stand with them in history.\n  But I think history has shown that every time we expand the rights of \npeople to certain basic needs in people's lives, we become a stronger \ncountry, a more unified country, a better country, with more \nopportunity for all.\n  For those of us who believe that quality, affordable health care is a \nright and not a privilege, this is a great victory.\n  I see that some in the House have scheduled a vote to repeal it after \nwe get back from the Fourth of July break. They have already voted to \nrepeal it; I guess they are going to vote to repeal it again. They are \non the wrong side of history. I call upon my Republican friends in the \nHouse and the Senate: It is over. This is constitutional. Now let's \nwork together to make it so that it is implemented and that it works \nfor everyone.\n  I say to my Republican friends that I have never said the Affordable \nCare Act is like the Ten Commandments, chiseled in stone for all \neternity. I have often likened it to a starter home to which we could \nmake some additions and some improvements as we go along. But at least \nthat starter home has put a roof over our heads--a roof that will give \nquality affordable health care insurance to every American. So I say to \nmy Republican friends, bring your toolkits if you want to make it \nbetter and improve it. Bring your toolkits, don't bring a sledgehammer. \nDon't bring a sledgehammer to break it down and try to repeal it. So \nlet's work together, put politics behind us, and make this bill work \nfor everyone, make it work for every American. The Justices have \nspoken. Now it is time for us to get back to work to build a reformed \nhealth care system that works not just for the healthy and the wealthy \nbut for all Americans.\n  This is a victory. It is not a victory for President Obama. It is not \na victory for my committee or anyone else around here. This is a \nvictory to make sure that no one--no one in the future is ever denied \nhealth care coverage because he or she got cancer, to make sure that no \none in the future will be denied quality affordable health care \ncoverage because they have diabetes.\n  It is a victory for families who have had a child who needed \nintensive, very expensive health care coverage to make sure that child \nwould live and grow and be able to take full part in our society, \nalthough sometimes those costs are extremely high. In the past, there \nhave been annual limits, and if you went above that, you had to pay out \nof pocket. There were lifetime caps. How many women have I met in the \npast who have had breast cancer and had to have intensive treatments \nfor a period of time but they bumped up against a lifetime cap. They \nhad to pay out of their pocket. So this is a victory for them. It is a \nvictory for families so that they don't face lifetime caps and annual \ncaps. It is a victory for every family in America to ensure that their \nchild can stay on their family's policy until age 26. That is who wins \nhere--ordinary hard-working families in America. It is a victory for \nhard-working families to make sure that insurance companies have to \nprovide--have to provide--cost-effective, lifesaving preventive care at \nno cost to get to people early on to keep them healthy in the first \nplace. It is a victory for working families so no longer do they have \nto choose between paying for health insurance or other critical family \nneeds such as food, shelter, transportation, education. That is what \nthis is about. That is what this victory is all about. It is a victory \nfor American families.\n  I say to those who now want to repeal it, who are going to start to \nmake a political issue out of this, you are on the wrong side of \nhistory. The American people will now begin to take a look at this bill \nin a new light: that it is constitutional, it will be implemented, and \nwhat is in it for us? And I just went through what is in it for every \nAmerican family. The American people will not want to go back. They \nwill not want to repeal this law. There may be improvements we can make \nas we go along. That is fine. But I say woe to those who vote to repeal \nthis bill. The American people will hold you accountable for being on \nthe wrong side of history, the wrong side of progress, the wrong side \nof ensuring that every American family has quality affordable health \ncare in America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I come to the floor, as many of our \ncolleagues have done, to talk about this very significant and, for me \nat least, stunning U.S. Supreme Court decision on ObamaCare. First of \nall, I use the word ``stunning,'' not particularly because of the \noutcome. I would not have been shocked at either outcome--upholding the \nlaw or striking down the law. I considered both of those clear \npossibilities. I am stunned and shocked, somewhat confused, by the \ndecision--by the nature of the decision, by the nature of the majority, \nand by the reasoning.\n  I am not going to dwell on that. It is not my role or the role of \nother Senators to second-guess it or to claim we have some authority to \nrewrite it. But I do find that doing backflips beyond the significant \npower of the Court to completely recharacterize the individual mandate \nand parts of the law associated with it as a tax--it was never proposed \nas a tax. It was never debated as a tax. It was never written as a tax. \nIt was never meant as a tax in any part of the ObamaCare debate or \nlegislative action. So I certainly agree with Justice Kennedy who said \nout loud from the bench, which I think is significant, that to read it \n``as a tax'' is not just reading the law a certain way, it is rewriting \nthe law. Judicial rewriting of tax policy, judicial writing of the law \nto create a tax, is particularly worrisome. I absolutely agree with \nthat.\n  I do think the majority, led tragically by Chief Justice Roberts, did \nbackflips to rewrite the law in order to uphold it. I think that is \nvery unfortunate.\n  What it also means for the country and for the policy debate and for \nus in the Congress is at least two things, which I think are also very \nimportant. No. 1, it means that if this is a tax, this is a massive tax \nincrease on the middle class, which stands full square against the \nclear and repeated campaign promises of President Obama. So this is a \nhuge tax increase, now that it is a tax, completely against everything \nhe ran on and what he said over and over, campaigning for office.\n  It also means something separate that is very significant. If this is \nall about taxes and spending, it means a different Congress next year--\nhopefully, led by a different President--can repeal all of that with a \nsimple majority of votes in the Senate through reconciliation. If this \nis all about taxes and spending, then it can all be undone through the \nreconciliation process. Of course, that is significant for one reason \nand one reason only: In the Senate, it means that lowers the \nrequirement from 60 votes to a simple majority. If there is a \nRepublican President, that would be 50 votes, plus the Vice President \nas the tiebreaker.\n  So my bottom line is simple. It was my bottom line yesterday before \nthe opinion, it was my bottom line over the last several months, and it \nwas my bottom line the day after Congress passed ObamaCare and the \nPresident signed it into law. It may be ruled constitutional, but it is \nstill a bad idea that is making things worse. It is putting an all-\npowerful Federal Government between the patient and his or her doctor, \nand it is costing us an enormous amount of money as individuals, as \ncitizens, as a society, and as a government that we clearly cannot \nafford.\n  Many of us made those arguments during the original debate. But I \nthink all of those arguments have been validated and are even more \nclearly true and compelling in the months since ObamaCare was passed, \nin particular, because costs have been going through the roof. The \nsuggestion that this was going to save us money and not cost us extra \nmoney--even the suggestion of that argument--has gone out the window. \nIt is clear the opposite is true. Individual premiums have gone up as a\n\n[[Page S4695]]\n\nresult, family premiums have gone up as a result, and costs to the \ngovernment and to society have gone up as a result. It has made the \nalready staggering problem of health care costs worse and worse. It has \nmade health care for everyday Americans less and less affordable. \nBecause of that, I certainly renew my commitment to work with others to \nfully repeal ObamaCare lock, stock, and barrel.\n  Under the Supreme Court's decision today, I restate again that I \nthink it is very significant since it is all about a tax and all about \ntaxes and spending that can be addressed early next year with a simple \nmajority in the Senate if there is a President Romney and a Republican \nCongress to do it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, in light of the Supreme Court's \ndecision on the Affordable Care Act, I wanted to come to the floor \ntoday to bring just a few Rhode Island voices into the discussion that \nis taking place.\n  One such person is a man from Providence, RI, named Greg, who has a \n16-year-old son named Will. Will has cystic fibrosis, which requires \nWill to spend several hours every day undergoing the treatment that \ndreadful disease requires. He sees a specialist four times a year to \nmonitor the disease. He has daily prescriptions and treatments.\n  Without this bill, Will and his father were looking at two problems: \nOne, denial of coverage because Will's cystic fibrosis was a \npreexisting condition; and, two, lifetime caps.\n  For people like Will all around the country, this has been a real \nblessing because lifetime caps are forbidden and kids with preexisting \nconditions must be covered notwithstanding the preexisting condition. \nSo for Greg, the father in Providence, and his son Will, I want their \nvoices to be heard today in not so much celebration but relief that \nwhat they have been provided by the health care law is still in place.\n  Another voice to bring to the Senate floor is Olive. Olive is a \nsenior citizen. She lives in Woonsocket, RI. Her husband has fairly \nserious Alzheimer's and requires several medications to treat it. Until \nthe Affordable Care Act came along, Olive and her husband fell in the \ndoughnut hole and had to pay 100 cents on the dollar for the husband's \nAlzheimer's medications while they were in the doughnut hole.\n  When I ran for this office, one of the things I pledged to do was to \nwork my heart out to close the doughnut hole. In the Affordable Care \nAct, it does close. Right now there is a 50-percent discount for Olive \non her husband's Alzheimer's drugs when they are in the doughnut hole. \nFor them that 50-percent discount means $2,400, which, for senior \ncitizens who count on Social Security in Woonsocket, makes a difference \nin the quality of their lives. Overall, it is up to $13.9 billion in \ndoughnut hole discounts for seniors and people with disabilities as a \nresult of this bill. That makes a big difference in every single one of \nthose lives, just like Olive and her husband.\n\n  A third voice I wish to bring to the Senate is Brianne, who is a 22-\nyear-old graduate of the University of Rhode Island, out and working \npart time as a physical therapist, but her job does not provide health \ninsurance. She would be going without entirely, hanging her fortunes on \nchance, as the President recently said, if it were not for the \nAffordable Care Act. She and 9,000 young adults in Rhode Island have \nachieved coverage as a result of this bill by being able to get on \ntheir parents' policies.\n  Danny is also a recent college graduate living in Providence, having \ngraduated from Brown University. He is passionate about renewable \nenergy planning but couldn't make the health insurance work. Because of \nthe Affordable Care Act, like Brianne, he is able to be on his parents' \nhealth insurance coverage and have that peace of mind.\n  The last story I will tell is about a small business owner named \nGeoff in Providence who provides health care insurance for his \nemployees because he believes it is the right thing to do. He qualified \nfor the law's small business health care tax credit, so he has seen a \nsignificant advantage to his small business from this provision.\n  I think it is a relief to put this quarrel behind us, to be able to \nmove on and deal with the economic issues we face. As we do, I wish to \nmake sure that Greg and Olive and Brianne and Geoff and Danny were all \nheard here on the floor today, because they are Rhode Islanders in \nwhose lives this bill has made a real and practical difference.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor. I see the distinguished Senator from Wyoming ready \nto speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, it is disappointing that the Supreme Court \nhas upheld the constitutionality of the new health care law. Just \nbecause it is constitutional doesn't mean it is the best policy, the \nperfect policy, or even good policy. And just because the Court upheld \nthe law does not change the fact that the American people have \noverwhelming concerns about it--not all of it but a lot of it.\n  In fact, the Court affirmed that the new health care law is a massive \ntax increase on the American people. Congress must get serious about \nfixing our broken health care system. We can start by changing this \nmisguided health care law that has divided the American people and \nfailed to address rising health care costs. Congress should work \ntogether to make commonsense, step-by-step health reforms that can \ntruly lower the cost of health care. I was pleased to see that the \nSupreme Court narrowed the Medicaid expansion because States can't \nafford them. Hard-working Americans are still struggling in this anemic \neconomy and need real action to make health care more affordable.\n  Reforms do not have to start here in Washington. Our Nation's States \nare laboratories of democracy and can play a significant role in \naddressing the health care crisis in America. Governors are in a \nspecial position to understand the unique problems facing their States, \nand fixing health care, like most problems facing our Nation, cannot be \na one-size-fits-all solution. Efforts underway by Indiana Governor \nMitch Daniels provide a great example of what different States are \nworking on. He is moving forward with the Healthy Indiana initiative, \nwhich is an affordable insurance program for uninsured State adults \naged 19 to 64.\n  Outside Washington, some health insurance companies have already \nstated they will adopt several reasonable provisions to lower health \ncare costs. These include allowing young adults to be covered until age \n26 while on their parent's plan, not charging patients copays for \ncertain care, not imposing lifetime limits, and not implementing \nretroactive cancellation of health care coverage. They said they would \ndo that regardless of how the Supreme Court case came out.\n  One of the most effective ways Congress can address the rising costs \nof health care is to focus on the way it is delivered as part of the \nNation's current cost-driven and ineffective patient care system. \nAmerica's broken fee-for-service structure is driving our Nation's \nhealth care system further downward, and tackling this issue is a good \nstart to reining in rising health care costs. What is fee for service? \nThis method of payment encourages providers to see as many patients and \nprescribe as many treatments as possible but does nothing to reward \nproviders who help keep patients healthy. These misaligned incentives \ndrive up costs and hurt patient care.\n  The new health care law championed by President Obama and \ncongressional Democrats did very little to address these problems. The \nlegislation instead relied on a massive expansion of unsustainable \ngovernment price controls found in fee-for-service Medicare. If we want \nto address the threat posed by out-of-control entitlement spending, we \nneed to restructure Medicare to better align incentives for providers \nand beneficiaries. This will not only lower health care costs, it will \nalso improve the quality of care for millions of Americans. In the \nhealth care bill, we took $500 billion out of Medicare and put it into \nnew programs. Then we appointed an unelected board to suggest\n\n[[Page S4696]]\n\ncuts that can be made, and the only place left for cuts are providers, \nhospitals, home health care, nursing homes, and hospice care. I don't \nthink that is where we want to be cutting Medicare.\n  Shifting the health care delivery system from one that pays and \ndelivers services based on volume to one that pays and delivers \nservices based on value is an idea that unites both Republicans and \nDemocrats. We have been mentioning a number of simple steps that can be \ntaken while Congress weighs the larger fixes needed for preventive \ncare. We can encourage insurers to offer plans that focus on delivering \nhealth care services by reducing copays for high-value services and \nincreasing copays for low-value or excessive services. Consumer-\ndirected health plans provide another avenue for linking financial and \ndelivery system incentives and have the potential to reduce health care \nspending by $57 billion a year. Bundled payments will support more \nefficient and integrated care. All of these options have already been \nutilized by a number of private sector firms with great success. The \nFederal Government should be willing to support viable reforms where it \nis needed, but also refrain from handcuffing innovative private sector \ndesigns with excessive regulations or narrow political interests.\n  Our Nation has made great strides in improving the quality of life \nfor all Americans, and we need to remember that every major legislative \nissue that has helped transform our country was forged in the spirit of \ncompromise and cooperation. These qualities are essential to the \nsuccess and longevity of crucial programs such as Medicare and \nMedicaid. But when it comes to health care decisions being made in \nWashington lately, the only thing the government is doing is increasing \npartisanship and legislative gridlock. I wish to leave the Senate with \nsome words of wisdom from one of our departed Members, and that is \nSenator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat from New York, who served \nin this body. He said in 2001, shortly before he retired:\n\n       Never pass major legislation that affects most Americans \n     without real bipartisan support. It opens the door to all \n     kinds of political trouble.\n\n  Senator Moynihan correctly noted that the party that didn't vote for \nit will criticize the resulting program whenever things go wrong. More \nimportantly, he predicted the measure's very legitimacy will be \nconstantly questioned by a large segment of the population who will \nnever accept it unless it is shown to be a huge success.\n  That is a quote from Daniel Patrick Moynihan, former Senator.\n  Truer words were never spoken. We have seen each of these scenarios \nplay out over the past 2 years as the new health care law polarized the \nNation. I hope this distinguished body has the courage to learn from \nour mistakes, because our Nation needs health care reform, but it has \nto be done the right way. Providing Americans with access to high-\nquality affordable health care is something I am confident Democrats \nand Republicans should be able to agree on.\n  Two-and-a-half years ago, a Democratic President teamed up with a \nDemocratic-led Congress with only Democratic votes to force a piece of \nlegislation on the American people that they never asked for and that \nhas turned out to be as disastrous as predicted. How so? Amid an \neconomic recession, a spiraling Federal debt, and accelerating \nincreases in government health spending, they proposed a bill that has \nmade the problems worse.\n  Americans were promised lower health care costs. They are going up. \nAmericans were promised lower premiums. They are going up. Most \nAmericans were promised their taxes wouldn't change. They are going up. \nSeniors were promised Medicare would be protected. It was raided to pay \nfor a new entitlement instead. Americans were promised it would create \njobs. The CBO predicts it will lead to nearly 1 million fewer jobs. \nAmericans were promised they can keep their plan if they liked it, yet \nmillions have learned that they can't. And the President of the United \nStates himself promised up and down that this bill was not a tax. That \nwas one of the Democrats' top selling points, because they knew it \nwould never get passed if they said it was a tax. The Supreme Court \nspoke today. It said it is a tax.\n  This law was sold to the American people under deception. But it is \nnot just that the promises about this law were not kept, it is that it \nhas made the problems it was meant to solve even worse. The supposed \ncure has proved to be worse than the disease.\n  We pass plenty of terrible laws around here that the Court finds \nconstitutional. We need to do some commonsense, step-by-step reforms \nthat protect Americans' access to the care they need, from the doctor \nthey choose, and at a lower cost. That is precisely what I am committed \nto doing.\n  The American people weren't waiting on the Supreme Court to tell them \nwhether they supported this law. That question was settled 2\\1/2\\ years \nago. The more the American people have learned about this law, the less \nthey have liked it.\n  Now that the Court has ruled, it is time to move beyond the \nconstitutional debate and focus on the primary flaws of this law \nbecause of the colossal damage it is doing and has already done to the \nhealth care system and to the economy and to the job market, which \nneeds to be turned around. There are things that need to be done and \ncan be done.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I cannot remember another day when so \nmany Americans were waiting for the Supreme Court to rule, but today \nwas one of those days all across America. Everyone understood that a \ndecision just across the street this morning by the nine members of the \nSupreme Court was historic and politically significant.\n  The Supreme Court handed down a decision, consisting of 193 pages, \nwith all of the major opinions--dissenting and concurring opinions \nincluded--in the case of National Federation of Independent Business v. \nSebelius. We knew this was a case to decide the constitutionality of \nthe Affordable Care Act. That, of course, was one of President Obama's \nfirst major legislative undertakings when he was elected President. \nMany of us who were part of the Senate and the House during this debate \nwill never forget it. I have been lucky enough to represent my great \nState of Illinois for quite some time, in both the House and Senate, \nbut there has never been a more historic and exhausting debate than the \none that preceded the final vote on the Affordable Care Act. The last \nvote in the Senate actually occurred on Christmas Eve, and then we \nhurried away from here to be with our families, knowing we had done \nsomething of great historic import.\n  Behind this decision was my human experience that most every one of \nus has had at one time or another. I can recall in my own family \nexperience that moment when I was a brandnew dad and a law student--not \nexactly a great combination in planning, but that was my life. Our \ndaughter was born with a serious problem. We were here in Washington, \nDC, and we were uninsured--no health insurance, a brandnew baby, and I \nwas a law student. I can remember leaving Georgetown Law School a few \nblocks from here to go over to Children's Memorial Hospital to sit in a \nroom with all of the other parents who had no health insurance. It was \na humbling experience, waiting for your number to be called for a \nbrandnew doctor whom you had never seen before to sit down and ask you \nagain for the 100th time the history of your child. You never feel more \nhelpless as a parent in that circumstance--to have no health insurance \nand to hope and pray you are still doing the best for your child. That \nexperience is one that literally millions of Americans have every \nsingle day,\n\n[[Page S4697]]\n\nwith no health insurance, praying that they will get through the day \nwithout an accident, a diagnosis, or something that is going to require \nmedical care. What we tried to do with the Affordable Care Act was \ntwofold: first, to expand the reach of health insurance coverage to \nmore families; second, to make health insurance itself more affordable \nand more reasonable.\n\n  Let me start with this question of affordable and reasonable health \ninsurance. Similar to my family, many families had children born with a \nproblem--asthma, diabetes, cancer, heart issues. These are children who \nneed special care, and many times families, when they turned to ask for \nhealth insurance, were turned away. That is not fair and it is not what \nwe need in America. We need health insurance to protect those families, \nand that is one of the major provisions in the Affordable Care Act.\n  Secondly, many people don't realize until it is too late that their \nold health insurance policies had lifetime limits. There was only so \nmuch money the insurance company would pay. People who got into \nchallenging medical situations, with expensive health care needs, \nlearned in the midst of their chemotherapy their health insurance was \nall in--finished, walked away. We change that in the Affordable Care \nAct. We eliminated the lifetime limits in health insurance policies for \nthat very reason.\n  We also said health insurance companies should be entitled to a \nprofit and, of course, should charge a premium to cover the cost of \ntheir administration of health care. But we started drawing limits on \nwhat they could ask. We said 85 percent of the money collected in \npremiums needed to be paid into actual health care, with the other 15 \npercent available for marketing, for administration, and for executive \ncompensation. Eighty-five percent had to go into the actual cost of \nhealth care, hoping to keep premiums from rising too fast. That was in \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  When it came to coverage, we detected a problem: too many families \nhad their sons and daughters graduating from college, looking for jobs, \nand not finding full-time jobs with health insurance. So we expanded \nfamily health care coverage to include children--young men and women--\nthrough the age of 25. We thought parents should be able to keep them \nunder the family health care plan while they are getting their lives \ntogether and looking for work. That was one of the basics that was \nincluded in the Affordable Care Act.\n  All of those make health insurance more affordable and more \nreasonable for the families who need it.\n  Then came the question of what to do about those people who have no \nhealth insurance. Some people don't have health insurance because they \nwork at a job that doesn't provide it and they can't afford it. Others \nhave an opportunity to pay for it but decide they are going to wait or \nthat they don't need it. We hear that particularly from younger people \nwho think they are invincible and will never ever need health insurance \ncoverage. So the question was how do we expand the reach of health \ninsurance coverage. We did it in this bill.\n  We set a standard and said people should not have to pay any more \nthan 8 percent of their income for health insurance premiums. If they \nare in lower income categories, we will help them with tax credits and \ntreatment in the Tax Code to pay for their health insurance. For \nemployers--the businesses people work for--they will be given \nadditional tax credits to offer health insurance, hoping to continue to \nexpand that pool of insured people in America. For the poorest of the \npoor, we said, ultimately, they would be covered by Medicaid--the \ngovernment health insurance plan--and for at least the first several \nyears, the Federal Government will pay the entire cost, the expanded \ncost of that coverage.\n  The notion is to get more and more people under the tent--under the \numbrella of coverage. That not only gives them peace of mind, but it \nalso means for many hospitals and providers across America there will \nbe fewer charity patients.\n  Let's be honest about it. Even people without health insurance get \nsick. When they do, they come to a hospital and they are treated. When \nthey can't pay their bills, those bills are passed on to all the rest \nof us.\n  In my hometown of Springfield, IL, at the Memorial Medical Center, \nthe CEO there said: If we have everybody walking through our front door \nat least paying Medicaid, we will be fine. Do that, Senator. That is \nwhat this bill sets out to do.\n  There were some people who objected to the part which said, if \nsomeone can afford to buy health insurance and doesn't, they are going \nto pay a penalty. Some people called it a mandate. Others--myself \nincluded--called it personal responsibility. If someone can afford to \nbuy health insurance, they should buy it because 60 percent of the \nfolks who don't buy it end up getting sick and the rest of us pay for \nit. That is not fair to the system. It is estimated to cost those with \nprivate health insurance $1,000 a year just to pay for those who don't \nbuy it when they can. That was one of the issues being debated before \nthe Supreme Court. So this bill, which ultimately passed, was signed by \nPresident Obama, has been debated back and forth ever since. It became \na major topic in this year's Presidential campaign. I don't believe \nthere was a single Republican Presidential candidate who didn't get up \nand say: I will get rid of it on the first day I am in office. Governor \nRomney has said that. Yet when you look at all the provisions--the \nexpansion of coverage--even expanding Medicare's prescription drug Part \nD for seniors--to think we would eliminate that, think about the \nhardship that would create across our country.\n  We all waited expectantly for this day, this day at the end of the \nOctober term of 2011 for the U.S. Supreme Court, and the decision today \nwas that the Affordable Care Act President Obama signed into law is \nconstitutional. Now we can move forward.\n  Some people have said: Is it perfect? The answer, of course, is no. I \nsay half jokingly, the only perfect law was carried down the side of a \nmountain on clay tablets by ``Senator Moses.'' All the other efforts \nare our best human efforts and always subject to improvement. The same \nthing is true for this. I am sure the President would say exactly the \nsame. The good news is that today, the Supreme Court found the \nPresident's Affordable Care Act is constitutional.\n  There was, of course, some question of one provision or another, but \nthe bottom line is Chief Justice Roberts--not considered a liberal by \nany standards--led the Court in a decision that found this law \nconstitutional. The important part of that is it means, for a lot of \nfamilies, there is going to be help through this law.\n\n  In Illinois last year, 1.3 million people on Medicare and 2.4 million \npeople with private health insurance received preventive care at no \ncost. That is a provision in this law that was found constitutional \ntoday. That means that mammograms, cholesterol screenings, and other \nefforts ahead of time for preventive care will help people prevent \nillness and save lives.\n  Speaking of prevention, the law provides help for States with their \nprevention programs--programs to help our children stay strong with \nimmunizations, programs that detect and prevent diabetes, heart \ndisease, and arthritis.\n  Another reason this law is so important is because of lifetime \nlimits, as I mentioned. Before this law, insurance companies would \nliterally say: Sorry, you hit your limit. We can't pay for any more \nchemotherapy. But because the Affordable Care Act was found \nconstitutional today by the Court, 4.6 million people in my State of \nIllinois alone received the care they needed last year without having \nto worry about an insurance company's lifetime limits. It is prohibited \nby the Affordable Care Act.\n  In these tough economic times, as I mentioned, when young people are \nlooking for work, the fact they can now have health insurance through \ntheir family's plan up to the age of 26 is a sensible policy. Two-and-\none-half million young Americans received protection under the \nAffordable Care Act because of this single provision, and 102,000 of \nthem live in my State of Illinois.\n  Of course, the law, as I said, requires the insurance companies to \nspend more money of their premiums on actual medical care--85 percent, \nin fact. Over $61 million has been returned to those\n\n[[Page S4698]]\n\nwith health insurance policies, and 300,000 people in Illinois are \nincluded, in the form of a rebate, because of the medical loss ratio.\n  For seniors, it will be a helping hand to pay for prescription drugs. \nThey are going to be able to help fill the so-called doughnut hole and \nhave less money come out of their lifetime savings to pay for the drugs \nthey need to keep them strong and even alive. It also means preventive \ncare for a lot of these seniors, so they are able to get the annual \ncheckup in order to detect some problem before it gets serious.\n  From the business side, the Affordable Care Act--found constitutional \ntoday by the Supreme Court--is going to help small businesses pay for \nhealth insurance. The new tax provisions help them do the right thing \nand buy health insurance for their employees. So far, more than 228,000 \nbusinesses across America have taken advantage of this new tax credit \nand have saved $278 million.\n  When this is all implemented--the Affordable Care Act--30 million \nmore people will have health insurance across America. By 2019, 15 \nmillion of these will be in Medicaid and the rest will be in exchanges \nand in private health insurance.\n  Another provision in here was important and that was the expansion of \ncommunity health care clinics. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a \ngood friend and a great leader on these issues, pushed hard for it. I \nhave been to these community health care clinics across my State. They \nare wonderful primary care in the neighborhoods, in the small towns, in \nSpringfield, and in Chicago, that truly help people along the way.\n  Today, the President of the United States went to the cameras after \nthe Supreme Court decision and talked about this decision by the Court \nand this law. He said for those who believe the Affordable Care Act was \njust politics as usual, it was a political risk and he knew it. There \nwere close friends and advisers of the President who basically \ncounseled him not to try and take this on. This issue has stopped \nPresident after President.\n  I tried to help President Clinton and then-First Lady Clinton when \nthey were attempting to get health care reform passed. Try as they \nmight, they couldn't get it done. But President Obama stuck with it. \nEven though there was precious little help from the other side of the \naisle, he stuck with it and got the bill passed. They then challenged \nhim in court at every level they could, and today--at the highest Court \nof our land--it was found constitutional.\n  The President said--and I think we all should pay attention to this--\nit is not only good in its substance--and I have described that--but it \nis also a new challenge for us, Democrats and Republicans, to make it \nwork. The American people want us to come together to make health \ninsurance affordable and available, to incentivize quality care, and to \nmake certain America, the richest Nation on Earth, has the best and \nmost affordable health care on Earth.\n  It took the Supreme Court 193 pages to say it today, and now it is up \nto us, both Democrats and Republicans, to work together, maybe put the \nswords aside and sit down at a table and make this law even better \nacross America. I think the American people are counting on us. The \nSupreme Court, in finding President Obama's Affordable Care Act \nconstitutional, made it clear that now it is up to us to put the \npolicies in place that will make it successful and help families, \nbusinesses, and individuals all across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we have had a monumental decision \nfrom the Supreme Court of the United States, and I have to say I am \ndisappointed, because while the opinion is not very clear, in many \nrespects, the result is clear, and that is we are getting ready to see \none of the largest tax increases in the history of our country.\n  We are all talking about the fact the Supreme Court has declared the \nObama health care plan constitutional, but let's look at how it was \ndeclared constitutional. It was not based on the commerce powers of the \nCongress in the Constitution. It was based, instead, on taxing \ncapabilities--the taxing power--of the Congress.\n  I wish to read excerpts from an interview George Stephanopoulos did \nwith President Obama.\n\n       Under this mandate--\n\n  Stephanopoulos says--\n\n     the government is forcing people to spend money, fining you \n     if you don't. How is that not a tax?\n\n  President Obama replies:\n\n       No. That's not true, George. For us to say that you've got \n     to take a responsibility to get health insurance is \n     absolutely not a tax increase.\n\n  Stephanopoulos goes on later to say:\n\n       But you reject that it's a tax increase?\n\n  President Obama replies:\n\n       I absolutely reject that notion.\n\n  Yet the Court today said this is constitutional because of Congress's \npower to tax. So we are going to see the tax increase go forward, and \nthe small businesses and businesses that are looking at this, the \nindividuals, are going to have a whopping increase in the cost of doing \nbusiness at a time when--I certainly don't have to point out--we are in \nan economic downturn, when the private sector is not hiring, when we \nhave an over 8-percent unemployment rate. Yet now we see more costs on \ntop of what we already have in this country.\n  I don't think that is the recipe for getting this country going again \nand hiring people to work.\n  I would like to read a few quotes from employers on the impact of the \nObama health care plan on their businesses.\n  Scott Womack, the president and owner of Womack Restaurants, is an \nIHOP franchisee. He said:\n\n       Let me state bluntly. This law will cost my company more \n     than we make.\n\n  Grady Payne, who is the CEO of Connor Industries, said--it is very \ninteresting because Conner Industries is headquartered in my home State \nof Texas:\n\n       Conner Industries is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas \n     with plants in 8 different states. Conner Industries started \n     in 1981 with five people and one location. Today they have \n     grown to 450 employees and eleven plant locations. They offer \n     health coverage to their employees and the company pays over \n     half of the total premium cost. In 2014, the company will \n     have to choose how to comply with the law, either buy a more \n     expensive, government-approved healthcare benefit or drop \n     health coverage completely and pay the $2,000 fine for each \n     of their employees. Thus, Mr. Payne has stated that the \n     impact of this law will cost them over $1,000,000 no matter \n     what option they choose.\n\n  The chairman and CEO of NuVasive, a medical device company in San \nDiego, in an op-ed said:\n\n       Provisions of the Affordable Health Care Act are destroying \n     jobs, hindering innovation and slowing the economic recovery. \n     To offset the medical device tax increase, we will be forced \n     to reduce investments in research and development and cut up \n     to 200 planned new jobs next year.\n\n  So what we have seen today is a validation of what many of us were \nconcerned about when this law was going through Congress; that is, the \nenormous increase in the tax, the fine, and the overall burden to the \nbusinesses of this country which would do several things that are not \ngood for the people of our country: It will increase costs to American \nconsumers; it will inject the government into doctor-patient \nrelationships; it will most certainly add new burdens on business in an \nenvironment in which we have over 8 percent unemployment. I also think \nit is very clear that though the President promised that people will be \nable to keep their health care coverage as they know it, that health \ncare coverage is not going to be there because so many companies are \ngoing to drop the health care coverage they have been offering because \nit is too expensive to comply with the government conscription of the \nplan that is required in order to avoid the $2,000 fine.\n  I think what the Court said is insightful in this respect; and that \nis, while they said this law is constitutional based on the taxing \npower of Congress, they are not ruling on the wisdom nor the fairness \nof the policy. I think it is going to come down to the people of our \ncountry because the election this year is going to determine the \nultimate fate of this bill. The Republican nominee, Gov. Mitt Romney, \nhas said very clearly, on the first day he is sworn into office he will \nask for the repeal of this health care law.\n  I think it will become an issue in every contested congressional race \nand\n\n[[Page S4699]]\n\nevery Senate race: Are you going to vote to keep this law that has been \nruled constitutional based on the fact that it is a taxing power of \nCongress? The people will be able to decide if they want this jolt on \ntheir health care, if they want the extra cost, if they want the \nintrusion on the patient-doctor relationship, and if they want to \npossibly lose the coverage they have and be taxed to go into another \nplan--a government plan.\n  We are going to see the erosion of the quality of health care in this \ncountry if we are not able to repeal this law and start all over.\n  Now, I will say the purpose of passing health care reform is to \nprovide more options for people to get affordable health care coverage. \nI think that is a worthy goal. I think we should go for that goal in a \nway that does not burden the economy of our country, stop employers \nfrom employing people; in a way that preserves the doctor-patient \nrelationship and doesn't intrude on the people who do have coverage \nthey want to keep. That should be our goal.\n  There are several months before the election. I hope we will be able \nto do something in this Congress to start a new process of providing \naffordable health care options for the people of our country and not \ncontinue on this path of enormous tax increases--which have been \nvalidated by the Court--as well as an intrusion on the quality of our \nhealth care, and not something that in the bigger picture is going to \nkeep our businesses from hiring more people to get the economy jump-\nstarted, which should be every one of our goals.\n  I hope we can work on this in a productive way before the election, \nbut I also hope the people will make the final decision in the election \nif Congress has not acted before; that we will have a decisive election \nthat will say we can do better. We, the people of the strongest country \non Earth, can do better than a health care system that will be \neventually turned over to the government if we go down this path.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Flood Insurance\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, there are so many important issues in \nWashington today, it is hard to know what to speak on first. But I am \ngoing to take this opportunity to talk about flood insurance. One of \nthe reasons is because there are three States in the Union that carry \nthe most policies relative to our population, and it may be the most \npolicies regardless of our population. That would be Florida, No. 1; \nTexas, No. 2; Louisiana, No. 3; and, of course, California, No. 4.\n  So while this bill affects everyone in the country, the four States \nthat it affects the most and by far are the four States that I \nmentioned, and Louisiana happens to be one. So the people of my State \npay a lot of attention to flood insurance. We always have, and we \nalways will have to.\n  I am sorry to say that just within the last few hours, with so much \nchanging around here at the last minute, I was just given the \ninformation that the flood insurance bill--which we have not even \ndebated on the floor of the Senate--is now going to be put into an \nomnibus package which includes many other important bills: the \nTransportation bill, the RESTORE Act--which is also important for the \ngulf coast, parts of it that were accepted by the House, and there were \na few important parts that were, unfortunately, left on the cutting \nroom floor over in the House--and now the flood insurance bill.\n  I want to make it clear that if I were called on to vote on the flood \ninsurance bill that is now going to be a part of this package, I would \nvote no because there are some very important provisions that I was \ngoing to offer as amendments to the bill that I think are crucial to \nnot just my State but to the State of Florida, potentially to the State \nof California, and potentially to Texas as well. I am not sure their \nSenators are in complete agreement or understand some of the \nchallenges, but I want to point out a few of them. Unfortunately, I am \nnot going to get a chance to vote no because I am going to have to vote \nfor the whole package, which I intend to do, although this flood \ninsurance bill is not in the position I would support. Let me give \nthree reasons.\n\n  No. 1, there is a provision of the bill that talks about V-Zones; \nthat is, velocity zones. Right now, with FEMA, FEMA basically says if \nyou are in a velocity zone, you cannot rebuild.\n  I have St. Bernard Parish, Plaquemines Parish, Lafourche Parish, \nTerrebonne Parish, Cameron Parish, and large sections of St. Tammany \nand St. John the Baptist and Orleans Parish that you can see are \ndesignated V-Zones. This means likely to be flooded, not just based on \ntheir elevation but the way that the historical patterns of storms \ncoming out of the gulf affect them.\n  I understand that we have to be very careful in these areas so I had \nan amendment to say: No, you can rebuild but you have to rebuild up to \nthe right elevation or you have to rebuild according to the highest \nstandards. If we do not fix this, and this bill passes--which it looks \nas though it will--there will be great concerns or questions, if not a \ndownright prohibition, on building in these areas regardless of whether \nyou pay for insurance. This is not right.\n  The other amendment I was prepared to offer is an affordability \namendment. People may not realize this--I hope Members will be \nlistening. Again, this bill affects all the States, but in the \nunderlying bill there is a provision that allows these rates for \neveryone in the country to be increased by 15 percent a year.\n  People are struggling to pay flood insurance now. I think that is \nvery steep. People who are arguing for the 15-percent a year increase \nsay it is important to get this program actuarially sound, it is \ncurrently running a $20 billion deficit. I am well aware of the need to \nget this program in line. But I was going to offer an amendment that \nsimply created and expanded a short, small, but important affordability \nprovision of $10 million that the Department would have to help people \non fixed incomes or lower or middle-income families who of course are \nworking along the gulf coast and in some of these coastal areas. They \nare not sunbathing, not vacationing. This is not about second homes. \nThis is about primary homes. They have a right to live and have been \nliving for generations near the coast. These are fisherman, et cetera. \nThat was an affordability amendment that I cannot offer or file for the \nRecord.\n  This is a very important issue. Flood insurance is not just about \nbusiness and commerce; it is about culture; it is about a way of life; \nit is about preserving coastal communities; it is about being resilient \nin storms. Yes, Louisiana wants to pay its fair share. Florida must pay \nits fair share. Texas must pay its fair share. We have no problem with \nthat. We have been for years.\n  Some Members are now waking up and saying: Oh, my goodness, now you \nare telling us, people in other parts of the country, we have to buy \nflood insurance? But we have a levee. You are telling us we have to buy \nflood insurance?\n  Yes. We had levees in Louisiana for 200 years. Unfortunately, they \nbreak. Sometimes when the Federal Government doesn't build them \ncorrectly, they disintegrate and our people get flooded. Yes, we have \nlevees, we pay to build the levees, and we pay for insurance, and we \nare still not as protected as we could be. Again, we are not sunbathing \ndown here on this coast. We are producing oil and gas for the Nation. \nWe are running the largest port system in North America, and we drain \n40 percent of the continent.\n  Florida has a little different situation. They do a great deal of \ntourism and they do a great deal of sunbathing and other things. I am \nhappy for Florida and their economy. But the people I represent are not \nrunning huge vacation operations. This is not an optional place for us \nto live. It is not optional for us, it is not optional for the Nation, \nand it is not optional for the world. We have to find an affordable and \nsafe way to live here.\n  I had an amendment to try to make this more affordable. That \namendment is not going to be offered. The only positive thing I can say \nabout the bill--\n\n[[Page S4700]]\n\nand there are some positive things, and this is important, I know, to \nthe realtors. I support them almost 100 percent--and the homebuilders. \nI have a very good record with the realtors and homebuilders. I believe \nin what they do and they are right when they say: We have to have a \npermanent extension because we cannot close deals. People cannot sell \ntheir homes. We have to have this insurance program. And they are \ncorrect.\n  Like a lot of things up here, it is a balance. With the amendments I \nwas going to put on the bill and actually had worked out to do so, on \nbalance the bill would have been better. I was prepared to vote for it \non the floor. Now that it is being stuck into this package without the \ndebate on the floor and without the amendments, I must go on record to \nsay that I would vote against the bill in its current form, even though \nI know we need long-term flood insurance. Because of the increased \nrates, the lack of the affordability, and the lack of a fix to the V-\nZones, I think it tips the balance against the bill generally.\n  There is nothing I can do about it. That is the way it is going to \nhappen. But I wanted to submit my comments for the Record. I can \npromise the Members of this Senate after this bill goes into effect you \nare going to hear a lot of complaints from your constituents. I am \ncertain we will be back here within the year, after the elections--\nregardless of who wins and who loses--fixing some provisions that \nshould have been fixed, but because there is not going to be a debate \non the Senate floor will not be.\n  I know this bill came out of the Banking Committee in the Senate with \nbipartisan support. I am well aware of that. But I think there were \nsome corrections or some perfections that could have been done on the \nSenate floor. We are not going to have that opportunity.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded and that I be recognized to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as we know, the Supreme Court ruled on the \nhealth care law, and we have had a lot of phone calls and e-mails. \nPeople want to know what this means above the politics. Sometimes I \nthink that in Washington everything is analyzed over what this means \nfor the elections and what this means to the Republicans or the \nDemocrats. What I hope to do today by coming to the floor of the Senate \nis to respond to some of my constituents from Florida, and folks around \nthe country who have called as well, to show what this means in real \nlife and what my position is toward this moving forward. So that is \nwhat I hope to do here today in the few minutes I have while the Senate \nwaits on the pending matter.\n  Let's begin by understanding what has happened today. The Supreme \nCourt doesn't decide whether something is a good idea or a bad idea; \nthe Supreme Court's job is to decide whether something is \nconstitutional. Today, by a vote of 5 to 4--four of the Justices \ndisagreed, but five of the Justices, including the Chief Justice, \ndecided that a key component of the health care law that passed the \nyear before I was elected was constitutional. They said it was \nconstitutional because it was under the taxing powers of the Congress. \nIn essence, they said that this mandate, this requirement is \nconstitutional because it is a tax.\n  That is curious, of course, because the President denied that it was \na tax. I looked it up. I remember a specific interview the President \ngave while this was debated where he was asked by George Stephanopoulos \non ABC: Is this a tax? He denied it. He denied it and said there was no \nway this was a tax. If I could find the right quote in here just to \nmake sure I am not misquoting anybody in this day and age of fact-\nchecking, the President specifically said that the notion that it was a \ntax was wrong. However, months later, when this appeared before the \nSupreme Court of the United States, his lawyers argued that, no, this \nis constitutional because this falls within the power of the government \nto tax. So that is important because that is the reason this law still \nstands on the books today.\n  Let's remind ourselves of what a mandate is. This is not a mandate \nthat the government provide an individual with insurance, this is a \nmandate that a person find insurance for himself or herself. For a \nmandate to work--and anyone who has been for a mandate will admit this \nto you--the penalty for not buying insurance has to be severe enough so \nthat the person will decide to buy the insurance; otherwise, people \nwill just pay the fine and not get the insurance.\n  So what does this mean in the real world? I found a blog post from \n2009. The numbers may have changed a little bit, I am not 100 percent \nsure, but this is from when the House was deliberating at the time. An \neconomist took this up on July 14, 2009, and he actually used a couple \nof real-world examples. This may be very similar to you, so listen \ncarefully.\n  The first example he used is of a gentleman who is single and earns \nabout $50,000 a year, which is four times the Federal poverty level, so \nhe wouldn't qualify for the subsidies under the bill. Now, he is a \nsingle 50-year-old nonsmoker, small business employee. That means he \nworks for a small business that doesn't provide health insurance and \nisn't required to because the law requires businesses that have more \nthan 50 employees to provide insurance. If he works at a place that has \nfive employees, they are not required to offer health insurance. So to \nreiterate, he is 50 years old, works at a small business that is not \nrequired to offer insurance, and makes $50,000 before taxes. He doesn't \nhave insurance. Now, he cannot afford a bare-bones policy. This \neconomist went through ehealthinsurance.com and found that the cheapest \npolicy he could find was $1,600 a year. Depending on where you live in \nthe country, when they start taking out taxes, $50,000 doesn't add up \nto a lot of money. This is middle class. He can't afford a $1,600-a-\nyear policy, so instead he would have to pay a $1,150 fine, which is a \ntax. That is what he would have to pay. Guess what. Even after paying \nthe $1,150, he still doesn't have insurance. This is the real-world \nimpact of the mandate.\n  Here is another example. This one actually uses my home State, so I \npicked this one. A married couple with two kids has a small business. \nThey run a small tourist shop in Orlando, FL. I am not sure if these \nare real people or if it is hypothetical, but I like the fact that they \npicked Orlando, FL. The husband and wife make $90,000 a year at their \nsmall business. That is what the business makes, again, before taxes. \nThey have a small business making $90,000. Between all the expenses \nthey have and all the other tax components that come up, it is middle \nclass. This is middle class, OK? These are two employees, but their \nwages exceed the amount to qualify for the small business tax credit. \nBecause their business is so small, there will be no financial penalty \nfor a business that only has two employees, but as individuals they \nstill have to buy health insurance for themselves and for their \nchildren.\n  So here they are, husband and wife, 40 years old, two kids, they own \na small tourist shop, and they are the only employees, making $90,000 a \nyear together. The cheapest insurance they can get is a high-deductible \nplan with about a $6,000-a-year annual deductible. It costs them about \n$3,800 a year. The fine is $2,000 a year. So that is probably what they \nend up having to do now. This is a $2,000 increase in their taxes \nthrough a fine, and they still don't have insurance to show for it.\n  This is the third example I want to give, and this is not part of the \nanalysis. I pointed out that the law now requires any business with \nmore than 50 full-time employees to offer health insurance. Now, \noffering health insurance is a good thing. We should try to encourage \nthat and provide opportunities for businesses to do it. Imagine you are \none of these businesses and you are asking yourself if you should hire \nthe 51st or 55th employee. Should I grow my business? Well, as a result \nof this new mandate, maybe you decide not to now. How much will this \ncost us? It is $2,000 per employee if they don't comply. How much will \nthis cost us? Maybe this is not the year to add a few jobs. Even worse, \nmaybe they should become a part-time business.\n\n[[Page S4701]]\n\n  I heard a lot about this in my campaign from franchises. Taco Bell \nand McDonald's are not owned by Taco Bell or McDonald's, they are owned \nby a small business owner. They are going to decide to make everyone \npart time because they can't afford to pay the fine. They can't afford \nto pay for the insurance. This would be a bad idea no matter what the \neconomy is because now we are discouraging them from growing their \nbusinesses. No matter what the economy looked like, this would be a bad \nidea.\n  Let me explain why it is worse. No. 1, guess who gets to enforce all \nof this stuff. Guess whom they have to answer to. Guess who they have \nto prove they have insurance. Your neighborhood, friendly IRS. That is \nwho is in charge of enforcing this. Millions of Americans now have an \nIRS problem because they don't have health insurance.\n  This idea that they don't have health insurance--because if we read \nsome of these statements and interviews that the President gave when he \nsaid it wasn't a tax, it made it sound as though they don't want to buy \ninsurance and they want to use the money for something else because \nthey are irresponsible. They are not irresponsible. They can't afford \nit. There is not a private market for them to buy insurance because \nthey can only buy insurance from their States. If they live in Florida \nand there is some company in California that wants to sell them \ninsurance, too bad, they can't buy it. That is ridiculous. That is what \nwe should be changing here. These people are not doing it because they \ndon't want to be responsible. They can't afford it. Their house is \nupside down. They are making half as much and working twice as long. \nTheir kids want to go to college. Everything has gotten more expensive, \nincluding gas, milk, their water bill, and electricity bill. On top of \nthat, we are going to hit them with this?\n  We just got a report today that shows that the economy barely grew in \nthe first 3 months of this year. It was less than 2 percent. Our \neconomy is not growing. When it is not growing, the debt gets worse, \nthe unemployment gets worse, everything gets worse. We should not be \ndoing anything in Washington that makes it harder for people to grow \nthis economy. Why would we do something such as this to people? Why \nwould we hit the owner of a tourist shop with a $2,000-a-year tax or \nelse the IRS is going to chase him around? Why would we hit this guy \nwho is 50 years old, trying to make a living in the world working for a \nsmall business, with a $1,000-a-year tax when we are trying to grow our \neconomy?\n\n  Health insurance is a real problem. It is. I wish more Americans \ncould get their health insurance the way Congress gets it. We get it \nvery simply. We get to choose, depending on which State we are from, \nbetween 8 to 10 companies, and we can decide. If we want a higher \ncopayment, we pay less premium and vice versa. We get to choose. Most \nAmericans don't have that choice. They get their insurance from their \njob and their job tells them: This is your insurance plan. Pick a plan \nout of this book. Those are the kinds of things we should be working \non.\n  So apart from everything else, this is a terrible idea because it \nhurts our ability to grow our economy. This is the real-life impact of \nthis bill. This is the impact it is going to have, and we are going to \nsee it. We are going to see it in a further downturn in our economy and \nin slower economic growth. This is going to have a real impact. This is \na big deal. People across this country and across Florida have every \nright and every reason to be worried about the impact this is going to \nhave on them. This is a middle-class tax increase, and millions of \nAmericans now have an IRS problem. People will now have to, for the \nfirst time in American history, prove they have health insurance or \nthey are going to have to deal with the IRS. I guarantee that is not \ngood for small business. I guarantee that is not good for the middle \nclass. I guarantee that is not good for economic growth.\n  That is where we are today. If there is anything I hope we can do--I \nwasn't here when the health care bill passed, but I hope some of my \ncolleagues who voted for this will think to themselves: This is not \nwhat we intended. We want to help people who are uninsured but not like \nthis. This is never what we wanted to do. I hope enough reasonable \nminds will come together to either suspend or repeal this, and let's \nstart from scratch. Let's come up with a real plan to help deal with \nthe health insurance crisis in America.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, today marks one of the most historic and \ncertainly highly anticipated Supreme Court decisions in a long time.\n  I would be less than candid if I didn't say I am enormously \ndisappointed that the Court upheld the law in its individual mandate \nwhich requires all Americans to purchase government-approved insurance \nwhether they choose to or don't choose to. I believe it is \nfundamentally wrong for the U.S. Government to intervene in the lives \nof Americans in this very direct way. However, the Supreme Court's role \nwithin our system of government is to interpret the Constitution, and \nthey have spoken. So with the ruling now officially out, what is \nimportant is where we go from here.\n  The Court did not decide that this law is good policy. In fact, Chief \nJustice Roberts went out of his way to clarify this point. It is clear \nin my mind that we must do everything we can to repeal this flawed law \nbecause it is enormously bad policy.\n  While we have waited over 2 years for the final decision about this \nlaw's constitutionality, we haven't had to wait that long to learn why \nthe law is bad for America. The law was a train wreck from the very \nbeginning: backroom deals, empty promises, political tactics that \nepitomize what disgusts Americans about their government. Some of the \nlaw's leading supporters even admitted they hadn't read the 2,700-page \nbill. The Speaker acknowledged we are going to have to pass the law to \nsee what is in it. My colleagues across the aisle hastily passed the \nbill on the notion that there were some gold nuggets in there, tucked \ninside the law, and that maybe Americans would think they were lucky \nenough to cash in. We have come to know nothing could be further from \nthe truth.\n  After more than 2 years, there has been a lot of rain but not a \nsingle rainbow and certainly no pot of gold when it comes to this \nlegislation. Instead, what we have seen is one broken promise after \nanother.\n  Just last week, the administration's own Medicare Actuary reported \nnational health care spending will increase at an average of more than \n50 percent over the next decade. The same study estimated, in 2014, the \nincrease in private health insurance premiums is expected to accelerate \nto 7.9 percent. But the startling fact is that is more than twice the \nincrease Americans would have faced in the absence of the health care \nlaw.\n  This is just one of many studies that indicate the law does not bend \nthe cost curve down as the President promised. It begs the basic \nquestion: Why would Congress pass a massive overhaul of our country's \nhealth care system that actually increases the cost of care? It is so \nironic that the majority decided to call this health care law the \nAffordable Care Act. One can hardly argue that more people will receive \nbetter care under a plan that drives costs upward as well as puts \nMedicare on an unsustainable path.\n  The Medicare Actuary asserted in the most recent trustees report that \nthe law could lead to significant access issues for beneficiaries under \nMedicare, and Medicare itself is estimated to be insolvent by 2024. Due \nto the cuts to Medicare and the health care law, he said: ``The prices \npaid by Medicare for health services are very likely to fall \nincreasingly short of the cost of providing those services.''\n  He goes on to say: ``Severe problems with beneficiary access to \ncare'' will occur.\n  That is just another way of saying, to put it very directly and \nsimply, our seniors are going to find it harder and harder to find a \ndoctor or a hospital that will accept them as patients. To put it \nsimply, our seniors are going to have difficulty accessing medical care \nunder this law.\n  The health care law perpetuates the problems within this very \ndifficult system. It is clear that heavy-handed government solutions \nare not the answer, but that is exactly what this law creates. In this \nlaw, there are 159 new\n\n[[Page S4702]]\n\nboards, over 13,000 pages of new regulations, and it gives the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services more than 1,700 new or expanded \npowers. No one will convince me this act isn't a seizure of our \ngovernment, of our health care system, and putting it under the power \nof government.\n  Americans don't want government bureaucrats diagnosing and \nprescribing their care. They want the freedom to choose an insurance \nplan that covers their needs and to simply see the doctor of their \nchoice.\n  It seems the President even manipulated this sentiment, which is why \nhe said no fewer than 47 different times: ``If you like your plan, you \ncan keep it.'' He knew that pledge would help him gain support for his \nlaw, but, sadly, the American public was misled and his promise can't \nbe kept.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates up to 20 \nmillion Americans could lose the insurance they get through work--the \ninsurance they like and want to keep--because of this health care law. \nFamilies in 17 States, including my own State of Nebraska, no longer \nhave access to child-only health insurance because of the mandates in \nthis misguided legislation. That is not the only way the law will hurt \nhard-working American families. The Director of the CBO testified that \nthe new law will mean 800,000 fewer jobs over the next decade.\n\n  The American people deserve more than a laundry list of flawed \npolicies and empty pledges. Americans deserve step-by-step reform \ninstead of rushed policy; transparent reforms, not a 2,700-page \nentangled mess; and an open debate, not a closed-door discussion and \nthe backroom deals that were so necessary to get this flawed piece of \nlegislation passed. More than anything, they deserve sound policy that \ndelivers on the promises.\n  I will do everything I can to continue to push to repeal this \nmisguided law and to push for policies that set us on the right course \nbecause the path we pave will define our future as a nation. There is \nno disputing that Medicare and Medicaid are two of the biggest drivers \nof our Nation's $15 trillion debt. So if we want to secure a sound \nfuture for our children and our grandchildren, we have to fundamentally \nreform these government programs, not double down on policies that will \nbankrupt them. In that same vein, we can't ignore our struggling \neconomy. Instead, we need policies that promote business growth and job \ncreation. I believe we can pass step-by-step reforms that confront \nthese tough issues and policies that depart from a top-down, one-size-\nfits-all approach.\n  The issue of health care touches all of us at the deepest level. \nWhether it is a new life entering into our world, a tough diagnosis, a \nlifesaving surgery or care for a loved one in their final days, health \ncare decisions should not be dictated by Washington. Families and the \nphysician they trust need to be at the heart of the decisions that \nimpact their health. The Supreme Court has spoken definitively about \nthe constitutionality of this law, but Americans have spoken loudly and \nclearly when it comes to the sensibility of this process and of this \npolicy. It is time to repeal it and put in place sensible reforms that \ntruly do bring down costs.\n  I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the Supreme \nCourt's ruling this morning in the case involving the constitutionality \nof the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. In that case, the \nSupreme Court rendered a decision that may be spun by many, perceived \nby many, as a victory for the proponents of the controversial \nindividual mandate contained within the Affordable Care Act.\n  I would submit today, however, that this victory, if it is being \ncalled that, will prove to be not only hollow but also short lived. I \nsay that because, significantly, the Supreme Court was able to uphold \nthe constitutionality of the mandate only by a series of gymnastics \nthat allowed the Court to find this was a tax.\n  First, the Court addressed the issue and concluded, for only the \nthird time in the last 75 years--only the third time since 1937--that \nCongress had, in fact, exceeded its power as asserted under the \ncommerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Having concluded that Congress lacks the authority to compel \ncommerce, the creation of commerce so that it could then regulate \ncommerce, the Supreme Court went on to shoehorn this individual mandate \nprovision into the Supreme Court's conception of Congress's taxing \npower. This awkward construction is one that exposes many of the true \nflaws of the individual mandate.\n  The mandate itself, we must remember, was not wildly popular among \nthe American people at the time it was enacted. It has become even less \npopular as the American people have come to understand it. A recent \npoll revealed that roughly 74 percent of Americans do not like the \nindividual mandate. This is easy for us to understand when we think \nabout the fact that we as Americans--we are born as a free people. We \nwere intended to live as a free people. It offends our most basic sense \nof freedom to have one of the most personal decisions made for us by \ngovernment--particularly by the impersonal, distant government that is \nbased in Washington, DC.\n  These kinds of decisions should be made by the individuals and \nfamilies in consultation with their doctors, not by government \nbureaucrats in Washington, DC. So the fact that it is unpopular does \nnot surprise us, and given the fact that the Supreme Court was able to \nuphold the individual mandate only by calling it a tax is very \nsignificant. It is especially significant given the fact that it was \npitched to the American people as something other than a tax.\n  The President promised us he would not raise our taxes. He promised \nus the individual mandate did not amount to a tax increase. He promised \nus all along that he would never raise the taxes of any American \nearning less than $250,000 a year. Well, those who participated in \nCongress who voted for this provision also promised us this would not \namount to a tax increase. They did so for one simple reason: They knew \nit could not pass. They knew it would not be able to get the number of \nvotes necessary to make it become law if they called it a tax. So they \ndid not. They went to great lengths to make sure it was not described \nor characterized or structured as a tax within the text of the statute \nitself.\n  Now, after the fact, the Supreme Court has taken the step of \nshoehorning this regulation into Congress's taxing authority, and it is \ncalling it a tax, effectively insulating those Members of Congress who \nvoted for it from the political liability attached to having voted for \na tax increase--not just any tax increase but a tax increase that the \nJoint Committee on Taxation has concluded will be borne overwhelmingly \nby hard-working, middle-income earners.\n  In fact, they have concluded that over 75 percent of the burden \nassociated with this mandate that has now been deemed a tax will be \npaid by those earning less than $250,000 a year. It was unpopular \nbefore we were told it would be deemed a tax. Now that it is a tax, we \ncannot expect that its status as a tax will enhance its popularity. If \nanything, we can expect that it will become even less popular with the \nAmerican people.\n  For that reason, I am absolutely convinced that for those who call \nthis a victory for the individual mandate, it will prove to be anything \nbut a victory. It will prove to be something that will result in a \ngroundswell of people contacting their Members of Congress, telling \nthem they do not want their taxes raised, telling them that Members of \nCongress who voted for this promised them it would not be a tax \nincrease, asking them, for instance, to vote on it, to decide once and \nfor all whether they are willing now to call it a tax, given that was \nthe only way in which it could be affirmed, upheld, as a valid \nconstitutional exercise of Congress's power.\n  As we move forward to the November elections, we are going to hear a \nlot about what people do not want out of their national government. We \nwill\n\n[[Page S4703]]\n\ncontinue to hear a lot from those people who are offended by this \nnotion that the government can tell them where to go to the doctor and \nhow to pay for it, who are offended by the notion that government would \nstep in and tell Americans: You have to buy health insurance, not just \nany health insurance but that health insurance which Congress, in its \ninfinite wisdom, has deemed necessary for every American to purchase. \nAnd if you do not, you are going to be penalized. If you do not, you \nare going to be taxed.\n  People are going to be upset about this. They are going to complain \nto Congress and to candidates for Congress. They are going to complain \nto the President and to other candidates for the Presidency that this \nis not the kind of government they want. After they do that, they will \nproceed, and they will start talking about what kind of government they \ndo want. That is where we have to move, away from the kind of \ngovernment we do not want toward the kind of government we do want.\n  The kind of government we do want today is, in so many respects, the \nsame kind of government we as Americans have always wanted ever since \nour founding; that is, a government that at the national level \nrecognizes limits to its power, recognizes that whenever government \nacts it does so at the expense of our individual liberty.\n  When the Federal Government acts, to a significant degree it does so \nat the expense of our State governments, governments which are closer \nto the people and often more responsive to the needs and to the \nevolving demands of the people. This is not simply a technicality upon \nwhich we are involved in a discussion. This is a very important part of \nthe political process. It is essential that any time we raise taxes, we \ndo so in a way that is clear to the people and that we stand \naccountable to the people for raising taxes. The courts do not have the \nexpertise to do that, and yet they exercised that power today.\n\n  As the majority opinion today reminded:\n\n       The Supreme Court of the United States possesses neither \n     the expertise nor the prerogative to make policy judgments. \n     Those decisions are entrusted to our Nation's elected leaders \n     who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with \n     them.\n\n  This reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from our country's \ngreatest Founding Father, George Washington, who said something very \nsimilar way back in 1789, when he explained:\n\n       The power under the Constitution will always be in the \n     people. It is entrusted for certain defined purposes and for \n     a limited period to the representatives of their own \n     choosing. And whenever it is executed contrary to their \n     interests or not agreeable to their wishes, their servants \n     can and undoubtedly will be recalled.\n\n  This reminds us of the fact that we as Americans are in control of \nour own destiny as a nation. We as Americans are here and have the \nprerogative to explain what we want and what we do not want out of our \ngovernment. The government exists to serve the people and not the other \nway around. The decision rendered by the Supreme Court today, while I \ndisagree with it in many respects, is one that I predict will usher in \na new era of robust debate and discussion over issues of federalism and \nindividual freedom. That debate, I am convinced, will lead inexorably \nto the result that we as Americans will become more free, less captive \nto a government that tells us where to go to the doctor and how to pay \nfor it, and that we as a people will again prosper as we regain our \nGod-given right to constitutionally limited government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak on the Affordable Care \nAct. Today I am so relieved that the Supreme Court has upheld the \nAffordable Care Act as constitutional. With this ruling, our Nation's \nhighest Court has made it clear that no matter who you are--a man or a \nwoman, a senior facing cancer, a child with juvenile diabetes--you will \nhave health care that is available, reliable, and undeniable.\n  Health care reform has achieved many goals that the American people \nwanted us to do: One, expanding universal access. Now 32 million people \nwill have health care they did not have before. Second, it breaks the \nstranglehold of insurance companies, ending their punitive practices, \nparticularly in those areas of preexisting conditions where they denied \nhealth care because a child might have autism or asthma or for women \nwhere they had a particular approach where they charged us more than \nfor men of comparable health status--30 percent more. Then they treated \nsimply being a woman as a preexisting condition, or a pregnancy, \nsometimes the need for a C section. In some States being a victim of \ndomestic violence was considered a preexisting condition. We ended that \npractice.\n  We also saved and strengthened Medicare, and we emphasized \nprevention, early detection, and screening. That will save lives, \nimprove lives, and also save money.\n  I am proud of what we did in Congress with the universal coverage. \nFor the first time in our history we are committed to covering every \nsingle American with health care. It helps young families to be able to \nlook out for their children. It helps young adults recently graduated \nfrom college, some looking for a job, some working in startups where \nthere is no health insurance.\n  Because of health care reform, 52,000 young adults in Maryland will \nhave coverage on their parents' policies while they go back to school, \nlook for a job, or get that entrepreneurial spirit going.\n  Then there are these punitive practices of the insurance companies. \nMuch has been said about how we interfere with people's right to see \nthe doctor of their choice or get health care.\n  That is what insurance companies have been doing for years. People in \npinstripes sitting in boardrooms made decisions on who could get health \ncare and who couldn't. We stopped them from denying families health \ninsurance. We stopped insurance companies from denying children's \ncoverage. Congress ended, as I said, discrimination against women.\n  I remember when they tried to take our mammograms away, and I said no \nand organized the preventive health care amendment. We women fought to \nhave access to mammograms and other things related to our particular \nlife needs. The fact is we wanted it for the men too. We organized for \nthe prevention amendment so we could limit the need of copays for this, \nso we women could have access to mammograms, so men could have access \nto screening for prostate cancer, so all Americans could get that \nscreening for the dread ``C'' word, such as colon cancer, and how about \ndiabetes and heart disease. These are the kinds of things that, if we \ncan have early detection and early screening, will save lives, stop the \nspread of the disease or keep it from getting worse.\n  Diabetes, undetected, uncontrolled, and unmanaged, can result in the \nloss of an eye, a kidney or a leg, all because one has lost their \nhealth insurance. Because of what we have done in the Affordable Care \nAct, not only will people have health care, but they will have the \npreventive services where, early on, they will be able to examine \nexactly where they are and have access to a diabetic educator and have \nthe monitoring and coaching they need and, hopefully, the diabetes \ncomes under control and the health care costs come under control. That \nis what we did in this bill, and I am very proud of it.\n  I travel my State a lot. As I went from diner to diner out there in \nthe communities, where I could talk to the people unfettered, \nunchoreographed, they said to me: Barb, I not only worry about losing \nmy job, but I worry about losing my health insurance. I don't know what \nwill happen to my family. I fear that I am one health care catastrophe \naway from family bankruptcy. I want to make sure my family is taken \ncare of.\n  I talk to small businesses. How can they afford that? They need \npredictability and understanding and they need access to something \ncalled the health care exchange, where it will be akin to an economic \nmall, where they will be able to go to the health exchange and see the \nwhole lineup of private health insurance companies and the benefits \nthey offer. Small businesses will be able to navigate that and see what \nthey need and what they can afford for the benefit of their workers.\n  This is the American way. This does use market techniques, but at the \nsame time we don't use the free market to endanger the people in terms \nof universal access and some of these others.\n\n[[Page S4704]]\n\n  There are many things in this bill. One of the other things I like so \nmuch was that we insist that 80 percent of the premium we pay goes into \nhealth care, not into the executives' pockets for perks, privileges or \nprofits.\n  I believe in the free enterprise system, and I believe in profit, but \nI don't believe in profiteering. So we said 20 percent goes into \nadministrative costs, and if they can control those, they will make a \nbigger profit. But 80 percent has to actually go to rewarding providers \nfor the health care they do, for their education and training. I think \nit is terrific.\n  Part of the bill has already kicked in. My constituents in Maryland \nwill see over $5 million returned to them because we insisted on this \nprovision. We are for providers getting what they need in terms of \nreimbursement but at the same time looking at and making sure it goes \ninto the health care they need.\n  Today we have had the ruling of the Supreme Court. I was out there on \nthe steps of the Supreme Court, and I loved every minute of it. As you \nknow, I got into politics as a neighborhood protester. I fought a \nhighway and the downtown establishment and I fought the political \nbosses. When I talk to young people around the world--particularly \nthose with aspirations in autocratic or dictatorial environments--I \ntell them that in America when you are a protester, they don't put you \nin jail, they send you to the Senate. I am here because of the first \namendment of the Constitution--free speech, freedom of assembly.\n  When I was out there on the steps today and heard the roar of the \ncrowd, whether it was the tea party who had access to a microphone or \nwhether it was me who had access to a microphone, I knew the Founders' \nvision of America had worked. They believed in limited government. They \nbelieved in checks and balances. No President should have unlimited \npower. No Congress should have unbridled power, and the Supreme Court \nwould be an independent judiciary to act as referee.\n  President Obama proposed a bill. We duked it out in the Congress and \nwe passed it and sent it out into the land. There have been legal \nchallenges. It went to the Supreme Court, and the Court looked at the \nbill not for utility or even desirability, they looked at it for \nconstitutionality. Today, they ruled that the bill was constitutional.\n  I am sure somewhere there is Tom Jefferson, John Adams, and his wife \nAbigail, who said they lived the Constitution, and in that health care \nbill, by the way, John, they didn't forget the ladies.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time to comment on the \nSupreme Court decision on the Affordable Care Act. This was a good day \nfor the American people. It allows us to move forward with providing \nuniversal health care coverage for all Americans--affordable, quality \nhealth care.\n  I wish to quote from a former Member of this body when he said:\n\n       For me, this is a season of hope, new hope for a justice \n     and fair prosperity for the many and not just for a few, new \n     hope. And this is the cause of my life, new hope that will \n     break the old gridlock and guarantee that every American--\n     north, south, east, west, young, old--will have decent, \n     quality health care as a fundamental right and not a \n     privilege.\n\n  That was a statement from our former colleague, the late Senator Ted \nKennedy, on August 26, 2008. This Congress acted and did what was right \nto move this Nation forward to join all the other industrial nations in \nthe world to say health care is a right, not a privilege.\n  The Supreme Court today recognized it was Congress's responsibility, \nand Congress had the legal authority to move forward. As a result of \nthis decision, we are going to find that $10.7 billion has been \nrecovered already today by dealing with waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nMedicare system. We will be able to continue with those programs that \nmake our health care system more affordable. We will be able to \ncontinue health care coverage for those between the ages of 19 and 25 \nwho are now on their parents' health insurance policy; 3.1 million \nyoung adults have benefited from that provision of the Affordable Care \nAct that was upheld by the Supreme Court today.\n  Seventeen million children with preexisting conditions can no longer \nbe denied coverage by their insurers. That provision is now safe as a \nresult of the Supreme Court decision. And 5.3 million Americans on \nMedicare have saved, on average, $600 on their prescription drugs.\n  As you know, we worked in this Affordable Care Act to close the \ncoverage gap--the so-called doughnut hole--on prescription drug \ncoverage for our seniors. In upholding the Affordable Care Act, the \nSupreme Court allows us to continue to make sure that coverage gap is \neliminated.\n  There are 70,000 Americans with preexisting conditions who now have \nthe security to know their coverage is safe. In addition, in 2011, 32.5 \nmillion seniors received one or more free preventive services. So far \nin 2012, 14 million seniors have already received these services.\n  The expansion of benefits in Medicare that was under the Affordable \nCare Act, providing the wellness exam and eliminating the copayments on \npreventive health services, will also now be saved and our seniors will \nbe able to continue to receive those benefits.\n  On the doughnut hole, the coverage gap on prescription drugs will \nsave $3.7 billion for 5.2 million seniors, with an average of $651. \nThis is real money. This is the difference between some seniors being \nable to take their medicines or having to leave them on the \npharmacist's desk. That is now also protected.\n  Insurance companies will provide almost 13 million Americans with \nover $1 billion in rebates in 2012. We put into the health reform \nproposals protections against excessive premiums by private insurance \ncompanies. Well, that is going to save consumers in America over $1 \nbillion. And 105 million Americans will no longer have lifetime limits \non their coverage.\n  Insurance should be there to protect you. Before the Affordable Care \nAct, there were limits that might not have covered extraordinary costs, \ncatastrophic costs. We now have that protection as a result of the \nAffordable Care Act and the Supreme Court's upholding that decision \ntoday.\n  It is also important for small businesses. In 2011, 360,000 small \nbusinesses took advantage of the tax credit that helps small companies \nafford to buy health insurance for their employees. When we fully \nimplement this bill in 2014, small companies will enjoy the same larger \npools and lower premiums that larger companies enjoy today in covering \naround 2 million workers. So we have already made a significant amount \nof progress as a result of the Affordable Care Act and the Supreme \nCourt upholding that law today.\n  I wish to talk a minute about the Patients Bill of Rights. One of the \nmajor parts of the bill was to take on the abusive practices of private \ninsurance companies. We all know that was at risk if the Supreme Court \ndid not uphold the actions of Congress. As a result of upholding the \nactions of Congress, we now find, for example, access to emergency \ncare, a provision I worked on, says it is prudent for you to go to an \nemergency room if you are having shortness of breath, if you are having \nchest pains. It is the right thing to do to go to the emergency room \nand that your insurance company has to pay for that visit. It can't go \nby your final diagnosis that it may not be a heart attack. After you \nget your bill, and it is not paid for by your insurance company--you \nmight have a heart attack--this bill protects a person and makes sure \ninsurance companies do not use abusive practices against you.\n  Access to women's health care is guaranteed under the Patients Bill \nof Rights. Access to pediatric care and choice of health care \nprofessional as your primary care--all that is in what we call the \nPatients Bill of Rights that protects you against abusive practices of \nprivate insurance companies.\n  Clinical trial coverage is also here, and the provision I worked on, \nhealth\n\n[[Page S4705]]\n\ndisparities. We know we pay a heavy cost in America because of health \ndisparities in minority populations and in gender issues. We now have a \nNational Institute for Minority Health and Health Disparities at the \nNational Institutes of Health. That will help us understand why we have \nthese disparities in our system and what we can do to reduce those \ndisparities, because it is the right policy for America and it will \nalso save us money. That law now is protected. That institute is \nprotected and is no longer in jeopardy as a result of the Supreme \nCourt's upholding of the Affordable Care Act.\n  Let me talk about oral health care. We have talked frequently on the \nfloor here about Deamonte Driver, the 12-year-old in Maryland who, in \n2007, had no health insurance and could not get access to dental care \nand lost his life. We said that was not going to happen again in our \nState, or anyplace in the Nation, and we are proud that children's \naccess to pediatric health care--dental care--is protected under the \nessential benefit provisions in the Affordable Care Act that was upheld \nby the Supreme Court today.\n  I also want to comment on the importance of the legal decision beyond \nhealth care. To me, it shows the Supreme Court was able to find a way \nto advance the rule of law and to follow precedent we have seen in \nupholding programs such as Social Security and Medicare, which are \nmandatory insurance programs. It is the right decision on the rule of \nlaw. It is the right legacy for this Court to find a way--in a Supreme \nCourt that has nine different Justices with different views--to come \ntogether on an opinion that upheld the authority of Congress to act on \na major national problem.\n  Now it is time for us to move forward. This issue has been litigated. \nThe Supreme Court is the final arbiter of this decision. It is \nconstitutional. I urge my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, \nto work together to implement this bill in the best manner for the \npeople of this Nation. We know we are saving money, we know the \nCongressional Budget Office says the implementation of the Affordable \nCare Act will save hundreds of billions of dollars over the first 10 \nyears and then trillions of dollars beyond that in our health care \nsystem. Let's work together to make sure it works. Let's work together \nin the interest of the American people. Let's put our partisan fights \naside, let's accept what the Supreme Court has done, and let's move \nforward to get this law implemented in the most cost-effective way so \nwe can indeed achieve the goal Senator Kennedy was talking about--that \nevery American should have access to affordable quality care in the \nrichest Nation in the world.\n  With that, Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, today, June 28, 2012, 30 million \nAmerican people gave thanks, and it is because the Supreme Court this \nmorning upheld the health care law that will provide those 30 million \npeople with access to affordable health insurance.\n  Today is a proud day for America and for the values we cherish \nbecause on this day our Nation's highest Court has reaffirmed that \nAmerica is a country that works for everybody, not just a privileged \nfew. We fought for these values for many years, and this victory is \njust the latest in America's long struggle for a fairer and more equal \ncountry. We took the first step 77 years ago when President Franklin \nRoosevelt signed Social Security into law, ensuring that in this \ncountry no senior would go hungry. Thirty years later President Lyndon \nJohnson helped America take the next step when he created Medicare and \nMedicaid, ensuring that our seniors and the most vulnerable among us \nwould always have access to health care. And today our efforts to \nensure that every American has access to quality health care has been \ngiven the stamp of approval by our Supreme Court. Today we established \nour belief in America, the wealthiest Nation on Earth, that it is our \nmoral duty to make sure everyone can keep themselves and their families \nhealthy.\n  A little more than 2 years ago, we heard the call of Americans \nstruggling to pay for health care--parents who had to choose between \nkeeping their children healthy and putting food on the table and \nseniors who couldn't afford lifesaving medication. So we passed and \nPresident Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, and already \nmillions of Americans are reaping the benefits of this law.\n  Thanks to health reform, insurers can no longer deny people coverage \nfor a preexisting condition. If someone has cancer or some other \nlongtime sickness, insurers can't deny them coverage if they are \nalready sick from these conditions. Up to 17 million children with \npreexisting conditions are already benefiting from this provision. \nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are prohibited from \ncanceling coverage when people are sick. And more than 3 million people \nin my State of New Jersey no longer have a lifetime limit on their \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  Today millions of seniors are already receiving free preventive \nhealth services and are saving an average of $600 a year on \nprescription drugs. And it is not just seniors who are seeing lower \ncosts; almost 2 million New Jerseyans with private insurance now \nreceive preventive health service at no additional cost. For women, \nthese services include cancer screenings, such as Pap smears and \nmammograms. Since the 1950s, cervical cancer screenings have cut \nmortality rates by more than 70 percent. Think about that--70 percent \nof the people are alive now who otherwise would have died if they \ndidn't have the coverage.\n  Young people have benefited as well. More than 73,000 young adults in \nNew Jersey obtained health coverage last year through their parents' \ninsurance plans. This has brought their parents peace of mind, knowing \nthat their children, who may have just graduated from school and are \nmaking their way in the world, will be covered with insurance if they \nneed it.\n  But even with the Supreme Court's decision, our friends the \nRepublicans continue to fight our efforts. They are again showing they \nwill stop at nothing to make seniors have to pay more for medications, \nmore families going bankrupt, and more parents having to choose between \nfeeding their children and taking them to the doctor.\n  Our colleagues across the aisle keep telling us that they want to \nrepeal and replace health reform, that they simply favor other \nsolutions, but they have no proposals and no ideas on how to do that. \nInstead, they just keep giving the American people the same message: \nGive your benefits back; we can't afford it--in this rich Nation of \nours.\n  Well, I have a message for my friends here in this place where care \nis so carefully given: If you don't want Americans, I say to colleagues \nhere, to have affordable health coverage, then you ought to give yours \nback. That is what I say. The Republican hypocrisy is stunning. As \nMembers of Congress, politicians have access--all of us--to world-class \nhealth care, but they are determined to take away the lifeline that \nhealth reform law offers to families who really need it.\n  Let's be clear. Without this law, insurers could once again restrict \nbenefits, cancel coverage when people get sick, and refuse care to \npeople with preexisting conditions. The Republicans want to return to \nthe days when it was legal for insurers to turn away sick children, to \nsay: Sorry, you are not covered by insurance. No matter how sick you \nare, we can't give you any help.\n  And I say to my Republican colleagues, stop attacking the American \nhealth care plan, not the Obama health care plan. Start working with us \nto ensure a healthy and happy future for all of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Americans don't want to relive the health care debates with the lies \nabout death panels and socialized medicine. The American people want us \nto move forward and work together to lower costs and make sure no \nAmerican gets left behind. That is what the American people deserve \nfrom us. They send us to this place for 6 years at a time. That is the \nAmerica we must believe in. That is the America we fight for. And today \nwe are one step closer to making that America a reality.\n\n[[Page S4706]]\n\n  I speak for myself. Some years ago, I was 18 years old and I signed \nup to serve my country in World War II. It was a dark moment in our \nhistory. The war was at its height. My father was on his deathbed. He \nwas just past 42 years of age. He had cancer, acquired--like his \nbrother and his father did--from work in the mills of Paterson, NJ. \nThat is what they had. My mother was a 37-year-old widow. Things were \ntough. Things were difficult. I had a little sister. My father died, \nand we all grieved. I was already enlisted in the Army, and they \npermitted me to stay home until my father passed on. But what happened \nis not only did my father leave grief, but he left bills--bills for \nhospitals, for pharmacists, for doctors. People shouldn't have to go \nthrough that. The coverage ought to be there that says: We will take \ncare of you. You are an American citizen. Be proud of that. And don't \nlet anybody fight to take away your rights to protect their rights. No, \nthat is not a balance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask consent to be recognized for 5 minutes to speak \nabout the Supreme Court's ruling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, there are a couple observations I would \nlike to make about the historic ruling by the Supreme Court today. No. \n1 is about the legislative process. Members of Congress during the \ndebate on Obama health care had a very passionate, heated debate which \nis part of democracy. As I recall the debate, when people on our side \nsuggested this is a tax increase, that all the fines and costs \nassociated with the health care bill would be a massive tax increase, \nour friends on the other side, almost to a person, said: No, this is \nnot a tax increase. President Obama assured the American people during \nthe debate that the fine is not a tax.\n  I think the reason that was so is because if we debated this bill and \nthe only way we could pass the bill is using the power of Congress to \ntax under the Constitution, there would not have been 10 votes for the \nlegislation. Nobody would have wanted to go home and say I just \nincreased your taxes by billions of dollars over the next 10 years to \nfix health care, because I think most Americans believe our health care \nin this country needs to be reformed, and it is in many ways broken and \nneeds to be fixed, but there are very few people in this country who \nbelieve we don't tax enough and that is the problem with health care.\n  That is not the problem. The problem with health care is not the lack \nof how much we tax, it is the lack of choices people have and the \ncompetition when it comes to purchasing health care. Many of us want to \ngive people a chance to buy health care outside of the State in which \nthey live, which they cannot do today. Many of us believe some form of \nmedical malpractice reform will lower costs. Many of us are for \npreventing preexisting illnesses being used to deny health care.\n  I would like to give individuals the same tax writeoffs as businesses \nhave when it comes to purchasing health care, and I am willing to help \nthose who do not have the money to buy health care to be able to \npurchase health care in the private sector.\n  I am willing to do a lot of things, but I am not willing to impose a \nmassive tax increase to fix health care. Also, I do not think it is \nfair for people in the body, during the debate on a bill, to say: This \nis not a tax increase, vote for the bill, and wind up having to be told \nby the Court the only way this is legal is for it to be a tax increase.\n  Here is my challenge to every Member of the Democratic Party who said \nthis was not a tax increase when we debated the bill. I am asking now, \nif they did not want to increase taxes to fix health care, repeal this \nbill and work with me and others to find a way to fix health care \nwithout a massive tax increase. If after the Supreme Court ruling they \nare still OK with the legislation, be honest enough to go back home and \nsay: I raised your taxes to fix health care because I thought that was \nthe right thing to do.\n  Then let's have a debate about whether that is the right thing to do. \nI can promise, it is not the right thing to have a debate where the \nPresident of the United States and the architects of the bill assure \neveryone they are not having a tax increase when, in fact, that is the \nonly way this bill can stand.\n  I believe we all owe it to the American people to be on record. If \nafter today's ruling Senators are still for this legislation, have the \ncourage to tell the American people: I am for it, even though I had to \nraise your taxes to make it happen. Stand behind what they believe. If \nsomeone believed at the time this should not be considered a tax \nincrease and they are upset or they are worried that it is now being \ncalled a tax increase and they think that is wrong, have the courage to \nsay let's start over. Nobody is going to hold it against a political \nleader who is willing to change their mind if it makes sense.\n  I cannot think of a better opportunity for Congress to revisit an \nissue than this. If there is ever a bill that needed to be revisited it \nis the Obama health care bill. It needs to be revisited and it needs to \nstart over because it was passed on a party-line vote. It was passed \nwith statements being made that this is not a tax increase when it \nturned out to be. I hope we have the wisdom and the courage to start \nover and sort of get this thing right.\n  The second point I would like to make is that no one in this country \nhas suggested that health care needs to be fixed through a massive tax \nincrease. Let's find a better model to fix health care than hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of new taxes.\n  A final thought is, how do we move forward? In November of 2012, \nevery person who voted for Obama health care told their constituents \nthis is not a tax. They owe it to their constituents to go back and \nsay: Listen, the Supreme Court said this can only stand with it being a \ntax. I am either OK with that or I would like a second chance to fix \nit.\n  President Obama is a good man and sincerely believes that health care \nneeds to be reformed in a certain way. I agree it needs to be reformed \nbut not in this way. The President owes it to the American people to \ncorrect his statement when he assured us all this was not a tax \nincrease. Many Americans found comfort in that. I have always believed \nthe Court could uphold this law under one theory and one theory only. I \nnever believed the commerce clause was so broad that we in Congress \ncould compel someone to buy a product they did not want. The Court said \ntoday that the commerce clause cannot be used in such a fashion.\n  The bill was sold as a power within the commerce clause. The Court \nsaid today the commerce clause will not allow Congress to make the \npublic buy a product. That is not commerce. That should make all of us \nfeel better that there are some limits on the commerce clause vis-a-vis \nour Congress. But the Court did say when it comes to the power of a tax \nto tax, the Congress's discretion is broad. That is constitutionally \ntrue, and it has always been so. The Congress has the power to raise \ntaxes to pay for a war. Even though we may disagree with the war, we \nhave it in our power to say for the public good we are going to raise \ntaxes to pay for a war.\n  Congress also has the power, in my view, to say: The health care \nsystem is broken. We are going to raise taxes to fix it. I don't think \nthat is the right answer, but I think that is within our power.\n  The Court said today the fine is really a tax. Now that we know it is \nreally a tax, what are we going to do about it? Are we going to leave \nin place the largest tax increase in modern history to fix health care \nor are we going to be smart enough, wise enough, and courageous enough \nto start over? I hope we are wise enough, courageous enough, and smart \nenough to start over and this time do it in a way that is truly \nbipartisan.\n  The worst possible outcome for the American people is for the \nCongress to pass legislation that affects one-fifth or one-sixth of the \neconomy and say this is not a tax, and at the end of the day that is \nthe only way the law can stand is for it to be a tax.\n  So I hope between now and the election we can have another debate \nabout\n\n[[Page S4707]]\n\nhealth care. All those who stand by this product need to tell their \nconstituents: I believe in this product, and I am willing to tax you in \na large way to make it happen. If we had had that debate to begin with, \nthis bill would have never passed and we would have worked together. \nSecond chances are hard to get in life. Congress now has a second \nchance.\n  One final thought about Medicaid expansion. Congress said we are \ngoing to expand Medicaid dramatically under this proposal to insure \npeople not covered by Medicaid today. If you are 133 percent above \npoverty, you would be included in Medicaid. In my State 31 percent of \nSouth Carolinians would be eligible for Medicaid under the Obama health \ncare formula. That would mean an additional $1 billion of a matching \nrequirement by the State of South Carolina to get the Federal money. \nThat means my State would have to cut education, raise taxes, or cut \npublic safety to come up with the money to match Medicaid expansion \nunder the Obama health care act.\n  The Supreme Court said we cannot do that to the States. We cannot \nexpand Medicaid dramatically, which will bankrupt States and tell them \nif they don't agree with the expansion, they lose all the money under \nthe program; that is coercive.\n  In September of last year, along with Senator Barrasso, I introduced \nlegislation called the Graham-Barrasso bill, which would allow States \nto opt-out of Obama Medicaid expansion and still receive the money they \nreceive under the current program. That is basically what the Court \nsaid we should be doing. So I hope the Republican leader will impress \nupon the Democratic leader to bring up the bill we introduced last \nSeptember and legislatively allow States to opt out of Medicaid \nexpansion under ObamaCare if they choose to.\n  I guarantee there will be a bunch of red and blue States opting out \nof Medicaid expansion under this bill because it will make them \nhopelessly bankrupt, and that is not the way to solve health care for \nthe poor. That part of the bill needs to be addressed too.\n  This is a historic ruling by the Supreme Court, but for it really to \nbe historic in its fullest sense, Congress should take this historic \nopportunity to revisit health care and get this right without a massive \ntax increase.\n  I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, my friend from South \nCarolina articulated very well what happened today with the Supreme \nCourt. I think it is going to be a wake-up call for a lot of people in \nAmerica. I think it will, as he suggested, have a profound effect on \nthe elections in November when people realize the Court has ruled that \npeople who don't have coverage are going to be penalized by $695 per \nindividual, and families who do have coverage will have to pay an \nadditional about $2,100, and the employers of America are going to be \ndealing with the government exchange. People are going to be concerned \nabout it. I think they are going to want to send people to Congress in \nboth the House and the Senate and in the White House who are going to \nchange this system.\n  So I stand on the Senate floor and say that is what I am predicting \nand we will see what happens.\n\n\n                        Highway Reauthorization\n\n  I want to make one comment because we are going to vote shortly on a \nsignificant bill. It is the highway reauthorization bill. It makes me \nvery proud because we have been trying for a year and a half to do \nthis. When we passed the last highway reauthorization bill, it was in \n2005. At that time I was the chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. It was, as I recall and going from memory, a $286.4 \nbillion bill. It was for 5 years. Of course, that expired in 2009.\n  The problem we have had since 2009 is that we have been operating on \nwhat they call extensions. Most people are not aware that when we \noperate on extensions, we are operating with the same amount of money \nwe are spending out of the highway trust fund, but we are only getting \ntwo-thirds of what we would get if it were a reauthorization.\n  First of all, they can only do it in a short period of time. There is \nno planning, and they have all said we lose about 30 to 33 percent of \nthe amount of spending power or money that should be spent on highways, \nbridges, and maintenance.\n  It is kind of funny because I have been ranked as the most \nconservative Member of this body at different times, and I am always in \nthe top three. Yet I have always said I may be the most conservative, \nbut I am a big spender in two areas: One is national defense and the \nother is transportation, and that is what this is all about.\n  I have had occasion to talk to a lot of the new members of the \nconference committee over in the House and explained to them the \nconservative position and the conservative vote on this is to vote for \nthe highway reauthorization bill that is going to be coming up to us. \nHopefully, it will be here tonight. It is going back and forth between \nthe House and Senate. I believe most of the conferees have already \nsigned off on this bill, so it is coming up. It has been a long time in \nthe making. I am very excited about it.\n  Let me also say that while I take the position that the conservative \nvote is to vote for the highway reauthorization bill, I am not alone in \nthis feeling.\n  Mr. President, I would like to submit for the Record a statement by \nthe chairman of the American Conservative Union. It is an op-ed by Al \nCardenas, who is the chairman of the American Conservative Union. He \npresents a strong case as to why this is the conservative position that \nshould be taken.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement and op-ed piece by the \nchairman of the American Conservative Union be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Examiner, June 21, 2012]\n\n        Conservatives Should Break Transportation Bill Gridlock\n\n                            (By Al Cardenas)\n\n       The spending and debt crises of the past few years in \n     Washington have forced an important debate about the proper \n     role of government, and the need for prioritizing government \n     spending.\n       The failed $800 billion stimulus, TARP, countless bailouts \n     and Congress' failure to make a serious attempt at \n     controlling our $16 trillion debt have given many \n     conservatives rightful anger over how Washington spends our \n     money.\n       Unfortunately, well-placed mistrust in Congress' ability to \n     spend our tax dollars is now jeopardizing legitimate spending \n     projects, chief among them this year's transportation funding \n     bill. If Congress fails to act by June 30, important \n     transportation projects critical to our national defense and \n     our economy will lose their funding. The effects on our \n     already suffering economy will be far-reaching and profound.\n       While there are important disagreements between members of \n     the House and Senate on this bill, enough consensus exists on \n     the broad framework that there's no excuse for not passing it \n     in time.\n       First, the current framework does not contain any earmarks. \n     This is a monumental achievement in its own right considering \n     ``Bridge to nowhere'' and ``John Murtha's airport'' served to \n     make transportation earmarks the poster children of wasteful \n     pork spending. Second, the myriad of highway spending \n     categories that used to serve as hiding places for pet \n     projects has been reduced from 87 down to 21.\n       Third, thanks to the leadership of Senator Jim Inhofe and \n     conservatives in the House, the cumbersome and unnecessary \n     environmental review process for road construction projects \n     will see significant reform. How much reform is up for \n     debate, but we're going to get something better than what we \n     have now, that much is assured.\n       Fourth, not passing a bill will hurt our already suffering \n     economy.\n       While big-government Democrats mistakenly place their \n     economic faith in the religion of government spending, \n     conservatives know the economic pump is best primed by a \n     robust private sector. Government cannot do much to stoke job \n     creation on its own, as evidenced by President Obama's \n     repeated failures during the past three years. But government \n     can play a profound role in stalling job creation and hurting \n     economic growth. Failure to pass a transportation bill would \n     have a negative effect on commerce and the businesses that \n     count on safe and reliable roads.\n       Perhaps most importantly, those of us who believe in \n     constitutional conservatism understand that unlike all the \n     things the Federal Government wastes our money on,\n\n[[Page S4708]]\n\n     transportation spending is at the core of what constitutes \n     legitimate spending.\n       Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution specifically \n     lists interstate road-building as one of the delineated \n     powers and responsibilities vested in the federal government. \n     In Federalist Paper #42, James Madison makes an early case \n     for the federal government's role in maintaining a healthy \n     infrastructure, by stating ``Nothing which tends to \n     facilitate the intercourse between the states, can be deemed \n     unworthy of the public care.''\n       Let's be clear--the legislation before Congress is still \n     the product of a Democratically-controlled Senate, and far \n     from conservative perfection. But there can be no denying \n     that it represents a marked improvement over previous \n     transportation funding bills. Enough progress has been made, \n     victories won, and concessions secured from Democrats, that \n     conservatives should feel comfortable dropping their \n     objections and working to ensure passage of a bill before \n     June 30.\n       The road to reforming government spending will be long and \n     winding, but conservatives have us headed in the right \n     direction.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am looking forward to having this. Certainly, my State \nof Oklahoma is not the only State that has bridges and road problems.\n  Another good thing we are waiting on--and I feel very confident we \nare going to be able to pass this out of the Senate--is the pilots' \nbill of rights, which we are in the process of, hopefully, getting \ndone. When that time comes, I would like to be recognized to talk about \nsome of the great extensions of justice to people who have been denied \nthat justice heretofore just because they happen to be pilots.\n  I will yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                          Health Care Decision\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nthe Supreme Court ruling on health care. Obviously, we were all glued \nto the television set this morning and watched this historic and \nmomentous decision. I was deeply disappointed with the ruling. I \nrespect the Court and its work, but I was disappointed that the Court \nfailed to strike down this law as many anticipated they would. I was \ndisappointed because I believe the law has been deeply and fatally \nflawed from the very beginning.\n  It became a major issue, of course, in the 2010 election as people \nwatched this massive bill that impacts every American get passed \nwithout bipartisan support. The procedures were worked around and \nviolated in order to pass--even though it was against the will of the \nmajority of the American people. This was a 2,700-page monstrosity so \ninfamously described by the then-Speaker of the House as something we \nhave to pass first so you can find out what's in it. Well, we found out \nwhat's in it. We have had 2 years to examine this and we have seen \nparts of it being played out, with more to come.\n\n  I think what we have learned is this bill is fatally flawed and it \nought to be repealed. It doesn't mean we don't have health care issues \nwe should deal with, but we need to deal with it in a bipartisan way \nthat can be better explained to the American people and that is \naffordable. It is labeled the Affordable Care Act, but it is anything \nbut affordable. In a time of deep recession and over a period of the \nlast 2 or 3 years of a stagnant economy, this law adds a burden of \nregulation and taxation that is working against our ability to come out \nof this deep hole of economic distress.\n  Americans found out what was in this bill, and I think it reaffirmed \nmany of their deep concerns about going forward with a plan that tries \nto wrap up the entire U.S. health care system in one big ball--2,700 \npages worth. It reaffirms the people's concerns with federal rules and \nregulations and taxes and mandates. The American people are saying that \nthis is not how we want reform of our health care system. We want to \nmake it more affordable and more accessible, but letting Washington \nessentially decide how to go forward without giving flexibility to the \nStates and flexibility to the private sector to initiate reforms \nclearly is not what the American people--or at least the majority of \nthe American people--were wanting.\n  Despite the promises that were made about the impact of this bill by \nthose who authored it and by the President, middle-class Americans have \nfound that the health care law is a massive tax. The Supreme Court \nreaffirmed that today. This is not just a penalty; this is a massive \ntax on working Americans--and not just the rich. It is a tax on the \nmiddle class and it is a tax on every American taxpayer, even though \nthe President has insisted, now famously, on YouTube and every news \nstation, that this was not a tax on the middle class or a tax on any \nAmericans.\n  Families have found out their insurance premiums are going up, not \ndown, as was promised by those who supported this bill and authored \nthis bill. Seniors have found out they may not be able to keep the \ninsurance plan they have and could lose access to Medicare Advantage. \nMedicare Advantage is a program many seniors have enrolled in and found \nto be successful in addressing their health care needs at a reasonable \ncost.\n  Business owners found out they would be fined $2,000 per employee if \nthey failed to provide workers with a health care insurance plan \napproved by Uncle Sam. I don't know how many business owners I have \ntalked to in Indiana over the past couple of years who have said they \nhave sat down with their employees and discussed with them how much \nthey are able to provide in health care coverage without cutting jobs \nand without sinking the company. Many companies have worked out \ndifferent types of agreements with employees and various types of plans \nbased on their ability to provide that kind of coverage acceptable by \nboth the employees and the owners of the business. Now all of these \nagreements are wiped out because it is determined that Washington will \ndecide what the minimum level of the plan should be. Several business \nowners have told me they simply can't run their business in this \neconomy on the low margins, if any margins they are achieving, and \nprovide that kind of increase in insurance or opt out of it and pay a \nfine of $2,000 per employee.\n  For those businesses with under 50 employees, there is an exemption. \nOther businesses have said: Guess what. I have 47 employees. Does \nanyone think I am going to hire over 50? No way. No way am I going to \npush myself into a category where I have to pay a fine of $2,000 per \nemployee if I don't comply with the health care mandates out of \nWashington, DC. So what we see is a lot of payment of overtime for \nexisting workers but we don't see hiring. We don't see the expansion of \nhiring, particularly in small business, because of the so-called \nAffordable Care Act.\n  I have spoken to patients and doctors all over the State of Indiana, \nincluding health care providers, insurance companies, hospital \nadministrators, doctors who are part of a group and those individuals \nwho are in a private practice, and all of the other entities that are \nengaged in health care. They all have major concerns with this law and \nto a group, they have opposed this Affordable Health Care Act, or so it \nis described.\n  We have a dynamic medical device industry in Indiana, as we do in \nseveral States across this country. It is one of the cutting-edge, \nleading industries in terms of our ability to provide new and \ninnovative products to make people's lives healthier and safer and to \nprevent a number of unintended consequences from various medical \nprocedures. They learned after reading this act that they were going to \nbe subject to a 2.3-percent tax levied on their gross receipts because \nthey were a pay-for for this bill. These companies that make \npacemakers, artificial joints, and surgical tools find that this tax is \nsomething that drives them to the point where they need to think about \ntransferring their business overseas, or part of their business \noverseas, or not hire the workers they wish to hire. This is a tax \nimposed on one of our dynamic and innovative industries that is leading \nin our exports. This industry may no longer be able to compete under \nthis tax.\n  Just because this ruling that came down today saying the health care \nlaw is constitutional does not mean it is the right policy for us to go \nforward. The law remains unpopular and\n\n[[Page S4709]]\n\nunaffordable. I wish to state here today that I am committed to working \nwith my colleagues to repeal the health care law and give our citizens \nthe power and the flexibility to make their own decisions relative to \ntheir health care and to use those innovative ideas that are out there \nto put a much better package together that addresses the real question \nof rising health care costs and access.\n  I have traveled our State and listened to all of these providers and \nI have asked them this question: If the health care law is struck down \nby the Supreme Court, what would you propose? Because we still have a \nproblem here. We have rising health care costs that have to be \ncontained, we have an access problem, and we have a number of other \nproblems in terms of gaining access to coverage and payment for health \ncare issues. What would you propose? I have a long list of answers. I \nhave talked about it here on the floor. I talked about it during the \ncampaign. All across my State I have talked about the things I have \nlearned from listening to the people who are on the frontline doing \nthis business every day. There are all kinds of innovative solutions \nout there. There are all kinds of things we ought to be looking at. I \nknow all of us who support the repeal of the current law are committed \nto bringing forward sensible, affordable, cost-effective, quality-\neffective solutions to our health care issues.\n  What the Supreme Court essentially has done is say that this issue is \nfor Congress. Congress represents the people. We need to be \nrepresentative of the people. So what we need to do now is listen to \nthe people. It is the people who will decide the future of health care \nfor this country. I believe it is the people who will decide in this \ncoming election. It is the people who will decide whether they want \nevermore Washington--evermore taxing and spending, evermore debt, \nevermore Federal mandates and regulations--or whether they want to \napproach this in a different way that can reduce spending, empower \nindividuals, give States greater flexibility, and bring forward \nsensible, step-by-step, incremental, affordable, tested, proven ways of \naddressing our rising health care costs.\n\n  So the Supreme Court has turned it back to Congress. It is our \nresponsibility now to go forward and represent all those who were not \nlistened to when this bill was run through this Congress in a way that \nviolated a lot of our procedures and in a way that I believe went \nagainst the majority will of the American people. Here we are, and now \nit is back on us, and we now need to stand up and take responsibility. \nThose who voted for it will be defending it, of course. Those who voted \nagainst it--or those of us who were here, partly because it was an \nissue in the 2010 campaign--are here to not just simply say we don't \nlike what is there but to offer also positive solutions to the problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Today's Supreme Court ruling that the Affordable Care Act is \nconstitutional and the law of the land is a victory, I believe, for \nRhode Islanders and for all Americans. Families will no longer fear \nfinancial ruin if a child becomes seriously ill or face denial of \nhealth coverage due to a child's preexisting condition, and they will \nno longer have to worry that the terms of their coverage will run out \nas they are being treated after a major medical emergency.\n  Indeed, tonight, all Americans can sleep a little easier knowing they \nand their children will have access to quality, affordable health care. \nThis is the type of security we want for our children and what this law \nwill provide.\n  Indeed, for the first time in our history, parents can, with some \nconfidence, trust that whatever lies ahead, their child at least will \nhave access to affordable health care. We couldn't say that with any \nconfidence a few years ago--even 2 years ago--before we took up this \nlegislative activity.\n  This law has already benefited many people in Rhode Island, including \nindividuals, families, and businesses. Children up to age 26 are now \nable to remain on their parents' health insurance plan. In Rhode \nIsland, this has benefited an estimated 9,000 young adults and their \nparents. Over 15,000 Rhode Island seniors have saved a total of $14 \nmillion on prescription drugs since the law was enacted, an average of \nclose to $600 annually. Seniors will continue to save on their \nprescription drug costs until the existing coverage gap is closed and \nwill continue to have access to free preventive care such as annual \nwellness visits and screenings.\n  Rhode Islanders can now expect rebates if an insurance company spends \ntoo much on administrative costs and CEO bonuses instead of on their \nhealth care.\n  For too long, health insurance companies got away with increasing \npremiums and decreasing coverage, which resulted in higher costs and \nunfair practices. Beginning in 2014, Rhode Islanders will be able to \npurchase health insurance on a new exchange, a single point of entry \nwhere they can evaluate the costs and coverage of health insurance \noptions. They will, indeed, for the first time for many Rhode \nIslanders, have a real choice about the health care they receive and \nthe insurance they purchase. According to Families USA, 97,000 Rhode \nIslanders will have access to tax credits to make their coverage more \naffordable. Thousands more childless adults will gain coverage through \nthe Medicaid Program.\n  Now that the Court has spoken, I hope we can work on a bipartisan \nbasis to do what we must do, and that is to create jobs and improve our \neconomy. This health care decision is a landmark decision, but the work \nnow--the work of all of us--should be to reinvigorate our economy so \nthat not only can people have confidence in their health care, but they \ncan have the further and indeed very primary confidence that they will \nhave meaningful work.\n  In that respect, I am glad Congress is poised to take action that \nwill enable millions of students and families across the country to \nbreathe a sigh of relief about the student loans they need to borrow \nfor the upcoming academic year. Everyone, from every sector of the \ncountry, will tell us that the key to our future is higher \neducation, that we cannot be competitive in a world economy unless we \nhave the best educated students in this country, that we cannot be the \npowerful force we have been in the world unless we have education.\n\n  The key for so many jobs today is going on past high school into \npostsecondary education. Yet we are days away--unless we act--from \ndoubling the loan interest rate we are charging our students.\n  There has been quite a bit of stalling tactics for months. I hope \nthose tactics are over, as the July 1 deadline approaches. I hope we \nare soon to take action to prevent the doubling of the subsidized \nStafford loan interest rate.\n  I would like to thank majority leader Harry Reid for his tireless \nefforts to negotiate a bipartisan solution. I also wish to recognize \nand thank three other individuals who were absolutely critical in this \neffort, who were leaders, without equivocation, with deep conviction; \nthat is, Chairman Tom Harkin of the HELP Committee, who led with vigor \nthroughout this effort; Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who has been \ncommitted to this effort; and also our colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, Congressman Joe Courtney of Connecticut. They have \nbeen extraordinary.\n  Last January, Congressman Courtney and I introduced legislation to \npermanently extend the law that makes college loans more affordable for \nmillions of students across the country.\n  President Obama called on Congress to address the student loan \ninterest rate hike in his State of the Union Address. Back then, many \nRepublicans scoffed at the idea. In fact, they voted for budgets that \nassumed the interest rate would double, and they did that without any \napparent equivocation.\n  But thanks to students and families across the country who raised \ntheir voices and made themselves heard, my colleagues got the message: \nFixing the student loan interest rate matters. It matters a great deal. \nIt matters to individuals trying to build a better life for themselves. \nIt matters to parents whose dream to give their kids a chance at a \nbetter life depends on being able to afford college. It matters to our \nshared economic future because the single most important investment we \nas a nation can make is to educate our young people.\n  So thanks to groups such as Campus Progress, USSA, U.S. PIRG, Young\n\n[[Page S4710]]\n\nInvincibles, and the Rebuild the Dream coalition that pushed this issue \nto the forefront where it belongs. The letters, e-mails, calls, visits, \nbus tours, and campus rallies made a difference.\n  We should soon be voting, I hope, to keep this student loan rate low \nfor another year. However, it is important to remember this is only a \ntemporary, short-term fix. Now we need to develop longer term solutions \nto the growing burden of student loan debt, the rising cost of college, \nand the need to improve higher education outcomes so students complete \ntheir degrees and get the full benefit of their investment in \neducation.\n  These are tough issues, but we have to address them head on. Our \neconomy and our future depends on addressing these issues.\n  It is estimated, for example, that more than 60 percent of the jobs \nwill require some postsecondary education by the year 2018. In 2010, \nonly 38 percent of working-age adults held a 2-year or 4-year degree. \nWe have very few years to go from 40 percent to 60 percent. That gap \nrepresents the challenge we have in being a competitive economic force \nin the world. Certainly, if we are ever going to close that gap, we \nhave to make sure we do not double the interest rate on Stafford loans, \nas a first step.\n  But, as I suggest, there are many other steps we must take. We have \nto address the rising cost of college. The cost of attending college \nhas increased by 559 percent since 1985--559 percent--rising far faster \nthan costs for gasoline, health care, and other consumer items.\n  Keeping student loans affordable and interest rates low is one part \nof the solution. Providing more grant aid through Pell grants and other \nprograms is another.\n  We need to call on institutions to do their part to keep costs in \ncheck. Yes, the college community has to rally around this and has to \nthink of innovative ways to provide excellent education at a lower \ncost, a more affordable cost. States have to play a role too. When \nState support for higher education goes down, tuition goes up. The \ncrises of so many States--real crises, difficult crises--have forced \nthem to reduce their support for higher education, and the result, as I \nsuggest, has been tuitions climb, and that is another burden middle \nAmerica and middle-class, middle-income families are bearing.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on developing a \ncomprehensive approach to addressing these issues.\n  Also, I would just like to say, I hope we are on the verge--at least \nfor the next year--of avoiding a doubling of interest rates on student \nloans. We have a long way to go to ensure that every American with \ntalent and drive and the skills has the means to go to college. This is \nan important first step. There are many more we must take, and I hope \nwe do that very quickly.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes and bring \neverybody up to date. We have had wonderful cooperation in the last \nseveral weeks. We have gotten a lot done. Our passing the three bills \nthat are left to do--student loans, flood insurance, and the highway \nbill--would be a significant accomplishment. We are going to do it; it \nis only a question of when.\n  A lot of the committees and the chairs and ranking members worked \nlate last night. I talked to CBO today. They didn't get the information \nthat they started scoring until 4 a.m. They are moving forward and \ndoing their best. As with all agreements, things come up, and at this \npoint everything appears to be just right. The committees of \njurisdiction have indicated they have worked through all these matters. \nThey have completed the drafting of a revised version of the conference \nreport. We expect this to be filed momentarily--it could have already \nbeen filed.\n  But what we have done many times is we have voted on what the House \nhas filed before they passed it. We have done that many times. It is \nstandard procedure. Right now we don't have the consent from all \nSenators to do that, but that could be forthcoming. I will report back \nto the Senate within the next hour, after I find out whether we can \nfinish this work tonight or whether we have to come back tomorrow.\n  Everyone stay tuned. At this point, I can't express enough \nappreciation to everyone--Democrats and Republicans in the House and \nSenate. As I laid out to my chairmen at the lunch I had yesterday, this \nhas been truly an example of what legislation is all about--compromise. \nCompromise really sounds good. Legislation is the art of compromise--\nuntil you are faced, as a Senator, with something you may not get \nbecause of the overall good of the bill. Sometimes we have to \nunderstand that we have to give things up for the betterment of this \ncountry. We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. So \neveryone understands that to this point.\n  As I have indicated, we will know within the next hour, and I will \nreport back as to whether we can finish tonight or come back tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                         Surface Transportation\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and especially \nSenators Boxer and Inhofe, as well as their counterparts on the \nCommerce Committee and the Banking Committee, who have put so much time \ninto this bill, so much effort. We are trying now to get this important \nand complex bill right and then to secure the support of both sides of \nthe aisle to move it forward. A lot of work has been going into it. \nEverybody is working hard to try to accomplish what the majority leader \nhas spelled out. I am sure he will tell us if there are any \ndevelopments.\n\n\n                          Political Prisoners\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, off and on and for some time I have come \nto the floor to speak about an issue that doesn't receive a lot of \nattention, which is political prisoners in foreign lands--journalists \nin Cameroon, an AIDS activist in Uzbekistan, and a lot of others. I am \npleased that over the years, working with many of my colleagues, we \nhave been able to see many of these innocent political victims \nreleased. Former Senator Brownback, as well as Senators Cardin, Casey, \nKennedy, Lieberman, and Rubio have all been part of a joint effort to \ndeal with these political prisoners.\n\n  Sadly, there is no shortage of political prisoners in this world. \nThey languish in horrible prisons in places such as Iran and North \nKorea. Today I want to focus on a number of them, and I will preface my \nremarks by apologizing ahead of time for my pronunciation of these \nnames. Some of these are extremely difficult to pronounce for those of \nus in the States, particularly from the Midwest.\n  I suppose one might start typically with the most outrageous case, \nbut, tragically, all of the cases I speak to fit that definition. Let \nme start with the heartbreaking case from 6 years ago--that of Gambian \njournalist Ebrima Manneh.\n  Manneh was a reporter for the Daily Observer newspaper. He was \nallegedly detained by plainclothes Gambian security officials. He was \nheld incommunicado for years, although he was seen during the initial \nyears of his detention by witnesses in at least one detention facility \nand one hospital. No one has seen him for years. It is possible he died \nin custody. But imagine the pain and uncertainty of his family, who \nhave no help and no answers.\n  The Economic Community of West African States Court of Justice, which \nhas jurisdiction over Gambia, and the United Nations Working Group on \nArbitrary Detention both ruled against the Gambian Government on the \ncase and called for his release. After years of waiting, the Gambian \nGovernment recently requested United Nations help to investigate \nManneh's case and the death of one other journalist.\n  This was a welcome move by the Gambian Government, and I hope ongoing \ndiscussions with the United Nations will expedite the investigation and \nbring some resolution to the case and answers for Manneh's family.\n  Some years ago, there was a change in leadership in Turkmenistan, one\n\n[[Page S4711]]\n\nthat many hoped would open that country's closed and repressive \npolitical system. Unfortunately, President Berdimuhamedov has yet to \nmeet those modest expectations. One would think in a country where the \nPresident wins an election with a 97-percent vote, and where there is \nan annual week of happiness, that Turkmen leadership could be more \ngracious to its political opponents. Unfortunately, the following \nexamples demonstrate just the opposite.\n  Gulgeldy Annaniyazov is a long-time political dissident who left \nTurkmenistan in 2000 to settle in Norway as a political refugee. He \nreportedly returned to Turkmenistan in June 2008 to visit his family \nand was arrested. After a closed trial on October 7, he was sentenced \nto 11 years in prison.\n  Annakurban Amanklychev and Sapardurdy Khadzhiev are members of the \nhuman rights organization Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation. They were \nconvicted in August 2006 after trials of only 2 hours and sentenced to \n6 and 7 years in jail on charges that were never very clear.\n  Unfortunately, we don't have a photograph of Mr. Khadzhiev. \nTurkmenistan Government officials have been quoted as asserting these \nindividuals were arrested and convicted for ``gathering slanderous \ninformation to spread public discontent.''\n  The legal bases for their detention are suspect at best and raise \nserious concerns of political intimidation, questionable charges, \nclosed trials, and inappropriately punitive punishment.\n  In May 2010, more than 20 Senators--and that is not an easy feat in \nthe Senate--signed a letter to Secretary of State Clinton urging the \nadministration to raise these cases with the Turkmenistan leadership. I \nknow the State Department did in fact take those steps, and I thank \nthem, but I hope they will continue.\n  In November 2010, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary \nDetention released its opinion that the arrest and continued detention \nof the Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation members is arbitrary and in \nviolation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That United \nNations group called on the Turkmen Government to immediately release \nthem.\n  Sadly, they continued to languish under harsh sentences that include \nhard labor, torture, and forced psychotropic drug injections.\n  To the leaders of Turkmenistan, I say, if you want to change the \nimage of your nation in the world, you must release these and other \npolitical prisoners.\n  Some who follow this may wonder what difference it makes if I make a \nspeech on the floor of the Senate about someone languishing in a prison \nin Turkmenistan. All I can tell you is that after years of doing this, \nit does make a difference. It turns out, people listen. And when they \nlisten, sometimes they react, and often in a positive way. These people \nlanguishing in prisons do not believe anybody in the outside world \nknows they are alive. Groups are trying to make sure others are aware \nof that fact, and that is why I come to the floor, as many of my \ncolleagues do.\n  It is hard to believe in Europe there is still one regime like that \nof Alexander Lukashenko. He is often known as the last dictator of \nEurope. I have been to Belarus twice, once with the Helsinki Commission \ngroup, led by Senator Cardin of Maryland, where we actually met this \nPresident Lukashenko; and most recently I went there after the highly \nsuspect 2010 elections held in December. What was egregious about this \nelection was that President Lukashenko, on the night of the election, \nbeat up and arrested all the candidates who had the nerve to run \nagainst him, as well as hundreds of Belarusian citizens who showed up \nin central Minsk to protest his actions.\n  Lukashenko's barbaric behavior, and that of his KGB henchmen--and, \nyes, Belarus still has something called a KGB security service--earned \nhim sweeping condemnation from Europe and the United States, further \nisolating his nation and hurting his own people.\n  Sadly, today, a year and a half after this outrage, Lukashenko is \nstill holding the man in this photograph. This Presidential candidate--\nMikalai Statkevich--was sentenced to 6 years in a medium security \nprison for having the nerve to run against Lukashenko. At least 6, and \nas many as 13, other protestors from the election still sit in jail.\n  This is outrageous in Europe today or anywhere on the planet, for \nthat matter. It is time for President Lukashenko to let this man and \nthese people go.\n  Next I turn to Vietnam. Although our bilateral relationship continues \nto improve with Vietnam, we cannot ignore the troubling disregard for \nfreedom of speech in that country. It is illustrated by the unfounded \ndetention of the popular blogger Nguyen Van Hai, better known as Dieu \nCay.\n  Let me show this photograph of him. He is the head of the Free \nVietnamese Journalists' Club, and as such Cay has been detained almost \ncontinuously by Vietnamese authorities since 2008, when he was \nconvicted and tried for trumped-up tax evasion charges.\n  In 2009, the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention highlighted \nCay's case, as well as the ``illegal arrests'' and continued \npersecution of a number of other Internet bloggers.\n  In October 2010, on the day Cay was due to be released, having \nfulfilled his sentence, he was transferred to a new jail and re-\narrested for violating a security provision that prohibits \npropagandizing against the government. The propaganda in question--3-\nyear-old blog postings. The subject of his propaganda--freedom of \nspeech, and other issues considered by the government to be too \nsensitive, such as labor strikes and the trials of two human rights \nlawyers.\n  Cay's arrest is part of a well-documented trend in Vietnam in which \nnational security concerns have been cited as a pretext for arrests and \ncriminal investigations.\n  The State Department's Human Rights report notes the Vietnamese \nGovernment is increasing suppression of dissent, increasing measures to \nlimit freedom of the press, speech, assembly and association, and \nincreasing restrictions on Internet freedom. The trend is clear, and it \nis very concerning.\n  Secretary Clinton noted in a speech last year on Internet Rights and \nWrongs, ``In Vietnam, bloggers who criticize the government are \narrested and abused.''\n  It is long overdue that Vietnamese leaders release Cay and stop \nharassing journalists and bloggers.\n  Lastly, on Saudi Arabia, our ally on many important issues, but also \na friend with whom we have vast differences when it comes to basic \nfreedoms and women's rights. Let me tell a recent story that is truly \nhard to believe.\n  Since early 2012, the Saudi Government has imprisoned 23-year-old \nblogger Hamza Kashgari. His crime? He tweeted an imaginary conversation \nwith the Prophet Muhammad. That action sparked a spate of death \nthreats, causing him to remove the tweet and flee to New Zealand in \nfear of his life. While stopping in Malaysia for a plane transfer, \nMalaysian authorities detained him until their Saudi counterparts \nswooped in and returned him to Saudi Arabia under arrest.\n  Back in the kingdom--facing accusations of blasphemy and calls for \nhis execution by top clerics--he repented before the Saudi court and \nshowed great remorse, asking for forgiveness. That was 4 months ago, \nyet he remains imprisoned, awaiting his fate, with no sense when a \ndecision will be made.\n  I can imagine his actions sparking a debate in Saudi Arabia, but \nleading to calls for a death sentence for blasphemy? In today's world, \nthat is hard to believe.\n  Saudi Arabia has initiated steps toward social, educational, \njudicial, and economic reform, and we encourage them to do more. \nImmediately freeing Mr. Kashgari would be an important move. This man \nhas suffered enough and deserves his freedom now.\n  These are just a sample of the many political prisoners who still \nsuffer in parts of the world. I want them and their families and the \ngovernments that unjustly imprison them to know they are not forgotten. \nI and my colleagues here in the Senate will continue to do our best to \ndraw attention to their plight, work for their release, and stand up \nfor the cause of human rights in the United States and around the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S4712]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Surface Transportation\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are anxiously awaiting work on the \nTransportation bill that came out of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, of which I am proud to be the chairman.\n  Last year we wrote a bill called MAP-21. That stands for Moving Ahead \nfor Progress in the 21st Century. I was proud to see this bill become a \nbipartisan bill, with Senator Inhofe working with me and his staff and \nmy staff working together as one. When we got it out of the committee, \nI think it was a unanimous, or close to unanimous, vote.\n  I know when our young people learn how a bill becomes a law it sounds \na little easier than it really is. I often think, in my spare time I \nshould write a little pamphlet on how a bill really becomes a law \nbecause I would say to the young people who are here today, as well as \nthose who might be listening, it is a little trickier than it sounds \nbecause when we learn about how a bill becomes a law in school, it is \nvery simply put.\n  The bill starts in a committee in the House or Senate, and it moves \nto the floor of that body. Then it starts in a committee in the other \nbody, it moves to the floor of that body. It passes both Chambers. If \nit is identical, it goes to the President. If there are differences, \nthere is a conference committee, and then it goes to the President. The \nPresident either signs it or vetoes it. If he signs it, it is a done \ndeal. If he vetoes it, we need to have a whole lot of votes--two-\nthirds--to override.\n  So that is how it is taught in schools, and it is absolutely true. \nBut getting it to the point where we are now, where we await a \nconference report, is sometimes a very long and winding path. This one \nwas a long and winding path. I think we are where we are, at the point \nwhere we hope to vote soon on it, because people were willing to meet \neach other halfway.\n  I have been saying for a long time, we all stand in our respective \ncorners and insist that it is our way or the highway and nothing ever \ngets done. We must come together, and the Senate proved it can come \ntogether around our version of the highway bill. It passed by 74 votes. \nWe were hopeful the House would just take it up and pass it. It didn't \nhappen that way. They wrote a less comprehensive bill; they sent it \nover; and then we went into a conference committee. There was a lot of \ndifficulty because there were issues that were simply not seen in the \nsame light between the House and Senate.\n  I would have to say, through all of this Senator Inhofe and I, \nRepublicans and Democrats, on the EPW Committee were united. But we \ndidn't have that unifying factor with the House Republicans. I want to \nthank every member of the conference committee, Democratic and \nRepublican, House and Senate, because everyone worked extremely hard. \nThey worked hard. They were knowledgeable. Their staffs worked hard. \nThey asked a lot of questions. They cared a tremendous amount about the \npolicies.\n  The great news about the bill that is coming out of the conference \ncommittee is that it is a jobs bill, first and foremost. It is going to \nsave about 1.9 million--almost 2 million--jobs that are currently held \nin the private sector, and it will create up to 1 million new jobs \nthrough an expanded TIFIA program. TIFIA is a program that fronts the \nfunds for local government to have a revenue stream, and the leverage \non that is about 30 to 1. So if you have an amount of approximately $1 \nbillion, you will be able to get $30 billion of economic activity. So \nthat is a good part that we can all be proud of. That is a fact.\n  The bill will be coming soon, we hope. It is not here yet, and it is \nnot done yet, but it is close. What we hope we will have before us is a \nbill that creates close to 2 million--I am so tired. I have to say, I \nhaven't gotten much sleep in the past 3 days because we have been \nworking nonstop.\n  I will say it again. We protect almost 2 million jobs that are \ncurrently held in the private sector, and we will create up to 1 \nmillion; hence, the 3 million jobs that are relying on this bill.\n  We have thousands of businesses that care a lot about what we do. \nThese are general contractors, these are equipment dealers, these are \npeople in the concrete industry. I can tell you these organizations of \nbusiness and labor have been behind us every inch of the way. When I \nwas giving up hope because I didn't think we could move forward, they \nwere there to say: Keep on going. And they weighed in. I think the work \nproduct reflects the fact that we would never, ever give up.\n  There is a lot of talk about, What did Democrats give up? What did \nRepublicans give up? Let's just say this is a negotiation between \nRepublicans and Democrats, a negotiation between the House and Senate, \nand not everybody got what he or she wanted. That is for sure.\n  But I just want to say to people who might be listening that in a \nnegotiation nobody gets everything they want. You have to meet each \nother halfway, and that is what happened in this negotiation.\n  We both wanted to see this as a reform bill. The Senate brought a \npackage together that took the 90 programs down to 30, and that pretty \nmuch survived the conference committee. We also did some more reforms, \ncertainly, on project delivery because all sides agree it is taking too \nlong to get some of these public works projects done. It is taking \nsometimes 15 years, 14 years, 13 years to do a road start to finish or \nto do a bridge. We need to make sure we can move faster because our \neconomy needs that, but still, in my view, protect the rights of \ncitizens throughout this country to ensure their communities are taken \ncare of, that there is no damage to their communities, that the air \nquality is protected, the water quality is protected.\n  We were able to keep those environmental laws while we were tough on \ndeadlines and milestones and very tough to say: This is it. If you \ncan't finish in this time, and we are trying to get this for 15 years \nto 8 years per project--if you don't do that, you have to explain \nwhy. There has to be a really good reason why these projects would be \ndelayed.\n\n  I believe the funding in the bill is fair. Every single State is \nprotected. This is a 2-year-3-month bill. Every State will get the \namount of money they got last year, plus inflation. That is very \nimportant. It is the current level of funding with the inflation put \nin, and every State can now know, if and when this bill passes, that \nthey can count on that funding for 2 years and 3 months. Everything is \npaid for.\n  There are a lot of comments about, what did we do about pedestrian \nwalkways and bike paths. I want to be clear. That was an intense \nsubject of negotiations. There were those who wanted no funds set aside \nfor bike paths, pedestrian paths, and it was very clear--safe streets, \nsafe roads to school, et cetera--we had to negotiate on this.\n  Honestly, I think what has come out is a good thing, and let me \nexplain why. We kept the same amount of funding, same set-aside \npercentage for these transportation alternatives, but what we said was, \nfor the first time, half of those funds will go directly to locals, \nwill go to the metropolitan planning organizations, will go to the \nlarge cities. That is key because we want the local people, who know \ntheir area best, making these decisions. We protected those funds. The \nonly way anyone in the State can use those funds is if there is a \nnationally declared disaster and there are some unobligated funds \naround--yes, that could be borrowed but must be paid back from any \nsupplemental appropriation.\n  On the State portion, which is the other 50 percent, we built in more \nflexibility, and there are a lot of people who are calling this a cut. \nIt is not a cut. Some States will use it all. I say to the people in \nthe States who are worried about it, use your pressure, use your power, \nuse your grassroots strength to make sure you lobby your State \nlegislatures and your Governors to provide for safe streets to schools, \nfor bike paths, for pedestrian walkways. These are very important \nsafety issues.\n\n[[Page S4713]]\n\n  I know not everyone is happy, but I wanted to be clear on that. If \nthe choice is between doing away with that wonderful program, which I \nthink is wonderful, or making a few concessions on flexibility, I think \nwe did the right thing. I honestly do.\n  This bill is all paid for. I have to thank so much Senator Max Baucus \nand his team, the Republican members of the Finance Committee, and also \nthe team in the House headed by Mr. Camp because they came up with a \npay-for that people on all sides can live with. It gives us that \nsecurity for 2 years and 3 months.\n  We don't have any riders on this bill. I know some people very much \nwanted it. We don't have them. It became part of the give-and-take at \nthe end of the day.\n  Two provisions that I lament are not on there are the oceans trust \nfund, which is part of the RESTORE Act, and the Land and Water \nConservation Fund that was also part of the RESTORE Act. I lament that \nthose provisions are gone. I commit myself to working with Senator \nWhitehouse on the oceans trust fund and Senator Baucus on the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund to get that done. But I have to be completely, \ntotally frank with the Senate; we just could not get it done. There was \nnothing we could offer or give that would allow us to move forward with \nthose two very critical environmental programs.\n  I tell you, our oceans deserve attention and our land deserves \nattention. These issues are certainly not going away. Having said that, \nthe rest of the RESTORE Act is in this bill. That means those folks in \nthe Gulf States who were so harmed by this horrible BP spill will be \nable to use some of those fines as they come in to restore--that is why \nwe called it the RESTORE Act--restore their environments, restore their \nfisheries, restore the damage that was done by that horrific BP spill. \nWe don't know how much money will come from those fines. We will watch \nit very carefully. But we know that when they do come--if this bill \npasses, and I am very hopeful it will--our Gulf States will have the \nhelp they need.\n  I want to say to the people, particularly in Louisiana, whom I \nvisited many times, your Senators work very hard. I would say Mary \nLandrieu took the lead on this. Senator Vitter was on the conference. I \nwant to say that Mary Landrieu--you know her well--is unrelenting, and \nshe was very clear with us.\n  I want to say to my friend in the chair, from Alaska, how helpful he \nwas to us, pointing out some of the great unmet needs he is dealing \nwith in his State, a beautiful State, a very interesting State that has \nunique needs. I want him to know how much I appreciated his working \nwith us, giving us the facts as we needed them. I also thank Senator \nMurkowski, but I particularly want to say to Senator Begich, thank you. \nYou happen to be in the chair, and I believe you were mentally \neffective for your State. Really, you made the case for fairness. I \nhope you are comfortable with how this bill turned out.\n  I have never met a team of more dedicated staff--never. Again, they \nare not resting because we are not done. Until we are done, they are \nnot resting. But we are talking seriously about this staff getting 3 or \n4 hours of sleep over the last 2 or 3 days. The issues were still \ncoming at us in ways we could not believe at noon today. Last night we \nhad to work out some issues.\n  It has been, in many ways, a very difficult negotiation but \ncertainly, if and when this bill comes before us and it is passed, a \nvery satisfying one.\n  I have to mention Bettina Poirier, who is my chief of staff and chief \ncounsel. I have never seen anyone more professional, more energetic, \nmore persuasive. I have to thank her counterparts: David, Grant, \nAndrew, Jason, Tyler, Mary, Kate, and Paul, all of whom were just \namazing. If I left anyone out, forgive me; I will correct it in the \nRecord if I did.\n  I have to say to the staff of Senator Inhofe that you were amazing--\npart of the team. You worked together. If we had disagreements, we \ntalked them out, but for the most part we were on the same page. So \nRuth and James, you know who you are. You also have had a very rough \nfew days, working very hard on this.\n  Congressman Mica's staff also worked very hard, and they are very \ntough negotiators, but we were able to talk out our differences. It was \nnot always pleasant to deal with it because people see things in \ndifferent ways, but we got it done.\n  We are not out of the woods yet in the sense that we do not have the \nbill before us. We are awaiting a decision made by the leaders as to \nwhen we will have this vote. But I would like to say that I believe, as \nI stand tonight, that really the work of the conference is completed, \nand that is very rewarding.\n\n  The last thing I want to say is a huge thank you to the outside \ngroups that have stood by my side this entire time. I tell you, I have \nhad conference calls with them for months and months, sometimes four \ntimes a week, sometimes three times a week, sometimes six times a week, \nseriously, sometimes on Saturday, Fridays, Mondays--whenever we needed \nto touch base. This is an amazing coalition of people--workers from \norganized labor, people from the construction trades. The chamber of \ncommerce and AFL/CIO worked together. That is a rarity, you know, in \ntoday's very difficult atmosphere where everyone is arguing over \neverything--the granite people, the cement people.\n  I want to say something to a gentleman--I will not identify his \nname--who brought a couple of cement trucks. We had a rally. I think \nSenator Begich was there. After the rally, we were saying: Pass the \nbill, get the bill done. I talked to this gentleman. He identified \nhimself as a conservative Republican who is so much for this bill. One \nof the most touching things that happened was that he introduced me to \ntwo of his drivers who came over to meet me. As I stood there with \nthese two gentlemen and the owner of the business, I realized how much \nthey were counting on us.\n  What we do here matters. What we do here should matter. What we do \nhere is literally life and death for the construction industry, for the \nbusiness end and for the workers.\n  We know--our President and all of us--we all know this economic \nrecovery is too slow. One of the things that is weighing us down is the \nconstruction industry. One of the things that is weighing it down is \nthe transportation sector. We know that if we do not do our job and we \npass another extension here, that is a signal that the construction \nindustry is going to suffer and suffer mightily. We cannot have that. \nWe are on the brink of getting this done.\n  I know I have left out a lot of people I want to thank. I do not have \nreally a written speech here in front of me. I will go back and I will \ncorrect the record if I left anyone out. But we are close to getting \nthis done. Whether it is in the next few hours or more than a few \nhours, I believe we will get it done. All the people who brought us to \nthis day--I should mention Senator Reid, our majority leader, who never \ngave up even though I was--at one point, I am sure he was ducking me as \nI walked around because I would always say: Let's keep going, Mr. \nLeader. And he did. He kept on going.\n  When we went over to meet with Speaker Boehner was a very important \nmoment, with Chairman Mica. It was important. I think it helped us at \nthat point to realize that everyone did want to have a bill.\n  I have to say that the Democrats in the House--I am sure it has been \nvery difficult for them because they had so many priorities as well. \nBut they were very clear, day after day, pushing hard for a bill, until \nfinally everybody came together and passed some messages to the \nconferees that said: Get the job done. And everybody came together on \nthat one--get the job done.\n  For me personally, this has been a very important day. This is a day \nwhen I think we are very close to getting a transportation bill done.\n  It is also a day that President Obama will forever remember, where \nthe centerpiece of his work was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme \nCourt. We all know we cannot go back to the days when people with \npreexisting conditions suffered and could not get insurance. We just \ncannot go back to the days when being a woman was considered a \npreexisting condition. It was impossible for her to get insurance. We \ncannot go back to the days when kids were thrown off their parents' \nhealth insurance at 18. We can't go back to\n\n[[Page S4714]]\n\nthe days that seniors were going broke, having to choose between a drug \nthat was lifesaving or having dinner that night.\n  In my State, 6 million Californians are getting preventive services. \nThey are getting mammograms, cancer screenings, and everything they \nneed now because of this health care bill. There are 300,000-plus \nsenior citizens who are getting help paying for their prescription \ndrugs and 300,000 more students who are now on their parents' \ninsurance.\n  We are going to hear a lot of outrage about how this was bad for \nAmerica. Let me just say that I thought today was a critical day for \nAmerica. No piece of legislation is perfect. We will have to fix this, \nthat, or the other in everything we do whether it is in a \ntransportation bill or health care bill, but I think we need to move \nforward. We need to not go backward. We need to make sure that health \ncare in America doesn't become such an expensive burden for all of our \npeople because it just drags down our families and it doesn't enable \nthem to do for their kids and for their moms and dads.\n  So I think today was quite a day for the history books, and I look \nforward to working across the aisle in everything we do here, whether \nit is transportation or health care or anything else, to make life \nbetter for people, not to make it worse. I think if we all do that and \nif we listen to each other, we can get things done.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I notice there is no one on the floor at this time, so I would note \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Health Care Decision\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share a few thoughts about the \nSupreme Court's ruling today and the status of the health care bill.\n  I believe the health care bill cannot be justified as written and \nwill have to be changed. It will have to be repealed, and we have to \nstart over. It is just that simple.\n  As ranking member of the Budget Committee, I began to look at the \nnumbers we have had. Our team is going to redouble their effort in the \nweeks to come so we can know precisely how much this legislation will \ncost. As that becomes more and more understood by the American people, \nit will be clear that we do not have the money to pass the bill.\n  I know a lot of people are confident that it will undermine the right \nof an individual American to see the doctor of their choice, despite \nthe President's protestations. Even I believe today that people will \nnot be able to continue to keep their insurance--at least not all \npeople will be able to--and there will be other different problems. \nThere is a real concern that under the legislation the quality of \nhealth care will go down. I believe that is accurate for a lot of \nreasons, and people like Dr. Barrasso and Dr. Coburn have explained \nthat in great detail.\n  As a member of the Budget Committee, I want to share some thoughts \nabout the financing of the legislation to raise the issue of why we \ncannot go forward with it.\n  The President promised the American people before a joint session of \nCongress, right down the hall in the House Chamber: ``Now, add it all \nup, and the plan that I'm proposing will cost around $900 billion over \n10 years.'' Now, $900 billion is a lot of money, there is no doubt \nabout that. He said that is how much it would cost over a 10-year \nperiod. As we have all learned, that was a gimmicked-up number. It was \nfundamentally gimmicked up as a result of the fact that the cost of the \nbill where it begins to pay out money and will have real cost and the \nimplementation of the bill was delayed 4 years. So you take a 10-year \nwindow, and the bill is going to be out there for 6 of those 10 years, \nand you announce it is only going cost $900 billion.\n  That is not the right question, is it. The right question for the \nAmerican people to actually understand the impact of the legislation \nwould be to ask how much it would cost over the first 10 years of full \nimplementation. That is what you should be asking. We all know that the \nnumbers have come in on that. Under the CBO estimate strictly adhering \nonly to the insurance portion of the bill, I believe they came in as \nsaying not $900 billion but $1,400 billion would be the cost over the \nfirst 10 years, but the true cost of the health care bill is yet higher \nstill. A complete and honest assessment of the cost of the President's \nhealth care bill would include a full 10 years of spending starting in \n2014. Adding up CBO's estimates for the different provisions in the \nbill, the President's health care bill will amount to at least $2,600 \nbillion--$2.6 trillion, not $900 billion. It is almost three times the \nestimated costs over the true 10-year period. Now, that is how we go \nbroke in this country. That is how this country is going broke. We go \nthrough a whole debate, and the President insisted that is how much the \nbill was going to cost.\n  When the Democrats had a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, \nthey had 60 Democratic Senators, and they insisted it was going to pay \nfor itself. They said there was more revenue than needed to pay for the \ncost of the bill, so don't worry about it, be happy. On Christmas Eve, \nwithout amendments and after much secret debate and a bill plopped on \nthe floor, the bill was voted up or down, 60 votes to 40. Every single \nDemocrat voted for it, and every single Republican voted against it.\n  I just have to say that the first 10 years of the bill is going to \ncost three times what was estimated.\n  In addition to delaying the major spending provisions during the \noriginal window of the legislation, here are some of the other \naccounting gimmicks, tricks, and maneuvers that the drafters used to \nmanipulate the score the Congressional Budget Office gave to the bill, \nto manipulate how much they would say the bill cost and to hide its \nimpact.\n  Well, one of the most significant things is a double-counted $400 \nbillion. Can you imagine that? The U.S. Government, according to the \nscore manipulation and the way it was done by the CBO, utilizing \ncomplex rules of the CBO to its advantage, the way it was analyzed, \nthey double-counted $400 billion. So they cut Medicare expenses, they \nraised Medicare taxes, but they took the money and used it to fund the \nnew bill and said they made Medicare more solvent. In some ways, we \ncould argue they did make Medicare insolvent because the money that was \nspent on the health care bill was borrowed from Medicare. They are debt \ninstruments for Medicare.\n\n  So my analysis of the legislation is that Medicare got a benefit, but \nthere was no money for the health care bill. Yet they counted it as \nbeing $400 billion free to be spent without adding to the debt of the \nUnited States, but it does add to the debt. Medicare is going broke. \nMedicare is going to call the debt from the United States. It increases \nthe debt of the United States $400 billion. It was counted both \nplaces--as income from Medicare and income available to be spent on the \nhealth care provision. That is a stunning development.\n  I got a letter from the head of the CBO the night before we voted, \nDecember 23, and he said, in effect--not in effect, I think this is a \ndirect quote: It is double-counting the money, although the conventions \nof accounting might indicate otherwise.\n  He told us in a letter before we voted that it was double-counting \nthe money, but under the unified budget process rule that was utilized \nhere, it didn't score.\n  In addition, they counted $70 billion of extra income that would come \nfrom the CLASS Act, which was designed for young people. The net result \nof that was that in the first decade or so of the CLASS Act's \nimplementation, healthy young people wouldn't make many claims and \nthere would be a surplus of $70 billion. But over 20, 30, 40 years, the \nCLASS Act goes into serious decline. Its actuarially unsound. It was \nreferred to as a Ponzi scheme by the Democratic budget chairman, \nSenator Conrad. Finally, the Secretary of HHS could not certify it as a \nsound program, so $70 billion has been wiped off that as income \navailable to be spent.\n  They included--unrelated to this bill--student loan savings of $19 \nbillion.\n\n[[Page S4715]]\n\nThey relied on off-budget Social Security revenue for $29 billion, not \nscored toward the cost of the bill.\n  They ignored the cost of implementing the law. Imagine that. I mean, \nyou have a bill. How much is it going to cost? It is going to cost $900 \nbillion. Well, do you not score the cost of it? What about all these \nIRS agents? There will be 1,000-plus to 2,000 IRS agents who have to be \nhired and paid for, which is $115 billion not counted in the cost of \nthe bill. Is this why we are going broke in this country? We score a \nbill, say it only costs $900 billion, and we have $115 billion of \nadministrative costs not even counted.\n  Then there was no permanent solution to the doctor reimbursement \nfigure. To pay the doctors at the rate they needed to be paid--and I \nagree they need to be paid at this rate--would cost $208 billion over \nthe current level of expected spending. If we don't have this doc fix, \nas we call it, doctors would receive a 20-plus percent cut in pay for \ndoing Medicare work immediately. They are already paid less for \nMedicare work than they are paid for private insurance. Doctors would \nquit doing Medicare work if they took a 20- or 25-percent reduction in \nfee payments. That is $200 billion. That was one of the main reasons we \nwere supposed to have comprehensive health care reform, to deal \npermanently with this doctor fix that was being fixed every year, but \nnot permanently. The bill didn't do it. The bill never fixed it, \ntherefore leaving a $208 billion hole in the plan that we have to find \nmoney for, and it is an essential part of all of that.\n\n  So I would just say to my colleagues that this cost is unsustainable. \nIt will put us on a debt course we cannot continue to be on. We are \ngoing to continue to look at the numbers, and I am going to ask people, \nif they desire, to come to the Senate floor and show me if I am wrong. \nLet me see where I am wrong. But I don't think they can show that we \nare wrong because I and my staff are working as hard as we can to make \nsure what we say about the cost of this bill is accurate and fair.\n  What does this do to the long-term debt of our country? That is a \nmatter of great importance. One of the things our government does now \nis analyze the unfunded obligations of the U.S. Government. When we \npass a law that says when everybody reaches a certain age, they get to \ndraw a Social Security check of so much money, and it increases on a \npercentage basis each year, that is an obligation of the United States. \nThat is an entitlement program, we call it. People are entitled to that \nwhether the government has any money to pay it.\n  So the health care bill is an entitlement. It has a guaranteed right \nfor an individual American to receive certain subsidized health care \nbenefits under this plan, and it is a permanent program, but it doesn't \nhave a permanent source of income dedicated to paying for it in any \nsignificant fashion. So it creates what the Congressional Budget Office \nrefers to as an unfunded liability, unfunded obligations. To show \nAmericans and Congress the true state of our long-term financial \nhealth, they do it over 75 years. It is not a perfect estimate, but it \nis a pretty good estimate of whether the programs are actuarially sound \nand what they will do to the debt of America over 75 years.\n  Under the numbers we have seen from the CBO and the work of our \ncommittee, it is pretty clear the health care bill that was passed by \nthis Congress will add $17 trillion to the unfunded liabilities of the \nUnited States of America--$17 trillion--not a little amount of money, a \nhuge amount of money. To give perspective on how large it is, the \nSocial Security unfunded liability over 75 years is only--only--$7 \ntrillion. This is 2\\1/2\\ times as large an unfunded liability addition \nto our government as Social Security, and we are wondering how we are \ngoing to save Social Security. It is more than half of the unfunded \nliabilities of Medicare or half of the unfunded liabilities of Medicare \nover 75 years.\n  At a time when we have a serious demonstrated requirement that we \nreduce the unfunded liabilities of Medicare and Medicaid and Social \nSecurity, this bill would add $17 trillion to it. This is why every \nexpert has told us this Nation is on an unsustainable course.\n  The total unfunded liabilities before the passage of the health care \nbill were $65 trillion over 75 years. That trend, experts tell us, is \nunsustainable and threatens the future of our children and \ngrandchildren. After the bill passes, it is $82 trillion. We don't have \nthe money to do health care reform in this way, with 2,700 pages and \n$17 trillion in additional cost to the Treasury. We don't need to \naffirm and repass legislation that was said to cost $900 billion in the \nfirst 10 years. In truth, in the first 10 years of its obligation--\nbeginning the year after next--for the first 10 years it will cost \nalmost three times that much--$2,600 billion. So it is a matter of \ngreat concern to me.\n  As to the Court decision today, I am going to look at the Court \ndecision and evaluate it. But I think it is additional proof that this \nhealth care legislation, from the beginning and in its entirety--a \n2,700-page Rube Goldberg contraption--will never work. It is further \nproof of that.\n  Even the fundamental justification for the legislation that it was \nnot a tax but a mandate has been rejected by the Court. The law was \nonly upheld by saying it is not a mandate. In effect, it is a tax that \nthe sponsors of the bill directly said it was not. Indeed, the \nPresident said it was not a tax himself, directly. So certainly this \nopinion that allowed the legislation to stand, by the narrow margin of \n5 to 4, in no way is an affirmation of the wisdom of the bill but is in \nfact demonstration that the people who cobbled it together and who \nrammed it through without full floor debate and amendments, that that \nscheme was flawed from the beginning and it will not work.\n  Indeed, there are 1,700 references in that legislation to regulations \nto be issued by the Secretary of HHS. In other words, once the bill is \npassed, we will turn over huge sections of it to unknown bureaucrats \nwho will issue regulations to administer this monstrosity. It is just \nnot a practical and decent way to do business.\n  So I believed the bill clearly violated the interstate commerce power \ngranted to the Federal Government. The Federal Government can only act \nand pass legislation if it has been specifically authorized by the \nConstitution. One of the authorized powers was to regulate interstate \ncommerce. But if a person is sitting on the creek bank in Alabama, not \nbuying insurance, not participating, can he be made to buy a product in \ninterstate commerce when he is explicitly not participating in that? I \ndidn't believe it could be done, and the Court agreed. The Court \nrejected the Obama administration's argument that it did.\n  They said the Federal Government has no power to compel a person to \nparticipate in a commercial market when a person doesn't participate. \nIf a person participates, maybe they can regulate it. But if a person \ndoesn't participate, they can't tell a person to participate because \nthis is a government of limited power.\n  It was a historic and important ruling that the Supreme Court made \nclear: that there are limits to the power of the U.S. Government. I \nfelt good about that. But now that Chief Justice Roberts and other \nmembers of the Court concluded that it may look like a mandate, but we \ncall it a tax--and I haven't done the technical analysis they went \nthrough to reach their opinion, but that doesn't seem correct to me. It \nseems as though it is still a mandate, a mandate to buy something a \nperson doesn't want to buy. That doesn't sound like a tax to me. Maybe \nit is. Maybe they can defend it that way, but I don't see how that is a \ntax. It sounds like a mandate and a penalty.\n  So scholars will be reading that opinion for some time, and we will \nknow whether Chief Justice Roberts announces that this apparent \nmandate, apparent requirement that the President said was not a tax, \nnow it is a tax and the law is constitutional because of it. We will \nwrestle with that. But it does deal with the fundamental question: Can \nwe afford this legislation. I say we cannot. I believe the facts are \ncrystal clear that we cannot. We absolutely have to reform it, start \nover, create a health care system that works at a reasonable cost for \nthe American people and does not burden our children with exorbitant \ndebt that could throw us into a debt crisis at most any time, and in \nthe long term destabilize the health of the Nation we love so much.\n\n[[Page S4716]]\n\n                            Flood Insurance\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on June 20, I introduced a bill to \nauthorize the FEMA administrator to waive the 30-day waiting period for \nflood insurance policies purchased for private properties affected by \nwildfire on Federal lands. Senators Tom Udall, Mark Udall, and Michael \nBennet are cosponsors of this legislation.\n  As we speak, wildfires are burning across the Western states and it \nis critical that we take immediate steps to protect communities against \nthe tragic consequences of flooding. To this end, I am pleased that the \nSenate included this legislation in the National Flood Insurance \nProgram reauthorization bill, which we will be voting on later today or \ntomorrow.\n  Flooding is the most common and costly natural disaster in the United \nStates. In 1968, Congress created the National Flood Insurance Program \nto help provide a means for property owners to financially protect \nthemselves. The Act, however, requires a 30-day waiting period before \ncoverage under a new contract for flood insurance can take effect. This \nis to prevent individuals from delaying until the last minute to \npurchase insurance when the risk of flooding is high.\n  Unfortunately, today's large catastrophic wildfires in the West can \nalter the watershed conditions on our forested Federal lands so rapidly \nthat nearby communities find themselves in flood hazard areas that \ndidn't exist the day before. The heat of the fires can make the ground \nimpermeable to water, which significantly increases runoff when \nrainfall comes.\n  In some cases, the U.S. Forest Service will advise a community to \npurchase flood insurance immediately after a wildfire is put out, only \nto see that community flooded by a few inches of rainfall weeks before \nthe 30-day wait period has lapsed. When this happens, homeowners are \ntragically without any flood insurance coverage.\n  Every year States throughout the U.S. deal with the devastating \nconsequences of wildfires. Firefighters are currently battling several \nmajor fires in New Mexico, including the largest fire in the State's \nhistory. Over 340,000 acres in the Gila and Lincoln National Forest \nhave been burned and over 100,000 acres have been burned in Colorado \nleaving thousands of residents struggling to cope with the aftermath \nand the risk that flooding presents.\n  While our immediate concern is fighting these wildfires, we need to \ntake steps to protect communities against the tragic consequences of \nflooding. In fact, in the area of the Whitewater-Baldy Fire, though the \ndamage from the fire is extensive, the damage caused to property and \nrisk to life is expected to be far greater from the associated flooding \ndespite the mitigation and prevention efforts in progress. Recently, I \njoined Secretary Vilsack and Forest Service Chief Tidwell for a \nbriefing on the Little Bear Fire, and although progress is being made \nin containing the fire, people are very concerned that the monsoons \nwill soon drop rain on soil that can't absorb the moisture.\n  It makes little sense to punish homeowners in communities who have \nnot faced the kinds of flood risk they are currently presented due to \nthe sudden devastation of nearby Federal forest land.\n  I should also note that after consultation with the Congressional \nBudget Office, it is my understanding that this legislation does not \nscore for budget purposes. I appreciate the Banking Committee's \nwillingness to work with us on this issue. This legislation represents \na critical step forward in providing access to Federal flood insurance. \nThe fire-stricken communities need help, and they need it now.\n\n\n                         surface transportation\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am dismayed that the final conference \nreport on the surface transportation reauthorization bill did not \ninclude funding and continued authorization for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, LWCF, program, despite the fact that this provision \nwas included in the Senate-passed bill. This short-sighted decision is \ncounterproductive and ultimately, harmful to America.\n  The LWCF program represents a promise that was made to the American \npeople almost 50 years ago to invest in conservation and outdoor \nrecreation. The LWCF Program has long been a successful bipartisan \nprogram that has touched all 50 States and nearly every county in \nAmerica. I strongly believe that the LWCF provision, that was included \nin the Senate bill and which was passed in the Senate by a vote of 76 \nto 22, should have been included in the final conference report.\n  Over the course of half a century, the LWCF program has protected \nnatural resource lands, outdoor recreation opportunities, and working \nforests across America. The program is so successful, in fact, that \nevery part of the LWCF Program is oversubscribed, with the demand for \nState and local recreational needs, access for sportsmen, and working \nlands opportunities far exceeding the funds that have been available.\n  The LWCF Program has been extremely important to Vermont. Two \nsuccessful Vermont examples are the Green Mountain National Forest and \nthe Silvio O. Conte National Wildlife Refuge. Among the most visited \nlands in the National Forest System, the Green Mountain National Forest \nhas provided accessible and affordable recreation for millions of \nresidents in the densely populated Northeast. Likewise, the Silvio O. \nConte National Wildlife Refuge, which stretches across Vermont, New \nHampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, is a revolutionary project \nthat has helped to conserve prime fish and wildlife habitat across the \n7.2 million-acre Connecticut River watershed.\n  By failing to include the LWCF Program in the final conference \nreport, I believe that we are squandering a critical opportunity to \nprotect America's precious natural resource lands and grow the economy. \nThe Outdoor Industry Association estimates that outdoor recreation is \nan overlooked economic giant, generating $646 billion in direct \nconsumer spending, supporting 6.1 million direct jobs, and producing \n$80 billion in Federal, State, and local tax revenue each year. This \namount dwarfs total spending in other sectors such as pharmaceuticals \nand motor vehicles, which respectively account for $331 billion and \n$340 billion in direct spending.\n  I am extremely disappointed that the final conference report did not \ninclude the bipartisan-supported LWCF Program. This will hurt all \nAmericans today and for generations to come. I urge my colleagues to \ncome together and right this wrong. The benefits of the LWCF Program \nare clear and we owe it to the American people to provide funding for \nthis essential and successful program.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor and note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sorry it has taken so long. There are a \nlot of things to do around here. The conference report has been filed. \nAs I said earlier today, I appreciate very much the work of everyone, \nincluding our very hard-working staffs on both sides of the Capitol. \nBut there is no need for us to wait anymore. We are not going to finish \nthis tonight. We are going to have to come back tomorrow.\n  I have talked to a number of people, and I wanted to make sure before \nanything was announced that the papers had been filed. They have been. \nWe have a number of issues we are trying to work through procedurally. \nWe are not going to be able to do that tonight. I am not passing blame \non anyone, because we all have a lot to do tomorrow, a lot of things \nthat we are going to put on hold. This is a very big work period for us \nthe next 10 days. I think it is appropriate to say we will be back at \n10 o'clock in the morning to finish this legislation and do it as \nquickly as we can. We do not know what time the House is going to vote \non this tomorrow, but we may have to wait now until they pass it. That \nis one of the pieces we are working on. We have done our very best to \ntry to complete everything tonight, but we are not going to be able to \ndo that.\n  I am disappointed. I heard that from many people, how disappointed \nthey are that we could not move further\n\n[[Page S4717]]\n\ndown the road. But that is the way it is.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, would the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the distinguished majority leader \nhas been working very hard to accommodate Senators in a vote. I know he \nhas the support of every member of our caucus in doing that. I believe \nI heard the distinguished leader say we will come in at 10.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. If I thought it would help to come in earlier, I would \ndo that. But it would only be----\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator anticipated my next question. I appreciate \nthat.\n  Mr. REID. We likely cannot do anything until the House votes on the \nbill tomorrow. We are trying to work through that. I have to say, the \nHouse has been extremely cooperative in everything we have done the \nlast few days. I see on the floor my friend, the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. She knows how hard this has \nbeen and how cooperative the Republicans have been. No one has been \nmore so than the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Jim Inhofe. I will always admire Jim Inhofe for the manner \nin which he approached this important piece of legislation. We pass out \naccolades on this floor, about everyone, how hard they work, but we \nwould not be able to get this bill done except for Jim Inhofe. Fact.\n  So I am disappointed we cannot do this tonight. As the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee just said, we would stay here tonight on our \nside until the wee hours of the morning, because we have some things to \ndo. I was scheduled to be in Lake Tahoe tomorrow, but I can't be there. \nOther people have certainly more important trips than that. But it is \none of the issues we have to face with these jobs we have, which are a \ntremendous privilege, but sometimes we do not have the ability, as a \nGovernor does or the President does, a member of the Court does, to \nsay: This is the schedule. There are 100 different leaders here, each \nthinking they have the best way of solving the problems of the world, \nand it takes a while sometimes to work through their opinions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4717-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

I rise today to celebrate a major milestone for Illinois \nand the nation. One hundred and fifty years ago on July 11, 1862, \nIllinois' own President Lincoln signed an Act of Congress that \nestablished the Rock Island Arsenal.\n  Rock Island started out during the Civil War as a small Union \nprisoner of war camp which also held and distributed supplies. It has \ngrown into a critical manufacturer of 21st century supplies for our \ntroops in the field. And in doing so, it also serves as the lifeblood \nof the Quad Cities region that hosts it.\n  In celebration of its 150th anniversary, I would like to highlight \nRock Island Arsenal's impressive history and the impact it has had on \nthe community and the nation.\n  Rock Island has a long history of producing supplies for our \nmilitary. It was rifle cartridges and siege howitzers in the Spanish-\nAmerican War of 1898. In World War I, it was rifles and a variety of \npersonal equipment. By World War II, the Arsenal's emphasis had shifted \nto artillery production, and workers increased production from 75 \nartillery cartridges a year to 600 a month during the war. This ability \nto rise to the challenge for our servicemembers is a theme at Rock \nIsland.\n  Products weren't the only thing changing at the Arsenal. So were \ndemographics. Everyone is familiar with the image of Rosie the Riveter, \nas women stepped into the workforce. The Arsenal was no different--32 \npercent of the workforce was female during World War II.\n  Yet some of the workers were only teenagers. Squeezing in 40 hours of \nwork while going to school, students were picked up after class and \nbused to the island. They worked Saturdays too. In a not uncommon \nstory, Arsenal worker Anna Mae said her wartime effort was a family \naffair. ``My mom worked on one side of the island, my stepdad on the \nother and I was in the middle.''\n  Years after the war ended, Anna Mae returned to work at the Arsenal \nuntil retirement. When she learned that her war efforts contributed to \nher pension, she articulated the selflessness of so many when she said, \n``I never would have thought (about) that--we were just trying to win a \nwar.''\n  In the Korean War/Conflict, the sense of urgency on the island \nreturned. Crews worked 10-hour days, 6 days a week, and sometimes on \nSunday to get weapons and equipment shipped out. For Vietnam, the \nArsenal created new products designed to counteract the Viet Cong's \nguerilla ``hit and run'' tactics, such as the M102 lightweight \nhowitzer. The Arsenal continued to contribute to systems that meant \nlife or death for the soldiers for the 1991 Gulf War--and then adapted \nas the military went through a drawdown after the war ended.\n  But as we all know, that peace did not last long. A little more than \n10 years ago, the attacks of September 11th changed our world--and the \nnation again found itself at war. Again to their credit, the Arsenal \nworkforce went into overdrive to provide our troops what they needed. \nMachinist Jeff Roberts recalled, ``Everyone's mentality is it's one \ncollaborative effort to get the soldiers what they need as fast as you \ncan.''\n  They did--in a unique way. The Arsenal has the Department of \nDefense's only vertically integrated metal manufacturing capability. It \nhas the only remaining foundry in the U.S. Army. It means that raw \nmaterials can go in one side and come out the other as very intricate \nfinished products. It does this with a number of materials, including \nstainless steel, carbon steels, and titanium. The result--new equipment \nto better protect our troops, especially on short notice.\n  We all know how devastating improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were \nto U.S. troops in Iraq and continue to be to servicemembers in \nAfghanistan. In 2006 and 2007, our nation had fallen short in armor \nkits for Humvees and other ground vehicles to protect our troops. I \nurged then-Secretary Gates to use Rock Island's production capability \nto get these kits to our troops faster. Secretary Gates agreed. Rock \nIsland became the single largest producer of these armor kits. Talk \nabout saving lives.\n  Lieutenant General Raymond Mason, Army's Deputy Chief of Staff for \nLogistics, recently noted, ``It was critical that we had (the organic \nindustrial base), along with our manufacturing capabilities at our \narsenals at Watervliet, Rock Island and Pine Bluff. This allowed us to \nexpand for wartime demand . . . `` He also added, ``By ensuring we \nmaintain a core level of work, we then retain expandability \ncapabilities if something else happens in the world.''\n  As I look to the future, I would say that is exactly what we are \ndoing at Rock Island. Earlier this year, I introduced the Army Arsenal \nStrategic Workload Enhancement Act of 2012, with the support of Senator \nMark Kirk, Senator Grassley, Senator Harkin, and the Senators from New \nYork and Arkansas.\n  The bill does just what General Mason was describing. It would create \na strategic plan to ensure arsenals receive the workload they need to \nkeep workers' skills sharp for whatever the future may hold.\n  We worked with Senator Levin and Senator McCain on this. I was \npleased that major portions of our bill were included in the report \naccompanying the National Defense Authorization Act, which was voted \nout of the Armed Services Committee last month.\n  But the Arsenal isn't complacent. They are partnering with private \nindustry interested in working with titanium and other lightweight \nmetals at the Quad-City Manufacturing Lab which opened in 2010. In \nthese times of tough budget decisions, these partnerships enable Rock \nIsland to sustain itself at no cost to the government\n\n[[Page S4718]]\n\nthrough a Working Capital Fund. Just like the private sector, the \nArsenal is out there competing for work--and winning it. They have \nsigned agreements with Sivyer Steel, Mack Defense and others.\n  But Rock Island is about more than just production--it is also the \nbedrock of the Quad-City region as the area's largest employer. One \nexample of family commitment to the Arsenal is Jeff Roberts, a \nmachinist at Rock Island. His great-great-great-great grandfather was a \nmaster carpenter at Rock Island in the 1860s and helped build the \nisland's iconic Clock Tower. Working at the Arsenal for our men and \nwomen in uniform gave Jeff a clear understanding of, as he described \nit, ``what you're doing and why you're doing it.'' He added, ``I've \nnever had the job satisfaction I have now until I came here.''\n  Jeff's experience is replicated all across the Arsenal. The island \nhas more than 70 military and private sector organizations as tenants. \nOver the years, the Arsenal has welcomed the Army Corps of Engineers, \nArmy Sustainment Command, Joint Munitions Command, and Army Contracting \nCommand, among others. Most recently, Rock Island welcomed the \nheadquarters for First Army, which is in charge of mobilizing, training \nand deploying our Army Reservists. It may not always have the glitz of \na front-page story. But their collective dedication shows how central \nRock Island is to the support of our military, every day.\n  Rock Island Arsenal is a large and vibrant installation, with a rich \nhistory and an impressive array of ongoing activities. Rock Island \nArsenal has made remarkable contributions over the past 150 years. It \nhas served us through our difficult times and will continue to do so in \nthe future.\n  I thank those who serve at the Arsenal today and those who have \nserved in the past. And also to those who have join me in honoring Rock \nIsland Arsenal in its 150-year anniversary celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4718-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         INDEPENDENCE DAY 2012\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate our \nNation's Independence Day.\n  Over 230 years ago, a collection of very brave and thoughtful men put \ntheir names and lives on the line to support a visionary idea, writing:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these \n     rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their \n     just powers from the consent of the governed.\n\n  Today we honor those patriots who crafted our country's identity, and \nwe appreciate every man, woman, and child who has shared it, refined \nit, and lived it. There is a reason why the rest of the world looks to \nAmerica as a bold leader, and it began in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776. \nIt continues nationwide today in our independent spirit, our ambition, \nand our sense of generosity, and we certainly see that in my home State \nof Alaska.\n  We see it in communities large and small, as we solve problems and \nwork together to make life better and the future brighter. Today, we \ntake a moment to realize that we do all this without thinking about \nit--and that few other countries in the world can boast the same.\n  But as we take a moment to appreciate all that we have, we must never \nforget the cost of freedom. Thousands have given their lives to secure \nthe blessings of liberty. Men and women in uniform are serving bravely \noverseas, enduring tremendous sacrifice, while countless others guard \nour shores, protect our interests abroad, and defend our skies here at \nhome. Their burden is shared by the families who endure empty spots at \nthe dinner table, missed birthdays, and absence from special moments \nlike a child's first steps. Freedom is indeed perishable and we are \ngrateful for those who safeguard our liberty for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  As Americans, we honor our veterans and the freedoms they defend. We \nspeak our minds and we think big thoughts--bounded only by the limits \nof our imagination.\n  On this Independence Day, I am honored to represent Alaska in the \nUnited States Senate.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in the tradition of patriotic \ncelebration to recognize 236 years of American independence. The Fourth \nof July is not only a proud and inspiring symbol of our nation's \nindependence, but of our undeniable strength and unity. As we celebrate \nIndependence Day this year, I am thankful for our forefathers' struggle \nto afford us freedom and liberty which we enjoy today.\n  As the first battles of the Revolutionary War broke out in April \n1775, many colonists were skeptical of complete independence from Great \nBritain. By the middle of the following year, tensions and hostility \nwere high. As revolutionary sentiment spread, so too did the colonists' \ndesire to become liberated from Great Britain.\n  On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted in favor of a \nresolution for independence. Two days later, our Founding Fathers \nadopted the Declaration of Independence, marking the United States' \nbreak with Great Britain. In 1870, the U.S. Congress instituted July \n4th as a federal holiday. As Americans, we are proud to celebrate this \nimportant national holiday, a symbol of our patriotism and freedom.\n  On the eve of this celebration, we also pay tribute to today's \nheroes; America's brave men and women in uniform who have fought \ntirelessly to protect and preserve the very freedom afforded to us by \nour Founding Fathers. Their perseverance in the face of adversity is a \ntestament to the strength of the greatest military in the world. We are \nproud to honor our veterans, active duty soldiers, and military \nfamilies for their grave sacrifices made for the safety and security of \nthis great nation.\n  Next week, as we gather with family and friends, let us reflect on \nthe trials and tribulations of our nation's path to independence and \nthe everlasting impact of this defining moment in America's history. \nWith appreciation for the freedoms we enjoy today, I ask my colleagues \nto join me in commemorating the birth of our Nation's independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4718-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4718-S4719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATULATING THE 2012 NATIONAL ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to commend three outstanding Vermont \ncompanies that were recently singled out for recognition at the 2012 \nFancy Food Show in Washington, D.C. These vendors were among the select \n110 Silver Finalists for the show's coveted Specialty Outstanding Food \nInnovation, sofi, gold awards, widely considered to be one of the top \nhonors in the specialty food industry. The sofi Awards, from the \nNational Association for the Specialty Food Trade (NASFT), recognize \nthe best in specialty food and beverage and are a coveted industry \nhonor. This year's contest was the most competitive in the history of \nthe awards, with a record 2,520 entries.\n  Two of the vendors, Vermont Butter and Cheese Creamery, located in \nWebsterville, and Big Picture Farm L3C, located in Townshend, won the \ngold sofi in their categories, while Grafton Village Cheese, located in \nGrafton, represented Vermont proudly as a finalist in the category for \noutstanding cheese or dairy products for their new cheese, Cave Aged \nLeyden.\n  Vermont Butter and Cheese Creamery's owners, Allison Hooper and Bob \nReese, deserve well-earned congratulations for winning three gold sofi \nAwards, including Best Product Line, Best Cheese or Dairy Product for \ntheir aged goat cheese Bonne Bouche, and Best Perishable Food Service \nProduct for their Sea Salt Crystal Cultured Butter. Allison and Bob's \nextraordinary achievement demonstrates, beyond a doubt, that Vermont \nButter and Cheese Creamery has succeeded at building a high quality, \nsuperior brand that reflects the values and ethos of Vermont.\n  Congratulations are due as well to Big Picture Farm's owners, Louisa \nConrad and Lucas Farrell, for winning a gold sofi Award in the \nConfectionary Category for their Farmstead Goat Milk Caramels. When I \nmet this young couple last week, I was taken with their energy and \nexcitement for both their goats and their award winning caramels. \nEarlier this year, Louisa and Lucas received a U.S. Department of \nAgriculture Value Added Producer Grant which helped them expand their \nfarm, hire additional staff members,\n\n[[Page S4719]]\n\nand expand their business plan. The Value Added Producer Grant, \ntogether with Big Picture Farm's hard work and commitment to their \nvision, helped to catapult this new business to a sofi Award after less \nthan two years in business. That is quite an achievement. I can't wait \nto see what challenges this young couple will tackle next.\n  Recognition should go, too, to Bob Allen, Christine Damour, and Wendy \nLevy, co-owners of Grafton Village Cheese. This year, Grafton Village \nCheese was a sofi finalist in the category of Outstanding Cheese or \nDairy Products. Vermont Butter and Cheese Creamery also competed in \nthis category and to have not one, but two great Vermont companies \ncompeting as finalists in the same category is an outstanding \nachievement for any State, much less one as small as Vermont.\n  I always enjoy seeing Vermonters in Washington, and was pleased to \nvisit them at the 2012 Fancy Food Show. These companies create Vermont \njobs and grow Vermont's economy. During these tough economic times, \nthis kind of work is vital to restoring the American way of life and \ngetting the country back on track. I am extremely proud of the hard \nwork, dedication, entrepreneurial spirit, and innovation of these \nexceptional Vermont companies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4719-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL PTSD AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues today \nin recognizing the Department of Veterans Affairs' National Center for \nPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, as their month-long PTSD \nawareness campaign comes to a close and in reflecting on our \nparticipation in the third annual National PTSD Awareness Day. I thank \nSenator Conrad for introducing the resolution to honor Army National \nGuard SSG Joe Biel who suffered from PTSD and tragically took his own \nlife in April 2007 after returning from his second tour in Iraq.\n  All this month, we draw attention to PTSD which affects millions of \nAmericans at some point in their lives. As chairman of the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, I am especially concerned with the impact \nthat PTSD has had on our Nation's servicemembers and veterans. The \nnumber of veterans treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, \nfor PTSD or related symptoms has reached 475,000 and there are likely \nmore cases that go unreported, undiagnosed, or untreated each year. In \nfact, as the drawdown of Afghanistan troops continues, we can only \nexpect those numbers to follow the steady rise previously reported. VA \nand the Department of Defense, DoD, need to be ready now.\n  This unpreparedness is a tragedy. Whether the wounds they return home \nwith are visible or invisible, no veteran should be left to face their \ninjuries alone, and I am committed to seeing that they never have to.\n  Already, we have seen a change in how VA and the DoD treat PTSD. \nEarlier this year, we learned that hundreds of servicemembers and \nveterans had their PTSD diagnoses reversed over the course of 5 years \nat Madigan Army Medical Center in my home State of Washington. In the \nwake of this shocking discovery, Secretary of the Army John McHugh \nordered a comprehensive, Army-wide review of medical files from the \npast decade to uncover any other problems with misdiagnoses. Two weeks \nago, Secretary Panetta announced that he would be ordering a similar \nreview across all of the armed services. I applaud these actions taken \nby Secretary Panetta and Secretary McHugh, but we are a long way from \nwinning the battle on mental and behavioral health conditions.\n  That is why earlier this week I introduced the Mental Health ACCESS \nAct of 2012. This bill will require VA and DoD to offer a range of \nsupplemental mental and behavioral health services to ensure that \nveterans, servicemembers, and their families are receiving the care \nthat they need and deserve. The Mental Health ACCESS Act of 2012 \nprovides for comprehensive standardized suicide prevention programs, \nexpanded eligibility to families for support services, improved \ntraining for healthcare providers, new peer-to-peer counseling \nopportunities, and reliable measures for mental health services.\n  Finally, we must overcome the stigma that surrounds PTSD. As VA's \nNational Center for PTSD has demonstrated, once diagnosed, PTSD and its \nsymptoms can be treated and those who suffer from it can resume healthy \nand productive lives. Efforts like National PTSD Awareness Day and PTSD \nAwareness Month are critical to combating some of the most damaging \nmisperceptions about PTSD.\n  In closing, as we look back on our efforts to raise awareness of PTSD \nthroughout the month, we must also reaffirm our commitment to those \nveterans, servicemembers, and families affected by PTSD. Our veterans \nand servicemembers have made tremendous sacrifices for us and our \ncountry and we owe them the support and care that they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4719-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4719-S4720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             RECOGNIZING EVANSTON ROUNDHOUSE AND RAIL YARDS\n\n Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \n100th anniversary of the Evanston Roundhouse and Rail Yards. This \nimpressive site, which is listed on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces, is a lasting landmark and a national treasure.\n  Evanston is truly a special place, and the railroad has had a huge \nimpact on its history. In fact, Evanston would not exist today had it \nnot been for the railroad. Like the rest of the area, a large part of \nWyoming's development depended on migrants coming from the East. Some \ntraveled on famous emigrant trails like the Oregon and California \nTrails. But many followed the train tracks as the transcontinental \nrailroad forged a new path across the West. The transcontinental \nrailroad had particular importance in Wyoming's development. Steam \nengines needed water-refilling stations, and these stations quickly \nbecame hubs of commerce in the State. Evanston was the Union Pacific's \nlast stop in Wyoming, and its settlement depended on the railroad.\n  In 1868, tracks finally reached Evanston, and a town of tents cropped \nup around the station. This prosperity was only short-lived because the \nmanagers soon ordered the station to be moved 12 miles west to Wasatch. \nBecause of the transfer, the town's population disappeared virtually \novernight. Evanston was in danger of becoming another ``end of the \nline'' town. Fortunately, the station moved back to Evanston later that \nsummer--and it stayed there. The railroad provided a stable job base \nand nearby coal mines encouraged the settlement of the town. Just as \nthe railroad depended on its workers, the town depended on the trains.\n  Evanston enjoyed great success as a water-filling station. The \nincreased production and prosperity of the Union Pacific warranted new \nfacilities to accommodate its increased traffic. In 1871, a new \nroundhouse and a shop complex were constructed. The station was \ndesignated as the major Union Pacific maintenance facility between \nGreen River, WY, and Ogden, UT. In the next 30 years, the station \nprospered and the town of Evanston expanded. In 1912, the Union Pacific \napproved additional upgrades. The construction included a new \nroundhouse, a state-of-the-art turntable, and electricity for the other \nbuildings in the complex.\n  Many technological advances eventually caught up with the station's \nsuccess. The advent of diesel train engines brought the slow demise of \nthe machine shop in Evanston, as more and more services were moved to \nGreen River. In 1927, main operations were moved to Green River and the \nEvanston station opened as a reclamation plant. Here, rolling train \nstock and parts were repaired and refurbished for the Union Pacific. \nThe new designation created a new era of success for the station. At \nits height of production, the plant employed over 300 men, making it \nthe largest employer in Evanston. The roundhouse and its accompanying \nfacilities were crucial to the economic independence of the town's \nresidents.\n  The success of the reclamation plant was enjoyed for several decades. \nHowever, in 1971, the Union Pacific closed the facility for good, due \nto modern production methods and lower prices for new equipment. The \ncommunity had developed a strong tie to the railroad. Evanston depended \non the railroad not only for jobs or economic stability, but also for \nits identity. After\n\n[[Page S4720]]\n\nits final closure, the Union Pacific donated the rail yards to the \ncommunity, creating the perfect opportunity for the community to \npreserve the station's legacy. Local businessmen formed a coalition to \ndevelop the area. The city of Evanston leased the facility to a number \nof railway companies while they created a comprehensive plan to \npreserve the roundhouse and rail yards.\n  To honor and recognize the significant impact of the roundhouse and \nthe railroad, community members turned their eyes to restoration and \npreservation. This historic site was listed on the National Register of \nHistoric Places in 1985. This special designation prompted other city \nofficials to create a plan for the preservation and renovation of the \nrail yards. In 1998, thanks to Federal funding and the fundraising \nefforts of the community, cleanup of the facilities began. The goal to \npreserve the structural and historical integrity of the facility was \naccomplished through the cooperation and passion of the entire \ncommunity.\n  Today, the Evanston Roundhouse and Rail Yards are open to the public. \nThe recently dedicated J.T. & Phyllis Patterson Visitor Center welcomes \nvisitors from across the country. In addition to the restoration of the \noriginal roundhouse, community leaders are working to restore the \noriginal turntable and other facilities around the plaza. Now, the \nmachine shop is a clean, updated facility that is perfect for hosting \nevents and meetings. And Evanston has a vision for what might follow. \nIn the future, the city plans to move its city hall into the complex. \nOther ideas include plans to install a renovated dining car and to move \nthe original water tower from Wasatch to the rail yards. Evanston and \nits visitors will continue to enjoy the rich history of the roundhouse \nthanks to the innovation of city officials and Evanston's partnership \nwith local, State, and Federal agencies.\n  The Evanston Roundhouse and Rail Yards is a remarkable part of \nWyoming's history. In honor of its 100th anniversary, I invite my \ncolleagues to visit this national treasure. This site is a visible \nreminder of the important role the railroad played in the growth and \ndevelopment of Evanston. I congratulate the citizens who have worked so \nhard to preserve the roundhouse. They should be proud to share this \nhistoric place with visitors from all over the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4720-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    125TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED WAY\n\n MR.

For 125 years, \nUnited Way has been at the forefront of bringing about change in \ncommunities by initiating longlasting collaborative partnerships to \nmeet the needs of citizens. By bringing together people, communities, \nand organizations, United Way has effectively solved problems and \nimproved the lives of countless people.\n  The vision of United Way has remained constant since 1887 when \nDenver, CO, community members recognized the importance of cooperation \nto address the welfare problems in the city. Those efforts laid the \nfoundation for the help it provides to communities all over the world \ntoday.\n  I am particularly proud of United Way's efforts in Arkansas and the \nsupport of people all over the State to help fellow Arkansans. I know \nmany Arkansans join in efforts to help improve the well-being of their \nneighbors through various campaigns to mobilize resources and \nstrengthen educational, employment, and health opportunities. We are \nblessed to have great community involvement and an organization like \nUnited Way that is always looking for new problems to solve. This is \ntruly an amazing program that makes its presence count in untold by \nways touching lives and creating lasting changes.\n  On this 125th anniversary, on behalf of the people of Arkansas, I \noffer my thanks for impacting positive changes in the lives of people \nworldwide and close to home. I am humbled by United Way's constant \ncommitment and attention to developing a bright future for all \ncitizens. It is a privilege to have United Way in our backyard, and we \nare grateful for its outreach. United Way serves as an inspiration for \nall of us, showing us what hard work, dedication, and partnerships can \nlead to. Thank you for bringing hope to the hopeless, help to the \nhelpless, voice to the voiceless and bridging the gaps between people \nand resources.

On July \n14th, 2012, the residents of Milton will recognize the community's \nhistory and founding.\n  When Milton was founded in 1887, the postmaster initially suggested \nthat the town be called Springfield. Some historians claim the town was \nnamed after the famous English poet, John Milton. However, most \nhistorians agree the town was named for Milton, Ontario, the hometown \nof pioneer settler Steven Sophar. Steven Sophar was instrumental in \nobtaining land and creating townships across North Dakota, as well as \nin several other northern states.

My home State of Nevada is proud and privileged \nto acknowledge such an extraordinary civic leader.\n  Since founding Q Construction in 1964, Norm has been committed to \nmaking the Truckee Meadows a great place to live. He has served as the \nheart and soul of the company by continually going above and beyond the \ncall of duty each year, assisting numerous organizations for the \nbetterment of the Silver State.\n  A native Nevadan, Norm has volunteered his time to organizations such \nas the American Heart Association, American Lung Association, March of\n\n[[Page S4721]]\n\nDimes, American Cancer Society, the Boys & Girls Club of Truckee \nMeadows, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Saint Mary's Hospital, and, of \ncourse, the Reno Rodeo Association. His extraordinary charitable work \nin the community is admirable. For 9 of the past 13 years, Norm was \nvoted Contractor of the Year by his peers in northern Nevada. He truly \nis one of the best.\n  Recently, Norm was honored with the privilege of leading the Reno \nRodeo Parade. Having attended and supported the Reno Rodeo for over 60 \nyears, Norm has seen and experienced many changes in the community and \nthe rodeo itself. His company has been instrumental in updating the \nrodeo grounds for years. Norm's love for Nevada, community service, and \nthe Reno Rodeo are unmatched.\n  Nevada's economy relies on events such as the Reno Rodeo, which \ncelebrated its 93rd anniversary this year. Dependent upon nearly 400 \nvolunteers from across the Truckee Meadows, the event is said to have \nan economic impact of $42 million in the Reno/Sparks area. This 10-day \nrodeo recognizes the passions and skills of some of the world's top \nprofessional cowboys and cowgirls and their contributions to the sport \nof rodeo.\n  I admire and recognize Norm's commitment to northern Nevada. His \ndedication serves as a constant reminder of the importance of giving \nback to our communities. I am proud to stand with the residents of my \nhome State to recognize his generosity and selflessness.

United Way is active in the communities of Beatrice, \nColumbus, Cozad, Crete, Fremont, Grand Island, Hastings, Kearney, \nLexington, Lincoln, Nebraska City, Norfolk, North Platte, Omaha, \nScottsbluff, Wayne, York, and others. The Nebraskans affiliated with \nthese organizations work tirelessly every day to improve the lives of \nthose around them.\n  For the past 125 years, United Way has mobilized resources from local \nbusinesses and individuals to identify and meet the needs of the \ncommunities they serve. Thanks to the leadership from local United Way \norganizations, communities in Nebraska have been better able to address \nsignificant social issues. The programs they support help those \nexperiencing hunger, domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse, \nneglect, and many more challenges. In Nebraska, the United Way provides \nleadership and helping hands throughout our State.\n  I have had the privilege of working with United Way and the agencies \nthey support as a county commissioner, city councilman, mayor, \nGovernor, and now as a Member of the Senate. I have seen first hand the \nsuccesses achieved by Nebraska's United Way offices, which have \nimproved the lives of countless citizens across the State. I couldn't \nbe more proud of their work.\n  It is an honor to mark this special day by acknowledging United Way \noffices across our State and thanking the many volunteers who \ncontribute time, talent, and financial resources to improve Nebraska \ncommunities. I wish all of the United Way offices in Nebraska and \nacross the Nation another 125 years of success in their mission to \nserve others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4721-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RICK CRAIG\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Rick Craig, \npresident of America First Federal Credit Union. Rick was appointed \npresident of the credit union in 1997, and previously served as the \nexecutive vice president for two decades. He recently announced his \nretirement and I wish to honor his exemplary career.\n  Rick is an alumnus of Weber State University, where he earned a \nbachelor of science degree in the field of mathematics with a minor in \nphysics. He went on to earn a master's degree in the field of \nengineering from the University of Utah, and graduated in 1981 from the \nWestern Credit Union National Association, CUNA, Management School. \nWhile in school, Rick earned the Charlie Clark Award and later was \nhonored with the James D. Likens Alumni Recognition Award. He has also \ncompleted the Credit Union Executives Society's Directors Leadership \nInstitute program at the London Business School. Over the years, Rick \nhas been willing to share his knowledge with others, teaching courses \nat Weber State University and the Western CUNA Management School.\n  Rick is a past board member of the Utah League of Credit Unions, and \nwas vice chairman of the league's Executive Committee. From 1997 to \n2003, he also served on the Governor's Board of Credit Union Advisors \nin Utah. He served on the Filene Research Council from 1999 to 2005, \nand he has been a member of the CO-OP Board of Directors since 2005. He \nhas been a director of the Credit Union Executives Society, CUES, for 9 \nyears, serving as chairman of the board. Rick was inducted into the \nCredit Union Society's Hall of Fame in 1996.\n  Mr. Craig has received numerous honors for his work. Utah Business \nMagazine recognized him as one of the one hundred most influential \npeople in the State of Utah in 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2011. He was \nrecognized as one of the Ten Trail Blazing Companies in Utah in 2003 \nand in 2004, the national CUES named him Executive of the Year. Under \nhis leadership, America First Credit Union was recognized as one of the \nbest places to work in Utah in 2007. Craig has written numerous \narticles, including articles for CUNA and CUES magazines, as well as \ncomputer world.\n  After 12 years as president, Rick Craig is leaving America First \nCredit Union on solid financial foundation. He has been successful at \nnavigating the credit union through very turbulent financial times.\n  Although Rick Craig has achieved great success in business, his \ngreatest success has been being the father of 10 wonderful children. It \nis my wish that he and Karen enjoy this new chapter in their \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4721-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4721-S4722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING JUDGE ROBERT C. BOOCHEVER\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, next week the Juneau community \nwill come together to honor the late Judge Robert C. Boochever, who \npassed away on October 9, 2011. At the time of his passing, Judge \nBoochever was a senior judge of the Ninth Circuit, U.S. Court of \nAppeals. Since Alaska was admitted to statehood, only three Alaskans \nhave served on that court. Judge Boochever was the first of the three.\n  Judge Boochever was not born in Alaska, but he earned the right to be \ncalled an Alaskan through decades of service, on and off the bench, to \nour community. Robert C. Boochever was born in New York City on October \n2, 1917, and grew up in Ithaca, the home of Cornell University where \nhis father was director of public relations. He completed his \nundergraduate work and law degree at Cornell, then enlisted in the \nArmy. Deployed to Newfoundland as a legal officer, he met Connie \nMaddox, who was the chief surgical nurse for the base. They were \nmarried in April 1943.\n  At the end of the war, a long-time family friend from Cornell, Warren \nCaro, who had been an aide to Alaska's territorial Governor, Ernest \nGruening, told Judge Boochever about a job in Juneau. It was an \nassistant U.S. attorney position, but at the time there was no U.S. \nattorney, so Boochever would in fact be running the operation. At the \ntime, Judge Boochever knew nothing of Alaska or Juneau other than the \npraises sung by his family friend, Warren Caro. But that didn't stop \nhim from asking Alaska's delegate to Congress, Bob Bartlett, for a \nrecommendation. Once offered the job, he persuaded Connie to give \nAlaska a try and they never looked back.\n  In 1947, Boochever joined the Faulkner Banfield law office in Juneau \nand soon was made a named partner. He built the Faulkner Banfield firm, \nwhich dates back to 1914, into one of Alaska's great law firms. That \nfirm continues to operate today as Faulkner Banfield in Juneau and \nHolmes, Weddle and Barcott with offices in Anchorage, Seattle, Portland \nand San Diego. Mike Holmes, one of his partners, described Boochever as \n``the best trial lawyer in the State.'' He served as president of both \nthe Alaska and Juneau Bar Associations.\n\n[[Page S4722]]\n\n  In 1972, Judge Boochever was named to the Alaska Supreme Court and \nserved as chief justice for three years. In 1980, President Carter \nnominated Judge Boochever to the Ninth Circuit. In an oral history, \nJudge Boochever described himself as a champion of individual rights \nwho was also sympathetic to the problems of law enforcement. His Ninth \nCircuit colleague, Judge Dorothy Wright Nelson, the former dean of the \nUniversity of Southern California Law School, described Boochever as \nthe best writer on the court.\n  But a distinguished legal career was but one measure of this \noutstanding Alaskan. Judge Boochever was a gentleman who greeted women \nwith the tip of a hat, a family man whose daughter would sing out loud, \n``Oh, we're the happy Boochevers'' to the tune of ``Jolly Good \nFellow,'' an avid birdwatcher, a poet, a singer and a pianist.\n  According to a 1997 tribute in the Alaska Bar Rag, he was ``revered \nby his friends and neighbors as a dedicated advocate who championed \ncauses that helped shape the Juneau community.''\n  He was the first chairman of the Juneau Planning Commission, a vocal \nopponent of efforts to move Alaska's capital out of Juneau, and a \nleader in the successful campaign to create the University of Alaska \nSoutheast in Auke Bay. Judge Boochever, and Connie, who predeceased \nhim, were selected by the Juneau Rotary Club as Man and Woman of the \nYear. Connie will long be remembered as a champion of the arts in \nJuneau. What an outstanding team.\n  Outstanding families are the product of outstanding patriarchs. Judge \nBoochever was the father of four outstanding daughters. Barbara, an \navid skier, whose daughter Hillary Lindh, would grow up to be an \nOlympic silver medalist in downhill skiing; Linda, an Anchorage \nbusinesswoman; Mimi, a teacher nationally renowned for teaching the \nfine arts to young people; and Ann, a music teacher who cofounded two \nof Juneau's finest restaurants.\n  Judge Boochever was outstanding in every respect. It is people like \nJudge Boochever who moved Alaska from the last frontier of the \nprestatehood period to the best place in America to live, work and \nraise a family. I am grateful for his significant contributions to the \nquality of life we today enjoy in the State of Alaska. That is why I \nwas proud to cosponsor legislation naming the Juneau Federal courthouse \nin perpetuity for Judge Boochever. That is why I am proud to honor his \nlife and legacy today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4722-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE ASPEN CENTER FOR PHYSICS\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I wish to \ncongratulate the distinguished Aspen Center for Physics, located in \nAspen, CO, on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. I offer these \ncongratulations on behalf of Senator Bennet of Colorado as well.\n  We would like to commend the Aspen Center for Physics for their \ndedication and excellence in the field of theoretical physics. Since \nthe 1960s the Center has been one of the world's foremost research \ncenters for the pursuit of basic scientific understanding on topics \nranging from cosmology to biophysics.\n  With Federal funding primarily from the National Science Foundation \nand the support of dozens of corporate, institutional, and individual \nsponsors, the Aspen Center for Physics has become an international hub \nfor revolutionary physics research. More than 10,000 scientists, \nrepresenting 65 countries and including 52 Nobel Laureates, have \nparticipated in Center programs. They come to Aspen to converse with \ntheir peers, conduct groundbreaking research, and explore uncharted \nareas in theoretical physics.\n  The atmosphere created by the Aspen Center for Physics is unique. \nWhile surrounded by beautiful landscapes, researchers are encouraged to \nparticipate in informal dialogue and pursue creative and novel paths in \ntheir research, both individually and in collaborative groups.\n  The unstructured environment has been key to the exchange of ideas \namong the world's best theoretical physicists, and it has led to \nimpressive results: more than 10,000 scientific papers and books have \ncited the Center's influence.\n  The Center is also a good neighbor. For more than 25 years, the \nCenter has offered free public lectures on cutting-edge science to the \ncommunity. It offers informative and interactive programs designed to \nengage children in learning and get them excited about science. \nPhysicists from the Center also visit local schools and serve as \nmentors for students.\n  Colorado is fortunate to be home to the Aspen Center for Physics. \nSenator Bennet and I would like to congratulate them for an impressive \nfirst 50 years and wish them continued success for the next 50 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4722-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4722-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4722-4", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 3187.

A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to provide \nsocial services agencies with the resources to provide services to meet \nthe unique needs of the Holocaust survivors to age in place with \ndignity, comfort, security, and quality of life; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Kirk and Mikulski to introduce the Responding to Urgent needs \nof Survivors of the Holocaust Act or the RUSH Act.\n  Our bill will provide needed protections for survivors of the \nHolocaust who managed to make it to the United States after years of \nprolonged terror, abuse, and desperation. Millions fled from the \ncruelty of the Nazi regime between 1933 and 1945, from territories \nannexed, invaded or occupied by Nazi Germany and from their Axis \npartner countries in Europe as well.\n  Millions of others were killed during the Holocaust, exterminated by \na ruthless machine propagated by the Nazi party. Those who escaped the \nterror of the Nazi regime carried with them experiences that can never \nbe forgotten, and have adversely affected their ability to cope with \ninstitutionalized settings.\n  Many Holocaust survivors living in the United States would prefer to \nspend their days at home with their families, rather than being moved \ninto settings where they lose autonomy, privacy, and control, which can \nbring back painful trauma from their experiences under Nazi rule. This \nbill would amend the Older Americans Act to ensure that Holocaust \nsurvivors can better access needed services, such as health care and \nnutrition services, without having to live in a nursing or assisted \nliving facility.\n  As of 2010, there were approximately 127,000 Holocaust survivors \nliving in the United States, and more than three quarters of them are \nover age 75, with a majority in their 80s and 90s. By focusing on home \nand community-based long-term care, we can help ensure that fewer \nsurvivors are dependent on the unpaid support of family caregivers, or \nhave to resort to unnecessary institutionalization.\n  All aging Americans deserve access to needed community supports and \nservices in comfortable settings that are neither mentally nor \nphysically traumatizing. These great Americans deserve our efforts to \nensure that they are better able to age in place. I ask my colleagues \nto join me in support of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4726-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4726-S4727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 513--RECOGNIZING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WAR OF \n 1812, WHICH WAS FOUGHT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND GREAT \n BRITAIN BEGINNING ON JUNE 18, 1812, IN RESPONSE TO BRITISH VIOLATIONS \nOF NEUTRAL RIGHTS OF THE UNITED STATES, SEIZURE OF SHIPS OF THE UNITED \n   STATES, RESTRICTION OF TRADE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER \nCOUNTRIES, AND THE IMPRESSMENT OF SAILORS OF THE UNITED STATES INTO THE \n                               ROYAL NAVY\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 513\n\n       Whereas in standing up to the British, and fighting the \n     conquerors of Napoleon to a draw, the War of 1812 revived \n     flagging nationalism, cleared the way for expanded overseas \n     trade, and ended an era of introversion by the United States;\n       Whereas most of the public buildings of Washington, D.C. \n     were set alight, including the White House and the Capitol;\n       Whereas Sackets Harbor, New York, on the eastern shore of \n     Lake Ontario, was the site of more naval construction during \n     the war than anywhere else;\n       Whereas the war came to the State of New York in late \n     December 1813 when the village of Black Rock, located 2 miles \n     below Buffalo on the front lines of the war, was torched by \n     the British and only 1 house was spared;\n       Whereas Buffalo, of which it is said that ``no other town \n     in the United States saw more of the war'', came under \n     regular siege from the British and was ultimately burned \n     despite assurances that private property would be spared;\n       Whereas the British capture of Fort Niagara, in a surprise \n     night offensive on December 18, 1813, provided control over \n     the mouth of the Niagara River to the British as well as the \n     launching pad for its attacks on Buffalo and Black Rock;\n       Whereas the town of Lewiston, New York, which served as the \n     headquarters for the United States Army during its attack \n     across the river at Queenston, Ontario, was the target of \n     British retaliation in December 1813, resulting in the deaths \n     of many civilians and the destruction of all buildings;\n       Whereas despite being outnumbered 30 to 1, members of the \n     Tuscarora Nation offered the first resistance the British and \n     Mohawk allies had seen, saving the lives of dozens of \n     Lewiston citizens by allowing them to escape the attack;\n       Whereas Jacob Brown, a pioneer settler in the Black River \n     country of upstate New\n\n[[Page S4727]]\n\n     York and a general in the New York Militia, led the \n     successful defense of Fort Erie in the late summer of 1814, \n     which lifted the sprits of the people of the United States at \n     an important time and resulted in Brown emerging from the war \n     a national hero;\n       Whereas the British plan to invade from the North, in a \n     manner similar to that of General John Burgoyne in 1777, was \n     halted at Plattsburgh, New York in September 1814;\n       Whereas the victory at Plattsburgh shattered any hopes of \n     British gains in the North, helped maintain national morale \n     after Washington was sacked in that dark summer of 1814, and \n     was described by Winston Churchill as the ``most decisive \n     engagement of the war'';\n       Whereas from the death and destruction of the War of 1812 \n     there was born a spirit of cooperation and a vision of peace \n     between the United States and Canada;\n       Whereas the unparalleled cooperation, prosperity, and \n     friendship that developed between the United States and \n     Canada since the War of 1812 find the deepest roots and daily \n     expressions in the border communities across upstate New \n     York, which was the front line of the War of 1812;\n       Whereas the bicentennial of the War of 1812 offers an \n     exceptional opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the true \n     and lasting legacy of 200 years of peace between the United \n     States and Canada; and\n       Whereas through the turmoil of war, a young nation endured \n     and saw its banner continue to wave over a land free and \n     brave: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 200th anniversary \n     of the War of 1812.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4727-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 514--COMMEMORATING THE VICTORY OF LOYOLA UNIVERSITY \n     MARYLAND IN THE 2012 NCAA DIVISION I MEN'S LACROSSE NATIONAL \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to S. Res. 514.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       A resolution, (S. Res. 514) commemorating the victory of \n     Loyola University Maryland in the 2012 NCAA Division I Men's \n     Lacrosse National Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and commemorate \nLoyola University of Maryland's victory in the 2012 NCAA Men's Lacrosse \nChampionship and to honor the players, coaches, and administrators who \nhelped to secure Loyola's first Division I National Championship.\n  For much of recent history, NCAA Division I Lacrosse has been \ndominated by a small group of eight, elite programs. But last month, a \nJesuit university on Charles Street in downtown Baltimore became the \nsmallest school ever to win a Division I National Championship. Loyola \njoins the ranks of such universities as Johns Hopkins University, the \nUniversity of Maryland, Syracuse, and Cornell, in becoming just the \nninth team to win a championship since the event's creation in 1971.\n  This year's Division I National Championship set the stage for an \nafternoon of record-shattering lacrosse. The Greyhound defense and \ngoalkeeper Jack Runkel set a new NCAA Division I record for fewest \ngoals allowed in a national championship game, giving up only three \ngoals despite a barrage of nearly thirty shots taken by the highly \nmotivated University of Maryland offense.\n  Loyola University's star offensive player, Eric Lusby, had a busy day \nas well. He scored four goals in the championship game, bringing his \ntotal to 17 during the final four games of the season, setting a new \nNCAA tournament record. He also broke Loyola's single season scoring \nrecord with a total of 54 goals.\n  Loyola University players were not the only ones to break records \nlast month. Head Coach Charley Toomey became the first coach ever to \nwin an NCAA title on his first trip to the NCAA tournament. With 18 \nwins and only one loss, the players and coaches of the 2012 Greyhounds \nlacrosse team have firmly cemented themselves as the most successful \nteam in Loyola's history. The team's achievements are even more \nimpressive when you consider that the Greyhounds started the season as \nan unranked team.\n  Lacrosse has long played a central role in the athletic culture of \nMaryland, and I am proud to see that this year's All-Tournament Team \nselections reflect this reality. Eight of the ten players selected to \nreceive All-Tournament honors call Maryland home, with five coming from \nthe Loyola Greyhounds team and three from the University of Maryland. \nWith Loyola's victory in this year's championship, Maryland is now home \nto three of the nine teams that have ever won a national championship, \nfurther securing our State's reputation as the center of collegiate \nlacrosse.\n  In light of these impressive accomplishments, I call upon my \ncolleagues to join me in recognizing and congratulating Loyola \nUniversity's players, Coach Charley Toomey, Athletic Director Jim \nPaquette, and President, the Rev. Brian Linnane, S.J. on a championship \nseason and the many amazing achievements that carried the Greyhounds to \nvictory.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 514) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 514\n\n       Whereas on May 28, 2012, Loyola University Maryland won its \n     first NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse National Championship \n     and the first Division I national title in the history of the \n     school;\n       Whereas Loyola is the smallest school in NCAA history to \n     win the Division I Men's Lacrosse National Championship, with \n     only 3,863 undergraduate students;\n       Whereas the Loyola Greyhounds finished the men's lacrosse \n     season with a record of 18 wins and 1 loss;\n       Whereas the Loyola Greyhounds set a NCAA record for the \n     fewest goals allowed during a men's lacrosse championship \n     game;\n       Whereas 5 members of the Loyola Greyhounds, Joe Fletcher, \n     Josh Hawkins, Eric Lusby, Scott Ratliff, and Jack Runkel, \n     were named members of the All-Tournament team;\n       Whereas Loyola senior Eric Lusby was named the Most \n     Outstanding Player of the 2012 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse \n     National Championship after scoring 4 goals in the title \n     game, while also setting a tournament record with a total of \n     17 goals in 4 games;\n       Whereas sophomore goalie Jack Runkel had 6 saves in the \n     championship game, holding the University of Maryland to only \n     3 goals;\n       Whereas the 18 wins by the Loyola Greyhounds this season \n     set a program record;\n       Whereas Loyola became just the ninth team to win an NCAA \n     Division I Men's Lacrosse National Championship since the \n     first championship was held in 1971;\n       Whereas the Loyola Greyhounds secured their victory in only \n     their second appearance in a national championship, having \n     been defeated by Syracuse in 1990;\n       Whereas the vision and leadership of the Rev. Brian \n     Linnane, S.J. and Jim Paquette, Loyola University's President \n     and Athletic Director, respectively, were instrumental in \n     bringing academic and athletic success, as well as national \n     recognition, to Loyola University Maryland; and\n       Whereas the 2012 Loyola University Maryland men's lacrosse \n     team has brought great honor and pride to their university, \n     the State of Maryland, and the United States: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Loyola University Maryland Greyhounds \n     for winning the 2012 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse National \n     Championship;\n       (2) recognizes the achievements of the players, coaches, \n     students, and staff whose hard work and dedication were key \n     to Loyola's victory in the championship game; and\n       (3) requests the Secretary of the Senate to transmit for \n     appropriate display an enrolled\n\n[[Page S4730]]\n\n     copy of this resolution to Loyola University President Rev. \n     Brian Linnane, S.J. and Loyola University Men's Lacrosse Head \n     Coach Charley Toomey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/28/senate-section/article/S4730-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, JUNE 29, 2012\n\n  Mr. REID.
