Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require a report on the impact of the FISA Amendments Act \n       of 2008 on the privacy of the people of the United States)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. REPORT ON THE IMPACT OF THE FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF \n                   2008 ON THE PRIVACY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n\n[[Page S8456]]\n\n       (1) The central provision of the FISA Amendments of 2008 \n     (Public Law 110-261; 122 Stat. 2436) enacted section 702 of \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. \n     1881a) which provides the government authority to collect the \n     communications of persons reasonably believed to be citizens \n     of foreign countries who are located outside the United \n     States.\n       (2) Such section 702 contained restrictions regarding the \n     acquisition of the communications of United States persons \n     which were intended to protect the privacy of United States \n     persons and prevent intelligence agencies from using the \n     authority in such section to deliberately read or listen to \n     the communications of specific United States persons without \n     obtaining a warrant or emergency authorization to do so.\n       (3) Estimating the total number of communications to or \n     from the United States collected under the authority in such \n     section 702 would provide an indication of the degree to \n     which collection carried out under such section has impacted \n     the privacy of United States persons.\n       (4) Estimating the number of wholly domestic communications \n     collected under the authority in such section 702 would \n     provide a particularly significant indication of the degree \n     to which collection carried out under this authority has \n     impacted the privacy of United States persons.\n       (5) While Congress did not intend to provide authority in \n     such section 702 for elements of the intelligence community \n     to deliberately review the communications of specific United \n     States persons without obtaining individual warrants or \n     emergency authorizations to do so, such section 702 does not \n     include a specific prohibition against this action, and the \n     people of the United States have a right to know whether \n     elements of the intelligence community have deliberately \n     searched through communications collected under such section \n     702 to find the communications of specific United States \n     persons.\n       (6) Despite requests from numerous Senators, the Director \n     of National Intelligence has declined to state publicly \n     whether--\n       (A) any entity has made an estimate of the number of United \n     States communications that have been collected under such \n     section 702;\n       (B) any wholly domestic communications have been collected \n     under such section 702; or\n       (C) any element of the intelligence community has attempted \n     to search through communications collected under such section \n     702 in a deliberate effort to review the communications of a \n     specific United States person without obtaining a warrant or \n     emergency authorization permitting such a search.\n       (7) In public remarks in July 2012, the Director of the \n     National Security Agency stated that ``the story that we have \n     millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is \n     absolutely false''.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) Requirement.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Director of National \n     Intelligence shall submit to Congress a report on the impact \n     of the amendments made by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 \n     (Public Law 110-261; 122 Stat. 2436) and other surveillance \n     authorities on the privacy of United States persons.\n       (2) Content.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A determination of whether any government entity has \n     produced any estimate regarding--\n       (i) the total number of communications that--\n\n       (I) originated from or were directed to a location in the \n     United States; and\n       (II) have been collected under the authority of section 702 \n     of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 \n     U.S.C. 1881a); or\n\n       (ii) the total number of wholly domestic communications \n     that have been collected under such authority.\n       (B) If any estimate described in subparagraph (A) was \n     produced, such estimate.\n       (C) An assessment of whether any wholly domestic \n     communications have been collected under the authority of \n     section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978 (50 U.S.C. 1881a).\n       (D) A determination of whether any element of the \n     intelligence community has ever attempted to search through \n     communications collected under section 702 of the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1881a) in a \n     deliberate effort to find the communications of a specific \n     United States person, without obtaining a warrant or \n     emergency authorization to do so.\n       (E) A determination of whether the National Security Agency \n     has collected any type of personally identifiable data \n     pertaining to more than 1,000,000 United States persons.\n       (c) Form of Report.--\n       (1) Public availability of report.--The report required by \n     subsection (b) shall be made available to the public not \n     later than 15 days after the date such report is submitted to \n     Congress.\n       (2) Redactions.--If the President believes that public \n     disclosure of information in the report required by \n     subsection (b) could cause significant harm to national \n     security, the President may redact such information from the \n     report made available to the public.\n       (3) Submission to congress.--If the President redacts \n     information under paragraph (2), not later than 30 days after \n     the date the report required by subsection (b) is made \n     available to the public under paragraph (1), the President \n     shall submit to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the \n     Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the House of Representatives a statement explaining the \n     specific harm to national security that the disclosure of \n     such information could cause.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 30 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to the vote on the \nWyden amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, given the events of yesterday, this is the \nlast opportunity for the next 5 years for the Congress to exercise a \nmodest measure of real oversight over this intelligence surveillance \nlaw. Here is why. Colleagues, it is not real oversight when the \nCongress cannot get a yes or no answer to the question of whether an \nestimate currently exists as to whether law-abiding Americans have had \ntheir phone calls and e-mails swept up under the FISA law. That is the \ncase today.\n  Colleagues, it is not real oversight when the Congress cannot get a \nyes or no answer to the question of whether wholly domestic \ncommunications between law-abiding Americans in this country have been \nwarrantlessly intercepted under the law. That is the case today.\n  Colleagues, it is not real oversight when National Security Agency \nleadership states in a public forum that the Agency does not keep \ndossiers on millions of Americans and yet they will not give the \nCongress a yes or no answer as to whether the Agency collects any sort \nof data on millions of Americans. That is not the case today.\n  What this amendment does is it gives us the opportunity to do real \noversight--real oversight--by getting yes or no answers to questions \nthat have been asked repeatedly by members of the Intelligence \nCommittee. The amendment, in order to ensure that national security is \nprotected at an important time in our country's history, gives the \nPresident of the United States unfettered discretion to redact any \ninformation he believes is necessary in order to protect the country's \nnational security. The amendment does not require any agency to do new \nwork. We have heard cited repeatedly it would be impossible to do an \nestimate on projections that have been discussed in the past. So we \nhave changed course and we have said all we are seeking is a yes or no \nanswer to the question of whether an estimate has actually been done.\n  This is an important time for American security. It will always be an \nimportant time for American security. It is also an important time for \nAmerican liberty, and this amendment ensures we can strike the \nappropriate balance between protecting our country's well-being and \nalso protecting the individual liberties we all cherish.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. \nThis amendment would require the Director of National Intelligence to \nissue a public report within 90 days, assessing the impact of the FISA \nAmendments Act and its surveillance authorities on the privacy of U.S. \npersons.\n  That sounds benign, but it is not. The goal of this amendment is to \nmake information public about a very effective intelligence collection \nprogram that is currently classified. All of the information has \nalready been made available to the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary \nCommittees. It is available to all Members. All they have to do is read \nit. It is hundreds of pages of material.\n  Senator Wyden has raised a number of issues that all concern the \npotential for surveillance conducted pursuant to authorities to result \nin what is called ``incidental collection.'' Section 702 authorizes the \nexecutive branch to go to the FISA Court--that is a Federal court, \nFederal district judges appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme \nCourt--and obtain annual approval for the certifications of the \nAttorney General and the DNI that identify categories of foreign \ntargets. These are what I call a program warrant, to conduct \nsurveillance on non-U.S. persons; in other words, individuals who are \nnot U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents who are located outside \nthe United States.\n  It is possible there can be some incidental collection of \ncommunications of\n\n[[Page S8457]]\n\nor concerning those who are U.S. persons. This potential for incidental \ncollection does not mean the intelligence community is intentionally \nconducting surveillance on U.S. persons. In fact, doing so would be a \nviolation of the law.\n  Here is the key point to understand about incidental collection. \nAlthough the government may, under the right circumstances, be \nauthorized to retain the communication between--as an example--known \nterrorists and a presumptive U.S. person or persons, including the \nphone number he relayed to the terrorist, the government cannot place \nthe U.S. number on surveillance and start collecting the calls to and \nfrom the U.S. number without first obtaining an individual court order \nor a warrant. To do so would be to target a U.S. person, which I will \nexplain is reverse targeting.\n  Let me answer another common question: Can the government use section \n702 to target a U.S. person? This is important. The answer is no. The \nlaw specifically prevents the use of section 702 to direct collection \nagainst U.S. persons. This prohibition is codified in 702(b), which \nstates that the section may not be used to ``intentionally target any \nperson known at the time of acquisition to be located in the United \nStates'' or to ``intentionally target a United States person reasonably \nbelieved to be located inside the United States.''\n  Another frequent question: Is there a loophole or backdoor that \nallows the government to use 702 to target U.S. persons by searching \nincidental collection? Answer: No. The Department of Justice, the DNI's \noffices, the FBI, and NSA have all advised that limiting the ability of \nintelligence analysts to review and analyze information already in the \ngovernment's possession under section 702 would make these agencies \nless able to respond quickly during a developing terrorist plot.\n  In sum, review of the information already collected enables the \ngovernment to protect against a terrorist attack on this Nation.\n  Regarding the level of oversight conducted on these authorities, as \nof October 7, 2011, the congressional Intelligence and Judiciary \nCommittees received over 500 pages of information from the Department \nof Justice that specifically relate to matters covered by the Wyden \namendment. The Senate Intelligence Committee held a closed hearing in \nOctober 2011 on these issues. The senior Senator from Oregon attended. \nThese were the issues specifically discussed. In December of 2011, the \ncongressional Intelligence and Judiciary Committees received in excess \nof another 100 pages of material relating to these issues.\n  We held another closed hearing on February 9, 2012, which the Senator \nfrom Oregon attended, where these issues were discussed. The inspectors \ngeneral for the intelligence community and NSA have both provided \nclassified and unclassified responses to letters written by the Senator \nfrom Oregon and the Senator from Colorado, explaining why it is not \nfeasible to estimate the number of people inside the United States who \nhave had their communications collected or reviewed under the \nauthorities granted by section 702. Finally, the DNI sent a letter in \nAugust on this issue.\n  Here is the point. If we want to talk about oversight, all of the \ninformation exists, and it is up to Intelligence Committee of the \nSenate to do its oversight and Members have to go in and read the \nmaterial.\n  I believe very strongly that what this amendment aims to do is make \npublic a program that should not be made public at this time. I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose this amendment.\n\n  Finally, I request that a letter from General Alexander, head of the \nNational Security Agency--which essentially explains remarks he made--\nbe printed in the Record. I would also like to have the letter to the \ngeneral from the Senator from Oregon printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                     National Security Agency,\n\n                          Fort George G. Meade, MD, Nov. 13, 2012.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for your letter dated 10 \n     October 2012 concerning issues related to the National \n     Security Agency's (NSA's) handling of U.S. person \n     communications. As you know, NSA takes great care to protect \n     the civil liberties and privacy interests of U.S. persons in \n     the conduct of its mission.\n       Your letter requested clarity and further information with \n     respect to my extemporaneous response to a question posed by \n     a member of the audience following my formal presentation on \n     cybersecurity delivered on 27 July 2012, at DEFCON 20. At the \n     conference, a member of the audience asked me: ``Does NSA \n     really keep a file on everyone [in the United States] and, if \n     so, can I see mine?'' I responded: ``Absolutely not. And \n     anybody who would tell you that we're keeping files or \n     dossiers on the American people know[s] that's not true and \n     let me tell you why. First, under our Agency we have a \n     responsibility. Our job is foreign intelligence.'' I then \n     gave a short explanation of how we execute our foreign \n     intelligence mission and the oversight provided by all three \n     branches of government, including Congress, before \n     reiterating that ``the story that we have millions or \n     hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is absolutely \n     false.'' I referred to the fact that Section 702 of the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as amended by the FISA \n     Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA 702), permits the targeting only \n     of communications of non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to \n     be located outside of the United States. Finally, I \n     highlighted the role served by minimization procedures to \n     provide additional protection to incidentally collected \n     communications of U.S. persons.\n       First, with respect to the reference to minimization \n     procedures, my response should be understood in the context \n     in which it was made. I noted at the outset that NSA has a \n     foreign intelligence mission, and my subsequent reference \n     focused on the type of circumstance in which U.S. person \n     information may be disseminated when this foreign \n     intelligence requirement is not met (e.g., when there is \n     evidence of a crime). As you are aware, the statutory \n     requirements for minimization procedures are a matter of \n     public record:\n       Section 101(h)(1) of FISA requires that minimization \n     procedures must be ``reasonably designed . . . to minimize \n     the acquisition and retention and prohibit the dissemination, \n     of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting \n     U.S. persons consistent with the need of the United States to \n     obtain, produce, and disseminate foreign intelligence \n     information.''\n       Section 101(h)(2) of FISA requires that ``nonpublicly \n     available information which is not foreign intelligence \n     information shall not be disseminated in a manner that \n     identifies any U.S. person, without such person's consent, \n     unless such person's identity is necessary to understand \n     foreign intelligence information or assess its importance.''\n       Section 101(h)(3) of FISA permits both retention and \n     dissemination where there is ``evidence of a crime which has \n     been, is being, or is about to be committed and that is to be \n     retained or disseminated for law enforcement purposes.''\n       Section 101(h)(4) of FISA permits disclosure, \n     dissemination, or use for any purpose or retention for 72 \n     hours, or longer if a determination is made by the Attorney \n     General, ``if the information indicates a threat of death or \n     serious bodily harm to any person.''\n       Second, my response did not refer to or address whether it \n     is possible to identify the number of U.S. person \n     communications that may be lawfully but incidentally \n     intercepted pursuant to foreign intelligence collection \n     directed against non-U.S. persons located outside the United \n     States as authorized under FAA 702.\n       In your letter, you asked for unclassified answers to \n     several questions that you feel are important to allow the \n     public to better understand my remarks delivered at the \n     conference. While I appreciate your desire to have responses \n     to these questions on the public record, they directly relate \n     to operational activities and complete answers would \n     necessarily include classified information essential to our \n     ability to collect foreign intelligence. Indeed, as you are \n     aware, these very questions were recently addressed in a \n     classified letter to you from the Director of National \n     Intelligence dated 24 August 2012.\n       Finally, as you are also aware, senior officials from the \n     Administration, including the Office of the Director of \n     National Intelligence, the Justice Department, and NSA, have \n     testified and briefed before the relevant Congressional \n     committees on multiple occasions over the past year. We have \n     also conducted numerous sessions with committee staff and \n     counsel, as well as correspondence and discussions with \n     individual Senators and Representatives. As a result of the \n     many briefings, hearings, and other interactions between the \n     Intelligence Committees and the Administration, there exists \n     a comprehensive Congressional record relating to all of NSA's \n     foreign intelligence activities (including information \n     relevant to the questions you pose).\n       Again, thank you for your ongoing interest in these issues. \n     Regardless of differences that may exist on policy issues, I \n     cannot overstate the importance or value of ongoing \n     Congressional interest and oversight of NSA's operations, \n     acting on behalf of the American people. If you have further \n     questions, please contact me personally or have your staff \n     contact my Associate Director for\n\n[[Page S8458]]\n\n     Legislative Affairs, Ethan L. Bauman, at (301) 688-7246.\n                                               Keith B. Alexander,\n     General, U.S. Army Director, NSA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2012.\n     General Keith Alexander,\n     Director, National Security Agency,\n     Fort Meade, MD.\n       Dear General Alexander: You spoke recently at a technology \n     convention in Nevada, at which you were asked a question \n     about NSA collection of information about American citizens. \n     In your response. you focused in particular on section 702 or \n     the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which the Senate will debate \n     later this year. In describing the NSA's collection of \n     communications under the FISA Amendments Act, you discussed \n     rules for handling the communications of US persons. \n     Specifically, you said:\n       We may, incidentally, in targeting a bad guy hit on \n     somebody from a good guy, because there's a discussion there. \n     We have requirements from the FISA Court and the Attorney \n     General to minimize that, which means nobody else can see it \n     unless there's a crime that's been committed.\n       We believe that this statement incorrectly characterized \n     the minimization requirements that apply to the NSA's FISA \n     Amendments Act collection, and portrayed privacy protections \n     for Americans' communications as being stronger than they \n     actually are. We urge you to correct this statement, so that \n     Congress and the public can have a debate over the renewal of \n     this law that is informed by at least some accurate \n     information about the impact it has had on Americans' \n     privacy.\n       You also stated, in response to the same question, that ``. \n     . . the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions \n     of dossiers on people is absolutely false''. We are not \n     entirely clear what the term ``dossier'' means in this \n     context, so we would appreciate it if you would clarify this \n     remark. Specifically, we ask that you please answer the \n     following questions:\n       The intelligence community has stated repeatedly that it is \n     not possible to provide even a rough estimate of how many \n     American communications have been collected under the FISA \n     Amendments Act, and has even declined to estimate the scale \n     of this collection. Are you certain that the number of \n     American communications collected is not ``millions or \n     hundreds of millions''? If so, then clearly you must have \n     some ability to estimate the scale of this number, or at \n     least some range in which you believe it falls. If this is \n     the case, how large could this number possibly be? How small \n     could I possibly be?\n       Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on ``millions \n     or hundreds of millions of Americans''?\n       Since you made your remarks in an unclassified forum, we \n     would appreciate an unclassified response to these questions, \n     so that your remarks can be properly understood by Congress \n     and the public, and not interpreted in a misleading way. \n     Additionally, since the Senate will debate this issue during \n     the November/December 2012 session, please provide your \n     response by November 13.\n       If you have any questions concerning this request, please \n     have your staff contact John Dickas of Senator Wyden's staff, \n     or Jennifer Barrett of Senator Udall's staff. We appreciate \n     your attention to this matter and look forward to your prompt \n     response.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ron Wyden.\n     Mark Udall.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor to the vice \nchairman for the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I oppose Senator Wyden's amendment also \nbecause it imposes an unreasonably burdensome reporting requirement on \nthe DNI and is inconsistent with the purpose of FISA, which is to \nobtain foreign intelligence information. This amendment would require \nthe diversion of scarce intelligence personnel and resources away from \nthe identification of foreign intelligence information but, rather, to \nassess whether any wholly domestic communications have been \ninadvertently collected under FAA authorities. This is an unnecessary \nand pointless exercise. The collection system was designed to comply \nwith FISA's clear prohibition against the intentional collection of \nwholly domestic communications.\n  I will read how specific this is in the law. This is directly out of \nsection 702, which the amendment seeks to attack. There are limitations \nagainst collection of information under the following guise:\n\n       An acquisition authorized under subsection (a)--\n\n  Which is to collect information from those located outside the United \nStates. We:\n\n     may not intentionally target any person known at the time of \n     acquisition to be located in the United States; may not \n     intentionally target a person reasonably believed to be \n     located outside the United States if the purpose of such \n     acquisition is to target a particular, known person \n     reasonably believed to be in the United States; may not \n     intentionally target a United States person reasonably \n     believed to be located outside the United States.\n\n  It goes further into detail and is very specific about the fact that \nthere is no authorization to target U.S. persons.\n  As the chairman said, it is our duty, as members of the Intelligence \nCommittee, to do the oversight required to make sure these laws are \ncomplied with, and we do that. We do it in a very deliberate and direct \nway by not only having the individuals responsible for the collection \nof this information made available to the committee, but it goes all \nthe way to the top. The individuals who collect it, as well as the \nleaders of the intelligence community, come in once a year--and they \nwill come more often than that if there is a problem we need to \naddress--and we review this information.\n  The Senator from Oregon, the distinguished Presiding Officer, members \nof the Intelligence Committee, know the type of oversight that is \navailable to us. So if there is any question about what is done and \nwhether section 702 is not being complied with, we have the opportunity \nto ask the questions.\n  The amendment by the distinguished Senator from Oregon actually goes \nfurther than what he said was a simple yes-or-no question and requires \nthat the intelligence community go into great detail on any estimate or \nany finding where a U.S. person may have been involved. Is that the \ntype of information we need for our intelligence community to spend \ntheir time on versus trying to find bad guys around the world? I think \nthe answer is pretty simple.\n  As we said yesterday, if there is a problem and the problem is \naddressed by the intelligence community and the Intelligence Committees \non both the House and Senate side, it is not abused. If there is a \nproblem, we fix it. There are minimization procedures that are in place \nwhich address this issue that are used when necessary. If we do our \njob, there is absolutely no reason for this amendment--and we do our \njob.\n  The chairman is very diligent in making sure the annual reviews are \nset at specific times of the year. Every member of the committee has an \nobligation to be at the hearings to ask the tough and right questions. \nAs far as I know, every member of the committee has done that. We have \nprovided the right kind of oversight.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote against this because it is simply \nan unnecessary amendment, and it is the last amendment we have to \nconsider. As we said over and over yesterday, we have to get this bill \non the desk of the President by December 31, which is 3 days away.\n  It is important we conclude this morning, that the bill be sent to \nthe President's desk so we can sign it, and we can continue to provide \nthe right kind of supervised collection against foreign individuals to \nmake sure America and Americans are protected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Wyden \namendment. Before I share my thoughts, I wanted to express my respect \nand admiration for the chairwoman and vice chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee. They are professional, easy to work with, and \nhave the security of our people front and center at all times.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have learned a \ngreat deal with respect to our post-9/11 surveillance laws and how they \nhave been implemented. In the course of my 2 years on the committee, I \nhave determined there are reforms which need to be made to the FISA \nAmendments Act before we renew this important law.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Wyden and I opposed the bill reported out \nof the Senate Intelligence Committee extending the expiration date of \nthe FISA Amendments Act because we believe Congress does not have an \nadequate understanding of the effect this law has had on the privacy of \nlaw-abiding American citizens. In our view it is important for Members \nof Congress and the public to have a better understanding of the \nforeign intelligence surveillance conducted under the FAA so Congress \ncan consider whether the law should be modified rather than simply \nextended without changes.\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\n  That is the simple purpose of the amendment Senator Wyden, other \ncolleagues, and I have filed--to make more information available to \nMembers of Congress and the public so they have a better understanding \nof the law and its imitation.\n  This amendment requires the Director of National Intelligence to \nprovide information to Congress about the effects of the FISA \nAmendments Act on the privacy of America, which is something we all \nhold dear. It would require information on whether an estimation has \nbeen conducted of how many U.S. communications have been collected \nunder the FISA Amendments Act and, if so, how many, whether any wholly \ndomestic communications have been collected and whether officials have \ngone through these communications to conduct warrantless searches for \nthe phone calls and e-mails of specific Americans.\n  It would not require the intelligence community to conduct any new \nestimates of Americans whose communications may have been collected \nunder the statute and would give the President full discretion to \nredact information from the public version of the report.\n  I will conclude by restating my belief that the American people need \na better understanding of how the FISA Amendments Act, section 702, in \nparticular, has affected the privacy of Americans. I also believe we \nneed new protections against potential warrantless searches for \nAmericans' communications. I believe that without such reforms, \nCongress should not simply extend the law for 5 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague from Colorado. He has been a \nwonderful partner in this effort to strike a balance between security \nand liberty. I look forward to working with him in the days ahead.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Proponents have 8 minutes and the \nopponents have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I say this with the greatest respect to the \ndistinguished chair of the committee--with whom I have worked \ncooperatively on so many issues--that when she said this amendment \nseeks to publish names, I would just like to say that is simply and \nfactually incorrect. In no way, shape or form does this amendment seek \nto publish names, and I wish to tell colleagues that if anyone in \nconnection with this program were to seek to publish names, I would \nvigorously oppose that effort. I simply just want to make sure the \nRecord reflects that.\n  We have heard by the opponents of this amendment that the \nintelligence community has already provided the Congress with lots of \ninformation about the FISA Amendments Act. However, the reality is a \nlot more complicated than that. Much of that information is in highly \nclassified documents that are difficult for most Members to review, and \nthe reality is most Members literally have no staff who are cleared to \nread the documents which have been cited.\n  So the fact is most Members of Congress don't have staff to help them \ndeal with these complicated issues so they are--in many particulars--in \nthe dark about the program, and certainly the 300 million-plus \nAmericans who expect us to strike that balance between security and \nliberty are also in the dark.\n  I have already noted that the amendment gives the executive branch \nunfettered authority to make redactions, and I just want to make sure \nevery Senator hears the exact language because I think this is as broad \na redaction proposal as I have seen in my service on the committee. The \nredaction proposal states: If the President believes that public \ndisclosure of the report required by this section could cause \nsignificant harm to national security, the President may redact such \ninformation from the report made available to the public.\n  I hope colleagues who have asked about whether this would endanger \nour country and have heard on the floor of the Senate that somehow this \namendment would seek to name names--particularly at a dangerous time--\nwill see, No. 1, that is not the case; and No. 2, that the President, \nas outlined on page 6, has full and unfettered discretion to redact the \nreport as he sees fit.\n  I also want to respond to this point that there would be no time for \nthis to be considered by the other body if we add this modest measure \nof oversight. As I understand from the news reporting this morning, the \nother body will be meeting on Sunday, so they will be here this \nweekend. The other body is perfectly capable of passing an amended \nbill, getting it to the President by the end of the month. The \ndistinguished vice chair and I both served in the other body. We know \nthat when they are here--particularly on something that just involves a \nreport--it would be very easy for the other body to pass this and send \nit to the President. In fact, the House passed the extension a few \nmonths ago with over 300 votes. So passing it Sunday when the other \nbody is in session seems to not exactly be a difficult and arduous \ntask.\n  What it comes down to is what we define robust congressional \noversight in a program such as this to be. Again, I respectfully say \nthat without basic information as to whether an estimate even exists--\nin response to colleagues--this is not talking about anybody going out \nand doing a lot of work. This is a question of either responding \naffirmatively or negatively to the question Senator Udall and I have \nbeen asking lo these several years: Does an estimate exist as to \nwhether or not law-abiding Americans have had their communications \nswept up under this law?\n  There is a reason to be concerned about this because Senator Udall \nand I worked very hard to get at least a little bit of information on \nthis, and we have been able to declassify that there has been a fourth \namendment violation in the past.\n  I believe that without the information Senator Udall and I have \nsought that is behind this amendment--those who say there ought to be \nrobust congressional oversight of this program ought to reflect on the \nfact that without this information which is so essential to do our \nwork, oversight is not robust, it is toothless--it is toothless--if we \ncannot get an answer to the question as to whether an estimate exists \nfor how many Americans have had their communications swept up.\n  So I close with this: This is, as the distinguished chair of the \ncommittee said earlier, a critically important time for American \nsecurity. Those of us who serve on the committee--and the distinguished \nPresiding Officer is part of these briefings--go into the room, and the \ndoors are locked, and we certainly get significant information about \nthe threats and the well-being of this country. So it is an important \ntime for American security. It is also an important time for American \nliberty.\n  To paraphrase Ben Franklin, as I did yesterday, those who give up \ntheir liberty in order to have security really don't deserve either. \nThe two are not mutually exclusive. We can do both. That is what the \nconstitutional teeter-totter has always been about--security and well-\nbeing of our country on the one hand and protecting our liberties on \nthe other.\n  What Senator Udall and I contend this morning is that without access \nto information about critical questions such as whether an estimate \neven exists as to how many law-abiding Americans have had their \ncommunications swept up under FISA, we can't answer the question as to \nwhether the constitutional teeter-totter is in balance. So I hope my \ncolleagues will vote for this amendment given the events of yesterday.\n  I say to my colleagues that this will be the last opportunity--the \nlast opportunity for 5 years--to exercise some modest measure of real \noversight over this program. I hope my colleagues on a bipartisan basis \nwill support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, we have how many minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will use 1 minute.\n  The fact is, we do an intelligence authorization bill every year. If \nthere is a need to change the law, we can change it there, so this \nisn't the last opportunity to effect any change on the FISA Amendments \nAct for 5 years. I believe that it is the last opportunity to see that \nthis program continues on without interruption.\n\n[[Page S8460]]\n\n  I would also point out that one of the areas in which the \nadministration has really made an effort is to bring leaders of the \nIntelligence Community--whether it is the DNI or representatives from \nthe Department of Justice--to the Hill and explain to individual \nMembers how this program works.\n  With respect to the classified material, any Member has access to it; \nany Member can go up and read this material. The staff of the \nIntelligence Committee, which helps us conduct this oversight, can read \nthis material. The Members of the Intelligence Committee can read this \nmaterial. As chairman, if someone finds an irregularity, I am happy to \nlook at it, to have a hearing on it. But to adopt this amendment that \nwould change this program at this time has my very strong opposition. I \nurge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield to the vice chairman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I would echo what the chairman said--\nthat the very well trained, dedicated staff of the Intelligence \nCommittee is available to assist any Member in reviewing the classified \ninformation that is the subject of section 702. That is why they are \nthere. The Senator from Oregon is right. Every Member of Congress \ndoesn't have that highly trained, top-secret staff member, and there \nare reasons for that. There are reasons why the Intelligence Committee \nmembers do have those types of staffers. Those staffers are available \nat any time for discussion of this issue or, for that matter, any other \nissue relative to national security that is within the purview of the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  So I again say that this amendment is simply totally unnecessary \nbecause there are specific and direct prohibitions in the law as well \nas in court decisions that do not allow our respective intelligence \ncommunity agencies to listen in or review e-mails or whatever on U.S. \ncitizens unless it is under some sort of court order where probable \ncause must be shown.\n  We need to make sure we are equipping our intelligence community \nagents with every single tool necessary to combat terrorists around the \nworld. This section is critical to doing that. I urge a vote against \nthe amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 3439 offered by the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  The bill (H.R. 5949) was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I rise today to express my \nlongstanding concerns about the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. We are \nbeing asked to extend the sunset provisions in the Act until 2017. \nWithout adoption of the amendments to include additional privacy \nprotections and oversight requirements, I cannot support an extension.\n  We all appreciate the dedicated work of the intelligence community. \nThey have a big job in keeping us safe. But we also have to protect the \nconstitutional rights of American citizens. That goes to the heart of \nwho we are. Of what our country stands for. These aims are not \ncontradictory. We can do both. And we must do both.\n  The FISA Amendments Act of 2008 gave broad powers to the intelligence \ncommunity. Too broad, for some of us. I was one of the minority votes \nin the House against FISA. It allows a very wide net to search phone \ncalls and emails of foreigners outside of the United States.\n  We knew then, and we know now, that net would also scoop up the \nprivate communications of American citizens. The challenge was clear. \nGo after the bad guys. But do not violate the privacy of the American \npeople. So the Act contained specific limitations.\n  Now, 4 years later, we are asking a basic question. Have those \nlimitations worked? And the answer is--we really do not know.\n  This uncertainty is not for lack of trying. We have tried to get \nanswers. Numerous times. But the information is still lacking. \nIntelligence officials have said they are unable to tell us how many \nU.S. communications have been collected under FISA authority. Not an \nactual number. Not an exact number. Not even an estimate.\n  Plain and simple--we need more information. How else can we evaluate \nthis policy? The American public has a right to know. And needs to \nknow. How many Americans are affected by FISA? Are existing privacy \nprotections working? Are they too weak? Do they need to be \nstrengthened? These are vital questions. They need to be answered. And \nso far they have not been.\n  That is why the amendments that have been offered are so important. \nThese amendments are intended to strengthen privacy protections of \nAmerican citizens and to improve congressional oversight. These \namendments will improve FISA. And they deserve bipartisan support.\n  I want to emphasize my support for Senator Wyden's amendment that we \nwill vote on this morning. The amendment would require the Director of \nNational Intelligence to report to Congress on the impact of FISA. And \nprovide specific information. In particular, how many U.S. \ncommunications have been collected under the Act? Have there been \ndeliberate attempts to search the phone calls or emails of individual \nAmericans? Without obtaining a warrant or emergency authorization?\n  The Director's report would be available to the public. And the \nPresident could withhold public disclosure of any information necessary \nto national security. This amendment will not compromise national \nsecurity. But it will help protect the rights of American citizens.\n  As Senator Wyden stated on the floor yesterday, several of us sent \nletters to Director Clapper requesting this information, but have not \nreceived an adequate response. The Wyden amendment would ensure that \nCongress has the information we need to make an informed decision about \nwhether to extend future sunset provisions.\n  The war on terrorism that began after the 9/11 attacks has continued \nfor over 10 years. During that time, Congress has passed laws, \nincluding the PATRIOT Act and FISA Amendments Act, which gave sweeping \nnew authorities to law enforcement and the intelligence community.\n  I know we must protect the Nation from future attacks. But there must\n\n[[Page S8461]]\n\nalso be a balance--we cannot give up our constitutional protections in \nthe name of security. I voted against the PATRIOT Act and FISA \nAmendments Act because I believed they were not balanced--they unduly \ninfringed on the guaranteed rights of our citizens.\n  As I said, we all value the work of our intelligence community. Their \nefforts are vital to our Nation's security. But, I believe these \namendments are crucial. We can protect our citizens without trampling \ntheir constitutional rights.\n  Unfortunately, none of the amendments we voted on yesterday were \nadopted. But the main argument I heard against them was not on the \nsubstance of the amendments. It was that we do not have time to amend \nthe bill and send it back to the House. The Chair and Vice-chair argued \nthat we must pass the House bill without amendment and get it to the \nPresident before the provisions expire.\n  This is not how the ``world's greatest deliberative body'' should \nfunction. It is one more example of why we need to reform our rules so \nthat we are not constantly mired in procedural gridlock. Rather than an \n11th hour passage of the House bill, we should have had a real \nopportunity to debate and amend the Senate bill that came out of \ncommittee over 5 months ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on passage of the bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor passage of the bill, the bill (H.R. 5949) is passed.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for their \ncoming to the floor over the past 2 days for a good debate on the \nreauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act, which the Senate approved \ntoday by a vote of 73-23.\n  As I described a number of times during this debate, this electronic \nsurveillance tool is among the most important intelligence collection \nmeasures we have for identifying and thwarting terrorist plots, as well \nas stopping proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, cyber attacks \nagainst the United States, and for intelligence collection to advise \npolicy decisions. Authorizing the statute for another 5 years will put \nthe Nation's intelligence community on strong ground.\n  I also would like to reiterate the offer I made during the debate to \nmake sure that any Senator interested in getting additional, classified \ninformation on the FISA Amendments Act can get that information. In \nparticular, I look forward to working with Senator Merkley to see that \nsignificant decisions of the FISA Court--or summaries of those \ndecisions--are reviewed and made public in a way that does not \ncompromise classified information. I also will work with Senator Leahy, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to seek any additional reviews \nby the relevant inspectors general to complement the oversight that is \nalready done every year on FISA programs. I will continue to work with \nSenators Wyden and Udall on the committee to help pursue their \noversight requests and interests.\n  Lastly, but very importantly for me, I would like to thank the staff \nwho have worked over the past four years to conduct oversight of the \nFISA Amendments Act and who worked to get this legislation approved. \nTheir work includes countless hours of meetings with officials from the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of \nJustice, the National Security Agency, and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, and even more time reading and analyzing reports, \nanswers, and communications from those departments and agencies.\n  On the staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I would \nlike to note first and foremost the dedicated efforts and counsel of \nChristine Healey, the committee's general counsel, and Eric Losick, \ncounsel on the majority side who have been my main advisors on this \nlegislation. I also appreciate their Republican counterparts, Jack \nLivingston and Kathleen Rice, with whom we have worked closely and \ncollaboratively in this effort.\n  My appreciation as well goes to Mike Buchwald, my designee on the \ncommittee, for his tireless staff work; to Mike Davidson, who was the \ncommittee's general counsel during part of this past 4 year period and \nwho set the structure of the committee's ongoing oversight; and to \nDavid Grannis, the committee's staff director.\n  Finally, I deeply appreciate the efforts of the majority leader's \npeople and the floor staff--Tommy Ross, Serena Hoy, Gary Myrick, Tim \nMitchell, and Tricia Engle--who got this bill to the floor before the \nexpiration of the FISA Amendments Act and who helped guide it through \nto passage.\n  Thanks to the Senate's vote today, this critical intelligence tool \nwill continue to be available to the Nation's intelligence community. \nThe Senate's oversight of it will continue as well, as I intent to \ncontinue the committee's careful review of the program for the next 5 \nyears.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, major terrorist threats still exist, and \nit is critical that we do all we can to protect Americans, not only in \nterms of national security, but also in terms of civil liberties. In \nvoting today to extend the FISA Amendments Act, FAA, for 5 years, I \nmade a difficult judgment as there are still major outstanding \nconcerns. In trying to address these concerns, I supported three \namendments that would have made important improvements.\n  The first was Senator Leahy's amendment, which sought to align the \nFAA sunset with the Patriot Act sunset so that both of these national \nsecurity laws could be evaluated together prior to their expiration. \nAdditionally, this amendment required a comprehensive review of FAA \nsurveillance by the Inspector General of the intelligence community to \naddress privacy concerns that have been raised.\n  I also supported Senator Merkley's amendment, which would have \nincreased transparency by requiring the Attorney General, in a manner \nconsistent with the protection of national security, to make publicly \navailable Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court decisions that \ninclude a significant construction or interpretation of the law.\n  Finally, I voted in favor of Senator Wyden's amendment, which would \nhave required the Director of National Intelligence to submit a report \nto Congress and the public on the impact of FAA on the privacy of \nAmerican citizens, while preserving the President's ability to make \nnecessary redactions.\n\n[[Page S8462]]\n\n  I am disappointed that these amendments, which all call for greater \naccountability and transparency, were unsuccessful.\n  In 2008, I largely objected to the FAA because I had serious concerns \nabout granting retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies for \nactions they may or may not have taken in response to administration \nrequests that may or may not have been legal. Because these immunity \nprovisions are not subject to a sunset, they are not at issue with \ntoday's vote.\n  I ultimately decided to vote in favor of extending FAA for 5 years \nbecause, as I noted earlier, major threats still exist. However, I did \nso reluctantly. We should have considered an FAA extension months ago \nwithout the threat of FAA expiration in mere days. Protecting Americans \nmeans that we must balance ensuring our national security with \npreserving our civil liberties, and I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues to ensure that this balance is struck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/28/senate-section/article/S8462-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8462-S8467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is about ensuring that taxpayer dollars are spent \nwisely, while at the same time guaranteeing that Federal law \nenforcement agencies that face challenges following Hurricane Sandy \nhave the resources they need to get the job done.\n  Instead of simply providing funding, my amendment requires that \nwithin 7 days, the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland \nSecurity identify and relocate vehicles based at the Washington, D.C. \nheadquarters of DOJ and DHS that are used for non-operational purposes.\n  The vehicles identified will then be used to replace those damaged by \nHurricane Sandy that are used by the FBI, DEA, ATF, ICE, and Secret \nService.\n  This is a good government amendment and one that actually achieves \nthe goal of replacing operational vehicles used by Federal law \nenforcement faster than the underlying bill.\n  If this is an emergency, as we have been told, these agencies can \nspare some of the hundreds of vehicles they have sitting at their \nheadquarters that they currently have for non-operational purposes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my commonsense, good government \namendment.\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendments en bloc.\n  The amendments were agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as Hurricane Sandy was bearing down on \nour own east coast, causing tremendous damage, a supertyphoon named \nBopha was also striking the small Asian Pacific nation of Palau. The \nU.S. Embassy in Palau issued a declaration on December 5.\n  In response to this emergency, Palau has asked that the assistance \nagreement signed by the United States in 2010 be approved so the funds \nalready agreed to can become available for disaster recovery.\n  Palau is a strategic ally of ours in the western Pacific near Guam, \nthe Philippines, and Indonesia. Last year, our own Defense Department \nwrote:\n\n       Failure to follow through on our commitments to Palau, as \n     reflected in the proposed (Agreement), would jeopardize our \n     defense posture in the Western Pacific.\n\n  It is important the United States demonstrate its reliability as a \nstrategic partner in the Pacific by approving the 2010 agreement with \nPalau and meeting our commitments.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask for time to speak on this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 30 seconds remaining in opposition.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, this is the result of a compact that, \nto my knowledge, has not been brought before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. It commits us to direct spending permanently for \nentitlement-type spending that I do believe needs more careful review.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays were \npreviously ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Coburn \namendments Nos. 3368, 3370, 3371, and 3382 be temporarily laid aside \nand that the Senate proceed to Tester amendment No. 3350.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S8464]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3350\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, this amendment, No. 3350, is to provide \nadditional funds for wildland fire management. The summer of 2012 was a \nbad fire year, the third worst on record--9.2 million acres were \nburned. The drought has continued to persist. Projections for 2013 as a \nfire season will be even worse. The Forest Service budget--when there \nare bad fire years, they have to rob from other accounts. That was the \ncase this year, with a shortfall of $653 million. This amendment closes \nthat gap and gives the Forest Service the resources for the upcoming \nfire season, which is due to be a bad one.\n  The amendment also requires the GAO to recommend alternative new \nmodels to better reflect the costs associated with wild land fires \nbecause they have been underfunded so much in the past. This will \nestablish a better model and reduce the need for supplemental funding \nin this account in the future.\n  Here is the scoop, folks: The damage done by fires, particularly in \nthe West, was extensive and is an emergency. The Forest Service can \ncontinue to rob money from other accounts to fight these fires which \nends up in poor forest management and even bigger fires.\n  I encourage everyone's concurrence in this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Tester's energy on \nthis issue and desire to move forward with it. We do have a process for \nthis kind of funding to occur. He would add $653 million in prospective \nwildlife mitigation spending and declare that as an emergency. This \nspending is better if handled through the regular appropriations \nprocess. It is actually moving forward faster. He is trying to make \nsure this money is set aside. This is not the time to do it, but I \nappreciate his interest.\n  I raise a budget point of order pursuant to section 314(e)(1) of the \nCongressional Budget Act. I raise a point of order against the \nemergency designation provisions contained in amendment No. 3350 to \namendment No. 3395, the substitute amendment to H.R. 1, the vehicle for \nthe Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n  I appreciate the Senator's efforts but do not believe this is the \nappropriate process at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive all applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending measure.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, it is unfortunate that we couldn't sustain \nthis budget point of order because it truly is an emergency situation, \nparticularly in the West. We have seen the number of fires we have had. \nWithout the emergency designation, it does some bad things to our \nbudget next year.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment No. 3350 is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute on the Tester amendment withdrawal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nwithdrawing his amendment.\n  We are mindful of the issue of fires facing western Senators. We look \nforward to working with Senator Tester and other colleagues affected to \nreally deal with this problem in a sensible way that meets the needs of \nlocal communities and our serious budgetary constraints.\n  Mr. President, I also urge a return to regular order and ask that we \nmove our amendments as expeditiously as we can and stick to 15-minute \nvotes so we can get as much done as we can before we adjourn for lunch \nand visits to the White House. I wish to thank the minority for their \nexcellent cooperation in doing what we have done already.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3368\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3368, offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the Sandy supplemental appropriations bill \nprovides $3.5 billion in funding for new construction projects through \nthe Corps of Engineers. Part of that $3 billion is toward reducing \nfuture flood risk--not repairing present but reducing future.\n  I talked to CRS this morning after listening to my colleague from New \nYork. Over the last 25 years, the average participation rate was 35 \npercent-65 percent. No exceptions for future mitigation risks were made \nduring Katrina. It was not 100 percent. It was not 90 percent.\n  All this does is restore it back to what we have had traditionally. \nWe know projects that shouldn't get funded won't get funded when we \nhave this kind of ratio.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this amendment, if passed, would not \nallow the Sandy States or future States to protect themselves against \nfuture disasters. Now, my colleague draws a very clear line between \npresent rebuilding and protection for the future. If a dune is wiped \nout in Long Beach and they think it ought to be rebuilt at 7 feet \nrather than at 5 feet because 5 feet wouldn't be good enough, we come \nto the irrational conclusion that we will pay for the 5 feet and not \nthe 7 feet. It makes no sense.\n  Most of the cost of rebuilding is to restore, but if there is an \nextra amount needed to prevent damage from a future hurricane and it is \nthe same type of project, fine.\n\n[[Page S8465]]\n\n  We have a couple of piers that actually protected the houses in the \nRockaways, but they didn't build enough of them--not piers, jetties. \nNow, under my colleague's proposal, we could rebuild those jetties \nbecause some of them were destroyed, but we couldn't build new ones to \nprotect the other land there except at this 65-percent level.\n  I can tell my colleagues that most of New York and New Jersey are \ndotted with little localities, and the cost of these projects is so \nexpensive, if we say 35 percent, they won't get built, period. We will \nhave no protection, and we will be back here sure enough when another \nstorm occurs.\n  Furthermore, it is not true--Katrina Army Corps projects were funded \nat 100 percent. They did not call them. We didn't draw this new line \nbetween mitigation or rebuilding to protect and building for the old. \nThey were lumped together. But the overwhelming majority of Army Corps \nprojects for Katrina, as both of my colleagues from Louisiana can tell \nus, were 100 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. It doesn't mean they won't get rebuilt; it means that \nportion of the increase will be a contribution rate of 35 percent. We \nare going to do a complete restoration of what was there. The \ndifferential is and what we know from history, when this was put in, is \nit keeps projects that don't benefit from being built. The claim of the \nSenator from New York that they won't get built is just untrue. \nEverything is going to be restored, but new mitigation projects should \nhave a cost share so we don't do frivolous mitigation projects.\n  So I would insist on the yeas and nays on this amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), and the Senator from \nVirginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. DeMint) and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. \nKirk).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3370\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3370, division II, offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have no doubt there was significant \ndamage in the past of fisheries both on the west coast, Alaska, and on \nthe east coast. But a large portion of this money in this bill is not \nfor fisheries but for research. This should not be, in fact, in an \nemergency supplemental bill.\n  So all this amendment does is say that fisheries reparations inside \n50 miles of Sandy qualifies for this money, outside of 50 miles does \nnot. The regular process of going through the appropriations process, \nmaking appropriate judgments about priorities is what we need to be \ndoing, just like the point of order that was made on firefighting.\n  I would suggest we eliminate this portion of it or at least limit it \nto Sandy and not other areas. With that, I yield back the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first, I would like to bring something \nto the attention of the Senator from Oklahoma. First, the Senator got a \ndecimal point wrong. I feel amused correcting the Senator from Oklahoma \non numbers. But if we read his amendment, it is .50, which makes it \nhalf a mile rather than 50 miles. So that is 49.5 off. But before the \nSenator asks consent to correct that, whether it is half a mile or 50 \nmiles, I oppose the Senator's amendment because this amendment tries to \nsteer fisheries disaster funding for communities only affected by \nciting the Stafford Act.\n  Limiting it to half a mile or 50 miles, fish swim big distances, as \ndo crabs, as do lobsters, and particularly those big king crabs. Under \nthe Senator's amendment, by talking about the Stafford Act, it actually \nhas no bearing on fisheries.\n  Fisheries disasters are declared by the Secretary of Commerce \naccording to the Federal fisheries and commerce laws at the request of \nGovernors. Fisheries disasters are unanticipated. Under this amendment, \nall federally declared disaster areas would miss out on much needed \nfinancial help. I urge a ``no'' vote on the Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. For the information of all Senators, we are going to have \ntwo votes before we break for our caucuses--the Republicans have a \ncaucus, we have one. So we have two votes before lunch. Then at 2 \no'clock we will have another vote. If the meetings run over a little \nbit, that will give people 15 minutes to get here to vote.\n  Then Senator McConnell and I are both going to be indisposed from 3 \no'clock to 4 o'clock. So we will have a little brief time there. Then \nwe will finish the bill, we hope, after that.\n  The order says we are coming back at 2:15. I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be modified so we come back at 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If I might discuss with the leader and get the consent \nof the minority, the Senator from Oklahoma has a series of amendments. \nI wonder if we could debate the next amendment now, which is the \nFeinstein amendment, and then have two stacked votes or if the Senator \njust wants to follow regular order.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have no objection.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the vote on Coburn No. \n3372 be laid aside, that the Senator be allowed to speak on amendment \nNo. 3371, and then following that, we dispose of the Senator's \namendment and we have two votes at the same time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. So the Senator from Oklahoma is going to debate the second \namendment and then we will have two stacked votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nminutes of debate on amendment No. 3371.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, before we go to the second amendment--I \nask unanimous consent--I am looking at my transcription of this \namendment. It says 50 miles. So if, in fact, what is at the desk does \nnot say 50 miles, I ask unanimous consent to amend the amendment so it \nwould read 50 miles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I object.\n  Mr. COBURN. All right. Amendment No. 3371.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I just want to say to the Senator from \nOklahoma, there does seem to be a dispute\n\n[[Page S8466]]\n\nin the printing. But whatever it is, we are going to get it straight. \nWe are going to work with the Senator and function with maximum \ncourtesy here. If we could know whether we are taking about half a mile \nor 50 miles--\n  Mr. President, I ask the clerk to clarify, is it half a mile or 50 \nmiles?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises it is 50 miles.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. To the Senator from Oklahoma, I apologize. I am sorry \nfor the delay. We will move forward to further debate on the second \namendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, fishing is more than just a profession in \nNew England. Fishing is a culture and a way of life. In recent years, \nMaine's fishermen and fishing communities have been struggling to \nsurvive among Federal regulations that have limited fishing \nopportunities.\n  On September 13, 2012, the acting Secretary of Commerce declared a \nFederal fisheries disaster for Maine, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New \nHampshire, New York, and Connecticut because of the significant \nprojected reductions in the total allowable catch for critical \ngroundfish stocks.\n  The expected and considerable catch limit reductions have been \ntriggered by recently updated stock assessments that show that several \nkey groundfish populations are significantly below the levels necessary \nto meet the rebuilding deadlines that are mandated by Federal law.\n  The projected reductions, which may be as high as 73 percent, will \ncome despite strict adherence to new and rigorous management practices \nby fishermen.\n  There are approximately 45 Maine-based vessels actively fishing with \nFederal groundfish permits. Last year, more than 5 million pounds of \ngroundfish, with a dockside value approaching $5.8 million, were landed \nin Maine.\n  Given the magnitude of the projected cuts, the effect on these Maine \nvessels and vessels of all sizes and gear types throughout the region \nwill be profound. It will add to the already considerable economic \nburdens that fishing communities are facing. Federal assistance is \nnecessary to support these fishermen and the fishing related businesses \nin our coastal communities.\n  The requested funding will be used to provide both immediate economic \nrelief to the region's struggling groundfish industry, and to make \ntargeted investments that will allow the fleet to survive and become \nmore sustainable in the years ahead.\n  These funds could also be productively used to fully cover the costs \nof at-sea monitoring and to address long term overcapacity in the \nfishing industry. This is critical to rebuilding fish stocks and \npreserving a thriving fishing industry well into the future.\n  Slow recovery and declining fish stocks will continue to have a \nnegative impact on commercial fishing, harming local communities and \neconomies. Federal disaster assistance is vital to the long term \nsuccess and short term survival of fishing communities throughout the \nregion.\n  It is important to note that the funding provided in the bill is to \nrespond to fishery disasters declared by the acting Commerce Secretary \nin 2012 under the authority provided by the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries \nConservation and Management Act and the Interjurisdictional Fisheries \nAct. This is authorized funding in response to declared disasters.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3371\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, amendment No. 3371 is a good government \nhouse cleaning for FEMA. FEMA determines disasters based on a \ndeclaration process that is based on a per capita income--or per capita \ndamage indicator. It has not been revised to account for the effects of \ninflation. Because we have not revised it, the smaller States actually \nget more benefit from FEMA than the larger States.\n  Oklahoma has had 25 disaster declarations in the last 6 years, more \nthan any other State. So what I am actually proposing will not help my \nState; it will actually hurt my State. But it is improper for us to \ncontinue to use an outmoded number when, in fact, a small State has the \nsame amount of damage as a large State, but the per capita indicator \nwould say it does not meet the requirements.\n  All I am requesting is that FEMA, over the next 4 years, update this. \nIt does not have any application until 2016. It gives them time to \nupdate it. Then, through good government, we have a better reflection \nof when we declare a disaster and when we do not as far as the per \ncapita indicator would tell us.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nBut I wish to say the Senator from Oklahoma raises a very good point. \nBut this comes under the jurisdiction of the committee that he is \nactually the ranking member on, with the new chairman, Senator Tom \nCarper, to be done in an authorizing action, not on this particular \nbill.\n  It does need some updating. But the other point that needs to be \nlooked at--I think the Senator from Oklahoma will agree with me because \nthe Federal Government cannot do everything--is what role the States \nshould play in helping counties, particularly rural counties such as \nwhat happened in Joplin, MO, such as what has happened in Oklahoma, \nsuch as what has happened in Tennessee. What should States do to help \nthese more rural counties that get hurt?\n  I agree with the Senator in the need for an update. This is not the \ntime to do it, however. I urge a ``no'' vote on his amendment and turn \nit over to the authorizing committee, of which he is a member, to \nprovide for appropriate oversight in that venue.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to recapture 15 seconds of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this bill is full of authorizations--I \nmean, literally, full of authorizations. This is something I have \nstudied and looked at. I have been looking at FEMA for 8 years. We \nshould not wait to do this. Let's do it now. It is common sense. It \ndoes not harm anybody. It actually makes us better at what we are \ntrying to do with Federal emergency management.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator is correct that this bill is full of \nreforms that he and I and others have worked on. But every one of these \nreforms has been agreed to on both sides of the aisle; this has not. \nThe Senator could continue to work with us and find a way forward.\n  I would urge a ``no'' vote on this now. I promise we will give him \nits full attention and get this taken care of but at a later date.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate reconvenes at 2 p.m., we debate the next two Coburn amendments \nin order and that upon the use or yielding back of time on those \namendments, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Coburn \namendments, with all provisions of the previous order remaining in \neffect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, simply what this means is this--and I am \nreally asking for Senators to pay attention because they are very \nkeenly interested in the schedule. I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, for working on the expeditious \ndisposition of our amendments.\n  Senators should be aware that after 2 p.m., they should be in the \nChamber to vote on these amendments. These are 10-minute votes, and we \ndo not intend to hold the votes beyond the time. The leadership on both \nsides of the aisle will be going to the White House to discuss the \nreally critical, crucial matters before the Nation. They must go to the \nWhite House, but they will want to exercise their vote. So let's \ncooperate with the leadership.\n  At 2 o'clock, Senator Coburn will make his debate. We will have an \norderly, crisp rebuttal. Then we will go right to those votes, and then \nthe leadership will be able to leave for the White House. Remember, we \nhave to have that first vote done in a timely way so that both Senator \nReid and Senator McConnell can leave to have the designated meeting \nwith President Obama.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me join with the Senator from \nMaryland in commending all Senators for the expeditious way we have \nbeen able to move this bill but in particular the chairwoman herself, \nwho has provided strong leadership, capable leadership, and fairness, a \nsense of fairness for all Senators. I thank her for the honor of \nserving with her on this committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/28/senate-section/article/S8467-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be up \nto 8 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the votes in relation \nto amendments Nos. 3382 and 3383 offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, \nMr. Coburn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3382\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, amendment No. 3382 would require the use \nof competition for all Federal contracts awarded after the date of the \nenactment of this act for disaster assistance. It would also require \nthe Federal agencies to review and recompete no-bid contracts that had \nbeen awarded prior to it. There is no penalty if it is a no-bid \ncontract, but as that goes forward, additional payments on that would \nhave to come in to review. All this is, is about good government and \ngetting value for the dollars we are going to spend.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I \nguess I have 2 minutes for that since it is 4 minutes equally divided \nbetween the amendments. I know my colleague from Maryland will debate \nthe other amendment.\n  I urge a strong ``no'' vote on this amendment. This would require a \nhuge amount of time and bureaucratic redtape at a time of emergency \nbetween disaster victims and the Federal assistance they deserve.\n  Competitive bidding is generally a good thing. It can save on costs \nas well as provide transparency and fraud prevention. It is important \nthat Federal disaster assistance not be used as a slush fund for crony \ncontracts.\n  Folks, we are dealing with an emergency. In most States, it takes 90 \ndays or more. It can take 3 to 6 months. We have people who desperately \nneed help, and we would slow the process down to a fare-thee-well if we \nhad to invoke the same competitive bidding practice we invoke for other \ncontracts that are not under emergency.\n  In fact, this is sort of catch-22. Many of our Republican colleagues \nsay the money is spent out too slowly, and then they want to put more \nlevels of redtape and bureaucracy slowdown. What if the contract is \nchallenged in court? Businesses would lay fallow, homes will not be \nbuilt, and it would leave shorelines unprotected and naked.\n  Generally, I have been a supporter of competitive bidding, but as the \nScripture says: There is a time and a place for everything. When we are \ndealing with many aspects of an emergency, that should not happen.\n  My colleague on the other side, for whom I have great respect, is a \ntrue gentleman. He does what he believes and says what he believes. He \nvotes against interests that might affect his own State when he does \nit. In this case, he has not made any exceptions, and that makes no \nsense. This will hurt people and hurt them badly. In many instances, \nthis will end up costing us more.\n  Many competitively bid contracts--we have all been through this--end \nup in court and take years. Years during an emergency? I don't believe \nwe should start that as a new precedent. I\n\n[[Page S8468]]\n\nwould be happy to work with my colleague and refine the competitive \nbidding law to where it could be used appropriately, but this is a \nbroad brush.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, there is no reason to take additional \ntime. The fact is right now with FEMA, they have prebid contracts. In \nNew Jersey, they didn't take the lowest competitive bid contract on the \ndebris removal. We are going to spend about 20 percent, 25 percent more \nbecause the Federal Government is paying for it.\n  The vast majority of the money in this bill is not going to be \ncontracted out initially. As a matter of fact, only $9 billion is going \nto go out right way and that is in terms of flood insurance. The rest \nof it is coming from the FEMA funds and the DRF funds. None of those \nare competitive bid contracts, and it will not have any impact on \nhousing, home flood insurance or any of those other areas. Doing it \nright and getting value for our money is important, especially now that \nwe face the difficult fiscal times that are in front of us.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to move to the next amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, let's go with the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered on amendment No. 3382.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3383\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I understand that amendment No. 3383 is \nnow in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. There is a lot of work in this bill for the Corps of \nEngineers, and they are going to have a lot of work to do in the \nremediation and mitigation that is associated with Hurricane Sandy. \nHowever, in this bill is a provision which says that whatever the Corps \ndecides to approve, they give a blanket authorization. This means if, \nin fact, the Corps doesn't do what is in the best interests for New \nJersey or New York, they get to make the decision. The appropriators \nand authorizing committee don't get to decide; the Corps makes the \ndecision.\n  The one organization that has a problem with priorities in this \ncountry today is the Corps of Engineers. For us to blanket whatever \nthey say as a priority versus having government, committee, and \nappropriator oversight by giving this blanket waiver is to take away \nour powers to correct them. All this does is say it is not \nautomatically authorized and we will have plenty of time. All these are \nmitigation projects. They should all be authorized and approved by the \ncommittee of jurisdiction as they go forward. Rather than a blanket \napproval, all they have to do is come to Congress and say: Give us \napproval.\n  We are setting a terrible precedent. What this says is, in the \nfuture, we are going to let the Corps decide what is important rather \nthan the Governors, the State legislators or the Congress.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I oppose Coburn amendment No. 3383 \nstriking the provisions in the underlying bill.\n  We did a voice vote this morning on Feinstein amendment No. 4421 that \nfixes the problem. I understand the concerns the Senator has.\n  I yield time to the Senator from California to explain how she fixed \nthe amendment and why we should defeat the Coburn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, one of the things I have learned from \nthe Energy and Water Subcommittee, which is the committee that handles \nappropriations for the Army Corps of Engineers, is how difficult it is \nto get projects started, funded, and constructed. I am one--\nparticularly in view of storms, earthquakes, floods, and damages--who \nbelieves we also need to do the mitigation, because if it happens once, \nthere is a heavy likelihood it could happen again. So I rise in \nopposition to this amendment.\n  The provision the Senator from Oklahoma proposes would essentially \ntake a Corps project that has been authorized and a study is being \ndone. Once the study has concluded and it is cost-effective, the Corps \nproceeds to construction. With respect to mitigation, what this \namendment does is--as I understand it--remove that authorization.\n  I can understand how the language before was overly broad. What \nSenator Boxer and I did in an earlier amendment was narrow that \nlanguage, and we have addressed the shortcoming of the provision by \nstriking it with an earlier amendment. We took amendment No. 3421 and \nreplaced it with new text. This new text no longer authorizes an \nundefined set of projects; rather, it directs funding to be utilized to \nconstruct projects in areas that suffered direct inundation impact from \nHurricanes Sandy and Isaac. It provides a defined scope for the work \nthe Corps can construct with the funds provided. It requires the \nprojects to be undertaken must be cost-effective, technically feasible, \nand environmentally acceptable.\n  I hope my friend would agree that should be the goal of all Corps \nprojects we fund. Voting for his amendment, as I understand it, would \nundo the defined requirements and scope for the projects we previously \nvoted for.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3383 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I think the Senator from California has a \ngreat solution to the problem. I was not aware of that being accepted.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3382\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3382.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, when Hurricane Sandy struck the Northeast, \nhundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people were without power. \nWe all saw the video footage. We saw the terrible trauma, and people \nare still trying to dig out from underneath the debris of Hurricane \nSandy.\n  During that period of time, hundreds of workers drove up from the \nSouth wanting to help. These workers were nonunionized, and they were \nturned away. This was a sad day for our country that nonunion workers \nwere not allowed to participate in the cleanup and were asked to join a \nunion before they would be accepted as workers.\n  I think it is a mistake to politicize things such as this, \nparticularly in a time of an emergency. So what I have asked for and \nwhat my amendment would do is allow an exemption to Davis-Bacon.\n  Davis-Bacon is a Federal law that requires that we not have \ncompetitive bidding on Federal projects. What happens is on Federal \nprojects the wages are fixed at a union scale wage and there is not a \ncompetitive bidding for wages.\n  So what I have asked is that we suspend that and say, in order to get \nbetter use of the money, in order to advance the money by billions of \ndollars and do more with the money--and this is an enormous amount of \nmoney, running into the billions of dollars--in order to get better use \nof our money, to suspend Davis-Bacon, and we would basically be \nallowing competitive bidding on wages.\n  This has been done before. President Nixon and both President Bushes \ndid this. During Katrina, we suspended Davis-Bacon because it was an \nemergency. We wanted to make the best use of our Nation's dollars.\n  This amendment would suspend Davis-Bacon for this emergency. It is \nestimated it might save as much as 22 percent of the cost.\n  We are talking about billions of dollars. Mr. President, $60 billion \nis being requested for this cleanup. Where is the money going to come \nfrom? You have heard we have an enormous debt--$16 trillion--in our \ncountry. We have over $1 trillion in debt this year. We print up the \nmoney, but that simply steals from your savings and steals from your \ncurrent currency. We can tax you or borrow more. But we owe $16 \ntrillion already.\n  What I am asking is why don't we try to make good use of the money \nthat is going toward this disaster, allow money to go further? That is \nsimply by allowing competitive bidding on wages.\n\n[[Page S8470]]\n\n  Currently, there is no competitive bidding on wages. My amendment \nwould allow for this. I urge my colleagues to stand with taxpayers--to \nstand with taxpayers against special interests, against political and \npartisan purposes--and for the sake of an emergency to say: We are \ngoing to be frugal with the dollars spent. We are not going to be \nextravagant. We are not going to reward certain special interests that \nare very involved in the political process.\n  We are going to say we are going to use the money wisely, we are \ngoing to allow competitive bidding on wages. So I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this temporary and specific suspension of Davis-Bacon for \nemergency funds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I guess we have 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment offered by my friend from Kentucky. As we work to rebuild \nthese communities in the east coast from Superstorm Sandy, we need \npolicies in place that make these communities stronger. Davis-Bacon is \na critical part of that effort because it ensures that the people who \nare doing the work to rebuild our roads, schools, and bridges in these \ncities and towns are paid a fair wage. Again, the Davis-Bacon Act \nensures that workers on taxpayer-funded projects are paid locally \nprevailing wages--locally prevailing wages. These protections ensure \nthat the substantial influx of Federal dollars for reconstruction work \nafter a disaster will help prevent a race to the bottom for workers and \nnot contribute to the problem.\n  After a disaster such as this, people are disrupted, and people are \nout of work. So we have a lot of fly-by-night operators who flock to \nthese areas and abuse the workers. For example, we saw this after \nHurricane Katrina. According to a 2006 study, 47 percent of workers in \nNew Orleans reported not receiving all of the pay they were entitled to \nunder law. The same report indicated that 55 percent of workers did not \nreceive overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week.\n  Now, again, my friend from Kentucky says this could save up to 22 \npercent of the money we are going to put out in Federal taxpayer \ndollars to help recovery efforts. Well, how can that possibly be? Labor \ncosts are typically only 25 to 30 percent of the total cost of public \nworks projects. So there's no way we could save 22% by repealing Davis-\nBacon, we'd have to pay people next to nothing. That just doesn't make \nsense.\n  So, again, Davis-Bacon has been in law a long time to help prevent \nthe kinds of abuses we saw after Katrina from happening again because \nit ensures that workers will be paid locally prevailing wages--not \nnecessarily union-type wages but locally prevailing wages. It helps \nensure that responsible contractors--responsible contractors, \ncontractors who abide by wage and hour and safety and health laws--will \nwin the bids to perform federally funded work. We do not want this race \nto the bottom where you get some fly-by-night operator who does shoddy \nwork. Oh, but it is cheap. When we buy into that philosophy we might \nsave money now, but we lose a lot of money later on.\n  We keep hearing from our friends on the other side that this is going \nto save money. That is just not true. Numerous studies confirm that \nprevailing wage laws--Davis-Bacon--do not raise construction costs and \nactually lower the taxpayer bill on these projects. A study of nine \nStates found that prevailing wages led to costs of building \nconstruction that were on average $6 dollars to $35 per square foot \nless than without prevailing wages. Similarly, a 2004 study analyzing \nFederal highway wage data found that better wages led to an average \nsavings of $30,000 to $34,000 per mile of highway construction. Better \nwages also led to higher productivity. Higher wage States require 32 to \n35 percent fewer labor hours to complete the same work than lower wage \nStates. Why is that? Because, as one contractor I know in Iowa says, he \nalways hires people to do work under Davis-Bacon because he knows he \ngets quality work, he gets high productivity, the work is done right \nthe first time and it does not have to be done over. So these are the \nresponsible contractors we want to do this kind of work because in the \nlong run, it saves us all a lot of money and we get better work done.\n  I might also add parenthetically that Davis-Bacon--Senator Davis and \nRepresentative Bacon, the authors of this law, were both Republicans. \nThey wanted to ensure that large Federal contractors would not drive \ndown the price of labor, so they passed a law saying that workers on \nFederal Government projects should earn at least the typical local \nwages. That is what it is--typical local wages. That is all the Davis-\nBacon Act does. It is not a giveaway to unions or the workers they \nrepresent; it is just a commonsense policy that helps workers and \ncommunities recover and makes sure taxpayers get the best bang for \ntheir buck.\n  The workers affected by Hurricane Sandy are not just rebuilding \nbusinesses, houses, schools, and roads, they are rebuilding entire \ncommunities and neighborhoods. The foundation for communities is good \njobs with fair wages. The Davis-Bacon Act is a critical part in helping \ncommunities across the east coast recover.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Paul amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment No. 3410, \nwhich would take the spending for Sandy relief and spend only 1 year at \na time and would offset that spending with spending cuts. Now, you ask, \nwhy would we want to do that? Well, if you have been watching Congress \nin recent years, you might understand that we are not very good with \nmoney up here. Each year we are spending $1 trillion that we do not \nhave. To me, there is absolutely no objective evidence that we are very \ngood with money up here, so you do not want to give Congress 3 years' \nworth of spending authority on Hurricane Sandy. Why don't we do it 1 \nyear at a time and make sure there is correct oversight and make sure \nthe money is not being wasted, make sure the money is not being abused.\n  I will give a couple of examples of what is in the current bill. We \nhave money for Alaskan fisheries in the Hurricane Sandy bill. They \ntried earlier today to stuff money in here for a country by the name of \nPalau in the western part of the Pacific. Now, I thought this was about \nemergency relief for Hurricane Sandy, which hit the northeast coast. \nWhat does that have to do with sending money to the far reaches of the \nEarth, including sending money to work on Alaskan fisheries? If you \nwant to give money to Alaskan fisheries, have a bill on the floor about \nAlaskan fisheries, but do not pretend that we are going to stuff it in \nsome emergency bill for the Northeast.\n  So what I have asked is, let's just spend what you are going to spend \nnext year. CBO says there is going to be $9 billion spent next year. \nThat is what I allocate. I take the $9 billion from places where we are \nwasting it. I think we are wasting it by sending it overseas. I am not \nparticularly happy about sending money to countries that are burning \nour flag and chanting ``death to America.'' I think it is an outrage.\n  The President has said: Well, we need to quit doing nation building \noverseas and start doing it at home. But where are the actions that \nsupport his words? I agree completely--we need to quit doing nation \nbuilding overseas when we are running a trillion-dollar deficit here, \nbut we can't just say we are going to continue to print the money or \nborrow the money or simply raise taxes. There is not enough for all of \nthis spending. What you need to do so is say: Some of the spending is \nwasteful, and we should not do it.\n\n  I personally think we should not be sending billions of dollars to \ndictators who oppress their people, who burn our flag, who will not \nprotect our embassies. I think it is an absolute mistake. You can go \nthrough a list of 30 or 40 years of foreign aid and see dictators who \nhave personally profited and stolen our money. We have bridges and \nroads crumbling in our country. We have infrastructure that was damaged \nby Hurricane Sandy. They simply want to print more money and borrow it.\n  People will stand and say: Oh, we have never offset emergency \nfunding. Well, maybe that is why we have a $16 trillion deficit--\nbecause no one wants\n\n[[Page S8471]]\n\nto cut any spending around here. If you want to help those affected by \nHurricane Sandy, do it, but do it by taking the money from someplace \nwhere we are wasting it.\n  What my bill says is that we will spend next year's $9 billion, which \nis what they have asked for for the next year, and we will offset it by \ntaking $9 billion out of the foreign aid fund.\n  Now, usually when we bring this up here, someone will trod on down \nand say: Oh, but this will affect Israel. This has nothing to do with \nIsrael, will not affect any money given to Israel. There will be money \nleft in the foreign aid fund. It has always been my purpose that we \nstart by taking the money from countries that hate us, countries that \nare burning our flag. I have not seen anyone in Israel burning the \nAmerican flag, but I have seen it happening in about 10 other countries \nthat receive money, that actually receive more than Israel. So what I \nwould say is let's not trot out canards about Israel; let's make it \nabout what it is. The Mubarak family in Egypt got $60 billion. The \ncountry got $60 billion while the Mubarak family themselves stole \nprobably half of it. They are one of the richest families in the world. \nThe kids are some of the richest people in the world because they stole \nyour money. This has happened repeatedly. It has happened throughout \nthe African Continent. It has happened around the world, that your \nmoney is sent overseas. Just in Iraq and Afghanistan during the wars, \nwe built $6 billion worth of roads. Meanwhile, we have problems here. I \nhave two bridges in my State that I do not have the money to repair \nbecause we are too busy repairing some other country's roads.\n  There are people in this body--the majority of them here--who think: \nOh, let's keep spending this money. And the majority of the American \npeople do not think it is a good idea. I hope they will wake up and \ncall their Senators and their Congressmen and say: This is absurd. It \nmust end.\n  So this is a very simple amendment. Spend 1 year on the emergency \nfund, $9 billion, and offset it by cutting foreign aid overseas. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to respond and to inform my \ncolleagues about what would happen if this amendment were adopted by \nthe body. No. 1, the foreign aid budget is less than 1 percent of the \ntotal Federal budget. It is about $52 to $53 billion. It has been \nreduced. A lot of things Senator Paul said about money being wasted \nwere very much true in the past.\n  President Bush looked at foreign assistance in a different way to \ncome up with the Millennium Challenge Corporation. We are now trying to \nmake sure our dollars go to make us safer, to help people who are truly \nin need, and to make sure we have a presence in the world for which I \nthink there would be no substitute. It cuts 67 percent of the foreign \naid budget in three titles: USAID--those of you who have been to \nAfghanistan and other places, USAID projects are designed to make sure \nthat once the military is withdrawn from that area, that we can hold.\n  Those of you who are tired of war, like all of us, I just want to go \nback to ``Charlie Wilson's War.'' The last scene in the movie was Mr. \nWilson wanted $1 million to build some schoolhouses in Afghanistan, and \nthe reply was: Man, I have got broken schools in my State and my \ndistrict. And that is true in South Carolina, that is true in Kentucky, \nand it is true in West Virginia. But we had no soldiers in Afghanistan \nand no aid to Afghanistan during the Taliban reign. That model did not \nwork.\n  If you think you can withdraw from the world and if you think America \nhas no leadership role, then this is a good amendment. If you think the \nbest thing America can do is invest in aid programs that help us as a \nNation to be safer, then I would vote no for this amendment.\n  President Bush--one of his great legacies is that he invested in AIDS \nand malaria programs in Africa that saved a whole generation of African \nchildren. The Chinese are all over Africa trying to buy up the \ncontinent, and radical Islam is moving forward. What a time for America \nto tell the African people: No longer will we help you--because if this \namendment is passed, it will devastate the account we have in Africa. \nWe have almost no troops. The only thing we have to combat radical \nIslam and Chinese influence is our aid programs that will create a lot \nof jobs here in America.\n  Jordan--there are 250,000 Syrian refugees flooding into Jordan. The \nrefugee account is being overwhelmed. If you care at all about the King \nof Jordan and stability in Jordan, for God's sake, vote against this \namendment because it will devastate the money we set aside to deal with \nthe refugee problem from the war in Syria.\n  As to Israel, the third title that is affected is the \ncounternarcotics military assistance program, foreign military \nfinancing. We have contacted the Department of State and the Department \nof Defense. They told us: If you cut this account by 67 percent, it is \ngoing to put pressure on defense accounts. They are already under the \nthreat of sequestration. It will affect the ability of our Nation to \nhelp Israel with the F-35 aircraft, armored vehicles, and protective \nsystems for other vehicles.\n  If you think, as I do, that the world is a very dangerous place and \nit is better for America to lead than to come home and play like the \nworld is not a dangerous place, vote against this amendment. It is $9 \nbillion. It is 67 percent of the three accounts I have just described. \nAsk yourself, as a Member of the Senate, is now the time to tell the \nKing of Jordan and the people of Jordan: We cannot help you with \nrefugees overflowing into your country.\n  Because if the King goes, what happens next? Is now the time to send \nto the people of Israel a signal that we are going to reduce military \nassistance to their struggling nation, surrounded by a lot of \nadversaries? Is now the time to tell the people of Africa: America will \nbe leaving; enjoy the Chinese presence.\n  Every time America tries to play the game that what happens in other \nplaces doesn't affect us, we pay a heavy price.\n  This meant 9/11 was the result of a place called Afghanistan falling \ninto the hands of the most vicious people on the planet, and we sat on \nthe sidelines. It wasn't long before the Taliban invited bin Laden in \nas their honored guest, and the rest is history.\n  There are at least six countries I can name in Africa today that, if \nwe abandon Africa, are going to become the next places that attack us. \nI can tell you right now that if we abandon the King of Jordan, he will \nfall. You will wake up one day, and you will say, was that $9 billion \nworth all of what I have just described?\n  I wish we could come home. I wish we never had to send a dollar \noutside the State of South Carolina. But I promise you this: If we stop \nleading this world and we stop having a presence where others show up, \nwe will pay a heavy price.\n  This amendment guts to their core three essential accounts that are \nvery important to our national security and to who we are as Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Don't create one disaster in trying to solve another. \nPlease vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, is there any time remaining in \nopposition to the Paul amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time remains for debate on the Paul \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would like to thank the Senator from South Carolina \nfor his remarks. He summarizes what we on both sides of the aisle would \nsay about this compelling national security interest.\n  I also wish to bring to my colleagues' attention--the Senator from \nKentucky reduces the bill from $60 billion to $9 billion. Not only is \nit a disaster for our foreign aid, but it is a disaster for America. \nRemember, disaster assistance is aid to American people. So cutting out \n$51 billion and then poking in the eye of treasured allies that you are \nreducing by $50 billion--that is aid to America.\n  Hey, I am for aid to America, and that is why spending and working \nwith\n\n[[Page S8472]]\n\ntreasured allies, their security, and also stamping out things such as \nmalaria and blindness are the things for which we are well known.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, what is the regular order here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The regular order is the Paul \namendment on the debate time, amendment No. 3410.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Is there any time remaining for the Paul amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time remains for debate on the Paul \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. So we have concluded Paul amendment No. 3410.\n  Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation in time on Paul \namendment No. 3376, Davis-Bacon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on that amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, with all time having expired, I believe \nthe order requires that these amendments then be set aside to be part \nof a set of stacked votes at 4 o'clock; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Don't we now proceed to the McCain amendment under the \nconsent agreement, for debate? It was to be Senator McCain or Senator \nLee?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Either Senator McCain or Senator Lee may be \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I note the prompt appearance of Senator \nLee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3373, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we call up \namendment No. 3373, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from UTAH [Mr. Lee] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3373, as modified.\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       After section 1105, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SPECIAL RULES FOR USE OF RETIREMENT FUNDS IN \n                   CONNECTION WITH FEDERALLY DECLARED DISASTERS.\n\n       (a) Tax-favored Withdrawals From Retirement Plans.--\n       (1) In

The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is important that we begin the long \noverdue process of reforming the way the Federal Government responds to \ncatastrophic disasters.\n  Too often Federal disaster relief has been reactive, bureaucratic, \narbitrary, and billions of dollars are spent. Sometimes that happens \nwith little or no accountability. Resources go unused, goals are not \nmet, and redtape delays recovery. In the end, it seems Washington \nfocuses sometimes solely on the price tag rather than on the people we \nare trying to help.\n  The current model assumes that politicians and bureaucrats in \nWashington are best suited to decide where, when, and how best to \nallocate resources during an emergency, but common sense and decades of \nexperience tell us otherwise. It is the people on the ground--local \nofficials and emergency responders, of course, but also individuals, \nfamilies, and voluntary organizations--who are best equipped to help \ncommunities respond and recover from disasters.\n  As I looked into these issues, it became clear to me that even as the \nFederal Government has distributed billions for recovery with the right \nhand, regulations and bureaucracy have choked the recovery process with \nthe left hand. Our recovery policy needs to be both more flexible and \nmore consistent. Flood victims on the east coast deal with the same \nissues as flood victims in the gulf. Yet they are often faced with \ndifferent rules and requirements. Federal policy should be clarified so \nthat local officials and private citizens understand the process before \na disaster occurs rather than having to deal with it and figure it out \nafter the fact.\n  My amendment would create permanent, substantive regulatory reforms \nto assist victims of all disasters. It would create no new Federal \nprogram or taxpayer burden. It would instead remove redtape and provide \ntemporary but immediate regulatory relief for disaster victims and \nrelief volunteers. It would make it easier for a family to access \nsavings to begin immediate recovery. It would temporarily waive certain \nregulatory burdens for people providing essential services after a \ndisaster. It would expedite shipping to ensure we can get critical \nmaterials to areas affected by a disaster. Most importantly, my \namendment would make these reforms automatic so that communities could \nbegin rebuilding immediately and without having to wait for Washington, \nDC, to act. These are important and I believe overdue reforms, and they \nrepresent a good first step toward improving our approach to disaster \nrelief.\n  I am pleased with the positive response this proposal has received so \nfar, although I understand that some of my colleagues have concerns \nthat a few of these substantive changes merit additional discussion and \nconsideration.\n  I believe these reforms ought to be permanent fixtures of Federal \nemergency response policy, and ideally they should be part of a more \ncomprehensive package to overhaul how we respond to Federal disasters.\n  I have spoken with my good friend Senator Hatch, the ranking member \nof the Finance Committee--the committee in which many of these reforms \nwill and should properly be debated. He has expressed an interest in \nworking with me on these reforms in the new Congress.\n  I look forward to and encourage all of my colleagues to join me in a \nserious and meaningful dialog about these critical issues.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3373, as Modified, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, with that understanding, I withdraw my amendment \nbecause I am confident that a broader discussion will be good for the \ncountry and will result in reforms that will eliminate waste, \nfacilitate quicker recovery, and deliver assistance to Americans most \nseverely affected by disasters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Utah is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the Senator withdrawing his amendment. Had \nhe not, I would have had to oppose it. It basically waives the Davis-\nBacon requirements instruction for the Sandy rehabilitation projects. \nIt is a bad idea, and we shouldn't have been on that road.\n  Second, it changes the Code with respect to giving rules and also \nwith respect to penalties with respect to withdrawals from IRAs. I \ndon't think that is a good idea.\n  More importantly, the fancy term is, it makes this bill blue-slipped; \nthat is, because it is a revenue provision the Senator is offering and \nit did not originate in the other body, the other body would say: I am \nsorry, under the Constitution, revenue bills have to begin in the other \nbody--in the House. This didn't begin over there. It began here, this \nprovision, and so they would not even take up the bill.\n  For that reason, I am glad the Senator withdrew his amendment, \nbecause it would cause unnecessary problems for people who deserve a \nlot of help in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, might I inquire of the Chair or the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, who is managing this bill, whether I might \nspeak on a subject? Now, I don't want to speak out of turn, but I was \ngoing to make a brief statement with respect to the fiscal cliff and \nurging a resolution, showing with the chart I have here that we are not \nthat far apart, but I don't want to get in the way here. Given the \nmanagers' preference in how they manage the bill, I defer to the \nmanagers because it is their bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If the Senator will withhold, the next amendment under \nour agreement was Senator McCain. He will be here in 5 minutes, so the \nSenator may proceed.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will speak within that period of time. Thank you very \nmuch, and I thank both Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, President Kennedy once said:\n\n       There are risks and costs to action, but they are far less \n     than the long-range risks of comfortable inaction.\n\n  Here we are on December 28, just 3 days from what some have termed \nthe ``fiscal cliff''--trillions of dollars in automatic tax increases, \nacross-the-board spending cuts, including cuts in Medicare payments, \nunemployment benefits, and more.\n  I rise today to call on the Congress and the President to take \nimmediate action to resolve the year-end fiscal challenges. We can do \nit. We are very\n\n[[Page S8475]]\n\nclose together. The proposals are not that far part.\n  I make this call on behalf of the people I work for in Montana. My \nbosses have given me clear marching orders, three simple words: Get it \ndone. I believe their neighbors all across the country agree. It is \nabout time we listened.\n  In all the hype and the rhetoric here on Capitol Hill, many have lost \nsight of our fundamental duty to serve the American people. It is time \nto put politics aside and remember what is at stake for working \nfamilies, farmers, and small business owners across our country.\n  If Congress fails to act by the New Year's deadline, nearly every \nAmerican will be hit with a tax hike, including 400,000 Montana \nfamilies. That is approximately $2,000 out of the pockets of America's \nworking families. About 125 million American workers will see smaller \npaychecks as a result of higher payroll taxes.\n  More than 2 million Americans will lose the Federal unemployment \ninsurance that helps keep a roof over their heads while they look for \nwork.\n  About 98,000 Montana parents will see a tax hike of $1,000 if they \nloose the child tax credit, and thousands more will be hit by the loss \nof the earned-income and American opportunity tax credits.\n  As many as 28 million Americans and 52,000 working Montanans will be \nforced to pay the alternative minimum tax.\n  Across-the-board mandatory spending cuts mean thousands of Federal \nemployees will lose the jobs that put food on the tables for their \nfamilies. Agencies in charge of keeping America safe, such as the FBI, \nBorder Patrol, Department of Defense, and others, will be short-\nstaffed.\n  Families may lose farms and ranches that have been passed down for \ngenerations because of the estate tax hike. These aren't wealthy \naristocrats. They are honest, hard-working people who get dirt under \ntheir nails every day to put food on their tables. All they want in \nreturn is to pass the land they work on, on to their kids and on to \ntheir grandkids. These are not just numbers on a page. These are \npeople. We work for them. They are our employers.\n  Montana families sit down together at their kitchen tables every \nmonth and make tough choices to make ends meet. They deserve a Congress \nthat could do the same.\n  Unfortunately, the list of last-minute legislation doesn't stop with \nthe fiscal cliff. Our rural economies will take a big hit if the House \nfails to pass a farm bill. Make no mistake, the farm bill is a jobs \nbill. Agriculture supports 60 million jobs nationwide. In Montana, one \nin five jobs is tied to agriculture, and the Senate farm bill supports \nthose jobs while also cutting spending by $23 billion. This bill is \npart of a responsible solution.\n  There is absolutely no excuse for inaction. I call on the House to \nbring the Senate farm bill up for a vote immediately. Our farmers and \nranchers break their backs to put food on their tables every day. At \nleast they deserve an honest, fair, up-or-down vote on their jobs bill.\n  Failure to reach agreement on these critical year-end issues will \ncertainly cause market volatility and shock the greater economy. \nExperts predict that failure to reach agreement on the fiscal cliff \nwill cause the economy to contract in the year 2013 by one-half \npercent, likely causing unemployment to climb to 9.1 percent, pushing \nour Nation back into recession.\n  But it doesn't have to be this way. It is only because of \nstubbornness and stagnation on both sides of the aisle that we find \nourselves facing this great challenge at the eleventh hour. The blame \ngame has shifted into full gear, but there will be no winners if both \nsides continue to play this game of chicken.\n  The United States is at a critical juncture. We can come together and \nshow the world America is still the leader of a global economy or we \ncan let obstructionism turn this country into a second-rate superpower.\n  Just last week, I was doing some last-minute holiday shopping for my \nfamily. While in one store, I asked the sales clerk how business was \ngoing. We got to talking, and she told me how numbers were dramatically \ndown this year. She said people were worried. With so much uncertainty \nabout the future and the fragile economy, she said it was hard to \nconvince people to spend their hard-earned money on gifts.\n  That word, ``uncertainty'' is one I have heard quite often lately. \nWhether it is industrial leaders on Wall Street, small business owners \non Main Street or farmers and ranchers on country roads, they are \nworried about the future. They understand confidence matters in our \neconomy.\n  It is time to act right now, today. We have a chance to earn back the \nconfidence of the people we work for and show the world America is \nstill the safest bet in the world.\n  To give families and businesses certainty to start down a sustainable \nfiscal path, Congress and the President must agree on a balanced plan. \nThey must ramp up over time and cut spending, while at the same time \nasking a little more from those who can afford it. The math will not \nwork any other way. The clock is ticking. It is time to stop \ncampaigning and start listening. It is time to make the tough choices \nthe American people sent us to make.\n  The President is meeting with congressional leaders at this very \nmoment. My message to them is simple: We can do this. We can get this \ndone, and we must. It is our responsibility.\n  Here is a comparison of the latest grand bargain proposals made by \nthe President and Speaker Boehner. As you can see, we are not that far \napart. There is not a lot of difference. There are compromises that can \nbe made on both sides. We are not far from an agreement on a balanced \nplan--a plan that will bridge the fiscal cliff.\n  A balanced plan will encourage businesses to invest, enabling \ninvestors to return to the markets with confidence. Most important, a \nbalanced plan will put Americans back to work in a growing economy.\n  I understand time is short, New Year's Eve fast approaching. But I \nbelieve in life we have only two choices: try or do nothing. To ask the \nquestion is to answer it: Of course we try. If we try, we have another \nquestion to ask ourselves: Do we try our best? Of course, to ask that \nquestion is to answer it as well: We try our best.\n  I choose to try, I choose to try my best, and I ask you to join me in \nthat effort.\n  Our first choice is a grand bargain that puts this issue to bed once \nand for all. That is unlikely, to be honest, this late in the game. But \nit is still my first choice, and we should still try.\n  At the very least, we owe the American people a plan that addresses \nthe immediate challenges and gives Congress additional time to reach a \nbigger deal. It will show we can work together across party lines, and \nit will set the tone for the tougher discussion we need to have to \nenact a long-term and comprehensive deficit solution.\n  The American people are calling on us to act. They are calling for \ncompromise, for common sense. It is time to put progress ahead of \npolitics.\n  As President Kennedy warned, we cannot be lulled into comfortable \ninaction. We need to face this challenge head on and use it as an \nopportunity to put our economy back on track. So let's get to work.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for giving me this time, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Remembering Dan Inouye\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I wish to talk for just a couple \nminutes about Senator Inouye. I know I am late in the process, and that \nis partly why I am doing it--because I wanted to be late in the \nprocess.\n  I had been in the Senate 1 day back in 1985, and Dan Inouye came to \nvisit me in my office. He was up here; I was down here. He introduced \nhimself. We talked about our States. He had all kinds of seniority and \namazing qualities, I was nothing and he came to see me. I am sorry, but \nyou don't forget things such as that. It says something about him, \nwhich went through his life. That is just the way he was.\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\n  From there, a long friendship began. While I believe he looked at me \nas a friend, I looked to him as so much more than that. He was in a \ntotal sense a mentor with sort of a Confucian touch. He was of Japanese \nheritage and I had an interest in Japan and he had a way of imparting \njudgments and wisdom which were in the Eastern method, very subtle. He \nwas not always that way, but he could be, and he was with me.\n  I learned from him how this Chamber works and how to get things done. \nI watched the way he did them--not with a heavy fist or sharp words but \nwith thoughtfulness and hard work, a commanding presence, that voice--\nthat voice--and genuine relationships, including across the aisle. He \nbelieved in action. He believed in getting things done through hard \nwork and through determination. He had very much of an agenda.\n  Dan, of course, was one of our Nation's ultimate war heroes--not only \nbecause of his service and sacrifice but also somebody who stood for \nhis country, even when his country did not immediately stand for him.\n  Dan's courage and iron will were evident as he fought on the \nbattlefield, taking bullet after bullet, yet continuing to get back up. \nA tough soldier. He fought for the people of Hawaii every single day \nthat he lived in public service.\n  His love of his State and every Hawaiian was so abundantly clear \nthrough his massive list of accomplishments--an overwhelming list of \naccomplishments. Since Hawaii became a State, Dan had been working for \nit as the first Congressman ever elected by the State and only the \nthird Senator. His efforts are clear in his State's roads, bridges, \nairports, schools, military bases, health care, oceans, and almost \nevery aspect of American life that reached to the Islands. He played a \ntruly momentous role in making Hawaii what it is today.\n  Dan and I worked together on the Commerce Committee for 27 years. I \nalways felt very close to him. I remember sitting with him quietly, \nmaybe sharing a joke when I was lucky enough to be sitting beside him \nbut most often just listening. He was thinking, waiting for a \ndiscussion to ripen. He never once spoke just for the sake of it. Yet \nwhen he did speak, watch out.\n  I watched him a number of times, which I could well recite, when he \ntook an argument that the Commerce Committee had let ripen, and then, \nthrough the force of his argument, his quiet demeanor, and that \npowerful face and his calmness, turned the argument 180 degrees from a \nyes to a no or from a no to a yes, people simply following the power of \nhis logic and strength.\n  Dan didn't want us to be in awe of him, but many of us were anyway. \nHis integrity and his authenticity were momentous. He approached policy \nand public service with a pure heart.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee--to be succeeded by the \nwonderful Senator from Maryland--and the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, he was respected by everybody on both sides of the aisle. \nHe was a task master. He could be tough. He ran a tight and highly \ndisciplined ship but was unfailingly courteous and generous.\n  I have no doubt that one of the most difficult decisions he ever had \nto make was to implement the ongoing ban on congressional earmarks. Dan \nInouye believed in congressional earmarks, as does the current speaker. \nHe was adamant in his support and the constitutional right of Members \nto direct investments to their States, but he recognized that his bills \nhad no chance of being enacted into law in the current political \nclimate.\n  He fought back against Draconian funding cuts in the Ryan budget and, \nin a very partisan environment, moved all 12 of his bills for the 2012 \nfiscal year. He wasn't inactive. He was always on his game. Just in \nthis lameduck session, he turned a disaster relief request from the \nPresident into a finished bill to help so many States and families \nimpacted by Hurricane Sandy. These are large accomplishments.\n  His family was so deeply important to him. It has been wonderful for \nmy wife Sharon and me to see the utter joy that Dan's wife Irene \nbrought to him in these recent years, the happiness she gave him, the \ntwinkle in his eye and the privilege of just getting to know her, a \nremarkable and strong woman. Our hearts obviously are with Irene and \nDan's son Ken now.\n  Dan's is an awesome legacy and always will be, a legacy of character, \nof honor, and of service. So I say: Dan, thank you for what you have \nshared with each of us and for the life of service you gave to this \ncountry and your State that you loved so very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nhis deeply moving and heartfelt sentiments concerning our dear and \ndeparted comrade, Senator Inouye, a unique man. Never will the Senate \nof the United States of America see his like again.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his very important and \nmoving tribute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3355\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up pending amendment \nNo. 3355.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Coburn, proposes an amendment numbered 3355.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To strike funding for the emergency forest restoration \n                                program)\n\n       Beginning on page 2, strike line 16 and all that follows \n     through page 3, line 2.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 8 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 3355 offered by the \nSenator from Arizona. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill for her \npatience during this difficult time of many amendments and other \npriorities. I thank her for her patience and her courtesy as well as \nour Republican manager, the Senator from Mississippi.\n  This amendment is very minor in nature when we look at a $60 billion \npiece of legislation. But I think it has a certain amount of symbolism \nassociated with it, which is why I bring it up, symbolism we all want \nto respond to an emergency and a tragedy such as befell the people of \nthe Northeast as a result of this terrible hurricane and ongoing \ntragedies that continue. Our hearts go out to them. It is clearly an \nobligation of the Congress and President to do whatever is necessary to \nprovide what comfort and relief we can to them. It is one of the \nobligations of government we all recognize.\n  But also, over the years, I have seen the tendency as one of these \nthings happens, as they do from time to time, tragically, that we have \na tendency to put money in things we otherwise would not get so easily \nor funds for programs that have nothing to do with addressing the \ntragedy or just an excess of funds in an act of generosity on the part \nof the Congress of the United States. That might be OK--might be OK \nunder certain circumstances, but we have a $16 trillion debt. To \nappropriate more money without adequate justification for doing so is \nsomething that, sooner or later, we will have to stop.\n  I guess it was Margaret Thatcher who once said the problem with \nsocialism is that sooner or later you run out of other people's money. \nMy friends and colleagues, sooner or later we are going to run out of \nother people's money because they are going to stop lending it to us \nbecause we have a $16 trillion debt. Even though this is a relatively \nminor item, I think it is kind of symbolic of what we do around here. \nIt is concerning the $58 million we are going to spend for the \nDepartment of Agriculture Forest Restoration Program for planting trees \non private property.\n  Let me make that clear. We are going to spend $58 million for \nplanting trees on private property. This amendment would strike that \nprovision. This tree planting program called the Forest Restoration \nProgram is actually a farm bill subsidy that was created in 2008. It is \nrun by a relatively unknown government office called the Farm Service \nAgency, whatever that is, which was primarily responsible for\n\n[[Page S8477]]\n\nmanaging crop insurance in rural counties. Under the program, \n``nonindustrial private forest landowners'' can apply for up to \n$500,000 for a range of forest restoration activities, including tree \nplanting.\n  Why is that the role of the Federal Government? Why is it the role of \nthe Federal Government to pay for trees to be planted on private \nproperty, much less funded in a bill to repair the damage done by a \nhurricane.\n  There is nothing in the supplemental that limits the funding to just \nHurricane Sandy. Under this bill, the $58 million can be used anywhere. \nAccording to the U.S. Forest Service, approximately 45 percent of all \nforest land in the United States qualifies as ``nonindustrial private \nforestland.'' These lands are owned by approximately 11 million \nlandowners, many of whom have holdings of fewer than 50 acres on \naverage.\n  We know this program has cash. It received $11 million from Congress \nin 2010. It received an additional $28 million in the 2011 Omnibus \nAppropriations Act, more than doubling the program.\n  The Senate is proposing to double this subsidy again to $58 million. \nWe know from the U.S. Department of Agriculture records the majority of \nfunding has been used in past years for wind damaged trees in \nMississippi, Georgia, and Tennessee. There remains an unobligated $15 \nmillion in the program's account.\n  I say to my colleagues, $58 million here, $58 million there, sooner \nor later it runs into real money. In fact, it runs into a $16 trillion \ndebt. I come from a State, I say, Mr. President, where we love trees. \nWe have not enough of them. In some parts of our State we have a lot of \nthem. In some parts of our State it is kind of bleak--but beautiful. \nBut I am not asking for any money for private owners in my State to \nplant trees. I think they can do that themselves.\n  Again, it is only $58 million. Maybe I am taking up the time of the \nSenate when we are talking about $60 billion, but it is an example, an \noutstanding example, of the kind of excess that does not have the \npriority to spend another $58 million of the taxpayers' money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Arizona \nfor coming to the floor and debating this amendment because it means we \ncan move our bill in an expeditious way. I wish we could be solving the \nissues around the fiscal cliff with such civility, watchful rigor, and \na commitment to the taxpayer.\n  Having said that, however, I rise to oppose the Senator's amendment. \nThe Emergency Forest Restoration Program was established after \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. It does help owners of private forest land \ncarry out emergency measures to restore land damaged by a natural \ndisaster. This is not just trees falling. It has recently been used to \nprovide assistance to tornado damaged land across the Southeast: \nAlabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. \nAs the Senator from Maryland, the Presiding Officer, knows, when a \nhurricane hits, people, homes, and landscape are uprooted.\n  The program provides a 75-percent cost share for the work. The \nlandowner has to provide the other 25 percent. In order to participate \nin this program, there must be an onsite inspection to determine the \ntype and extent of damage caused by the disaster, and it must show that \nthe damage, if untreated, would endanger our natural resources or \nmaterially affect the future use of land around it.\n  If the physical inspection determines this land qualifies for the \nprogram, funding can be provided to remove damaged timber, clean up the \ndamaged trees, and take those activities to prevent future forest fires \nthat can certainly spread beyond the private forest. In the long run, \nsome of these issues, if not controlled, could cause much greater \ndamage and cost much more money.\n  Funding for this program was included in the administration request \nfor the supplemental, but it is limited only to Sandy. We are not doing \nthis as a new program that will occur in every disaster. Just as we did \nfor Katrina and for Rita, the bill was done for that. This would be \nlimited only to those geographic areas affected by Hurricane Sandy.\n  Historically, when disaster supplementals are considered, funding to \neliminate the full EFRP backlog was included. This practice has been \nhistorically supported by both sides of the aisle. We hope it is \ncontinued in this bill. I respectfully urge all Senators to oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, we are moving very well on this bill, and we expect to \nhave votes on these amendments when our colleagues return from the \nWhite House beginning shortly, around 4 o'clock. We note there is \nanother Senator who wishes to speak, but I, both in terms of the chair \nof the full committee as well as the Senator from Maryland, along with \nmy colleague presiding, do want to speak about this supplemental.\n  As we are drawing to a close with very few amendments left, I hope my \ncolleagues will pass this supplemental appropriations and view it \nurgently. In Maryland, we were hit in Hurricane Sandy. We were hit in \ntwo ways. No. 1, a hurricane on the Eastern Shore and up and down the \nChesapeake Bay, over 2,500 miles of shoreline, the Maryland part of the \nbay, the big bay, the inlets, the coves, the peninsulas--all of which \nwere vulnerable during Hurricane Sandy. Parts of our lower shore were \nabsolutely devastated.\n  While we were fighting the ravages of the hurricane and the wind and \nthe rain, up in western Maryland it took the turn that it was a \nblizzard, a blizzard in western Maryland. Mr. President, you received \nthe same calls I did, county commissioners saying the roads were \nblocked, 90 percent of the power was down. The National Guard had to be \ncalled out because only they had the muscle vehicles to clear the roads \nso the emergency power could get in. State Troopers were rescuing \npeople on snowmobiles and down in the lower shore they were going in, \nin swift boats, to pull out the elderly and other vulnerable \npopulations. It was just awful.\n  As the storm moved up and down the coast, community after community--\nsmall like ours, large like New York City--was pounded and pounded by \nthis devastating hurricane. All of America watched. We all held our \nbreath. We all feared the worst and we saw the worst. At the same time, \nwe saw the indomitable spirit of the American people hanging on to \ntheir home, praying for their livelihood.\n  While all that was going on, the President visited the Governors on \nboth sides of the aisle to say you have the United States of America \nbehind you. The United States of America being behind you, whether you \nare Governor O'Malley or Governor Christie or Governor Cuomo or the \nother Governors, means we need to pass this bill. We want to pass it \nbecause we know that lives were devastated and livelihoods were ruined.\n  In Maryland, we faced these unique challenges: hurricane, blizzards, \nurban and rural communities affected. In our own lower shore, Somerset \nCounty was hit.\n  That has one of the highest unemployment rates in the State, close to \n10 percent; 18 percent of the residents live below a line of $35,000 a \nyear. What I said then and what I say now: They were rich in community \nspirit, but they don't always have a lot of cash. Why? Because their \njobs are in agriculture, seafood--industries that were hard hit by the \ndecline in species, drought, and high fuel prices.\n  Families live in the same house for one, two, and three generations. \nAn appraiser might come by and wonder what the value is of that house. \nIf a family inherited the house from their mom, dad, or grandpa--some \nfamilies go back to the days of the Underground Railroad--that house \nmeans something to that family. How do we restore them? How do we get \nthe mold out? How do we get them back and functioning? Well, that is \nwhat this bill is all about.\n  You and I fought tooth and nail to get our State the assistance it \nneeded--not only our State but the other States as well--because we are \nthe United States of America. We hit some bureaucratic roadblocks along \nthe way, but thanks to the President and Mr. Fugate, the Administrator \nfor FEMA--and, wow, didn't he do a good job--and the creativity of \nShaun Donovan at\n\n[[Page S8478]]\n\nHUD, we all felt we were in it together. I thank them for their work.\n  What does that mean? Just in Somerset County alone, 619 people have \napplied for individual assistance. They were eligible for about $1 \nmillion. When we are talking about all of this money, $1 million might \nnot mean a lot in the Federal budget, but it sure meant a lot in the \nSomerset County family budget.\n  I am proud of what I did in working with you to help do this, and I \nam really proud of what our colleagues have done with their work on \nthis legislation. We have outstanding subcommittee chairs, and I will \ntalk about this in the wrap-up. They did a great job under President \nObama's leadership, and the executive branch functioned in a prime-time \nway. Now it is up to us to function in a prime-time way and to move \nthis bill.\n  The supplemental package provides well-tailored resources. Yes, there \nwas $11.5 billion for the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund and $17 billion in \ncommunity development block grants for the restoration of \ninfrastructure and housing, lives and livelihoods, and so the Corps of \nEngineers can repair and rebuild projects along the shorelines. These \nare the kinds of things this money will be used for. It is not to be \nspent on bureaucracy but on the restoration and recovery. It will \nactually put people to work rebuilding their communities.\n  Now, we might want to talk about how we don't want to spend money on \nforeign aid, but I sure want to spend money on American aid. I want to \nrebuild America, and I want to talk about things such as an \ninfrastructure bank another time. Right now, we have an opportunity to \ncome to the aid of fellow Americans, who in many instances are quite \ndesperate, to restore those communities and do the kind of \ninfrastructure we need in order to rebuild physical infrastructure and, \nI might add, emotional infrastructure.\n  I strongly support this legislation that I bring before the Senate \ntoday. I ask that my colleagues join me in moving it forward. At the \nend of the day, if we pass this bill, it will be a better day for all \nof those who were so hard hit by Hurricane Sandy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nMaryland for allowing me the opportunity to speak during this \ndiscussion of the supplemental appropriations bill. Also, it is my \nfirst opportunity to publicly congratulate the Senator from Maryland on \nher achievement of becoming the chairman of the committee I am a member \nof, and I look forward to working with her on an ongoing basis over the \nnext 2 years as we work our way through appropriations bills. I look \nforward to seeing that we do right and well and that we appropriately \ntake care of the taxpayers' dollars.\n  While the supplemental is important--and I am anxious that we move \nforward and vote on the amendments and its final passage--I would like \nto take this moment to speak, here on December 28, on the reason we are \nback in Washington, DC--the so-called looming fiscal cliff. It is \nunusual for the Senate to be in session at this point in time, just a \nfew days after Christmas and a few days before the New Year. I believe \nit has not been since 1970 that the Senate has cast votes during this \nperiod of time.\n  Our country faces a significant financial challenge, and I hope the \nHouse, the Senate, and the President are up to the task. I want to \nreach an agreement. I want to avoid finding out the consequences of no \nagreement. We have heard the predictions of the Congressional Budget \nOffice that suggest that the U.S. economy will be driven back into a \nrecession should we go over the cliff. There is a projection of \nincreasing unemployment rates, a reduction in real GDP, and the amount \nof debt held by the public will increase. I do not want our economy, \nthe American people, the taxpayers, the business men and women of our \ncountry to suffer the risks of inaction by Congress and the President.\n  But while meetings are ongoing now at the White House--and I hope \nthere is some semblance of progress that we learn about shortly--it \ndoes seem to me that we are at this final hour with a lack of any \nsignificant progress to deal with the fiscal cliff issue. We need \nleadership. We need the President's leadership. We need leadership by \nRepublicans and Democrats, and we need the House and Senate.\n  While I say I want an agreement, I am also willing to appreciate the \nfact that I will not get everything I might want in an agreement. The \nconsequences of our failure seem to me to be so significant that we \nought to find common ground.\n  Now, I understand we might reach an agreement that deals with a \nportion of the so-called fiscal cliff. I want to point out that we are \nonly really talking these days about the tax consequences of the fiscal \ncliff. I don't know exactly how the phrase ``fiscal cliff'' came into \nexistence. I don't know where those words came from. I don't know \nexactly what they mean. I think they probably mean different things to \ndifferent people.\n  It seems to me the fiscal cliff we face is based upon sequestration. \nThis plan that was put in place by the Budget Control Act would reduce \nspending by $1.2 trillion in both defense and nondefense as well as the \ndebt ceiling, which our Treasury Secretary says needs to be addressed. \nThe peak will be reached, the balance necessary to be raised, on \nDecember 31. We might want to include the doc fix, which is the \nMedicare set of payments we make on a short-term basis to keep \nphysicians seeing Medicare patients. Certainly, the deficit and debt \nour country faces are a part of that fiscal cliff.\n\n  It seems to me that we are only dealing with the issue of taxes. I \nwant to avoid taxes being raised on any American. I may not have that \nopportunity, but we ought to do everything we can to make certain the \nTax Code is unchanged in regard to those who are currently paying \ntaxes. For more than 10 years, we have had a tax code that treated \ntaxpayers a certain way, and in my view, any tax increase is damaging \nto the economy. Having said that, that I might not get everything I \nwant, there are consequences of not dealing with this issue that may be \nbeneficial even though a tax increase on anyone would be detrimental. \nSo there is this opportunity for give-and-take to make certain that if \nthere is a tax increase on anyone, there is a corresponding benefit \nthat overcomes the damage to the economy in regard to this issue.\n  We need to understand that while we are talking about taxes, we are \ntalking about a tax increase that will affect everyday Kansans and \neveryday Americans. The research I have seen indicates that a teacher \nin my State making $43,000 a year, in the absence of us dealing with \nthis issue, his or her taxes would go up $3,000 a year, which is about \n$250 a month. That does not include the end of the temporary payroll \ntax holiday, the new ObamaCare tax increases, or the alternative \nminimum tax, which affects taxpayers at income levels of more than \n$33,750.\n  So I am hoping we can deal with the tax issue, but I don't want us to \nforget there are other significant issues our country faces. Almost \nnone of the conversation coming from the White House or the discussions \nover the last few days, weeks, and months have dealt with the deficit, \nwhich is so compelling.\n  As I drove down the roads from one side of the State to the other for \nChristmas, with one side of our family in western Kansas and the other \nside of our family in eastern Kansas, I was thinking less about \nChristmas at that moment and more about what to do if we have a short-\nterm so-called kick-the-can-down-the-road--a 60-day or 30-day \nextension.\n  It seems that we owe Americans something much greater than just \ndelaying the consequences of our inaction to date. We desperately need \nto deal with the big issues. We have no choice but to move forward with \njust the small items that are before us today, but we especially need \nto deal with the deficit and debt problems our country faces. We cannot \nafford to kick the can down the road.\n  I read a letter from a constituent of mine who wrote to me back \nduring the debt ceiling debate. I think what she said is still \nimportant for us today. This is a letter from Gina Reynolds from \nShawnee, KS. She says that she believes America is the greatest country \non Earth. She says:\n\n       I believe we have the greatest country on Earth, but our \n     inability to compromise and stop acting like spoiled children \n     saddens me.\n\n[[Page S8479]]\n\n     The Founding Fathers were able to compromise and write a \n     document that has stood the test of time for 235 years. Can \n     we not now do the same? Please do the right thing for the \n     American people, the ones . . . hurt by this self-produced \n     impasse.\n\n  I want the impasse to come to an end. I want us to reach an \nagreement. I want us to deal with the Tax Code that changes on January \n1. But I do not want us to avoid the opportunity to deal with the most \nsignificant problem and challenge our country faces--the fiscal \nchallenge of our deficit and debt.\n  I yield the floor .\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the looming \nfinancial crisis that all of us here are trying to solve. We are here \nbecause we know that in 4 days something that will affect every \nAmerican family in not a very good way is going to happen. We are \ntalking among ourselves, and we are trying to see what could be given \non each side of the debate and where we are together. In many areas, we \nare already together.\n  The President has said he is for AMT relief, and most certainly we \nare as well. There are other areas where we are in agreement, such as \nrelief from the marriage penalty and the child tax credit, which have \nhelped so many American families. Yet we seem to dwell on where we are \napart and not start with where we are together.\n  As we speak, our leaders are meeting at the White House. Our majority \nand minority leader in the Senate and the Speaker and the minority \nleader in the House are meeting with the President. It will be \nremembered about the President's term and it will be remembered by \nMembers of Congress if we don't do something that is a compromise. At \nthis point, it has to be bipartisan. There is no question that \nsomething has to pass the House and the Senate with votes from the \nminority party of each chamber.\n  We have to go to the drawing board, and I hope there is a plan laid \nout at the White House with the leaders from which we can start that \nreal negotiation. Now, many would say: Really? Should we start now, 2 \nor 3 or 4 days out?\n  Well, no. We should have started about 6 months or a year ago, no \ndoubt about it, but we are where we are. So what can be done in a \nsignificant way that will ease the concerns of the American people \nright now? No one wants to see tax increases on every American. No one \nwants to see America's defense budget decimated, which is what will \nhappen automatically with no action on January 2 with sequestration. No \none wants to see unemployment tick up, and no one wants to see another \nrecession when we have barely started on a very slow road to recovery \nfrom the last one.\n  The consequences are enormous. For instance, the child tax credit is \n$1,000 per child and refundable today. On January 1 of next year, it \nwill be $500 per child and not refundable. The adoption tax credit, \nwhich has helped many American families ease the cost of adoption while \ngiving a home to children who wouldn't have one otherwise today, is a \n$12,650 deduction. As of January 1, it would be $6,000 and not \napplicable to any child except one with special needs. Even though that \nis a wonderful thing, why not continue the full amount for every child \nwho is adopted.\n\n  The marriage penalty relief will be significantly reduced if we don't \ndo something by January 1.\n  This is something that hasn't been talked about very much: If an \nemployer provides education assistance, up to $5,250 of the cost of \nthis assistance may be excluded from their tax payment. That provision \nexpires, so that is a huge disincentive for employers to help their \nemployees further their education, which is in everyone's best \ninterests. Today student loan interest deductions are $2,500 per year. \nThat is an interest deduction to pay back a student loan, where someone \nhas had the initiative to get their higher education and borrowed to do \nit. In 2013, this deduction will only be available for 5 years of \ninterest payments.\n  The alternative minimum tax, which was meant to hit millionaires when \nit was enacted years ago, hit an income of $48,000 for an individual \nand almost $75,000 for a couple in 2011. Because it expired at the end \nof last year, for tax year 2012, the AMT has gone to $33,000 for an \nindividual and $45,000 for a married couple. A married couple making \n$45,000 with two children, maybe in college, should they pay an \nalternative minimum tax? This doesn't make sense to anyone in our \ncountry, and it is time we came together to face reality. The reality \nis we are on the brink of letting a bad thing happen because we are so \ndivided on the edges and we can't come to terms.\n  There are areas I have talked to my Democratic colleagues about where \nI know we are together. Fixing the AMT is one. Another one is the \nestate tax. Today, over 80 percent of the value of a ranch or a farm is \na nonliquid, land-based or equipment-based asset. That means if someone \ndies and they have to pay an estate tax over $1 million, which is what \nit will be January 1, often heirs have to sell at pennies on the dollar \nbecause they can't sell land or equipment for the value that is put on \nit for an estate. So we are going to throw family-owned farms into a \nliquidation, which cuts jobs of the people who are working there and \nalso affects the businesses and rural communities they support in Texas \nand in many other states. None of us want that. I talked to my \nDemocratic colleagues and they don't want that either. Today the \nexemption is $5.1 million--much more reasonable when we are talking \nabout an asset that is virtually not sellable on the open market. We \nwant to fix that so families can pass their businesses and farms and \nranches to their heirs and keep the people who are working there in \njobs.\n  We know we need to boost our economy at the same time we need to take \nhold of the spending of government. That is something we have talked \nabout for a long time because we know the debt is $16.3 trillion and we \nknow the deficits, which are more than $1 trillion every year, are \ngoing to make that higher. It is unsustainable. So we have to address \nthe revenue and we have to address the spending.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, if the Senator from Texas will yield for \na moment, I don't want the gavel to come down during her presentation.\n  We were scheduled to resume votes at 4 o'clock. I wish to ask \nunanimous consent for the Senator from Texas to finish her statement \nand then Senator Leahy be recognized to make a few remarks. We know the \nleadership is on their way back from the White House. So I ask \nunanimous consent that votes resume at 4:15 after the Senator from \nTexas completes her remarks and after the Senator from Vermont speaks \nfor a few minutes to debate the Rand Paul amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee as well as the ranking member because as \nsoon as our leaders get back from the White House I certainly want us \nto be able to go forward and vote.\n  To finish my remarks, we must take hold of our financial situation. \nThere is no doubt we are spending too much, we are borrowing too much, \nand I believe we are taxing too much. It is time for us to hold the \nline on taxes so they do not go up for the people who would hire \npeople. At the same time, we know we must cut responsibly. We must set \nour priorities and put a ceiling on spending in this country.\n  I understand that is going to take more time than the next 4 days, \nbut I implore my colleagues to not let the jolt happen on December 31 \nat midnight that would hurt our economy, possibly put more people out \nof work, and jeopardize their family incomes which, in many cases, are \nbarely able to make ends meet today. Let's come together where I know \nfrom talking to my Democratic colleagues we could come together. If we \ncan do the things that are necessary to bring us together to avoid this \ncliff, we need to do everything in our power to do it.\n  I thank the Chair, and I certainly wish to yield the floor to the \nSenator from Vermont. I just hope that before December 31 at midnight, \nif we have to be here to do it, we will come to an agreement that will \nease the tensions in the marketplace and in the American family and \nworkplace so we can go forward and give the new Congress the time to \nlook at all these issues and come to the terms of a government that has \na Democratic majority in the\n\n[[Page S8480]]\n\nSenate, a Republican majority in the House, and a President in the \nWhite House whom I hope will bring everyone together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3410\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas. As I said earlier on the floor this week, I will miss working \nwith her. We have worked together on a number of things.\n  I know my distinguished colleague, Senator Lindsey Graham, has \nalready spoken on the amendment of the junior Senator from Kentucky \nwhich would offset a portion of the cost of the supplemental by \nrescinding unobligated funds from the fiscal year 2013 continuing \nresolution for the Department of State and foreign aid programs and \noperations of the U.S. Agency for International Development. I agree \nwith him in opposing it.\n  The fiscal year 2013 CR provides $13.4 billion for these national \nsecurity programs. Of course, we are only 90 days into the fiscal year \nand $10.4 billion is not yet obligated. No matter how good an amendment \nsuch as this might sound, we need to talk about the reality. These days \nwe seem to have two types of arguments, those that go to symbols and \nthose that go to substance. Let me speak about the substance of what \nthis amendment would do to all of our foreign assistance programs.\n  It would effectively bring to a halt U.S. foreign aid programs around \nthe world. It would shut down the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment. The distinguished Presiding Officer and his family have \nexperienced how important these programs are throughout the world.\n  Let me tell my colleagues some of the things this amendment would do. \nIt would force early termination of contracts that are based on the \nfiscal year 2013 budget request such as military aid for Israel and \nEgypt, potentially resulting in significant early termination and legal \ncosts to U.S. taxpayers. It also tells these countries not to rely on \nus: We will make agreements with you, we will give you contracts, but \nwe may change our mind 2 months into the fiscal year. Is this how the \ngreatest, most powerful Nation on Earth should act? Come on.\n  The amendment would reduce the amount available for these programs \nduring the continuing resolution by 67 percent. The amendment sets a \nfloor of $5 billion for these programs for all of fiscal year 2013; \nthat would be a cut of 81 percent. It is not clear how or when \nadditional funds would be provided. In fact, the lack of clarity would \nwreak havoc on operations and programs that have bipartisan support. \nThat is why Senator Graham and I both spoke in unison on this. \nRepublicans and Democrats across the political spectrum support these \nprograms.\n  It might make a good press release back home to say we are going to \ncut all this money from our foreign aid programs, particularly when no \nmention is made that these programs are a mere 1 percent of the entire \nFederal budget, but these programs represent a large percentage of the \nface of America throughout the world. This amendment represents a \nmyopic misunderstanding of the world we live in, where our economy and \nour security are intricately linked with those of other countries. \nFrankly, a lot of countries wish we would do something such as this so \nthey could step in with influence that would be counter to the \ninterests of the United States.\n  Now is not the time to abruptly end our lifesaving global health \nprograms, including the PEPFAR initiative of the George W. Bush \nadministration, which I and many Democrats and Republicans supported, \nand which also protects the health and safety of Americans living here \nand traveling and studying and working overseas.\n  I would ask: Are we actually going to end anticrime programs in \nMexico and Colombia or military and economic aid for Israel, Egypt, and \nJordan? If anyone wants to eliminate all those programs, then vote for \nthis amendment. But if colleagues want to keep anticrime programs in \nMexico and Colombia and keep military and economic aid for Israel, \nEgypt, and Jordan, then vote against this amendment.\n  This amendment would curtail relief aid for refugees and victims of \nnatural disasters, from earthquakes to famines. How many times have we \nseen a tsunami or an earthquake and the world says: At least the United \nStates of America is there. How about if we said: Sorry, we may be the \nwealthiest, most powerful nation on Earth, but we can't help you.\n  How about the Peace Corps? Of course, this amendment would shut it \ndown. The Millennium Challenge Corporation? It would shut that down. \nThe list goes on and on.\n  I mention these things because they have all had strong bipartisan \nsupport--Republican and Democratic support, both in Congress and in \nRepublican and Democratic administrations.\n\n  Let's not waste our time like this. It is a classic example of \nrecklessly robbing Peter to pay Paul. We need Americans to help the \nvictims of Hurricane Sandy rebuild their lives. But we cannot do it by \neliminating programs that are critical to our economy and especially \nprograms critical to our national security.\n  This amendment also includes a new provision that would prevent all \nfunds within this act from being considered emergency spending.\n  Can any one of us stand on this floor with a straight face and say \nthe devastating effects of the largest Atlantic hurricane in history is \nnot an emergency?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator would suspend, the time for the \nvote has now arrived.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would ask consent for 2 more minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am right here.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask the manager of the bill, are you \nready to vote? I will take 30 seconds.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nbe allowed to finish his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when they say it is not an emergency, look \nat what happened with this hurricane. We lost 120 American lives. We \nlost 340,000 homes. We lost 200,000 businesses due to the effects of \nSandy. If that is not an emergency, then I have not seen an emergency \nin all my years in the Senate.\n  There are 12 States with disaster or emergency declarations in place \ndue to Sandy's wrath. It produced an emergency disaster for our Nation. \nIt should be considered as such through the appropriations process, and \nI applaud the Chair of the Appropriations Committee for moving this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3376\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3376 offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul.\n  Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, on our side, we yield all time back and \nare ready to proceed to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am told by the manager of this bill, \nSenator Mikulski, that she thinks they can complete work on this \nlegislation, the supplemental, in the next couple hours. I hope that is \nthe case. Maybe they can even do it more quickly.\n  Here is what the plan is. I talked to the Republican leader about \nthis generally, not specifically. Everyone knows we have been to the \nWhite House. We have had a constructive meeting. We certainly hope \nsomething positive will come from that. The Republican leader and I and \nour staffs are working to see what we can come up with. It should not \ntake a long time to do that.\n  I think it would be to everyone's interest if we were not in session \ntomorrow. It is my plan to come in at 1 o'clock. We have an hour on a \nprevious agreement that we have on Galante. There is an hour of debate \non that. We would have a vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. What day?\n  Mr. REID. Sunday. We have another vote that has been set up, Baer. \nThat is a simple majority.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. Leader, you are talking about Sunday, right?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. We will have those votes, start the votes after 2, and \nthen for us we will have another caucus following that. Hopefully, by \nthat time, we will have made a determination, Senator McConnell and I, \nwhether we can do something on the floor in addition to what I have \njust talked about. But I do think we need that time to have everybody \nkind of step back a little bit.\n  If we come up with something, it is not that easy. We are dealing \nwith big numbers and some of the stuff we do is somewhat complicated. \nBut I think it was a very positive meeting. There was not a lot of \nhilarity in the meeting. Everyone knows how important it is. It was a \nvery serious meeting, and it took an extended period of time, as you \nall know, waiting for us.\n  I would like to have the Republican leader speak.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I share the view of the majority leader. We had a good \nmeeting down at the White House. We are engaged in discussions, the \nmajority leader and myself and the White House, in the hopes that we \ncan come forward as early as Sunday and have a recommendation that I \ncan make to my conference and the majority leader can make to his \nconference. So we will be working hard to try to see if we can get \nthere in the next 24 hours.\n  I am hopeful and optimistic.\n  Mr. REID. I am going to do everything I can and I am confident \nSenator McConnell will do the same. But for everybody, whatever we come \nup with is going to be imperfect. Some people are not going to like it, \nsome people will like it less, but that is where we are. I am confident \nwe have an obligation to do the best we can. That was made very clear \nin the White House. We are going to do the best we can for the caucuses \nwe have and the country that is waiting for us to make a decision.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3355\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3355, offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, a point of clarification for our \ncolleagues, if Members could understand: We are going to vote on the \nMcCain amendment now and then we have four more amendments.\n  Mr. President, I stand corrected. So Senators can plan their time--I \nknow it is of the essence--we have, upon the disposition of the McCain \namendment, two other amendments--Merkley in agriculture and Coats on \nthe Republican alternative.\n  Then we have the Reid substitute, which we believe will be a voice \nvote. Then we will go to final passage.\n  So we have two amendments. We will have four votes, one of which we \nthink is a voice. So everybody knows--don't go off. Don't go off. Also, \nwhen we have the votes, if we can stick to the 10 minutes, it will \nenable us to complete the disposition of the bill.\n  I yield the floor and recommend we follow the regular order on the \namendment of Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does anyone seek debate on the McCain \namendment?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I will yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If not, all time is yielded back. The question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3367, as further modified, offered by the Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Merkley.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am delighted to partner with Senator \nBlunt and Senator Stabenow on this important amendment which addresses \nthe disasters that occurred this last summer in terms of a century's \nworth of the worst fires and the worst drought. This is a true \nemergency in which our response has been delayed because programs are \ntied up in the farm bill.\n  I ask that my colleagues address this real emergency.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I respect my colleague's desire to get \nthis matter done, but the language he is advocating is already in the \nFarm bill. We need to get the Farm bill passed, and I think we will \nsoon. It is paid for and is within the budget limits, which was done by \nthe Agriculture Committee.\n  This amendment defines ``disaster'' so broadly that it would include \nalmost anything that results in a livestock death, and the taxpayers \nwould be better served if we opposed this budget-breaking amendment. It \nis not an emergency since legislation is already in place that would \ntake care of this issue. There are also other problems with this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to section 314(e)(1) of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I raise a point of order against the emergency \ndesignation provisions contained in amendment No. 3367 to amendment No. \n3395, the substitute amendment to H.R. 1, the vehicle for the \nSupplemental Appropriations Act.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is determining which section the \npoint of order lies against.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. To further extend my point of order, I ask that the \nbudget point of order lie against both emergency designation provisions \nthat are contained in amendment No. 3367 to amendment No. 3395.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this is a budget point of order against \nthis being an emergency. If a person is a farmer or a rancher and their \nproperty or the property they rent from the BLM----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is advised the point \nof order is not debatable.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent to complete 30 seconds of \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. If a person is a farmer or a rancher, saying this is not \nan emergency is cold comfort. Saying this will be addressed in the farm \nbill is cold comfort. When a person's land is burned up, when they have \nthe worst drought in a century, it is an emergency, and getting help 6 \nor 8 months after it happens is unacceptable.\n  We have a responsibility, having not gotten the farm bill done, to do \nthese emergency provisions today. Please vote for the following waiver:\n  Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I \nmove to waive all applicable sections of that act for purposes of the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), \nthe Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), and the Senator from \nVirginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, given that the emergency designations in \nthis amendment have been stricken, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \nmy amendment No. 3367.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment, as further \nmodified, is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask for 1 minute to be able to respond \nto what the Senator from Oregon just did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S8483]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I just want to say to the Senator from Oregon, and all \nthe other Senators who face agricultural disasters, we on the \nAppropriations Committee would like to work with the Senator. This is \ncompelling human need--your disaster, my fisheries disaster. We have to \nhave a way of working together. We want to acknowledge the validity of \nthe Senator's concern.\n  The Senate has spoken on a budget point of order. But we do want to \nwork with the Senator and work with our authorizers so we do not have \nour agricultural interests hanging out there.\n  So I thank the Senator for his efforts. The Senate has spoken on this \namendment. Let's see what we can do together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask for the regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3391\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 3391, offered by the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Coats.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I do not believe there is anyone in this \nChamber who does not understand the devastating impact of Sandy on the \nNortheast and the pain and the suffering that has come from that.\n  I do not think there is anyone in this Chamber who does not \nunderstand this is an emergency supplemental appropriation that is \nneeded now to address this pain and suffering and help rebuild and help \nprovide the relief necessary to these people and businesses and others \nin the Northeast.\n  We want to do that. But the bill before us presented by the \nDemocrats--the bill offered by the other side throws out $60-plus \nbillion to address not just immediate needs but also future needs for \nfuture storms and even unrelated issues not related to Sandy.\n  The Coats alternative, which I hope to gain support for, documents \nwhat is needed, takes that documentation, provided by FEMA, SBA, all \nthe agencies involved, and more than generously compensates for what is \nneeded between now and the end of March.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I wish to say I appreciate the \ntrue concern my colleague from Indiana and those who have put this \namendment together have shown. He is not just giving us the back of his \nhand or saying: You do not need it or wait 3 months or whatever.\n  Unfortunately, though, it would just stop dead in its tracks the \nrecovery efforts so desperately needed. You cannot plan a recovery on a \n3-month basis. The bottom line is, if you want to build a tunnel, you \ncannot say: I will build one-fifth of the tunnel now, and we will see \nif there is more money later. If you need to build a berm of 6 feet, \nyou cannot say: We will build it 2 feet and then see if we can build \nanother 4 feet later. You just cannot do that.\n  Because of the way we all know FEMA and these other agencies work, \nyou have to spend the money first and then they reimburse you. If they \nare not sure there is going to be money at the end of the road--no more \nafter March 31; maybe Congress will, maybe Congress will not--you are \ngoing to get a lot of homeowners, small businesses, and governments not \ngoing ahead with the desperate repairs that we in New York need and the \nwhole national economy--since we are about 10 percent of the national \neconomy--needs.\n  I strongly urge the amendment--good intentioned, though, as it is--be \ndefeated.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, could I have 15 seconds just to respond to \nmy colleague?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Let me just say that we simply are allowing 3 months for \nthe Congress of the United States--representatives of taxpayers' \ndollars--to assess, document, and justify additional expenditures that \ngo beyond emergency needs. That is what this is all about.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Indiana, Mr. \nCoats, for the work he has done on this bill. He has proposed changes \nto the bill to balance our help for the victims of Hurricane Sandy with \nour duty to be responsive to the public trust.\n  His effort would provide aid now that is clearly needed now and \nconsider separately the longer term proposals in the substitute. I \nthink his intent was to propose a bill that could be enacted into law \nquickly so that disaster recovery would not be delayed. I thank him for \nhis contributions to this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3391.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of entering into a \ncolloquy with Senator Reed, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nInterior, Environment, and Related Agencies, regarding funding for the \nDepartment of the Interior included in the disaster assistance \nsupplemental.\n  Mr. President, my home State of Delaware was unfortunately impacted \nby Hurricane Sandy, which struck on October 28 and 29 of this year. The \ndamage caused by Hurricane Sandy was widespread in Delaware. Among the \nareas impacted was Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge in Sussex \nCounty.\n  Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, established in the 1960s, is an \nimportant part of the Eastern migratory flyway and one of the only \nplaces in the world where horseshoe crabs come to spawn. It offers \nworld class outdoor recreation and is a key piece of Delaware's tourism \nindustry.\n  The refuge suffered severe damage during Hurricane Sandy. Breaches in \nthe beach and dune system separating the refuge's marsh units from the \nDelaware Bay resulted in an ongoing inundation of the refuge by salt \nwater. This has led to the loss of thousands of acres of critical \nhabitat, as well as damage to refuge property and facilities. It \nseverely impacted the health of the freshwater marsh system in the \nrefuge, and the decline of the marsh has in turn led to continuous \nflooding of nearby farmland and communities, damaging the private \nproperty of thousands of people.\n  I am grateful that the Appropriations Committee had the wisdom to \ninclude $150,000,000 for the Office of the Secretary of at the \nDepartment of the Interior to fund recovery and restoration activities \nrelated to Hurricane Sandy and other natural disasters. I would like to \nask if the intent of this funding is to support recovery and \nrestoration projects similar to those that will be required in my State \nto respond to the impacts of Hurricane Sandy?\n  Mr. REED. The Senator is correct. Coming from a State that received a \nmajor disaster declaration due to the damage it sustained in Hurricane \nSandy, including damage to the Rhode Island National Wildlife Refuge \nComplex, I recognize the importance of providing funding for projects \nin States impacted by the storm. The funds provided in this bill will \nbe used in support of additional recovery activities directly related \nto the hurricane or to fund longer-term restoration activities for \nareas directly affected by Hurricane Sandy. The bill provides \nflexibility so that the Department can transfer the funds to any of its \nprograms to fund the highest priority needs in these specific disaster \nareas. I expect these funds to be of great assistance to states like \nours which were affected by this devastating storm.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we debate the Hurricane Sandy \nSupplemental bill this week, it is critical that we ensure taxpayer \ndollars go to help those impacted by this devastating storm and not \ntoward spending projects that are wasteful or not a priority at this \ntime. This bill, unfortunately, goes way beyond emergency aid and funds \nprojects that have little or nothing to do with meeting the immediate \nneeds of individuals misplaced by Hurricane Sandy. At a time when we \nface ongoing trillion-dollar deficits, and a $16.3 trillion debt, we \ncannot justify this type of spending.\n  While some of the projects included in this bill may hold merit on \ntheir own, they should go through the normal budget and appropriations \nprocess, where Congress has time to vet the need for such spending \nrequests.\n  To highlight this point, the Congressional Budget Office--CBO--\nexamined both the Senate bill and the administration's request and \nfound that that 64 percent of the funds appropriated under the Sandy \nSupplemental will not be spent until fiscal years 2015-2022 and after, \ntherefore, raising concerns about the rush to spend $60.4 billion \nwithout any attempt to pay for it.\n  Just two weeks ago, FEMA Director Fugate told the House \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee that the Disaster Relief \nFund currently has enough money and will not need additional funding \nuntil the spring 2013. CBO's assessment, combined with the statement of \nDirector Fugate clearly shows us that we need to pass a Sandy \nSupplemental bill that only includes prioritized disaster aid funding.\n  As I have examined this bill over this week, I have found numerous \nexamples of questionable spending including billions to replace \n`Federal assets' damaged by the storm, including automobiles owned by \nthe Federal Government. The Federal Government currently owns or leases \nover 660,000 vehicles--surely we can find replacements within our \ncurrent inventory.\n  Shouldn't we focus on providing relief directly to those still trying \nto rebuild their lives before replacing a bureaucrat's car?\n  The new substitute also includes language expanding levee \nconstruction to include West North Central States, such as North \nDakota. It also includes $2 million to repair damage to the roofs of \nmuseums in Washington, D.C., while many in Hurricane Sandy's path still \nhave no permanent roof over their own heads, $150 million for fisheries \nas far away from the storm's path as Mississippi and Alaska, $125 \nmillion for the Department of Agriculture's Emergency Watershed \nProtection program, which helps restore watersheds damaged by wildfires \nand droughts for areas including Colorado, $15 million for NASA \nfacilities, though NASA itself has called its damage from the hurricane \n`minimal.' On the day after the storm hit, NASA's Wallops Island put \nout a statement stating that ``an initial assessment team surveyed \nroads and facilities at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility today reporting \na number of downed trees but otherwise minimal impact in the wake of \nHurricane Sandy.'' To me, this raises a red flag that this NASA funding \nmay not be an immediate emergency.\n  There is $58 million for the USDA ``Forest Restoration Program'' for \nplanting trees on private property. This program is actually a Farm \nBill subsidy program that's run by a relatively unknown agency called \nthe ``Farm Service Administration,'' which is primarily responsible for \nmanaging crop insurance. Under this program, private landowners with \nabout 50 acres of land can apply for up to $500,000 in free grants for \ntree planting activities. Not only is this a non-emergency need, \nthere's nothing in the supplemental that limits the funding to \nHurricane Sandy areas. Under this bill, this $58 million can be used \njust about anywhere.\n  There is $336 million for taxpayer-supported AMTRAK without a \ndetailed plan for how the money will be spent. While some of the \nfunding will go for repairs, money will also go to increasing passenger \ncapacity to New York and future mitigation efforts. In a two page \nletter from AMTRAK that gives a broad description of how the $336 \nmillion will be spent, almost all of it falls under funding for \nimprovements and future capital projects. This includes $191 million \nfor AMTRAK to start design and construction of new Hudson River \nTunnels, as part of the Gateway Program. According to AMTRAK, the \nGateway Program, which was started in 2011 and is projected to cost \nover $13 billion, is ``a comprehensive program of infrastructure \nimprovements to increase track, tunnel, bridge, and station capacity \nserving New York City that will improve current assets and allow the \neventual doubling of passenger trains into Manhattan.'' I am not here \nto debate the merits or the need for new tunnels, but this is clearly a \ncapital improvement project--unrelated to Hurricane Sandy. AMTRAK is up \nand running so it is not apparent why this funding is deemed \n``emergency'' spending and included in this spending package. Keep in \nmind, AMTRAK receives roughly $1 billion in annual funding. Future \nmitigation projects should be debated in next year's budget process.\n  There is $5.3 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers--more than the \nArmy Corps' annual budget--with little clarity on how the money will be \nspent. Included in the Senate bill is $50 million in funding for more \nstudies, which will most definitely lead to additional Army Corp \nprojects and a new Task Force established by Executive Order.\n\n[[Page S8485]]\n\nMore projects are not something the Army Corps can handle. They are \ncurrently experiencing a backlog of construction and maintenance \nprojects of approximately $70 billion. Furthermore, a 2010 report \nreleased by the Government Accountability Office noted that carryover \nfunds have increased ``due to the large amount of supplemental funding \nthe Corps has received in recent years.'' Clearly, supplemental \nspending on the Army Corps has not paid off. There is $10 million \nimprove weather forecasting capabilities and infrastructure. The bill \nalso includes roughly $13 billion for future disaster mitigation \nactivities and studies, without identifying a single way to pay for it. \nWhile I understand that Mitigation is important to save money when \nfuture natural disasters occur, there is no justification to include \nthese projects in this ``emergency'' spending bill. By waiting to fund \nthese projects until next year during the normal budget and \nappropriations process, we will have a better understanding of the path \nforward and reduce the possibility of waste fraud and abuse.\n  As a nation, we are confronted with trillion dollar deficits, out of \ncontrol spending in Washington and the imminent approach of an \neconomically, devastating fiscal cliff. We do need to come to the aid \nof those who lost everything in Hurricane Sandy and are struggling to \nget their lives back together. Congress, however, cannot continue down \nthis road of irresponsible spending. We must pass a true disaster \nspending bill that only spends money on disaster recovery and response, \nnot pet projects.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, Hurricane Sandy had a devastating effect on \nthe electric and transportation infrastructure in the Northeast and \nMid-Atlantic states. When Hurricane Sandy struck the east coast, it \nflooded electrical substations and knocked down trees onto power lines, \nshutting off power for 8.2 million customers, and causing billions of \ndollars in damage.\n  The storm sent floodwater gushing into New York's five boroughs, \nflooding tunnels and the subway system and making the equipment \ninoperable. In many hard-hit areas wireless networks suffered \nwidespread outages primarily due to lack of power.\n  We have seen this scenario play out before. Just this past summer, a \nderecho thunderstorm knocked out power for more than 1 million \nresidents near Washington for several days.\n  Do such storms have to result in such widespread outages and does the \nrestoration of a power grid have to take so long? Several experts have \nsaid that America's power infrastructure could be more resilient--even \nwhen tested by a once-in-a-century storm.\n  The intent of section 52005 of the supplemental Appropriations bill \nis to encourage recipients of these disaster assistance funds to \nrebuild the electrical infrastructure so that it is more resilient to \nfuture storms. We can achieve a more resilient electric grid by \nmaximizing the utilization of technologies that can mitigate future \npower outages and by ensuring the continued operation of facilities \ncritical to first responders, communications, health care, \ntransportation, financial systems, homeland security, emergency food \nand shelter, government offices, as well as other vital services such \nas hospitals and wastewater treatment systems.\n  Rebuilding these essential infrastructure systems with technology \nthat is equipped to deal with extreme weather will better enable the \nelectric grid to withstand potential damage and continue to deliver \nthese vital services and maintain electric power to facilities critical \nto public health, safety and welfare.\n  There are numerous proven technologies that are ready to be deployed \nto enhance our electric infrastructure resiliency including smart grid \ntechnologies to isolate problems and repair them remotely, such as \nsmart meters, high-tech sensors, grid monitoring and control systems, \nand remote reconfiguration and redundancy systems; microgrids, energy \nstorage, distributed and back-up generation to power critical \nfacilities and operations; wiring, cabling, submersible and other \ndistribution components and enclosures to prevent outages; and \nelectronically controlled re-closers and similar technologies for power \nrestoration.\n  When we look at the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, and the \nsuffering by millions of people who could not get electricity or \ncommunicate by phone or the internet, it makes smart sense to rebuild \nthe electric grid so that it is more resilient and better able to \nwithstand whatever nature may next throw at it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote in support of the legislation \nbefore us because we have a responsibility to help our fellow Americans \nwho have lost homes and businesses through no fault of their own. \nNatural disasters are something we can attempt to prepare for, but the \ndestructive force of nature can overwhelm us, even when efforts are \nmade in advance of devastating storms, floods, droughts, or other \ndisasters. Further, the bill provides permanent reforms to the Stafford \nAct that will help to eliminate bureaucratic roadblocks that have \ncaused problems for local communities in rebuilding after a disaster \nand in mitigating risks from future disasters.\n  Hurricane Sandy was one of those disasters that overwhelmed us with \nits damage. Over 125 people lost their lives, thousands of people were \ndisplaced, millions lost power, and fuel deliveries were disrupted. \nTens of thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed, and public \ninfrastructure was devastated. The storm is estimated to have caused \nsuch damage that it is projected to be the second or third most costly \ndisaster in U.S. history. We need to provide the assistance to those \nimpacted by Hurricane Sandy.\n  Other natural disasters have also pummeled the U.S. this year, \nincluding the wildfires in the West and Hurricane Isaac in the Gulf \nCoast region. The bill includes some funding for these other natural \ndisasters, which I support. While Hurricane Sandy was most devastating, \nwe also should be responsive to these other disasters.\n  One of these disasters had impacts on my great State of Michigan. \nThis year, the Midwest experienced extreme weather including one of the \nworst droughts in history, causing tremendous damage to crops. Michigan \nalso experienced unusually warm weather in March that resulted in an \nearly bloom for many fruit crops, including tart cherries. These crops \nwere then heavily damaged by a series of freezes during April and May. \nThe drought, coupled with a warm winter, has resulted in near-historic \nlow water levels in the Great Lakes, which is also a natural disaster. \nThe Army Corps of Engineers reports that Lakes Michigan and Huron are \nmore than two feet below their long-term average. Lake Superior is more \nthan one foot below its long-term average. These low water levels \nthreaten harbors with closure, hamper boaters from getting to safe \nharbor, and require vessels to light-load, causing shippers to lose \nmillions of dollars of freight shipments and hampering our economic \ncompetitiveness. The bill includes $821 million in funding for dredging \nneeds related to natural disasters. I entered into a colloquy with the \nbill manager to ensure that Great Lakes projects would be eligible for \nthis funding. I am pleased Senator Leahy assured me that in fact Great \nLakes harbors and channels impeded as a result of drought and low water \nlevels would be eligible for this funding. When the Army Corps makes \ndeterminations as to how to allocate funds, I hope the Corps will \nprioritize funding for Great Lakes projects which are estimated to \nrequire $35 million to address the low water levels.\n  With respect to crop damage, the bill includes an amendment sponsored \nby Senator Merkley that reauthorizes several expired disaster \nassistance programs to assist ranchers and farmers, including an \nextension of the noninsured crop assistance disaster program. This \nprogram will provide critical assistance to farm producers, including \nMichigan tart cherry growers who are currently ineligible to purchase \ncrop insurance for their crops.\n  I hope this bill will soon be passed by the House and be signed by \nthe President. The people impacted by Hurricane Sandy and other \ndisasters should not be kept waiting for their Nation to provide \nassistance. I hope we will be able to provide the funds for those in \nneed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as we now move to final passage on this \nbill, I believe Senator Cochran and I, on a bipartisan basis, could \nwrap up our statements.\n\n[[Page S8486]]\n\n  Mr. President, we are now moving to final passage, and I know this \nbill will provide immediate relief to our constituents. I urge the \nadoption of the bill.\n  I thank Senator Cochran, the ranking member on this bill, for his \ncourtesy.\n  I want to say to my colleagues that Senator Inouye would have been \nreally proud of the way we acted today.

Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate the people who \nworked\n\n[[Page S8497]]\n\nso hard on this bill. We appreciate the new chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee and the good work she did; the work done by the New York \ndelegation, led by Senator Schumer; and the work done by the New Jersey \ndelegation. This is extremely fine legislation. I really appreciate all \ntheir hard work, and the cooperation we got from the Republicans was \nwonderful.\n  The people in New England suffered a tremendous blow caused by \nnature. As has happened during the entire history of this country when \nthat sort of devastation has occurred, Congress stepped in to do \nsomething to help the beleaguered people. In this case, it is New York, \nNew Jersey, and some other States, but they were the ones hit the \nhardest. Even now, hundreds of thousands of people are without homes, \nso I hope the House takes this up very quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/28/senate-section/article/S8497-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we now move to \na period of morning business, with Senators allowed to speak for up to \n10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments on what has \ntranspired today on the floor of the Senate.\n  First, some enormously important work has been done in regard to \naddressing the disaster caused by Hurricane Sandy. I know that in a \nnumber of States unprecedented devastation has occurred, and we should \nrespond extremely quickly--more quickly than we have. I hope the House \nwill immediately take up this package. Certainly, disaster relief \ndelayed is disaster relief denied. So I hope the House will indeed move \nextremely quickly to address the devastation throughout the Northeast.\n  I also wanted to note that tonight 55 Senators stood and said: As we \nassist the victims of Hurricane Sandy, we should also assist the \nvictims of unprecedented drought and fires that devastated much of our \ncountry this last summer.\n  How is it, we might wonder, that we had devastating fires in July and \nAugust and into September and devastating drought and we still haven't \napproved the disaster assistance? I must say it is 100 percent \nunacceptable.\n  If you lost your ranch in a fire, if you lost your fencing, if you \nlost your corn, if you lost your livestock, and a program that would \nhave helped that has always been in place for disaster assistance \nwasn't reauthorized, then you have been stranded since June or July or \nAugust. Perhaps in that interim you have lost your farm, perhaps you \nhave lost your ranch, perhaps you have mortgaged everything to hold on. \nYet here is the Senate saying: Hey, it is OK that we are not helping \nyou now because, you know what. We are going to help you in the farm \nbill.\n  Where is the farm bill? It is not on the President's desk. It is not \nen route to the President's desk. It has not even been brought up on \nthe floor of the House. A bipartisan group of Senators in this body \napproved the farm bill and had the disaster relief for our ranchers and \nfarmers in it and sent it over to the House, and it has never been \ndiscussed. That is completely unacceptable. It is a moral failure to \nleave those struck by disaster stranded.\n  Tonight 55 Senators agreed that it is unacceptable. We should help \nright now. But you know what. Under the budget point of order that was \nput forward, you needed 60 votes. We needed 60 votes tonight to help \nour ranchers and farmers. We only had 55.\n  Here is the interesting point. This budget point of order is supposed \nto be about saving money, but this body already approved all of those \ndisaster relief programs in the farm bill, and when that farm bill is \ndone, we are assured tonight that these provisions will be maintained, \nthat we will assist our ranchers and farmers. Thus, we will not save a \ndime. There is not a dime saved because the same program will \neventually be approved. But the relief will be coming so late to the \nvictims of the drought and the victims of the fire who lost their \nlivestock and their forage and their fences.\n  Tonight, what happened for those 40 who voted against helping our \nranchers and farmers is they did not save a penny, but they did \nenormous damage to citizens across this country, ranchers and farmers \nwho were counting on us.\n  I rise to say that I deeply regret the Senate's decision tonight. I \ndeeply regret the 40 votes against our ranchers and farmers. I deeply \nregret that 40 said: Even though it will not save a dime, we are going \nto hold them hostage to the farm bill, to its eventual passage someday. \nHolding people hostage who have been victims of disaster is morally \nunacceptable.\n  Again, I thank the 55 tonight who voted on the bipartisan amendment. \nMy partner on the Republican side of the aisle, Senator Blunt, should \nbe profoundly complimented for stepping in to help carry this charge. I \nwas pleased to be his partner. I was pleased to be a partner with \nSenator Stabenow, chair of the Agriculture Committee, who worked \nclosely with us to arrange for this Senate amendment to be possible \ntonight, to be able to have this vote. I thank her, and I thank Senator \nBlunt. I thank the other Senate cosponsors, and I thank everyone who \nvoted tonight to say that disaster relief should no longer be delayed \nfor the victims of the fires and droughts of the summer of 2012.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/28/senate-section/article/S8497-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8497-S8498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING DANIEL K. INOUYE\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to bid \n``Aloha'' to an extraordinary colleague and a dear friend, Senator \nDaniel K. Inouye.\n  I want to first and foremost offer my most sincere condolences to \nDan's exceptional wife, Irene, who has been a pillar of unending \nstrength and courage, as well Ken and Jennifer, both of whom he spoke \nof with boundless love, and of course, his entire family, as our hearts \ngo out to them during this most difficult time.\n  On an occasion of such a large and historic loss, finding the \nappropriate words to capture the immense depth and breadth of this \nmoment, as well as the magnitude of its meaning, represents the most \ndaunting of challenges. As Dan was the most senior member of this \nesteemed Chamber, and the second longest serving Senator in its \nhistory, every Senator here never known this institution without him--\nand so it is difficult to comprehend that these hallowed halls will \nnever again witness his presence or hear his deliberative, \ncompassionate, and measured approach.\n  Like all my colleagues, I profoundly admired Dan for his devotion to \nthis country and the steadfast, irrepressible determination that he \nexhibited day in and day out, as he sought to better our Nation not \nonly for his constituents in his beloved home State of Hawaii, but for \nall who called America home. But that is who Dan was, and throughout \nhis remarkable life, he placed the highest of premiums on service above \nself.\n  He did on the shores of Honolulu when, having heard the clarion call \nof sirens ringing out across the island as Japanese planes attacked \nAmerican naval forces at Pearl Harbor, he rushed toward the battle to \nvolunteer as a Red Cross medic. He did on the battlefields in Italy \nduring the Second World War, when having taken sniper fire and enduring \na gruesome explosion that would later claim his right arm, he refused \nto evacuate, pressing forward to neutralize enemy positions so that he \ncould lead his men to safe ground--an act of heroism and valor which \nlater rightfully earned him the Distinguished Service Cross and the \nMedal of Honor.\n\n[[Page S8498]]\n\n  Those acts of valor, which spoke to Dan's intrinsic and abiding \nconcern for others, distinguished him throughout his life. In fact, it \nmotivated him at every turn in Congress, where he cared not about \nscoring political points, but about doing what was right. In times rife \nwith partisanship, he proved the rare exception, bringing to bear his \nprincipled voice of reason, as well as his enormous credibility, his \ngravitas, and his vast experience to rise above the rancorous din that \nall too often envelops us here in Washington.\n  Indeed, Dan legislated with uncommon civility and candor, ability and \nefficacy, as well as the most seriousness of purpose and irrepressible \ngood humor. It is no wonder, then, why the people of Hawaii, since \nachieving statehood in 1959, have repeatedly and overwhelmingly \nreturned Dan to Congress for over half a century, entrusting him not \nonly to be their voice and their vote, but their champion.\n  And that is precisely what he was--a legislative stalwart and \ntireless advocate for his beloved home State, fighting fiercely on \nbehalf of his fellow Hawaiians. Whether strengthening vital \ninfrastructure, increasing job training and employment opportunities \nacross the islands, or supporting veterans, he united a workhorse-like \nlegislative craftsmanship with his legendary statesmanship to not only \ndeliver on behalf of Hawaii, but ensure that his State, despite its \ngeographical location, was on the vanguard of modernism.\n  In fact, I can still well-recall traveling to Afghanistan, Pakistan, \nand Uzbekistan with Senator Inouye and Senator Ted Stevens--who shared \na remarkable friendship themselves--as part of a five-member Senate \ndelegation in February of 2002, just 4 months after the horrific \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. One of the first American \ndelegations to travel to Afghanistan after the tragedy, we consulted \nwith NATO leaders to discuss international support for anti-terrorism \nefforts worldwide and met with President Pervez Musharref of Pakistan \nand Chairman Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan to signal America's commitment \nto defeating terrorism. And Dan was instrumental in these formative \npost-9/11 efforts in combating the combat the scourge of terrorism.\n  And so as we reflect upon his unequaled career, we as a people and as \na Nation can find solace in knowing that he has left to us an \nincredible legacy of service that will not only resonate for \ngenerations to come, but that will inspire all of those who are \nfortunate to follow in his footsteps, just as it has inspired all of us \nwho have had the privilege of serving with him.\n  Perhaps most importantly, though, he was indisputably what our \nforefathers quite likely had in mind when they envisioned a United \nStates Senator, and his beloved Aloha State--and indeed our Nation--\ncould not have asked for a more eloquent and powerful champion fighting \non their behalf. I will most certainly always remember the sincerity \nand warmth of our conversations and forever treasure our friendship.\n  As I conclude, today, I remember a powerful statement of Senator \nInouye's, which speaks to his unparalleled humility and integrity. \nHaving recently been asked how he hoped history would remember him, he \nreplied, ``I represented the people of Hawaii and this nation honestly \nand to the best of my ability. I think I did okay.''\n  Mr. President, I believe, as do my colleagues, that history will \nrecall Senator Inouye as one of our most distinguished and iconic \nlegislators, and just as he joins the pantheon of exemplary leaders who \nhave shaped our Nation for the better, his memory will, too, forever \nlive on in the collective heart of an eternally grateful Nation. \nIndeed, the Senate, the State of Hawaii, and the Nation, are \nimmeasurably enhanced by his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/28/senate-section/article/S8498-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8498-S8504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to the \nSenators who will not be returning when the 113th Congress commences \nnext month. I have already spoken about Senator Kyl and about Senator \nInouye, one of the truly great Americans and giants of this \ninstitution. At the time of his death, Senator Inouye was just a few \nweeks short of celebrating 50 years of Senate service. Only Senator \nByrd served in this institution longer.\n  Turnover is a natural occurrence, but it's important to acknowledge \nthat the Senators who are departing have served in the Senate for a \ncombined total of 237 years, or nearly 20 years per Senator, on \naverage. Add Senator Inouye, and the total is close to 300 years. That \nservice represents an enormous amount of expertise on issues ranging \nfrom national defense and foreign affairs to the Federal budget to \nenergy policy. The departing Senators will also take with them vast \ninstitutional knowledge and bipartisan friendships and working \nrelationships that will leave a void we will need to fill.\n\n\n                              Daniel Akaka\n\n  Mr. President, Daniel Akaka was born on September 11, 1924 just 4 \ndays after Senator Inouye and, like Senator Inouye, he overcame the \nprejudice and hostility directed at Asian Americans following the \nattack on Pearl Harbor to serve with distinction in the U.S. Army \nduring World War II. Senator Akaka was a civilian worker in the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers from 1943 to 1945. Then, he was on Active Duty \nin the Army from 1945 to 1947.\n  After Senator Akaka finished his military service, he devoted his \ncareer to education, first as a teacher and then as a principal and \nlater as an official in the State of Hawaii Department of Education. He \nwas first elected to the House of Representatives in 1976 and then \nappointed to the Senate in 1990 upon the death of former Senator Spark \nMatsunaga. He won an election that November with nearly 54 percent of \nthe vote, and was re-elected to the Senate in 1994, 2000, and 2006, \ntwice receiving over 70 percent of the popular vote and never dropping \nbelow 61 percent.\n  Senator Akaka is America's first Senator of Native Hawaiian ancestry, \nand the only Chinese-American Member of the Senate. He chairs the \nIndian Affairs Committee and, like Senator Inouye, he has been a \nstalwart supporter of Native Americans, Native Alaskans, Pacific \nIslanders, Asian Americans, and Native Hawaiians. One of his highest \npriorities has been to secure passage of the Native Hawaiian Government \nReorganization Act, S. 675. That bill was just placed on the \nlegislative calendar and hotlined, we need to get it across the finish \nline in the waning days of the 112th Congress. It's the right thing to \ndo.\n  I have been privileged to work with Senator Akaka on efforts to \nprotect the Federal workforce. Federal employees have no greater \nchampion than Senator Akaka, who has chaired the Homeland Security & \nGovernmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement. Senator Akaka is committed to making the Federal government \nan employer of choice capable of attracting and retaining the best and \nthe brightest. In 2009, he introduced the Telework Enhancement Act, \nwhich became law in 2010 and expands telework opportunities at \nexecutive agencies. Senator Akaka has also fought to create a culture \nof transparency and fairness in the Federal Government, authoring the \nWhistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, which I was proud to \ncosponsor. President Obama signed that bill into law last month. And \nSenator Akaka has been a civil rights champion, partnering with \nSenators Lieberman, Collins, me, and others to support domestic partner \nbenefits.\n  I also appreciate Senator Akaka's determined advocacy for financial \nliteracy and consumer protections. His Credit Card Minimum Payment \nWarning Act was included in the 2009 Credit CARD Act. Now, thanks to \nSenator Akaka, credit card bills must include a disclosure box to show \nconsumers how long it will take to repay their entire balance if they \nonly make minimum monthly payments. The so-called ``Akaka Box'' also \nlets consumers know how much it will cost to pay off their outstanding \nbalance within 36 months, which is a typical length of a debt \nmanagement plan. Senator Akaka was also an author of portions of the \nDodd-Frank Act addressing financial literacy (establishing the Office \nof Financial Education within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) \nand investor protections.\n  Throughout Senator Akaka's long and distinguished career in Congress, \nhe has also been an ardent environmentalist. As a former chairman of \nthe\n\n[[Page S8499]]\n\nSubcommittee on National Parks, legislation he authored has created, \nexpanded, or otherwise improved each of Hawaii's national parks. His \nHawaii Tropical Forest Recovery Act established the Hawaii Experimental \nTropical Forest in order to promote the recovery of tropical forests in \nHawaii and undertake needed research to better protect tropical forests \naround the world.\n  A hallmark of Senator Akaka, like Senator Inouye, is his soft-spoken \nand courteous manner. The Senators from Hawaii have always treated the \nrest of us with respect and graciousness. They have reached across the \naisle to foster bipartisan cooperation. And they have exhibited a rare \nand calming serenity when partisan tempers have boiled over. I will \nmiss the warm and gentle and friendly personalities of Senators Akaka \nand Inouye, their wise counsel, and their service here in the United \nStates Senate on behalf of Hawaiians and all Americans.\n\n\n                             Jeff Bingaman\n\n  Mr. President, Jeff Bingaman is another Senator whose quiet demeanor \nbelies his tremendous skill and effectiveness as a legislator. Senator \nBingaman and I were born 2 days apart October 3 and October 5, 1943, \nrespectively. Both of Senator Bingaman's parents were teachers, which \nmay help explain his interest and involvement in educational policy. He \ngraduated from a public school in a small town in New Mexico and then \nwent to Harvard for his bachelor of arts degree and Stanford for his \nlaw degree. From 1968 to 1974, he served in the U.S. Army Reserve and \nin 1978, he was elected attorney general of New Mexico. Senator \nBingaman was first elected to the Senate in 1982 and then won \nreelection four times, only once dipping below receiving at least 61 \npercent of the popular vote.\n  Senator Bingaman has worked on everything from drop-out prevention in \nschools with low student achievement and graduation rates to phasing \nout the waiting period for disabled individuals to become eligible for \nMedicare benefits and to eliminate it for people with life-threatening \nconditions to the establishment of ARPA-E the Advanced Research \nProjects Agency at the Department of Energy.\n  Earlier this month, the Energy Information Administration, EIA, \nreported that with improved efficiency of energy use and a shift away \nfrom the most carbon-intensive fuels, U.S. energy-related carbon \ndioxide, CO2, emissions are likely to remain more than 5 \npercent below their 2005 level through 2040. Emissions from motor \ngasoline will decline as a result of the adoption of fuel economy \nstandards, biofuel mandates, and shifts in consumer behavior. Emissions \nfrom coal used in the generation of electricity will decline as power \ngeneration shifts from coal to lower-carbon fuels, including natural \ngas and renewables. These are all significant accomplishments, made \npossible largely by Senator Bingaman's steady hand at the helm of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, where he has helped to shape \nand pass all of the major energy bills for over the past decade.\n  In 2009, Senator Bingaman shepherded the Omnibus Public Land \nManagement Act to passage. That legislation added wilderness protection \nto over 2 million acres, designated 1,100 miles of wild and scenic \nrivers, and added more than 2,800 miles to the national trail system. I \nbelieve it was the biggest wildness bill Congress has ever enacted \nafter the original Wilderness Act of 1964 and the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act of 1980. The epitaph on the stone \nplaque where the great English architect Sir Christopher Wren is buried \nreads, ``If you seek his monument, look around you.'' The same could be \nsaid for Senator Bingaman with regard to the preservation of our \nnatural world.\n  Two weeks ago, Senator Bingaman gave his farewell speech to the \nSenate and I would like to quote from the beginning of that speech. He \nremarked,\n\n       In 1981, in his first inaugural address, President Reagan \n     said, ``Government is not the solution to our problem; \n     government is the problem.''\n       I came to the Senate two years later in 1983 with the firm \n     belief that in most cases his statement was wrong.\n       I believed then and I believe now that the Federal \n     Government can be a constructive force for good; in \n     protecting and maintaining the civil liberties of all \n     Americans, in maintaining and strengthening our economy, in \n     protecting our environment and in helping Americans live \n     productive and fulfilling lives.\n\n  I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Bingaman and am grateful that for \nthe past 30 years in public service, he has lived by those words and \nbeliefs.\n\n\n                              Scott Brown\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Brown shook the political establishment when \nhe won a special election in 2010 to replace the late Senator Ted \nKennedy. Senator Brown was the first Republican to win a Senate race in \nMassachusetts since Senator Edward Brooke won re-election in 1972. \nSenator Brown previously served in the Massachusetts State House of \nRepresentatives from 1998 to 2004 and then in the State Senate from \n2004-2010.\n  Senator Brown has been here just a short time, but he has been in the \n``thick of things'', given his willingness to reach across the aisle. \nAccording to Congressional Quarterly, he has the second-most bipartisan \nvoting record in the Senate, and helped the majority pass the Stop \nTrading on Congressional Knowledge, STOCK, Act, which he co-authored; \nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which \nwas passed with exactly 60 votes; the repeal of the Department of \nDefense's ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy; the Hiring Incentives to \nRestore Employment, HIRE, Act, and the New START Treaty. In the wake of \nthe horrific shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, \nConnecticut, Senator Brown was one of the first Republicans to express \nhis support for reinstating the assault weapons ban. On a more \nparochial note, I would note that 9 months ago he started serving as an \nactive member of the Maryland National Guard, and we are grateful for \nhis service.\n\n\n                              Kent Conrad\n\n  Mr. President, few, if any, other Senators have devoted as much time \nand energy as Senator Kent Conrad has to trying to balance the Federal \nbudget. There are few more important--or difficult--tasks. The Senate \nwill miss his steady hand as chairman of the Budget Committee and his \nexpertise on budgetary and fiscal matters as a former tax commissioner \nfor the State of North Dakota.\n  As Senator Conrad likes to note, he was 16 years old when he sat in \nthe visitors gallery to this Chamber, listened to former Senator Hubert \nHumphrey speak on the Civil Rights Act, and decided that he wanted to \nbe a United States Senator. Not only did he make that decision, he \ncommitted himself to running for a Senate seat in 1986 or 1988. After \nSenator Conrad received degrees from Stanford University and George \nWashington University, he worked as an assistant to our former \ncolleague, Byron Dorgan, who was the North Dakota Tax Commissioner from \n1969 to 1980. He succeeded Senator Dorgan as tax commissioner but beat \nhim to the Senate, defeating Republican incumbent Mark Andrews, who had \nrepresented North Dakota as a Representative or Senator since 1963. \nSenator Conrad won that election in 1986. As he remarked in his \nfarewell speech, ``That is the power of a plan.''\n  Senator Conrad pledged that he would not seek re-election in 1992 if \nthe Federal budget deficit had not declined by the end of his term. He \nhonored that pledge. But North Dakotans, to their credit, encouraged \nhim to run in a special election that year to fill the remainder of \nSenator Quentin Burdick's term. Senator Burdick, the State's senior \nSenator at the time, had died in September 1992. Byron Dorgan was \nelected to replace Senator Conrad, and Senator Conrad was elected to \nreplace Senator Burdick. He was re-elected three times, with 58 \npercent, 61 percent, and nearly 69 percent of the vote, respectively. \nThis is an extraordinary political accomplishment in a largely \nRepublican State and a testament to Senator Conrad and the discernment \nof North Dakota voters.\n  Agriculture is the single biggest component of the North Dakota \neconomy. Senator Conrad has successfully fought to make sure farm \nprograms benefit North Dakota's farmers and ranchers, from winning \nformula fights on drought legislation in his first term to leading the \ncharge for disaster assistance in the late 1990s and playing a leading \nrole in writing the 2002 and 2008 farm bills. North Dakota receives far \nmore farm program benefits, on a per\n\n[[Page S8500]]\n\ncapita basis, than any other State, and they have helped produce \nprosperity in farm country. Senator Conrad has also brought hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to North Dakota to develop water supply and flood \nprotection projects. Key victories include passage of the Dakota Water \nResources Act to bring Federal legislation in line with North Dakota's \ncontemporary water needs, ensuring Federal help to protect Fargo \nagainst record spring flooding, and securing over $1 billion to rebuild \nGrand Forks and build new flood controls following the 1997 flood, an \nadditional $1 billion to respond to the ongoing, devastating flooding \nin the Devils Lake basin, and a final $1 billion to respond to the \nrecord breaking 2011 flooding in Minot.\n  While Senator Conrad has been a leader on farm and energy policies, \nhe has been the leader on budget policies as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and a senior member of the Finance Committee. Six years ago, \nhe teamed with former Republican Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire to \npropose a bipartisan commission to tackle the debt. That idea \nultimately prompted President Barack Obama to create the National \nCommission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, also known as the \nBowles-Simpson (or Simpson-Bowles) Commission after its co-chairs, \nformer Republican Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming and former White \nHouse Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, in 2010. Senator Conrad was \nappointed to the Commission and has subsequently served in the \nbipartisan ``Gang of Six'' and ``Gang of Eight'' groups of Senators \nattempting to find a budget compromise that would forestall the tax \nincreases and automatic spending cuts scheduled to commence on January \n1, 2013.\n  Senator Conrad has been indefatigable in his pursuit of sound \nbudgetary and fiscal policies. He has brought a soberness to the \nsubject, along with his trademark patience and extraordinary ability to \ndiscuss complex budget issues and large numbers in a way that is \naccessible to everyone accompanied, of course, by his myriad charts! \nSenator Conrad has always promoted a balanced approach to addressing \nour budget deficits that includes higher revenues, spending cuts, and \nappropriate entitlement reform. The Bowles-Simpson Commission's report, \nwhich he helped draft, should serve as a blueprint for Congressional \naction.\n  No matter how arduous the budget negotiations become, Senator Conrad \nis eternally optimistic. As he noted in his farewell speech,\n\n       I think we all know our country needs a plan now, and we \n     know plans have worked before. I was here in 1993 when we had \n     just come off the largest deficit in the history of the \n     United States. The country was in the doldrums. The economy \n     was just plugging along, not doing very well, we had a weak \n     recovery from a deep recession, and we passed a plan to get \n     the country back on track. We did it the old-fashioned way. \n     We made tough decisions, some that were unpopular, but it was \n     the right thing to do and it worked. We balanced the budget. \n     We had the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in \n     the Nation's history. Twenty-three million jobs were created, \n     and we were actually paying down the debt of the United \n     States at the end of the Clinton administration.\n\n  I share Senator Conrad's fervent hope that his farewell speech won't \nbe his final Senate speech; he indicated that he will take to the floor \nagain if we reach agreements in the next few days on the 2012 farm bill \nand the so-called fiscal cliff negotiations. If we do find a way \nforward, Senator Conrad will have played a key role in both instances. \nIt has been my honor to serve on the Budget Committee under Senator \nConrad's leadership.\n\n\n                          Kay bailey Hutchison\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison has been shattering glass \nceilings her entire life in a career that has spanned law, banking, TV \nnews reporting, owning a small business, and politics. She was one of \nfive women in her University of Texas Law School class. She was the \nfirst Republican woman elected to the Texas House of Representatives. \nIn 1990, she became state treasurer--the first Texas Republican woman \nelected to statewide office. Her 1993 special election victory to \nsucceed Senator Lloyd Bentsen made her the first--and only--woman to \nrepresent Texas in the Senate. She was re-elected in 1994, 2000, and \n2006, receiving over 60 percent of the popular vote in each instance. \nIn 2001, she was named one of the 30 most powerful women in America by \nLadies Home Journal.\n  Senator Hutchison was the Senate architect of our military forces' \ntransformation from Cold War-based forward basing, with extensive \noverseas infrastructure, to a strategically balanced approach that \nemphasizes rapidly deployable military forces based at large, modern, \ncentrally located U.S. military installations. As chair of the Military \nConstruction Appropriations Subcommittee, she has played a crucial role \nin developing larger, soldier- and family-friendly U.S. installations \nand improving the quality of life and the quality of health care for \nour servicemen and women and their families. As ranking member of the \nSenate Commerce Committee, Senator Hutchison authored major legislation \nin 2005 and 2010 to create a balanced, bipartisan blueprint for \nAmerica's post-Shuttle space program. She also protected $100 billion \nscience and research investment in the International Space Station by \npaving way for commercial crews. Senator Hutchison is one of Senate's \nleading advocates for bolstering the Nation's science and technology \neducation and competitiveness. In 2007, she co-sponsored the America \nCOMPETES Act, which included her legislation to allow college students \nmajoring in science, technology, engineering or mathematics--STEM--to \nbe concurrently certified as elementary and secondary school teachers.\n  Senator Hutchison has been a strong voice for women's economic \nempowerment and family-supporting tax policies. She joined with my \ncolleague, Senator Mikulski, in sponsoring the Homemaker IRA \nlegislation, which was enacted in 1997 and allows affected spouses to \nmake equal, $2,000, fully deductible contributions to individual \nretirement accounts, IRAs. She also successfully advocated for \nelimination of the marriage tax penalty. In 1975, while she was serving \nin the Texas House of Representatives, she sponsored pioneering \nlegislation to protect rape victims by redefining consent and shielding \nthem from invasive personal questions that implied ``blaming the \nvictim.'' The Texas law became the national model for state laws to \nprotect rape victims. In 2003, here in the Senate, she won passage of \nbill that created the national Amber Alert; more than 550 abducted \nchildren have since been reunited with their parents.\n  Senator Hutchison is also an accomplished author. In 2000, she and \nother woman Senators co-authored Nine and Counting: The Women of the \nSenate. In 2004, she wrote American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who \nShaped Our Country, which was followed in 2007 by the bestselling book, \nLeading Ladies: American Trailblazers. I'm not sure, but I believe she \nis the only sitting U.S. Senator to have appeared on an episode of \nWalker, Texas Ranger with Chuck Norris!\n  Senator Hutchison has a solid conservative voting record and outlook. \nShe is thoughtful, accessible, and collaborative. These qualities and \nher hard work have made her an outstanding Senator. We will miss her.\n\n\n                               Herb Kohl\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Herb Kohl embodies the American dream. His \nparents were Jewish immigrants from Poland and Russia who started a \nchain of grocery and department stores. Senator Kohl earned a Bachelor \nof Arts degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1956 and a Master of \nBusiness Administration, MBA, degree from Harvard Business School in \n1958. Between 1958 and 1964, Senator Kohl was a member of the United \nStates Army Reserve. Senator Kohl had a highly successful business \ncareer before he was elected to the Senate in 1988 with 52 percent of \nthe vote. In each successive re-election effort, his share of the \npopular vote rose, all the way up to more than 67 percent in 2006.\n  I have served with Senator Kohl on the Judiciary Committee and have \nseen firsthand his commitment to ensuring the fairness of our legal \nsystem.\n  Senator Kohl introduced legislation to create a tax credit for \nemployer-provided child care after Congress passed the welfare reform \nbill in 1996, to help families move from welfare to work. The credit \nwas codified in section 45F of the Internal Revenue Code as part of the \npackage of tax cuts passed in 2001. Section 45F offers a tax credit for \n25 percent of what it costs a business to\n\n[[Page S8501]]\n\nbuild and maintain an on-site child care facility and 10 percent of \ntheir expenses for child care resource and referral services. It is \ncapped at $150,000 a year per company to target the benefit to small \nbusinesses.\n  Throughout his career, Senator Kohl has championed the National \nInstitute of Standards & Technology's Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership Program, MEP, a public-private partnership that provides \ntechnical support to small and medium manufacturers. Since MEP arrived \nin Wisconsin in 1998, its two centers have created or retained over \n13,000 high quality manufacturing jobs with almost $2 billion in \neconomic impact throughout the State. In 2007 and 2010, Senator Kohl \nintroduced bipartisan legislation to authorize appropriations for MEP \nand, in both instances, those bills became public law: the former as \npart of the America COMPETES Act of 2007; the latter as part of the \nAmerican COMPETES Reauthorization of 2010. For over a decade, and \ndespite budgetary pressures, MEP has received the resources it needs to \ncontinue to help small manufacturers in Wisconsin and across the \nnation, prompting the American Small Manufacturers Coalition to name \nSenator Kohl a ``champion for small manufacturers.''\n  Senator Kohl's quiet but effective contributions to our Nation aren't \nlimited to his service here in the Senate. He is a committed \nphilanthropist, too. For instance, he donated $25 million to the \nUniversity of Wisconsin at Madison for the construction of its new \nsports arena. It was the largest single donation in University's \nhistory. In 1990, he established the Herb Kohl Educational Foundation \nAchievement Award Program, which provides annual grants totaling \n$100,000 to 100 graduating seniors, 100 teachers, and 100 schools \nthroughout Wisconsin. And he is much beloved in his hometown for \npurchasing the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team in 1985 to prevent the \nteam from being moved to another city.\n\n\n                             Joe Lieberman\n\n  Mr. President, few Senators have struck as independent a path in \nrecent years as Senator Joe Lieberman. He was the first prominent \nDemocrat to chastise then-President Bill Clinton for his affair with \nMonica Lewinsky but did not support removing the President from office. \nHe was the Democratic Party's nominee to be Vice President in 2000--the \nfirst Jewish candidate on a national party ticket in American history. \nSenator Lieberman has confounded people because he has been willing to \nfollow his conscience and to place principle over party loyalty.\n  Senator Lieberman is a proud son of Connecticut. His parents ran a \nliquor store in Stamford; both his paternal and maternal grandparents \nwere immigrants from Poland and Austria, respectively. He graduated \nfrom Yale University--the first member of his family to graduate from \ncollege--and then received his law degree from Yale Law School. In \n1970, when Senator Lieberman was just 28, he was elected to the \nConnecticut State Senate as a ``reform Democrat''. He served in the \nState senate for 10 years, including six as majority leader. In 1982, \nhe won the first of two terms as Connecticut's Attorney General, and \nwas immensely popular for championing environmental and consumer \nprotection.\n  Senator Lieberman pulled off perhaps the biggest upset of the 1988 \nelection cycle when he defeated incumbent Republican Senator Lowell \nWeicker in a close race, winning by just 10,000 votes. But 6 years \nlater, when Democrats lost control of both houses of Congress, Senator \nLieberman won re-election with over 67 percent of the vote. In 2000, \nwhile he simultaneously ran for Vice President, he received over 63 \npercent of the vote for the Senate seat he held.\n  Here in the Senate, Senator Lieberman has been a strong advocate of \nrecruiting, training, and equipping a 21st century fighting force and \nusing it to defend America's security, values, and interests. Senator \nLieberman was one of five Democrats to co-sponsor S.J. Res. 2, which \nauthorized the use of force in the first Gulf War in 1991. He partnered \nwith Senator McCain to push for U.S. intervention in the Balkans in the \n1990s, and he was a proponent of former President George W. Bush's \n``surge'' strategy in Iraq.\n  Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Senator \nLieberman led the charge to establish the 9/11 Commission, whose \nmission was to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances \nsurrounding the attacks. Then, in response to the Commission's \nrecommendations, Senator Lieberman worked with Senator Susan Collins to \nimplement the largest reorganization of the intelligence community in \nover half a century. As Chairman of the Government Affairs Committee, \nSenator Lieberman led Congressional efforts to establish the Department \nof Homeland Security, which integrated all or part of 22 different \nFederal departments and agencies. He has since continued to oversee the \nDepartment's work in his position as ranking member of the Committee \nbetween 2003 and 2006 and as Chairman again since 2007.\n  Senator Lieberman is a committed environmentalist. He played a key \nrole in drafting and passing the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, which \nestablished the sulfur dioxide ``cap and trade'' program to combat acid \nrain, one of the most successful programs in history. He has introduced \nevery major climate change bill in the Senate, and every bill that has \nbeen brought to the floor for a vote. In 1994, Senator Lieberman worked \nwith then-representative Nancy Johnson, a Republican, to secure Wild \nand Scenic River status for the Upper Farmington River, the first in \nthe State of Connecticut. He has led several successful filibusters \nagainst legislation that would have opened the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, ANWR, to oil and gas exploration; he also has introduced \nlegislation every two years to protect ANWR permanently.\n  In 1994, Senator Lieberman introduced the Video Game Ratings Act, \nheld hearings on violence in video games, and played an important role \nin establishing a rating system and restricting sales of mature games \nto minors. In the wake of the terrible tragedy at the Sandy Hook \nElementary School in Newtown, CT, he has called for the creation of a \nnational commission to study gun violence in a comprehensive way. In \n1998, Senator Lieberman introduced and helped pass the Charter School \nExpansion Act, which expanded the number of high-quality charter \nschools available to children across the United States. Three years \nlater, he was a lead sponsor of the No Child Left Behind legislation, \nNCLB. Because of his involvement, he was invited to join the NCLB \nconference committee despite not serving on the committee of \njurisdiction. In 2007, Senator Lieberman was a lead sponsor of the \nNational Innovation Act and the National Innovation Education Act. \nThese were underlying pieces of the final American COMPETES Act, \nintended to spur innovation and ensure that our workforce has the \neducation and skills necessary to compete in a global economy. In 2010, \nSenator Lieberman led the successful fight to repeal the Department of \nDefense's ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy. He also has introduced \nlegislation to provide domestic partnership benefits to federal \nemployees, and was an original cosponsor of the Employment Non-\nDiscrimination Act.\n  Senator Lieberman is a highly accomplished Senator because he has put \npragmatism above ideology and because he has been willing to forge \nbipartisan alliances and compromises. He is a deeply religious man \nwhose motto might well be the prophet Isaiah's plaintive cry, ``Come \nnow, and let us reason together'' (Isaiah 1:18). The Senate will miss \nhis devotion to public service, cheerfulness, and optimism.\n\n\n                             Richard Lugar\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Richard Lugar isn't just one of our leading \nSenators; he's one of the Nation's greatest statesmen over the past \nquarter-century. We have been fortunate indeed to have Senator Lugar at \nthe helm of the Foreign Relations Committee, either as chairman or \nranking member, for so many years. He is quite literally a gentleman \nand a scholar. After graduating first in his class from high school and \nfrom Denison University, he attended Pembroke College at Oxford as a \nRhodes Scholar, where he earned a second bachelor's degree and a \nmaster's degree in 1956. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1956 to 1960, \nearning the rank of Lieutenant, Junior Grade. While he was in the Navy, \nhe was an intelligence briefer for Admiral Arleigh Burke.\n\n[[Page S8502]]\n\n  To this day, Senator Lugar shows his fifth generation Hoosier roots, \nmanaging the family's 600-acre corn, soybean, and tree farm. When he \nwas just 35, he was elected Mayor of Indianapolis and served two highly \nsuccessful terms and was elected President of the National League of \nCities in 1971. Senator Lugar defeated incumbent Senator Vance Hartke \nin 1976 with 60 percent of the vote in a year when the Democratic \ncandidate for president, Jimmy Carter, won the election. He was re-\nelected five times. On three of those occasions, he received well over \n60 percent of the vote. In 2006, he received over 87 percent of the \nvote while Democrats were recapturing control of Congress for the first \ntime in 12 years.\n  Before Senator Lugar chaired the Foreign Relations Committee, he \nchaired the Agriculture Committee, during which time he authored the \n1996 Farm bill. He established a biofuels research program to help \nincrease U.S. utilization of ethanol and combustion fuels, and led \ninitiatives to streamline the U.S. Department of Agriculture, reform \nthe Food Stamp Program, and preserve the Federal school lunch program. \nOver the course of his career, he has been deeply involved in food \nsecurity issues, both domestically and around the globe.\n  Senator Lugar generally holds conservative economic views, but he \nsupports President Obama's DREAM Act and certain restrictions on gun \nownership. He was the first Republican Senator to announce his support \nfor President Obama's first Supreme Court nominee, U.S. Circuit Court \nof Appeals Judge Sonia Sotomayor. He also voted in favor of President \nObama's second Supreme Court nominee, Solicitor General Elena Kagan. I \nwas proud and privileged to work with Senator Lugar on an extractive \nindustries transparency provision that we are able to include in the \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act. And I have \nlearned so much from Senator Lugar serving on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  In a long career of dazzling accomplishments, Senator Lugar has made \nhis greatest mark with respect to foreign affairs. In 2006, Time \nmagazine rated him as one of America's 10 Best Senators in an article \nentitled ``The Wise Man''. According to the article, Senator Lugar's \n``thinking has often proved to be ahead of the curve.'' He pushed for \ndemocratic governments in the Philippines and South Africa and the \ndevelopment of alternative fuels to reduce our reliance on foreign \nsupplies of oil in the 1980s. He has been influential in gaining Senate \nratification of treaties to reduce the world's use, production, and \nstockpiling of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. In 1991, he \ncollaborated with then-Senator Sam Nunn, a Democrat from Georgia and \nchairman of the Armed Service Committee, to eliminate latent weapons of \nmass destruction in the former Soviet Union. To date, the Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program has deactivated more than 7,500 \nnuclear warheads. Three months after the September 11, 2001 terrorist \nattacks on the United States, Senator Lugar enunciated the ``Lugar \nDoctrine'', which commits the United States to use ``all of its \nmilitary, diplomatic and economic power--without question--to ensure \nthat life threatening weapons of mass destruction everywhere are \naccounted, contained and destroyed'' and which ``asserts that the U.S. \nshould encourage democratic institutions and decrease dependence on \nforeign energy sources.'' Few, if any, people have done more than \nSenator Lugar over the past 36 years to ensure security, promote \nfreedom and peace, and reduce the threat of war.\n  In 2008, Senator Lugar received the Paul H. Douglas Ethics in \nGovernment Award, which is awarded by the University of Illinois \nInstitute of Government and Public Affairs. He gave a profound speech \non the nature of bipartisanship when he received that award. I think \nthe speech perfectly exemplifies Senator Lugar and his approach to \ngovernance, and I would exhort everyone to read it and take it to \nheart. This is part of what he said:\n\n       Too often bipartisanship is misrepresented as the byproduct \n     of moderate political views or the willingness to strike \n     deals. We should be clear that bipartisanship is not \n     centrism, and it is more than just compromise. It is a way of \n     approaching one's duties as a public servant that requires \n     self-reflection, discipline of study, and faith in the good \n     will of others.\n       I believe this type of independent self reflection and \n     discipline of thought is at the core of any politician's \n     attempt to be truly bipartisan. In today's political \n     environment, politicians are bombarded by demands from our \n     respective parties and loyalist groups to adopt certain \n     orthodox positions. To some extent this is a necessary \n     element of a two-party system. But when positions are adopted \n     purely on the basis of partisan advantage or strategic \n     opposition to the other party, our system begins to break \n     down. Some members may genuinely agree with their party 50 \n     percent of the time, others may genuinely agree with their \n     party 99 percent of the time. The question is whether a \n     politician arrives at those conclusions through honest \n     reflection and careful study of the issue or whether they \n     arrive there because they have adopted an ``us-versus-them'' \n     mentality. Increasingly at all levels of American politics, \n     capable leaders are succumbing to the temptation to put \n     politics first. . .\n       Particularly destructive is the misperception in some \n     quarters that governing with one vote more than 50 percent is \n     just as good or better than governing with 60 or 70 percent \n     support. Under this theory, the compromises necessary to \n     achieve greater consensus among the American people and \n     Congress merely dilutes the strength of one's partisan \n     accomplishments.\n       The problem with this thinking is that whatever is won \n     today through division is usually lost tomorrow. The \n     relationships that are destroyed and the ill will that is \n     created make subsequent achievements that much more \n     difficult. If the minority is not a participant, it begins to \n     see its job as frustrating the majority, rather than as \n     trying to advance its ideas or contributing to good \n     legislation. A 51 percent mentality deepens cynicism, \n     sharpens political vendettas, and depletes the national \n     reserve of good will that is critical to our survival in hard \n     times. Leaders should not content themselves with 51 percent \n     if they can expand a working majority through outreach, \n     judicious rhetoric, bipartisan alliances, and thoughtful \n     argumentation. National unity is not simply a civic nicety; \n     it counts in real policy terms. . . .\n\n  Senator Lugar concluded his speech by remarking that former Senator \nPaul Douglas' life ``provides us with an extraordinary example of what \ncan be achieved through thoughtful dedication to public service.'' The \nsame can be said for Senator Lugar.\n\n\n                               Ben Nelson\n\n  Mr. President, Senator Ben Nelson is a native Nebraskan who earned \nhis B.A., M.A., and J.D. degrees from the University of Nebraska at \nLincoln. He embarked on a highly successful career in the insurance \nindustry, working for Central National Insurance Group of Omaha. In \n1975, he became Nebraska's State insurance director before going back \nto work for Central National Insurance first as an executive vice \npresident, and then as president.\n  With regard to politics, Senator Nelson decided to start at the top. \nIn 1990, in his first run for office, he was elected as Governor of \nNebraska. In 1994, he was re-elected with 74 percent of the vote. \nDuring his tenure, he cut spending relative to the previous \nadministration by 64 percent, promoted legislation to cut crime through \nthe Safe Streets Act & Juvenile Crime Bill, advocated for low-income \nfamilies through the Kids Connection health care system, enacted \nwelfare reforms, and cut taxes for over 400,000 middle income Nebraska \nfamilies. He was forced to step down because of term limits, but then \nhe successfully ran for the Senate seat vacated by Senator Bob Kerrey. \nWhile that race was close, he was re-elected in 2006 with just under 64 \npercent of the vote.\n  Senator Nelson is a moderate to conservative Democrat, which is \nfitting given the conservative tilt of Nebraska voters. For the past 12 \nyears, he has frequently reached out to Republicans to try to get \nthings done. For instance, he was a member of the co-called ``Gang of \n14'' that helped to resolve the judicial nominations controversy in \n2005. He has worked hard to protect and promote the State's \nagricultural interests, becoming a champion of ethanol and farm-based \nalternative energy sources. He is a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee and has been at the center of shaping our Nation's defense \npolicies, securing a new headquarters for STRATCOM, and a new Veterans \nAdministration hospital for Nebraska's veterans.\n  Senator Nelson has always been true to his beliefs and true to his \nword, and it has been a pleasure to work with him. His desire to seek \nbipartisan compromise is a noble one. He likes to quote Henry Ford, who \nsaid, ``Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. \nWorking together is\n\n[[Page S8503]]\n\nsuccess''. Senator Nelson has always heeded those words; we would be \nwell-served to do likewise in his absence.\n\n\n                             Olympia Snowe\n\n  Mr. President, few people have faced the personal adversity Senator \nOlympia Snowe has overcome on her way to becoming the youngest \nRepublican woman ever elected to the United States House of \nRepresentatives; the first woman to have served in both houses of a \nstate legislature and both houses of the U.S. Congress, and the first \nGreek-American congresswoman. Senator Snowe, a first-generation \nAmerican, was orphaned at a young age and then her uncle, who was \nraising her with his family, died a few years later. Her first husband \nwas killed in a car accident when she was just 26 and, later, her 20-\nyear-old stepson died from a heart ailment. And yet, Senator Snowe \ndidn't just persevere. She ran for her late husband's seat in the Maine \nHouse of Representatives at the age of 26 and won. She was re-elected \nto the State House in 1974 and, in 1976, won election to the Maine \nSenate. She was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978, \nand represented Maine's 2nd Congressional District from 1979 to 1995.\n  Senator Snowe successfully ran for the seat vacated by former Senate \nMajority Leader George Mitchell in 1994, winning 60 percent of the \nvote. She was re-elected in 2000 and 2006, winning 69 percent and 74 \npercent of the vote, respectively. In nearly 40 years of holding \nelective office, Senator Snowe has never lost an election.\n  During her time in office, Senator Snowe has been a quintessential \nYankee Republican, putting her constituents and the Nation ahead of \npolitical party. While she served in the House, she was a member of the \nmoderate wing of the Republican Party known as Gypsy Moths, working \nwith southern Democrats known as Boll Weevils to forge bipartisan \nbudgets. Here in the Senate, she was a member of the Gang of 14. Prior \nto that, during the Senate's 1999 impeachment trial of then-President \nBill Clinton, she worked with her Maine colleague, Senator Susan \nCollins, to find a middle ground approach, drafting a motion that would \nhave allowed the Senate to vote separately on the charges and the \nremedy a ``finding of fact'' resolution. When the motion failed, \nSenator Snowe and Senator Collins demonstrated the courage of their \nconvictions by voting to acquit the President on the grounds that his \nactions didn't warrant his removal from office.\n  During consideration of the 2001 tax cuts, Senator Snowe worked with \nformer Senator Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat from Arkansas, to increase \nthe amount of the child tax credit and make it refundable, so that low \nincome families who don't earn enough to pay federal taxes could still \nbenefit from the credit, ensuring that it would assist an additional 13 \nmillion more children and lift 500,000 of those children out of \npoverty. But 2 years later, she joined Senators Lincoln Chafee and John \nMcCain as the only Republicans to oppose the 2003 tax cuts. Pragmatism, \nnot fealty to a rigid political ideology, has been her guiding \nprinciple.\n  Senator Snowe was one of eight Republican Senators to vote to repeal \nthe ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy. Although she represents a largely \nrural, pro-hunting State, she has supported sensible gun control \nmeasures. She teamed with our former colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy, to \nco-author the landmark Genetic Nondiscrimination Act, which prevents \ninsurance companies and employers from denying or dropping coverage \nbased on genetic tests. I have been proud to work with Senator Snowe on \na number of small business initiatives, including our legislation to \nincrease the cap on surety bonds.\n  Senator Snowe has stated repeatedly that she inherited a legacy of \nbipartisanship and independence from former Maine Senator Margaret \nChase Smith, who delivered her seminal ``Declaration of Conscience'' \nspeech against the bullying tactics, smear campaigns, and intimidation \nof former Senator Joe McCarthy. As Senator Snowe remarked in her \n``farewell'' speech the other day, Senator Smith's stand demonstrated \ntruly uncommon courage and principled independence. Senator Snowe has \nbeen a worthy heir and guardian of Senator Smith's legacy. We will miss \nher common sense, her pragmatic approach to governing, and her ability \nto promote bipartisan consensus.\n\n\n                                Jim Webb\n\n  Mr. President, Senator James Webb is a highly decorated combat \nveteran of the Vietnam War, the first Naval Academy graduate to serve \nas a civilian Secretary of the Navy, lawyer, and accomplished author. \nSenator Webb grew up in a military family and noted in his 2004 book, \nBorn Fighting: How the Scots-Irish Shaped America, that his ancestors \nfought in every major American war. Senator Webb's father, a career \nofficer in the U.S. Air Force, flew B-17s and B-29s during World War \nII, and dropped cargo during the Berlin Airlift. After Senator Webb \ngraduated from Annapolis, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps. As a first lieutenant during the Vietnam War he \nserved as a platoon commander with Delta Company, 1st Battalion 5th \nMarines. He earned a Navy Cross, the second highest decoration in the \nNavy and Marine Corps for heroism in Vietnam. He also earned the Silver \nStar, two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts. Senator Webb's son Jimmy \nhas continued the Webb family's long, proud record of military service \nto our Nation as a rifleman and Marine Corps Sergeant, served a tour of \nduty in Iraq with Weapons Company, 1st Battalion 6th Marines.\n  Senator Webb has served just one term but he has made it a productive \none, passing the 21st Century GI Bill to provide the same educational \nbenefits to post-9/11 veterans that the World War II ``Greatest \nGeneration'' received. He introduced the bill his first day in office, \nand saw it enacted into law. More than 800,000 veterans have since \nreceived educational benefits through the program. What a wonderful \nlegacy for Senator Webb to have.\n  Senator Webb also dedicated his time in office to refocusing and \nrebalancing our relationships in East Asia. He has long argued that \ngetting mired in Iraq and Afghanistan was a strategic mistake, and that \nour long-term interests lie with Asia. As chair of the Senate Foreign \nRelations East Asia Subcommittee, he visited nearly every country in \nthe region, focusing particularly on the countries of mainland \nsoutheast Asia and our treaty allies. His 2009 trip to Burma was the \nfirst by a U.S. leader in 10 years; the visit is widely credited as the \nbeginning of efforts to change our relationship with that country. \nSenator Webb remains the only U.S. leader to have met with Than Shwe, \nthe former junta leader, and he also met with Aung San Suu Kyi while \nshe was under house arrest. Senator Webb has also worked continuously \nto resolve the basing issues with our main ally in the region, Japan, \nand to help pass a trade agreement with South Korea.\n  A hallmark of Senator Webb's lifelong service to our Nation is his \nwillingness to tackle the tough, unglamorous issues. Here in the \nSenate, he led an effort to reform our criminal justice system, \nintroducing legislation to establish a commission of experts to review \nthe entire spectrum of the American criminal justice system from drug \nlaws to sentencing, prison conditions, recidivism, and judicial reform.\n  Mr. President, these men and women who will be leaving the Senate \nsoon have made extraordinary sacrifices to serve our Nation. We are \nfortunate that they have chosen to spend significant parts of their \nlives in public service. All Americans owe them a debt of gratitude. \nThose of us who will be in the Senate next month when the 113th \nCongress convenes can best honor the legacy of our departing colleagues \nby reaching across the aisle as they have done so many times to forge \nbipartisan consensus and solutions to our Nation's most vexing \nproblems. The men and women who will be leaving the Senate at the end \nof this Congress understand that compromise isn't a dirty word; it is \nthe genius at the heart of our political system. We will miss them.\n\n\n                            Joseph Lieberman\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, at the end of each session of Congress, the \nSenate takes a moment to acknowledge and express our appreciation for \nthe service of those retiring Members who will not be a part of the \nnext Congress when we reconvene in January. We offer each of them our \nthanks for a job well done. Joe Lieberman is such an individual, and he \nhas brought so much to our\n\n[[Page S8504]]\n\nwork in the Senate over the years. We will miss him.\n  Ever since he arrived here in the Senate Joe has always seen our \ndeliberations as not so much a matter of party so much as it has been \nabout each issue taken individually. That is why we see him as such a \nthoughtful legislator. He examines every matter that comes before the \nSenate, taking stock of how it will impact his home State of \nConnecticut and the future of our Nation, and then he makes a decision \non the best course of action for the Congress to take. His ability to \nsort through each issue focused more on policy than politics has helped \nhim to work with Senators on both sides of the aisle--and bring \nsomething important to each discussion. That is why the people of \nConnecticut kept hiring him back on for another term. Simply put, they \nsaw him in action in the Senate and visited with him when he would \nreturn to Connecticut and they liked what they saw.\n  I got to know Joe as we worked together during a trip to South Korea. \nThe Kyoto Conference had concluded and South Korea was in the midst of \na series of problems. The outlook was troublesome and action needed to \nbe taken on a priority basis. The problems were magnified by the \nelection that was going on and the monetary crisis that was being \nplayed out in the midst of all of that political campaigning and \nposturing.\n  In an effort to be of assistance, the International Monetary Fund had \nstepped in and was willing to provide the support that was needed in \nexchange for South Korea's willingness to take certain steps that they \nbelieved were essential if any additional elements of the crisis were \nto be avoided.\n  The International Monetary Fund asked us to meet with the candidates \nwho were running in South Korea and make them aware of the importance \nof the current problem and the need to work with the International \nMonetary Fund toward the solution that had been proposed. It was not \ngoing to be enough for them to privately state that they were open to \nthe idea. We needed them to go public with their support for the \nproposal so that all the candidates would be on the record as being on \nboard with the plan. That would help to strengthen and stabilize the \neconomy and put South Korea on a track toward a long term solution to \ntheir financial problems.\n  We were so ``effective'' with our assignment that, after meeting with \nus, each of the candidates took to the airwaves the next day to make it \nclear that if they were elected they would rewrite the whole deal.\n  As soon as they made it clear they were not interested in the \nproposal that had been made, the value of their currency began to sink \nlike a rock. It hit the maximum loss for three days. That was enough to \nteach each candidate that they had no alternative but to move in the \ndirection the International Monetary Fund had recommended.\n  As soon as that realization became clear, each of the candidates went \nback on the airwaves and said that they would comply with the \nInternational Monetary Fund's recommendations and pursue the policies \nthat would place the nation on firmer ground. When there is only one \nviable alternative it makes taking a position on an issue like this a \nlot easier.\n  I learned a great deal about Joe on that trip--and from him, too. It \nwas in every sense time well spent both for me and Joe--and for the \ngovernment of South Korea as well. That experience has been with me \never since and I have never forgotten it.\n  Joe is completing his fourth term and through it all he has been a \ngood representative of the people of Connecticut. He has been a part of \nmany difficult and complex issues during those four terms. Each day, \nstrengthened by his faith and guided by his strong sense of values and \nprinciples, he has taken on each challenge that has come before us and \ndone some very important work for the Nation.\n  Thanks, Joe, for your willingness to serve. You have compiled a \nrecord during your years of service on the State and national level of \nwhich you can be very proud. As I thank you for your service, I also \nwant to thank you for your friendship. I have enjoyed having the chance \nto come to know you and I hope you will continue to keep in touch with \nus in the months to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/28/senate-section/article/S8504-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8504-S8505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ENVIRONMENTAL EPA MERIT AWARDS\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 11 \nindividuals and organizations from Connecticut that have been awarded \n2012 Environmental Merit Awards by the Environmental Protection Agency, \nEPA. Every year, the EPA recognizes stand-out efforts in different \nregions of the country, including Connecticut's New England Region. \nAlthough not official EPA initiatives, these accomplishments are \nintegral to national environmental stewardship and conservation \nefforts.\n  This year, a 2012 Lifetime Achievement Environmental Merit Award was \ngiven to Alan Buzzetti, for his career-long efforts fighting against \nlead poisoning, and Northeast Recycling Council, Inc., for its \ninnovative recycling campaign. Mr. Buzzetti has been instrumental in \nthe creation of a statewide program to eliminate lead poisoning. He \nalso founded the Connecticut Department of Public Health's Childhood \nLead Poisoning Prevention and Control Program, making Connecticut a \nclear choice for the regional headquarters of the New England Lead \nCoordinating Committee. For the past 25 years, the Northeast Recycling \nCouncil has worked with Connecticut and 9 other member States to \nsupport and promote recycling and sustainability models at both the \nState and local level and for both public and private efforts.\n  The EPA also awarded Individual Environmental Merit Awards to three \ntrailblazing activists, who care deeply about our environmental future. \nDr. Anthony Leiserowitz is currently a professor at the Yale School of \nForestry and Environmental Studies where he founded and directs the \nYale Center for Environmental Communication. Through these and \nadditional platforms like the Yale Forum on Climate Change and the \nMedia, Dr. Leiserowitz works with journalists and broadcast media to \nmake climate change data relevant to the public.\n  Kevin Taylor of Waterbury and Betsey Wingfield of Hartford have also \nreceived Individual Environmental Merit Awards from the EPA. Mr. \nTaylor, the Senior Project Manager of Waterbury Development \nCorporation, has led the redevelopment of more than 20 brownfields into \nvaluable, beloved community properties. Ms. Wingfield--outside of her \nposition at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental \nProtection--has led a community group to successfully lobby for stream \nflow standards and regulations in Connecticut. These measures ensure \nprotections for decades and future generations.\n  To recognize innovative partnerships that cross sectors, the EPA \nawarded three Environmental, Community, Academia and Nonprofit \nEnvironmental Merit Awards. This year's Connecticut winners are Goodwin \nCollege, the Long Island Sound Study's Citizens Advisory Committee, and \nthe University of Connecticut's Nonpoint Education for Municipal \nOfficials Program's New England Rain Garden Training Team. These three \norganizations are models of environmental stewardship--linking economic \ndevelopment, equal opportunity, and community participation with \nresponsible conservation. Since 2005, Goodwin College's campus along \nthe Connecticut River in East Hartford has inspired environmental \nparticipation from a diverse group of residents. It offers a college \ndegree in environmental studies and has developed Connecticut River \nAcademy, a magnet high school. These two academic institutions have \nbecome a hub for local businesses and have created countless jobs.\n  Similarly, the Long Island Sound Study and New England Rain Garden \nTraining Team have been successful in bringing diverse people together \nto protect the environment. Curt Johnson and Nancy Seligson, co-chairs \nof the Long Island Sound Study's Citizens Advisory Committee, have led \na large group of citizens, concerned about the future of the cherished \nLong Island Sound, in developing what the EPA has aptly called a \n``community blueprint'' or ``citizens' action plan.'' The New England \nRain Garden Training Team has similarly been on the ground, working \nwith all levels of government and community groups to build rain \ngardens in New England. By raising awareness of the importance of rain\n\n[[Page S8505]]\n\ngardens in reducing pollution from stormwater runoff, members of the \nRutgers University Cooperative Extension Water Resources program and \nUniversity of Connecticut's Nonpoint Education for Municipal Officials \nProgram have collaborated on easily translatable training programs for \nresidents and neighborhoods, including underserved communities.\n  To highlight the important work of State and local governments in \nenvironmental regulation, the EPA awarded a 2012 Governmental \nEnvironmental Merit Award to Connecticut's Department of Public \nHealth's Drinking Water Section, charged with regulating and \nadministering Connecticut's water system. These hardworking public \nemployees are heroes in times of crisis. In the aftermath of Tropical \nStorm Irene in 2011, this team offered assistance to nearly 770,000 \nconstituents who had lost power and issued boil water guidance for \n16,000 residents.\n  Lastly, Ethan Allen Operations, Inc., headquartered in Danbury, CT, \nand the Greenwich Hospital were awarded in the Business, Industry, \nTrade, or Professional category in recognition of their industry \nleadership. Ethan Allen has been on the forefront of reducing air \npollutant emissions, eco-friendly chemicals, and reduction in waste \noutput. Greenwich Hospital has used innovative, healing rain gardens to \npromote health as well as manage the area's stormwater runoff, and has \nassisted other New England area hospitals in instituting this type of \nsustainable landscaping for their communities.\n  Congratulations to these remarkable Connecticut ecological \nvanguards--environmentalists, scientists, and local leaders who have \ncollaborated with others to confront important global issues with \ntenacity, creativity, and courage. As we have seen, especially recently \nin the wake of Hurricane Sandy, our Nation's environmentalists are true \naltruists. I invite my Senate colleagues to applaud these commendable \nConnecticut companies and individuals, and thank them for their \ndedication to preserving our landscapes, seascapes, and climate for \nfuture generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/28/senate-section/article/S8505-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8505-S8506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS OF SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, although the Newtown community is very \nmuch still in mourning, I stand here today to remember 20 innocent \nchildren and 6 remarkable adults. I am hopeful that the memories of \nloved ones can provide some solace in the face of senseless violence. \nAnd I hope that as we continue to share stories, our national community \nwill bind together and hearts can begin to heal.\n  When President Obama addressed the Nation, he spoke of Sandy Hook \nElementary School as a compassionate community: parents holding their \nchildren's hands on their way to school, teachers meeting them at the \ndoor, principals keeping watch.\n  I have seen, firsthand, tragedy hit this tight-knit community. Last \nFriday morning, I went to the Sandy Hook firehouse. I went as a public \nofficial, but what I saw was through the eyes of a parent. There were \nmoments of unspeakable grief for parents emerging from the firehouse \nwho realized their children were not coming home. I will live always \nwith these sights and sounds of that day.\n  I have also seen this remarkable community come together in \nsolidarity. The firefighters and first responders are mostly \nvolunteers. Neighbors are like family members. I have the utmost \nconfidence that this beautiful town will heal through deep-rooted \nrelationships and collective strength.\n  We must remember that these children were dearly loved by parents and \nteachers who would give everything for them. And these adult victims \nmodeled selfless love for their students. In this spirit of love, \ncommunity, and compassion, we remember the 26 fallen today.\n  Twelve little girls passed away on Friday, and we honor them for \nbringing bursts of light and laughter and love into the lives of all \nwho knew them:\n  Charlotte Bacon was an outgoing and persistent red head, a member of \na Girl Scout troop led by her mother.\n  Olivia Engel was a great big sister to her younger brother and family \ndog and was looking forward to playing an angel in her church's \nupcoming pageant.\n  Catherine Hubbard had a passion for animals and greeted each day with \na smile.\n  Jessica Rekos loved horseback riding and learning about orcas.\n  Josephine Gay had just turned 7 and found joy in riding her bike \naround the neighborhood.\n  Madeleine Hsu had just turned 6 in July and was remembered for \nwearing bright, floral dresses.\n  Ana Marquez-Greene loved to sing and would leave love notes under her \nparents' pillow.\n  Emilie Parker was a mentor to her younger siblings, teaching them how \nto dance and laugh, and was eager to try new things.\n  Caroline Previdi was a spunky young gymnast who loved to draw and \ndance.\n  Grace McDonnell liked wearing bows in her hair and dreamed of living \nat the beach and becoming a painter.\n  Avielle Richman took up archery when she was inspired by a female \nhero in the Disney movie, Brave, and is remembered for her joyful \ngiggles.\n  Allison Wyatt was an eager, energetic first-grader, who was helpful \nto her peers and loving to family and friends.\n  Eight little boys passed away on Friday and will be remembered for \ntheir joy of life and boundless energy:\n  Daniel Barden would ride on his father's shoulders on the way to the \nschool bus every morning and was missing his two front teeth.\n  Dylan Hockley liked to play tag at the bus stop with his neighbors \nand dress up like Shrek or Superman.\n  Jesse Lewis would accompany his dad to work at building sites which \nhe happily explored and was learning how to ride a horse.\n  James Mattioli had just learned how to ride a bike and was \ndiscovering that he liked math.\n  Jack Pinto was a Giants fan and part of a youth wrestling team.\n  Noah Pozner was best friends with his twin sister Arielle, and older \nsister Sophia, and liked figuring out how things worked.\n  Chase Kowalski loved riding his bike outdoors and playing with his \nfive siblings.\n  Benjamin Wheeler studied piano with his mother and threw leaves in \nthe air with his friends and his brother Nate.\n  These children were raised with dance and music, with laughter and \nhope. The parents of victim Grace McDonnell have kept their house \nablaze with Christmas lights, even in the wake of the shooting, perhaps \nin tribute to their daughter, who they called ``the love and light of \nour family.'' Krista and Rich Rekos called their daughter Jessica, \ntheir ``rock.''\n  You can feel the energy of these children in the stories that are \nbeing told. Although their lives were cut short, they contributed to \nthe world around them by learning, growing, and loving.\n  Six beloved Sandy Hook faculty members--selfless heroes of the \nNewtown community--were also taken last Friday. They dedicated \nthemselves to the children around them.\n  Dawn Hochsprung, the 47-year-old principal of Sandy Hook Elementary \nSchool, instinctually lunged in front of the shooter and she was killed \nin the line of duty. For the students of Sandy Hook, she was the \n``Reading Fairy,'' inspiring what she hoped would be a lifelong \nappreciation for books. Before coming to Sandy Hook, she worked as a \nprincipal in the towns of Bethlehem and Woodbury. She was dedicated to \neducation and to family, crediting her own mother for the care she \nexpressed towards others.\n  Anne Marie Murphy, 52 years old, worked at Sandy Hook Elementary \nSchool as a special education assistant and raised four children of her \nown. She has been remembered as a positive spirit and source of good \nenergy. She was generous and loving, and died shielding the innocent \nfrom harm. In a public statement, the family of Dylan Hockley expressed \ntheir gratitude to Ms. Murphy and comfort that their son died in the \narms of his beloved teacher.\n  Mary Sherlach, 56 years old, had served Sandy Hook as their school \npsychologist since 1994 and was a year away from retiring. She earned \nher undergraduate degree at SUNY Cortland and master's degree at \nSouthern Connecticut State University. Last Friday, she showed her true \nspirit of selflessness when she and Principal Hochsprung ran towards \nthe shooter to stop him. Her adult daughters live in New Jersey and \nWashington, DC.\n  According to her loved ones, at age 30 Lauren Rousseau had landed her \ndream\n\n[[Page S8506]]\n\njob as a substitute teacher at Sandy Hook--something she had longed to \ndo since age 6. She found a home in this community and gave her life \ncaring for its children. A graduate of the University of Connecticut, \nshe cheered on the women's basketball team and enjoyed going to \nBroadway shows.\n  Rachel D'Avino was an intern at Sandy Hook--a 29-year-old who was in \nthe process of learning how to help children with special needs. She \nwas studying at the University of Saint Joseph for an advanced degree \nin applied behavior analysis and provided one-on-one instruction to \nvarious students. Her boyfriend was planning on asking for her hand in \nmarriage on Christmas Eve.\n  Victoria Soto loved going to work each day as a first grade teacher \nat Sandy Hook Elementary and was, in turn, beloved by her students. She \nwas raised in a family of public servants and graduated from Eastern \nConnecticut State University. She was attending night school at \nSouthern Connecticut State for a master's degree. When the gunman shot \nhis way into her classroom, she protected the children under her care \nwithout hesitation. Her story and those of her colleagues, who put \ntheir lives on the line, will be remembered around the Nation.\n  During this holiday season, we pray that the Newtown community can \nfind peace and solace. This tragedy reminds us of both the fragility \nand preciousness of life, and the healing grace of love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/28/senate-section/article/S8506-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL OF PAINTING\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, in 2010, Senators Gillibrand and \nSchumer passed a resolution honoring the Hudson River School painters \nfor their contributions to the United States. Today, I join my \ncolleagues in paying tribute to this significant, historic artistic \nmovement and recognize its ties to Connecticut.\n  The Hudson River School of Painting originated in the Hudson River \nValley in the 1920s and consists of landscapes featuring highly \ndetailed and realistic scenes of American wilderness. Painters \nattributed to this style include Thomas Cole, Asher Durand, Jasper \nCropsey, Sanford Robinson Gifford, George Inness, Worthington \nWhittredge, Albert Bierstadt, and Thomas Morgan.\n  Two of the most influential painters of the Hudson River School have \nConnecticut roots: John Kensett and John Frederic Church. Born in \nCheshire, Kensett worked in New Haven as an engraver and traveled \nthroughout New England, painting scenes of his cherished homeland. At \nhis home on Contentment Island near Darien, he painted some of his most \nnotable works. Church was born in Hartford and became famous for his \nlandscapes of exotic locales of South America, Western Europe, and the \nMiddle East.\n  The Long Island Sound--a treasure of Connecticut and the East Coast--\nwas a common subject lovingly portrayed by Hudson River School \npainters, in particular by Kensett, who would frequent the Sound to or \nfrom his studio in Darien. Famously, Kensett's ``Twilight in the Cedars \nat Darien,'' portrays a serene sun setting over a dense swath of forest \nin Connecticut.\n  The Hudson River School has not only inspired painters for \ngenerations, but led to the development of the National Park Service \nunder President Theodore Roosevelt. In Connecticut and throughout the \nNation, this influential style has inspired environmental conservation \nefforts historically and to the present day.\n  These beautiful, idyllic landscapes, untouched by man, inspire us to \nprotect our land, air, and water; future generations must not look at \nthese paintings as ancient artifact. Connecticut is closely tied to the \nHudson River School, and we must continue to preserve its legacy now \nand in the future by learning more about the School and its painters. I \nencourage my colleagues and their constituents to engage in this \nworthwhile pursuit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/28/senate-section/article/S8506-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8506-S8507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-8730.

A bill to make technical corrections to the Dodd-Frank Wall \nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss legislation that I \nintroduced to make technical corrections to the Dodd-Frank Act.\n  Two and a half years ago, Congress rushed to pass the 2,300 page \nDodd-Frank Act and, like any large and complex piece of legislation, it \ncontains numerous technical errors.\n  For example, section 742(b) of Dodd-Frank amends the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act by citing to section 206(e) of that act when, in fact, \nGramm-Leach-Bliley does not have a section 206(e).\n  Another example is that Dodd-Frank abolished the Office of Thrift \nSupervision, but failed to take out references to the OTS in at least \n20 statutes.\n  These are the types of errors that should be corrected.\n  While I strongly opposed Dodd-Frank and do not believe that it should \nhave become law, I nevertheless believe that we should at least attempt \nto clean up the errors found throughout the legislation.\n  Accordingly, the legislation I have introduced focuses purely on \ntechnical corrections of non-substantive inaccuracies and omissions in \nthe final Dodd-Frank bill.\n  The bill I introduced could have been many pages longer, but I sought \nto keep it to only those changes that were purely technical.\n  There are many other technical changes that could be made that also \ninvolve policy judgments.\n  I decided not to include those changes in my bill because I wanted to \nintroduce a bill that could garner broad bipartisan support and serve \nas a starting point for forging additional compromises on other \nproblems with Dodd-Frank.\n  If Congress is ever going to be bipartisan, this is the bill. We \nshould at a bare minimum be able to agree that a law with numerous \ntechnical errors should be fixed at least to the extent of those \ntechnical issues.\n  While the issues addressed in this bill are technical in nature, they \nalso take into account the realities with the ongoing implementation of \nDodd-Frank.\n  For example, this legislation extends for one year the deadline for \ncompleting and issuing the regulations, studies and reports required by \nDodd-Frank that have not been met by the date specified.\n  This provision does not aim to delay or undermine the rulemaking \nprocess in any way.\n  On the contrary, it is meant to address the flawed rulemaking process \nstipulated by Dodd-Frank, which directs financial regulators to \ncomplete an unprecedented number of rulemakings in very short time \nframes.\n  Presently, our financial regulators are in violation of the law \nbecause they have not completed scores of rulemakings by the times \nprescribed by Dodd-Frank. This is not how the world's leading democracy \nshould function.\n  Congress's laws should be followed, especially by the agencies it has \ncreated. Congress should either hold regulators accountable for not \nmaking statutory deadlines or should grant regulators more time so that \nthey are not in violation of the law.\n  In this case, extending deadlines is the appropriate and reasonable \napproach.\n  While I offer this bill to technically improve Dodd-Frank, my views \nabout the substantive provisions of Dodd-Frank have not changed.\n  I continue to believe that it is a flawed and poorly conceived piece \nof legislation. It expanded the scope and power of ineffective \nbureaucracies, created vast new bureaucracies with little \naccountability, and seriously undermined the competitiveness of the \nAmerican economy.\n  Moreover, Dodd-Frank did all that without accomplishing what it set \nout to do--make our financial system safer.\n  Instead, Dodd-Frank preserved and codified preferential treatment for \nlarge financial institutions.\n  It solidified the close relationships between regulators and big \nbanks by maintaining their pre-existing prudential regulators.\n  Dodd-Frank also protected the big banks from bankruptcy by creating a \nnew resolution mechanism to ensure that large financial institutions do \nnot fail.\n  In addition not one regulator was held accountable in the wake of the \ncrisis. To add insult to injury, the very same regulators that missed \nthe warning signs were then closely consulted on how to draft Dodd-\nFrank.\n  Accordingly, many provisions in Dodd-Frank should be reexamined and \nreplaced with language which would actually address the serious \nproblems in our financial regulatory system.\n  This bill, however, does not address any of my substantive concerns \nwith Dodd Frank. In fact, I made a conscious effort to avoid any \nsubstantive recommendations, and to focus exclusively on technical \ncorrections.\n  My hope is that this bill will form the foundation for a more \ncomprehensive debate on Dodd-Frank in the next Congress. Therefore, I \nintend to reintroduce this bill when we return in January.\n  By working together to revise Dodd-Frank, I believe Congress can not \nonly\n\n[[Page S8508]]\n\nmake our financial system safer, but also foster economic growth and \njob creation.\n  One would think that we could reach a bipartisan consensus on that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/28/senate-section/article/S8508-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3439.

REPORT ON THE IMPACT OF THE FISA AMENDMENTS ACT OF \n                   2008 ON THE PRIVACY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The central provision of the FISA Amendments of 2008 \n     (Public Law 110-261; 122 Stat. 2436) enacted section 702 of \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. \n     1881a) which provides the government authority to collect the \n     communications of persons reasonably believed to be citizens \n     of foreign countries who are located outside the United \n     States.\n       (2) Such section 702 contained restrictions regarding the \n     acquisition of the communications of United States persons \n     which were intended to protect the privacy of United States \n     persons and prevent intelligence agencies from using the \n     authority in such section to deliberately read or listen to \n     the communications of specific United States persons without \n     obtaining a warrant or emergency authorization to do so.\n       (3) Estimating the total number of communications to or \n     from the United States collected under the authority in such \n     section 702 would provide an indication of the degree to \n     which collection carried out under such section has impacted \n     the privacy of United States persons.\n       (4) Estimating the number of wholly domestic communications \n     collected under the authority in such section 702 would \n     provide a particularly significant indication of the degree \n     to which collection carried out under this authority has \n     impacted the privacy of United States persons.\n       (5) While Congress did not intend to provide authority in \n     such section 702 for elements of the intelligence community \n     to deliberately review the communications of specific United \n     States persons without obtaining individual warrants or \n     emergency authorizations to do so, such section 702 does not \n     include a specific prohibition against this action, and the \n     people of the United States have a right to know whether \n     elements of the intelligence community have deliberately \n     searched through communications collected under such section \n     702 to find the communications of specific United States \n     persons.\n       (6) Despite requests from numerous Senators, the Director \n     of National Intelligence has declined to state publicly \n     whether--\n       (A) any entity has made an estimate of the number of United \n     States communications that have been collected under such \n     section 702;\n       (B) any wholly domestic communications have been collected \n     under such section 702; or\n       (C) any element of the intelligence community has attempted \n     to search through communications collected under such section \n     702 in a deliberate effort to review the communications of a \n     specific United States person without obtaining a warrant or \n     emergency authorization permitting such a search.\n       (7) In public remarks in July 2012, the Director of the \n     National Security Agency stated that ``the story that we have \n     millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is \n     absolutely false''.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) Requirement.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Director of National \n     Intelligence shall submit to Congress a report on the impact \n     of the amendments made by the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 \n     (Public Law 110-261; 122 Stat. 2436) and other surveillance \n     authorities on the privacy of United States persons.\n       (2) Content.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A determination of whether any government entity has \n     produced any estimate regarding--\n       (i) the total number of communications that--\n\n       (I) originated from or were directed to a location in the \n     United States; and\n       (II) have been collected under the authority of section 702 \n     of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 \n     U.S.C. 1881a); or\n\n       (ii) the total number of wholly domestic communications \n     that have been collected under such authority.\n       (B) If any estimate described in subparagraph (A) was \n     produced, such estimate.\n       (C) An assessment of whether any wholly domestic \n     communications have been collected under the authority of \n     section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978 (50 U.S.C. 1881a).\n       (D) A determination of whether any element of the \n     intelligence community has ever attempted to search through \n     communications collected under section 702 of the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 1881a) in a \n     deliberate effort to find the communications of a specific \n     United States person, without obtaining a warrant or \n     emergency authorization to do so.\n       (E) A determination of whether the National Security Agency \n     has collected any type of personally identifiable data \n     pertaining to more than 1,000,000 United States persons.\n       (c) Form of Report.--\n       (1) Public availability of report.--The report required by \n     subsection (b) shall be made available to the public not \n     later than 15 days after the date such report is submitted to \n     Congress.\n       (2) Redactions.--If the President believes that public \n     disclosure of information in the report required by \n     subsection (b) could cause significant harm to national \n     security, the President may redact such information from the \n     report made available to the public.\n       (3) Submission to congress.--If the President redacts \n     information under paragraph (2), not later than 30 days after \n     the date the report required by subsection (b) is made \n     available to the public under paragraph (1), the President \n     shall submit to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the \n     Senate and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the House of Representatives a statement explaining the \n     specific harm to national security that the disclosure of \n     such information could cause.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3440.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 475, S. 3454.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  A bill (S. 3454) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2013 for \nintelligence and intelligence-related activities of the United States \nGovernment and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the \nCentral Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System, and for \nother purposes.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, among the unfinished business before \nthe Senate is the consideration of the Intelligence Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2013. I am asking today for unanimous consent to \napprove this legislation with a managers' amendment worked out both \nwith vice chairman Chambliss and the chairman and ranking member of the \nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in consultation with \nthe Armed Services and Appropriations Committees.\n  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reported its Fiscal Year \n2013 bill, S. 3454, with its accompanying report, S. Rpt. 112-192, on \nJuly 30, 2012 by a vote of 14-1. The bill and report have been publicly \navailable since it was reported. The classified annex reported from the \nCommittee was also available for all Senators to review in the \nCommittee's office.\n  S. 3454 as reported from our Committee was not without controversy, \nespecially with regard to provisions in the bill that were meant to \naddress the wholly unacceptable and large-scale disclosures of \nclassified information to the media.\n  Since the bill was reported out, the Committee has received \nthoughtful comments from our colleagues, media organizations, and from \norganizations that advocate for greater governmental transparency. As a \nresult of these comments, and technical suggestions received from the \nExecutive Branch, we have decided to remove ten of the twelve sections \nin the title of the original bill that addressed unauthorized \ndisclosures of classified information so that we might ensure enactment \nthis year of the important other provisions of the bill.\n  Unfortunately, I am certain that damaging leaks of classified \ninformation will continue, and so the Committee will need to continue \nto look for acceptable ways to address this problem.\n  Let me briefly describe the managers' amendment and where we have \nmade modifications in what was reported from the Committee.\n  As always, the intelligence authorization bill has two pieces: the \nlegislative text, which is unclassified, and a classified annex that \ncontains the Committee's authorization of intelligence spending.\n  The bill contains a number of legislative provisions requested by the \nAdministration to give the intelligence community the authorities and \nflexibilities it needs to continue protecting the American people and \nproviding policymakers information for foreign policy and security \ndecisions, as well as for the effective and appropriate functioning of \nour intelligence apparatus.\n  Among other things, this bill includes:\n  Repeal of four recurring reporting requirements burdensome to \nIntelligence Community agencies when the information in such reports is \nduplicative, or is provided to the Congress through other means. We \nregularly hear from intelligence officials that they spend so much time \nwriting reports that it interferes with collection, analysis, and \nmanagement of intelligence activities.\n  Modification of personnel authorities to facilitate more ``joint \nduty'' assignments within the Intelligence Community that will create \nshared knowledge across different elements of the IC.\n  These provisions, and several others that are mainly technical in \nnature, were requested by the director of National Intelligence and \nincorporated into the bill.\n  Other sections were initiated by the Committee to assist \nCongressional oversight efforts. These include, for example, a \nrequirement for corrective action plans to be developed to address\n\n[[Page S8514]]\n\nthe issue of improper payments made by intelligence agencies. We also \nrequire notification to the congressional intelligence committees under \ncertain circumstances with respect to certain disclosures of national \nintelligence information.\n  As this managers' amendment represents the combined efforts of the \nSenate and House, we have also included three provisions from the \nHouse-passed bill which were not in the Committee's original bill. \nThese address security clearance reciprocity, subcontractor business \nopportunities in the Intelligence Community, and a report on supply \nchain vulnerabilities.\n  I am attaching at the end of this statement a section-by-section \nanalysis that describes each of the sections of this managers' \namendment.\n  It is my hope that the provisions in this bill will continue to aid \nthe Intelligence Community as it conducts its missions, ensure better \nstewardship of taxpayer dollars, and support the thousands of civilians \nand military employees who work throughout the Intelligence Community.\n  As I mentioned, this managers' amendment also includes modifications \nto the classified annex and the Schedule of Authorizations, modified to \nrepresent the consensus of both congressional intelligence committees. \nI am unable to describe in detail the Committee's classified schedule \nand annex, but it is available to all Senators for their review in the \nCommittee's spaces. The Committee has sought to ensure that funding is \nauthorized to continue and enhance important intelligence collection \nand analysis programs, covert actions, and counterintelligence. At the \nsame time, we have cut funding for programs that were functioning \npoorly or at expenditure rates below expectations, and to shift funding \nfrom lower priorities to higher ones.\n  As always, the Committee has held numerous hearings and briefings on \nthe President's spending request. As was announced in late October, \nintelligence spending decreased slightly in Fiscal Year 2012, and that \ntrend will continue in Fiscal Year 2013. Our annex contains an overall \nfunding level that is very close to the President's request, and we \nhave attempted to find places to reduce spending that will not \nsacrifice any important work of the intelligence agencies.\n  I believe we have addressed all of the concerns that have been \nbrought to our attention by our colleagues and the public. I thus urge \npassage of this managers' amendment and enactment of this important \nlegislation before the end of the session.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the section by section analysis be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Section-by-Section Analysis and Explanation\n\n       The following is a section-by-section analysis and \n     explanation of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2013.\n\n\n              TITLE I--BUDGET AND PERSONNEL AUTHORIZATIONS\n\n     Section 101. Authorization of appropriations\n       Section 101 lists the United States Government departments, \n     agencies, and other elements for which the Act authorizes \n     appropriations for intelligence and intelligence-related \n     activities for Fiscal Year 2013.\n     Section 102. Classified Schedule of Authorizations\n       Section 102 provides that the details of the amounts \n     authorized to be appropriated for intelligence and \n     intelligence-related activities and the applicable personnel \n     levels by program for Fiscal Year 2013 are contained in the \n     classified Schedule of Authorizations and that the classified \n     Schedule of Authorizations shall be made available to the \n     Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives and to the President.\n     Section 103. Personnel ceiling adjustments\n       Section 103 is intended to provide additional flexibility \n     to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in managing \n     the civilian personnel of the Intelligence Community. Section \n     103(a) provides that the DNI may authorize employment of \n     civilian personnel in Fiscal Year 2013 in excess of the \n     number of authorized positions by an amount not exceeding 3 \n     percent of the total limit applicable to each Intelligence \n     Community element under Section 102. The DNI may do so only \n     if necessary to the performance of important intelligence \n     functions.\n       Section 103(b) requires the DNI to establish guidelines \n     that would ensure a uniform and accurate method of counting \n     certain personnel. The DNI has issued such a policy. \n     Subsection (b) confirms in statute the obligation of the DNI \n     to establish these guidelines.\n       The DNI must report the decision to allow an Intelligence \n     Community element to exceed the personnel ceiling in advance \n     to the congressional intelligence committees.\n     Section 104. Intelligence Community Management Account\n       Section 104 authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence \n     Community Management Account (ICMA) of the DNI and sets the \n     authorized personnel levels for the elements within the ICMA \n     for Fiscal Year 2013.\n       Subsection (a) authorizes appropriations of $540,721,000 \n     for Fiscal Year 2013 for the activities of the ICMA. \n     Subsection (b) authorizes 835 positions for elements within \n     the ICMA for Fiscal Year 2013 and provides that personnel \n     serving in such elements may be permanent employees of the \n     Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) or \n     detailed from other elements of the United States Government.\n       Subsection (c) authorizes additional appropriations and \n     personnel for the classified Community Management Account as \n     specified in the classified Schedule of Authorizations and \n     permits the funding for advanced research and development to \n     remain available through September 30, 2014.\n\n\n TITLE II--CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY SYSTEM\n\n     Section 201. Authorization of appropriations\n       Section 201 authorizes appropriations in the amount of \n     $514,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2013 for the Central \n     Intelligence Agency (CIA) Retirement and Disability Fund.\n\n\n           TITLE III--GENERAL INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY MATTERS\n\n     Section 301. Restriction on conduct of intelligence \n         activities\n       Section 301 provides that the authorization of \n     appropriations by the Act shall not be deemed to constitute \n     authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity that \n     is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of \n     the United States.\n     Section 302. Increase in employee compensation and benefits \n         authorized by law\n       Section 302 provides that funds authorized to be \n     appropriated by this Act for salary, pay, retirement, and \n     other benefits for federal employees may be increased by such \n     additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for \n     increases in compensation or benefits authorized by law.\n     Section 303. Non-reimbursable details\n       Section 303 amends Section 113A of the National Security \n     Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 404h-1) to increase the length of time \n     an officer or employee of the federal government can be \n     detailed to the staff of an element of the Intelligence \n     Community funded through the National Intelligence Program \n     (NIP) from two years to three. In addition, Section 303 \n     clarifies that a non-reimbursable detail made under Section \n     113A shall not be considered an augmentation of the \n     appropriations of the receiving element of the Intelligence \n     Community.\n       The DNI requested that an extension of the length of \n     service from two years to three years be made for members of \n     the Armed Forces detailed to an element of Intelligence \n     Community. This request was intended to align Section 113A \n     with requirements for joint duty assignments among the \n     military. Section 664(a) of Title 10 provides that joint duty \n     assignments for military officers, other than general and \n     flag officers, shall be no less than three years. Section 303 \n     provides the flexibility of a three-year length of service to \n     civilian employees as well as military officers.\n     Section 304. Automated insider threat detection program\n       Section 304 extends by one year the milestones for \n     establishment of an automated insider threat detection \n     program under Section 402 of the Intelligence Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 112-18). The \n     administration had requested a two-year extension of the \n     milestone for ``initial operating capability'' and a three-\n     year extension of the milestone for ``full operating \n     capability.'' The one-year extensions are intended to ensure \n     that the Intelligence Community moves more rapidly toward \n     establishment of this program.\n     Section 305. Software licensing\n       Section 305 requires the chief information officer for an \n     element of the Intelligence Community to conduct an inventory \n     of software licenses held by such element, including those \n     utilized and unutilized, by the element. This inventory is to \n     be conducted in consultation with the Chief Information \n     Officer of the Intelligence Community (CIO) and completed \n     within 120 days of enactment. Not later than 180 days after \n     enactment, the CIO shall provide the congressional \n     intelligence committees with a copy of the reports along with \n     any comments the CIO wishes to provide. The CIO shall \n     transmit any portion of a report involving a component of a \n     department of the U.S. government to the congressional \n     committees with jurisdiction over such department \n     simultaneously with submission of such report to the \n     congressional intelligence committees.\n     Section 306. Strategy for security clearance reciprocity\n       Section 306 requires the President to develop a strategy \n     and process for carrying out the requirements of section \n     3001(d) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \n     Act of 2004, which concerns reciprocity of security clearance \n     access determinations across agencies.\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\n     Section 307. Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act \n         of 2010 compliance\n       Section 307 requires the DNI and the directors of the CIA, \n     the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the National \n     Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and the National \n     Security Agency (NSA) each to develop a corrective action \n     plan, with major milestones, that delineates how such \n     agencies will achieve compliance with the Improper Payments \n     Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010, not later than \n     September 30, 2013. Section 307(b) requires the relevant \n     inspectors general to review the corrective action plan and \n     assess whether it is likely to lead to compliance. Each \n     assessment is to be provided to the congressional \n     intelligence committees. The corrective action plans and \n     inspector general assessments involving the DIA, NGA, and NSA \n     shall also be submitted to the armed services committees of \n     the Senate and House of Representatives.\n     Section 308. Subcontractor notification process\n       Section 308 requires the DNI to submit a report to the \n     congressional intelligence committees assessing the method by \n     which contractors at any tier under a contract entered into \n     with an element of the Intelligence Community are granted \n     security clearances and notified of classified contracting \n     opportunities within the Federal Government and \n     recommendations for the improvement of such method.\n     Section 309. Modification of reporting schedule\n       Section 309 changes the dates by which the inspectors \n     general of the Intelligence Community and the CIA are \n     required to prepare and submit semiannual reports on the \n     activities of their offices from a calendar year basis to a \n     fiscal year basis. This change will align these reporting \n     requirements with the reporting requirements of other \n     inspectors general in the Intelligence Community and \n     facilitate joint audits, inspections and investigations.\n     Section 310. Repeal of certain reporting requirements\n       Congress frequently requests information from the \n     Intelligence Community in the form of reports, the contents \n     of which are specifically defined by statute. The reports \n     prepared pursuant to these statutory requirements provide \n     Congress with an invaluable source of information about \n     specific matters of concern.\n       Congressional reporting requirements, and particularly \n     recurring reporting requirements, can place a significant \n     burden on the resources of the Intelligence Community. In \n     some cases, annual reports can be replaced with briefings or \n     notifications that provide the Congress with more timely \n     information and offer the Intelligence Community a direct \n     line of communication to respond to congressional concerns.\n       In response to a request from the DNI, Section 310 \n     eliminates four reports that were burdensome to the \n     Intelligence Community when the information in the reports \n     could be obtained through other means or was no longer \n     considered relevant to current concerns.\n\n\n     TITLE IV--MATTERS RELATING TO THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY\n\n     Section 401. Working capital fund amendments\n       Section 401 amends Section 21 of the Central Intelligence \n     Agency Act of 1949 (50 U.S.C. 403u) to provide authority for \n     the service providers under the CIA Central Services Program \n     to use resources to make their services known to their \n     authorized customer base through government communication \n     channels, but clarifies this authority shall not be used to \n     distribute gifts or promotional items. In addition, Section \n     401 authorizes service providers to deposit receipts from the \n     sale of their recyclable materials into the CIA working \n     capital fund.\n\n\n                         TITLE V--OTHER MATTERS\n\n     Section 501. Homeland Security Intelligence Program\n       Section 501 establishes the Homeland Security Intelligence \n     Program (HSIP) within the Department of Homeland Security for \n     activities of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) \n     that serve predominantly a departmental mission. The OIA is \n     currently funded through the NIP.\n     Section 502. Extension of National Commission for the Review \n         of the Research and Development Programs of the United \n         States Intelligence Community\n       Section 502 extends the date by which the National \n     Commission for the Review of the Research and Development \n     Programs of the United States Intelligence Community is \n     required to submit a report on its findings from ``not later \n     than one year after the date on which all members of the \n     Commission are appointed pursuant to Section 701(a)(3) of the \n     Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010'' to not \n     later than March 31, 2013, which is effectively one year \n     after the Commission was able to begin its review. The \n     extension was requested by the co-chairs of the Commission.\n     Section 503. Protecting the information technology supply \n         chain of the United States\n       Section 503 requires the DNI to submit to the congressional \n     intelligence committees a report that identifies foreign \n     suppliers of information technology that are linked directly \n     or indirectly to a foreign government and assesses the \n     vulnerability to malicious activity of the telecommunications \n     networks of the United States due to the presence of \n     technology produced by such foreign suppliers.\n     Section 504. Notification regarding the authorized public \n         disclosure of national intelligence\n       Section 504 requires government officials responsible for \n     making certain authorized disclosures of national \n     intelligence or intelligence related to national security to \n     notify the congressional intelligence committees on a timely \n     basis with respect to such disclosures. On a timely basis in \n     this instance does not mean at the exact same time but should \n     be sufficiently timely to keep the committees fully and \n     currently informed.\n       This provision is intended to ensure that the intelligence \n     committees are made aware of authorized disclosures of \n     national intelligence or intelligence related to national \n     security that are made to media personnel or likely to appear \n     in the press, so that, among other things, these authorized \n     disclosures may be distinguished from unauthorized ``leaks.''\n       Section 504(c) provides that the notification requirement \n     does not apply to a disclosure made pursuant to statutory \n     requirements, in connection with civil, criminal or \n     administrative proceedings, as a result of a declassification \n     review process under Executive Order 13526, or to cleared \n     government representatives with a need to know.\n       Section 504(e) provides a one-year sunset for the \n     notification requirement in this section.\n     Section 505. Technical amendments related to the Office of \n         the Director of National Intelligence\n       Sections 2302 and 3132 of Title 5 of the United States Code \n     exclude from the definition of ``agency'' under those \n     chapters certain specifically listed agencies such as the \n     CIA. In addition, Sections 2302 and 3132 exclude from the \n     definition of ``agency'' those executive agencies that the \n     President determines have as their principal function ``the \n     conduct of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence \n     activities.'' Section 505 amends the definition of agency in \n     Sections 2302 and 3132 to expressly identify the ODNI as an \n     agency excluded from the definition of ``agency'' under those \n     chapters.\n     Section 506. Technical amendment for definition of \n         intelligence agency\n       Title VI of the National Security Act of 1947 imposes \n     criminal penalties for the disclosure of the identity of \n     covert agents of an intelligence agency. The current \n     definition of an ``intelligence agency'' does not include the \n     counterintelligence elements of the Department of Defense or \n     the intelligence and counterintelligence components of other \n     elements of the Intelligence Community despite the fact that \n     these components may be conducting counterintelligence \n     operations jointly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     or under their own independent authority. Section 506 thus \n     amends Section 606(5) of the National Security Act of 1947 \n     (50 U.S.C. 426) to revise the definition of ``intelligence \n     agency'' to include all elements of the Intelligence \n     Community, as found in Section 3(4) of the National Security \n     Act.\n     Section 507. Budgetary effects\n       Section 507 provides that the budgetary effects of this \n     Act, for the purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-\n     You-Go-Act of 2010, shall be determined by reference to the \n     latest statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO \n     Legislation'' for this Act, submitted for printing in the \n     Congressional Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget \n     Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted \n     prior to the vote on passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/28/senate-section/article/S8515-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8515-S8516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, earlier today, we were successful in \npassing H.R. 5949, the FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act of 2012, \nwith strong bipartisan support. I am pleased that we are now in a \nposition to pass the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2013, again with strong bipartisan support. These two bills are the \nresult of Chairman Feinstein's exceptional bipartisan leadership of the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence. It has been my privilege and honor to \nwork with her these past two years during my tenure as Vice Chairman of \nthe Committee.\n  This bill looks a little different than the version we passed out of \nCommittee back in July, by a vote of 14-1. The final product is the \nresult of our extensive efforts to successfully address the concerns \nraised by the Executive branch, the House of Representatives, and, of \ncourse, our own membership.\n  It is a good bill. It contains a number of provisions requested by \nthe administration that will provide the intelligence community with \ncertain authorities necessary to perform its vital mission for our \ncountry. Most important, it authorizes the funds appropriated for the \nintelligence and intelligence-related activities of our government. \nThis congressional budgetary oversight is crucial to our national \nsecurity. I am also pleased that the bill\n\n[[Page S8516]]\n\ncontains a provision which will require government officials, who are \nresponsible for authorizing the disclosure of national intelligence or \nintelligence related to national security to the media or the general \npublic, to notify the congressional intelligence committees on a timely \nbasis with respect to such disclosures.\n  It is my hope that the House of Representatives will take this bill \nup quickly, pass it, and then send it on to the President for \nsignature.\n  Mr. REID.

Today the Senate is enacting provisions sent to us by \nRepresentative Conyers, Chairman Smith and others to repeal a \nshortsighted limitation passed in 1994 to limit Secret Service \nprotection of former Presidents. The House bill reverses the 10-year \nlimitation enacted during a time when partisans were angry at the \nAmerican people's election of President Clinton. They contended they \nwere saving taxpayers money with this change in protection, but I doubt \ntheir legislation had any such effect. Now that the limitation might \nlimit Secret Service protection for George W. Bush, they are ready to \nreverse course. We live in a world of real threats and dangerous people \nintent on wrongdoing. I support this effort to protect former President \nBush and other Presidents going forward.\n  I think we should take a more thorough look at this outdated statute \nand expressly extend protection for the minor children of former \nPresidents, as well. In today's world, I do not believe ending such \nprotection at age 15 is prudent. I have raised the issue with the \nauthors of this legislation, with the Secret Service and with the \ncurrent administration. They are hesitant to improve upon the current \nbill. I think we are making a mistake by not taking this opportunity to \nextend protection to children in our first families until they reach 21 \nyears of age. I will not hold up the beneficial change that will be \nmade by the House bill in order to demand a more thorough overhaul of \nthe statute at this time. I suspect Congress will need to reassess this \nmatter because we have not done all we should now.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent to proceed to \nH.R. 6621.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6621) to correct and improve certain \n     provisions of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act and title \n     35, United States Code.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Earlier this Congress, the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives came together to pass the Leahy-Smith America Invents \nAct, the most comprehensive change to our Nation's patent laws in 60 \nyears. It was the result of more than 6 years of bipartisan, bicameral \nwork by many, including my counterpart on the House Judiciary \nCommittee, Chairman Lamar Smith. Now 15 months since President Obama \nsigned our bill into law, its reforms are already starting to take \neffect, benefiting inventors and businesses around the country.\n  I am pleased the Senate has taken action to pass Chairman Smith's \ntechnical corrections legislation, H.R. 6621. The legislation makes a \nsmall number of changes to clarify and improve the law and to help \nstreamline its implementation. The bill corrects several minor drafting \nerrors and clarifies provisions concerning the inventor's oath, notice \nof patent term adjustments, derivation proceedings, and the terms of \nthe Patent Public Advisory Committee. It also addresses an inadvertent \n``dead zone'' by clarifying the remedies available to those wishing to \nchallenge patent applications.\n  The changes are straightforward and noncontroversial. They should \nhelp reduce confusion and ease implementation of the law. I appreciate \nChairman Smith's efforts to draft this legislation and to move it \nthrough the House of Representatives so the Patent and Trademark \nOffice, PTO, and participants in the patent system can benefit from its \neffects.\n  Regrettably, the legislation passed today does not include one \ntechnical correction that would improve the law by restoring Congress's \nintent for the post-grant estoppel provision of the America Invents \nAct. Chairman Smith recently described certain language contained in \nthat provision as an ``inadvertent scrivener's error.'' As written, it \nunintentionally creates a higher threshold of estoppel than was in the \nlegislation that passed the Senate 95-5, or that was intended by the \nHouse, according to Chairman Smith's statement. I hope we will soon \naddress this issue so that the law accurately reflects Congress's \nintent.\n  We must also continue to focus on the troubling problem of several \nhundred ``pre-GATT'' patent applications that have now been pending \nbefore the Patent Office for over 18 years. The original version of \nthis legislation in the House addressed that problem by providing a 1-\nyear window for the pending applications to be processed. \nUnfortunately, that language was removed before final passage in the \nHouse and replaced with a provision requiring the Patent Office to \nprepare a report. The amended bill the Senate has passed today strikes \nthe report, but I will work closely with the PTO to identify the cause \nof the delays and ensure that the PTO has the tools it needs to address \nany abuses by those who may be trying to game the system and use the \npatent laws to impede, rather than encourage innovation.\n  There is still more work to be done to address the problems that \nconfront our patent system. The assertion of patents is still too often \nused by patent trolls to extract payment even where there is not \ninfringement of a valid patent, and the ``tech patent wars'' among the \nlarge mobile phone companies show the perils to competition that can \ncome when companies do not reach business-to-business resolutions of \ntheir patent disputes. But the important reforms made by the Leahy-\nSmith America Invents Act go a long way toward improving the patent \nsystem. This legislation will help streamline those reforms, helping \ninventors, businesses, and the countless American workers employed in \nindustries that produce and rely on intellectual property.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Leahy-\nGrassley substitute amendment which is at the desk be agreed to; the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; a motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, and any \nstatements related to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, passing this bill was a very fine \naccomplishment. Of course, we Senators get up and stand and are very \nproud of it, as we should be. But without our staffs, we could not get \nany of this done.\n  So I would just like to take a few minutes to thank my staff, many of \nwhom were personally impacted by Superstorm Sandy, who worked \ntirelessly to ensure that New York's needs were adequately addressed as \nmy State continues to react and recover from Superstorm Sandy and her \naftermath. Because of their hard work and tireless efforts, I know New \nYork's needs have been addressed in the Sandy supplemental legislation \nthat passed through the Senate earlier this evening.\n  My great LD Heather McHugh coordinated this effort, making sure that \nevery type of aid was considered and included in this package. She has \ngreat knowledge of both the Senate and the House, and it was invaluable \nin getting this done.\n  My deputy chief of staff, Erin Sager Vaughan, who is so selfless and \nwonderful in making sure that every ``t'' is crossed and every ``i'' is \ndotted--I thank her as well.\n  Her team: Gerry Petrella did an amazing job. He is a Long Islander. \nHe felt the impact of this storm personally, and he was there every \nstep of the way making sure we did not leave out anything. Megan \nRichardson, Meghan Taira, Jonah Crane, Grant Kerr, Sean Byrne, Hana \nGreenberg, Veronica Duron were all exceptional on our legislative staff \nin bringing their expertise to help New York.\n  I wish to thank my press team: Brian Fallon, Max Young, Meredith \nKelly, Lindsay Kryzak, Marissa Kaufman, Chris Scribner, who did a great \njob.\n  While this legislation is a tremendous accomplishment for my staff in \nWashington, DC, I would also like to thank members of my regional \noffices who not only lived through and experienced Sandy but made \nthemselves available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to see that the \nneeds of the people of New York would be recognized and addressed, who \nextended their arms to those who were in trouble.\n  Martin Brennan heads my New York operation. He had a torn Achilles \nand hobbled around in a cast, but he led our staff, as he always does, \nas a team and exquisitely.\n  Our casework team, they are seasoned. Suzie Orlove--whom I went to \nsecond grade with and has been working for me for over 30 years--Sydney \nRenwick, Joyce Chang, Julietta Lopez, Jackie Benavides, Karine \nVorperian have spent months helping New Yorkers cut through the redtape \nand get the aid they need.\n  Nick Martin did an amazing job of connecting resources to needs \nacross New York City and Long Island. Cody Peluso and Deanna Robertson \nhelped make sure New York's northern suburbs were not forgotten.\n  Touring the damaged communities was a heart-wrenching task. Lane \nBodian, who travels with me, was with me every step of the way. Our \nlogistics team of Megan Murphy Vlasto, Jenna Jones, and Alex Victor \nhelped make sure we got where we needed to be in those very difficult \ndays after the storm and ever since.\n  Additionally, two members of my team were hit hard by the storm. They \nlost their houses or their houses were badly flooded. I wish to thank \nthem because they ignored their personal situations, particularly in \nthe days after the storm, to help New Yorkers. For that, I will always \nbe grateful to Kyle Strober, who runs our Long Island office, and to \nMichelle Basic, his assistant, whose family's home was flooded badly on \nStaten Island.\n  Finally, the leader of our team is a guy named Mike Lynch, who has \nmolded us into a great operation. He did not put his name in here, \ncharacteristically, but he deserves a huge amount of thanks.\n  Of course, my colleagues Senators Gillibrand, Lautenberg, Menendez, \nand their teams were essential. We worked as sort of a seamless web, \nand I look forward to working with them on the implementation of this \npackage.\n  I wish to thank Senator Inouye. When he was ill, he continued to meet \nwith Senators Gillibrand, Menendez, Lautenberg, and myself. We knew how \nmuch he cared. I know he is looking down, as I think Senator Mikulski \nsaid, and he is smiling at the good work we did in a bipartisan way to \nget this bill passed.\n  Of course, I wish to thank Senator Mikulski. This was the first bill \nshe managed. Let it be a metaphor for all her bills: Senator Gillibrand \nand I have just labeled her ``the engineer.'' She led that train down \nthe track speedily, without flaw, but carefully and was a great leader.\n  Senator Landrieu, the chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, \nwas incredible in giving us advice and help, and even in those darkest \ndays was there for us. The other subcommittee leaders--Senator Leahy, \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Murray--all made sure this package became a \nreality. Their staffs--Charlie Houy, Lilah Helms, Gabby Batkin, Chuck \nKeiffer, and Alex Keenan--were great.\n  Of course, my good friend, truly one of the closest friends I have \nand a great leader of this place, who understood the need and went out \nof his way for us, Senator Reid, was invaluable. It would not have \nhappened without him or his amazing floor staff, led by Gary Myrick and \nTim Mitchell, who gave us tremendous advice and help. So I also thank \nthem.\n  Finally, I thank my Republican colleagues across the aisle for \nputting aside partisanship. We had real differences. But this bill was \ndebated and conducted in the right way. We allowed a lot of amendments. \nThey were not blocked. There were no cheap shots. It was great.\n  I also wish to thank Gary's colleague, Dave Schiappa, for his advice \nand help as well.\n  With that, I wish everybody a nice Saturday and see you all on \nSunday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to amend the order to allow a \nstatement by Senator Pryor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have a couple things to say. First, I \nknow the Senator from New York just left, Mr. Schumer. I want the \npeople of New York to know, all the citizens of that State, how hard he \nworked to get this legislation passed. The entire delegation of New \nYork and New Jersey were outstanding.\n  But Senator Schumer, when the storm was still raging, was on the \nphone calling Senators and Congressmen and calling the White House to \nget help for his State and the region. He deserves a lot of credit for \ngetting us here. But truthfully, the delegations of those States pulled \ntogether and showed a lot of leadership. We appreciate that.\n  Also, we were so pleased Senator Mikulski was able to take the lead \non this bill. It was a lot of fun for all of us to see her in action in \nher first real bill that she handled on the floor as chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/28/senate-section/article/S8519-2", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL SUNDAY, DECEMBER 30, 2012, AT 1 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
