Mr. President, this week something rare occurred here in \nthe Senate: We debated a bill under regular order. No filibusters were \nmounted, no cloture motions were filed on the motion to proceed. That \nis certainly a rare occasion. For that reason we have had ample time to \ndebate and consider amendments. This is how the process should work.\n  Typically, over the last few years we have spent weeks running out \nthe clock on endless procedural motions rather than debating important \nlegislation. It is no wonder the Senate rarely accomplishes anything \nwhen it takes more than a week to have a vote even to begin a bill; \nthat is, whether we even take up a bill, start debate on a bill.\n  I would note, however, that even in this case, and this is an \nimportant piece of legislation, the Defense authorization bill--I did \nnot have to file cloture to get to the bill, but we spent weeks going \nback and forth to get this bill to the floor. Even though the bill \nmanagers are working mightily to make regular order work, a number of \nSenators have advanced nonrelevant amendments, threatening to derail \nthe process. More than 360 amendments have been filed to this bill, \nmany of them nonrelevant. I understand there is a lot of pent-up \nfeelings about: Why have I not been able to offer amendments the last \ncouple of years? Well, because we have not gotten on bills, and when we \ndo, nothing much happens because of the problems that have developed.\n  A number of my colleagues, especially this past week, both Democrats \nand Republicans, have come to me asking for a better path forward in \nthis body, this legislative body we so love. They want the Senate to \nfunction again in the manner the Founders envisioned. They want to see \nus debate legislation, consider relevant amendments, and then vote up \nor down on the matters before this body. Senators want to see us \nconclude legislation, pass or fail. Let's decide what we are going to \ndo, not avoid doing something. They do not want to see more good bills \nfilibustered to death without ever even getting a real vote. If a bill \nis worth bringing to the floor of this body, the Senate, it should get \nto the floor so we can start the debate.\n  One reason we have been able to work with 50, 60 amendments on this \nbill--actually that are disposed of--is because we did not have to \nwaste time for more than a week on a motion to proceed to get to it. So \nI repeat, if a bill is worth bringing to the floor of this body, it \nshould get to the floor quickly. It deserves an up-or-down vote once we \ngo on it.\n\n[[Page S7280]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/30/senate-section/article/S7280-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 3254, which the clerk will \nreport by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3254) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2013 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Kyl amendment No. 3123, to require regular updates of \n     Congress on the military implications of proposals of the \n     United States and Russia under consideration in negotiations \n     on nuclear arms, missile defense, and long-range conventional \n     strike system matters.\n       Menendez amendment No. 3232, to enhance sanctions imposed \n     with respect to Iran.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to take a couple of minutes \nthis morning to discuss Senator Sessions' amendment which we will be \nvoting on shortly, amendment No. 3009, which I cosponsor, and explain \nmy views on why this amendment is important in terms of the balance \nthis body traditionally and historically should have with the executive \nbranch of our government.\n  There are two clarifications in this amendment that I believe are \nimportant in terms of how we develop long-term relationships, security \nrelationships, with other countries. The first is that, as we know, \nrecently the President of the United States entered into what they have \ntermed an ``enduring strategic partnership agreement'' between the \nUnited States and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan which proposes to \nestablish an enduring strategic partnership. This has been done without \nthe consent of the Congress. It has been justified based on the \nauthority of the President to use force in order to respond to these \nincidents that began on 9/11.\n  I believe it is important for us as a body to make the distinction \nthat the authorization for the use of military force does not in and of \nitself authorize the executive branch to enter into long-term security \nagreements with another country that can affect the number of forces \nthat are there. It can affect a broad range of governmental issues that \nare far beyond the use of force in terms of dealing with international \nterrorism.\n  This is true in our history. It is actually true in the way these \nother countries--Iraq and now Afghanistan--have been dealing with the \nsame documents. I can recall during the previous administration when \nthey signed a strategic framework agreement, and then we began working \non the status of forces agreement with Iraq. I called at that time for \nthis agreement, the strategic framework agreement, which is a long-term \nrelationship proposed between the United States and Iraq, to be \nsubmitted to the Congress for review. I actually had to go into one of \nthese rooms where you close the door as if you were reading a top-\nsecret document even to examine the strategic framework agreement, \nwhich was not classified and which the Iraqi Parliament voted on twice. \nWe did not even get to vote on it. I do not think that is the way our \nsystem of government should be working.\n  We are seeing the same situation here with Afghanistan. We should not \nbe entering into a long-term security relationship with Afghanistan \npurely at the discretion of the executive branch. The Congress should \nhave a part to play in this. That is the second point. The question is, \nWhat should the role of Congress be? I think that is what has paralyzed \nus as a body for the 6 years I have been here in the Senate.\n  This is not a treaty. This would not be a treaty, so we would not \nhave to go through the entire consent process of a treaty, which could \nparalyze our foreign policy. The Presiding Officer and I both have \nworked for several years here now trying to get the Law of the Sea \nTreaty into place. It has been bouncing around for decades. But it \nshould be more than what they call ``consultation.'' Every time we talk \nto the executive branch--and I am a former member of the executive \nbranch. I spent 4 years in the Pentagon in the Reagan administration. \nThey say they have ``consulted,'' and the definition of the \n``consultation'' could be the Secretary of State calling the chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee or the Secretary of Defense calling \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee or coming over for a \nmeeting. That is not the level of discussion and involvement the \nCongress should have when we are talking about long-term commitments \nwith countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  This amendment is not Draconian. It is very sensible. It basically \nsays that in the situation where we have entered into this proposed \nrelationship with Afghanistan, the key committees over here in the \nCongress should have 30 days to review the documents before they are \nput into play. There is no great urgency in terms of when these \ndocuments are implemented. It is the same courtesy--it is not actually \nas far as what the Afghan Parliament is going to be able to do on the \nother side. For that reason, I commend the Senator from Alabama for \nhaving decided to come forward with this amendment. It has my support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3009, as \nmodified, and ask for its consideration.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we would need to see the modification \nbefore it is accepted.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe it is at the desk.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We would have to reserve the right--if you could call up \nthe amendment and then hold off on any modification until we can see \nit.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3009\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3009 and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3009.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for congressional review of any bilateral security \n                      agreement with Afghanistan)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1221. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF BILATERAL SECURITY \n                   AGREEMENT WITH AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Authorization for the Use of Military Force (Public \n     Law 107-40; 115 Stat. 224) authorizes the President to use \n     all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, \n     organizations, or persons the President determines planned, \n     authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that \n     occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such \n     organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts \n     of international terrorism against the United States by such \n     nations, organizations, or persons.\n       (2) President Barack Obama and Secretary of Defense Leon \n     Panetta have stated that the United States continues to fight \n     in Afghanistan to defeat the al Qaeda threat and the Taliban, \n     which harbored al Qaeda in Afghanistan, where the attacks of \n     September 11, 2001, were planned and where the attackers \n     received training.\n       (3) On May 1, 2012, the United States entered into the \n     ``Enduring Strategic Partnership Agreement Between the United \n     States of America and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan'', \n     which establishes an enduring strategic partnership between \n     the United States and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.\n       (4) The Agreement reaffirms the presence and operations of \n     United States Armed Forces in Afghanistan, and establishes \n     long-term commitments between the two countries, including \n     the continued commitment\n\n[[Page S7281]]\n\n     of United States forces and political and financial support \n     to the Government of Afghanistan.\n       (5) The Agreement also commits the United States to \n     establishing a long-term Bilateral Security Agreement, with \n     the goal of concluding a Bilateral Security Agreement within \n     one year to supersede the present Status of Forces agreements \n     with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.\n       (6) Congress was not consulted regarding the framework or \n     substance of the Agreement.\n       (7) In the past, Congress has been consulted, and, in some \n     cases, has provided its advice and consent to ratification of \n     such agreements, including those where the use of force was \n     not authorized nor required in the country.\n       (b) Notification Requirement.--Not later than 30 days \n     before entering into any Bilateral Security Agreement or \n     other agreement with the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan that \n     will affect the Status of Forces agreements and long-term \n     commitments between the United States and the Islamic \n     Republic of Afghanistan, the President shall submit the \n     agreement to the appropriate congressional committees for \n     review. If the President fails to comply with such \n     requirement, 50 percent of the unobligated balance of the \n     amounts appropriated or otherwise made available for the \n     Executive Office of the President shall be withheld.\n       (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like just like to say that this \namendment arose after Senator Webb expressed concerns at one of our \nArmed Services Committee hearing fundamentally that Iraq and \nAfghanistan are voting in their parliaments on the force of status \nagreements, and we are not even seeing the agreement here, so I \nappreciate his leadership and am glad to work with him on this piece of \nlegislation. I think his work moves us in the right direction.\n  We will talk with Chairman Levin to see where we are.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I couldn't miss the opportunity to \nexpress our appreciation for the services of Senator Webb. As all of us \nknow, but it doesn't hurt to be reminded, he is a Vietnam veteran, one \nof the most highly decorated veterans in the entire war, a combat \nleader of men in fierce combat. He served the country in a number of \ndifferent ways and in this Senate. Actually his book, Fields of Fire, \nremains the premier novel on the Vietnam War and is the most studied \nnovel in colleges to this day about the war in Vietnam.\n  So, at any rate, I just wanted to share those remarks while we had a \nminute here and express my appreciation to Senator Webb for his service \nto the country and to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on these amendments of Senator Sessions and \nSenator Webb--and, by the way, I thoroughly and totally join Senator \nSessions in his commends about Senator Webb. I think he spoke for the \nentire body when he made those comments.\n  We had agreed that we would do the following: There are a number of \nchanges which need to be made in this amendment which the sponsors have \nagreed to. There are some additional concerns about this amendment, \nwhich we believe we can take care of in conference. So the suggestion \nwas made to Senator Sessions and Senator Webb that we voice vote this \nat this time, and we address some of those concerns and modifications \nin conference, and I would suggest that we do that at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate on the \namendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3009) was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think the order is that we now proceed to consideration \nof the Cardin amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3025\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. Chairman, I call up amendment No. 3025.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report:\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3025.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure sufficient sizing of the civilian and contract \n           services workforces of the Department of Defense)\n\n       Strike section 341 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 341. CIVILIAN AND CONTRACT SERVICES WORKFORCE BALANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Defense shall, consistent \n     with the requirements of sections 129 and 129a of title 10, \n     United States Code, ensure that the civilian and contract \n     services workforces of the Department of Defense are \n     sufficiently sized, taking into account military strategy \n     requirements and military end-strength.\n       (b) Comptroller General Report.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually \n     thereafter, the Comptroller General of the United States \n     shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report \n     assessing the sufficiency of sizing of the civilian and \n     contract services workforces of the Department of Defense. \n     The report shall assess whether the sizing is consistent with \n     workforce management and sourcing laws, including sections \n     129 and 129a of title 10, United States Code.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled on \namendment No. 3025 offered by the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this amendment would eliminate an \narbitrary cap on the civilian and contractual workforce. The \nadministration supports this amendment. Without this amendment being \nadopted, the Department said it will need to significantly divest \nworkload and impose workforce caps.\n  The amount of civilian and contractual workforce should be determined \nby mission, by workload and by budget, as the law provides. This \narbitrary cap would be like a second sequestration type of cap on the \ncivilian and contractual workforce.\n  My cosponsors include Senators Akaka, Mikulski, Begich, Durbin, Brown \nof Ohio, McCaskill, Harkin, Boxer, Leahy, and Tester.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this was unanimously approved by the \ncommittee. There is a provision in there that would simply require the \nDepartment to plan to reduce funding for civilian and contractor \npersonnel by approximately 5 percent, which would be less reduction \nthan what is contemplated from the military side.\n  Right now, the President's budget, not counting sequester, would \nreduce military personnel by 123,900 men and women serving in the \nmilitary or 5.5 percent over 5 years.\n  Since 2001, the civilian personnel in the Department of Defense has \nincreased by 100,000, a 16 percent increase and a 37 percent increase \nin civilian pay costs.\n  The Department of Defense continues to be top heavy with \nheadquarters. The Office of the Secretary will grow by 25 percent from \n2001 to 2017.\n  Look, we all know that the Department of Defense is being downsized, \nso there has to be, obviously, a commensurate reduction in civilians, \nwhich is actually less than what is actually contemplated in the \nmilitary.\n  This was unanimously reported, and I have had conversations with the \nSecretary of Defense, who agrees that we need to reduce the civilian \npersonnel as well as the uniformed personnel.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed for \n10 seconds.\n\n[[Page S7282]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. We are cutting \nmilitary end strength by 5 percent over the next 5 years. In this \nbudget situation, we have no choice but to cut the Defense Department \ncivilian employee and contractor workforces as well. This gives \nflexibility to the Department of Defense when and where to make the \ncuts.\n  We have got to make some reductions in the defense budget. This does \nit in a way which is flexible and necessary, so I too oppose the \namendment.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. Chairman, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 16 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me just point out the civilian \nworkforce is going to be cut. According to the House Armed Services \nCommittee, over 10,000 positions will be eliminated in FY12 alone.\n  The House bill does not contain this provision. This provision \nimposes an effective cap on civilian and contractual workers.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Regular order here.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired. \nUnder the previous order, the question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Cardin.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Maryland be \ngiven an additional 3 minutes, if he so desires.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I will not take 3 minutes.\n  The point I am bringing up is that what this would do is impose an \nadditional cap on civilian and contractual. They are already controlled \nby law. The law says by mission and budget. That is what it should be. \nThe administration supports this amendment, and I would urge my \ncolleagues to approve it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment of the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Cardin.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch), the \nSenator from Nevada (Mr. Heller), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. \nKirk).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. \nAlexander) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is now going to be a 2-minute debate \non the Menendez amendment on Iran sanctions.\n  What Senator McCain and I asked for last night, and we again ask for \nnow, is that the Members let us know which amendments they believe need \nto be voted on if a rollcall vote and a debate is necessary because we \nare going to attempt to put together a unanimous consent agreement \nwhich will lay out the amendments that would be voted on before cloture \nnext Monday.\n  It was our expectation by the end of the day that cloture was going \nto be filed by the leader. We can try to avoid that problem if we can \nwork out a finite list of amendments to put in a unanimous consent \nagreement so we can work toward the final completion of this bill.\n  So I urge Members during this period to work with our staffs and let \nthem know what amendments they believe must be disposed of prior to the \nend of this bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3232\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order there will \nnow be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment \nNo. 3232 offered by the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Menendez and Senator Kirk \nfor this very important action of tightening sanctions on Iran.\n  The centrifuges are still spinning in Tehran, and we have enacted \nstrong sanctions. They have had some effect, but we have not had \nsufficient effect.\n  I thank Senator Menendez and Senator Kirk for this language in this \namendment. I will not go through a list of all the actions that will be \ntaken against Iran, but the screws need to be tightened. This is an \nimportant act, and it can--I emphasize, can--lead to a way to prevent a \nconflagration in the Middle East.\n  I thank Senator Menendez for his leadership, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his support \nand his words, and the chairman for his help in getting us here. This \nis a bipartisan amendment that is vital to U.S. national security and \nregional stability in the Middle East.\n  Our most recent sanctions that we passed a year ago 100 to 0 are \nworking toward crippling Iran's economy, but Iran hasn't quit trying. \nThat is why we need to go further with this amendment and apply \nadditional sanctions to Iran's energy, port, shipping, shipbuilding \nsectors that support their nuclear program, and the sales of certain \ncommodities that support those sectors.\n  Just this week the IAEA said Iran has not slowed down its enrichment \nactivities. They continue to deny access for inspection of facilities, \nand they have actually conducted live tests of conventional explosives \nthat could be used to detonate a nuclear weapon. We must make clear to \nthe Iranians that toughing out and waiting out is not an option; that \nit will only get worse. And I hope we have, on behalf of Senator Kirk, \nmyself, Senators Lieberman and Casey, and many other colleagues, the \nstrong bipartisan vote we had last year.\n\n\n                         Sanctions Credibility\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, in August, Congress passed and the \nPresident signed into law the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human \nRights Act of 2012. This measure, coupled with CISADA and last year's \npowerful Iran Central Bank legislation authored by Senators Menendez \nand Kirk, have helped dramatically to increase pressure on the Iranian \ngovernment to halt its illicit nuclear activities. Iran's petroleum \nexports have dropped by more\n\n[[Page S7283]]\n\nthan half this year, producing losses of over $100 million each day to \nIran's economy. Even so, Iran continues to press forward aggressively \nwith its enrichment program and to suppress the rights of its citizens.\n  The bipartisan amendment proposed by Senators Menendez and Kirk to \nthe 2013 National Defense Authorization Act will further tighten \nsanctions on Iran and increase the economic pressure on its leaders. I \nhave worked closely with Senator Menendez and respect his fierce \ncommitment to this issue, and to giving the administration all of the \ntools it needs to deal with Iran. I support the amendment. Our \nsanctions laws have become increasingly complex, however, and to assure \nthat the new provisions can be effectively implemented, I hope we can \nwork with officials in the Departments of State and Treasury to \ncontinue to refine these provisions as the bill moves to conference. \nThis is a complex area of the law, and we need to have a sure hand as \nwe go forward toward conference, drawing clear lines and avoiding any \nunintended consequences that might undermine the credibility of the \noverall sanctions regime.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I welcome my colleague's support, and I agree to work \nwith him to refine the new sanctions provisions contained in this \namendment to make them as workable and effective as possible as the \nbill moves forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds on \nthis amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I strongly support this amendment. It will continue to \ntighten sanctions on Iran and to bring into strong participation the \ninternational community.\n  This amendment is a continuing effort. The administration has made \nmajor efforts. I commend them for it. But this will add great strength \nto the existing sanctions which are essential to force Iran to comply \nwith the international community.\n  The administration has raised concerns--we know that--about some \nprovisions of this amendment. They have indicated that the amendment \ndoes not give them sufficient waiver flexibility. The Banking Committee \nhas raised some issues, and we will try to address, if we can, in an \nappropriate way some of these concerns in conference. But I strongly \nsupport this amendment and hope it gets the unanimous support or near \nunanimous support in this body.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nquestion occurs on amendment No. 3232.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are fortunate to have two of the most \nseasoned veterans managing this bill. They understand the legislation. \nThey have worked together for a quarter of a century on this. No one \nknows this subject matter better than these two managers.\n  Having said that, they are now going to put their experience to a \ntest because they are going to come up with a finite list. People have \nwanted to start legislating the way we have legislated. That is what we \nare doing here. As I mentioned this morning, we have almost 400 \namendments that have been filed on this bill, but that is not unusual. \nPeople have a pent-up desire to offer amendments and we all understand \nthat. But from that list, these two managers are going to cull a number \nof amendments to come up with a finite list; that is, a list of \namendments that should be disposed of.\n  They are going to do that by unanimous consent, and I hope everyone \nwill cooperate. They will be as fair as they can to Democrats and \nRepublicans. People should look at the list. If they don't like it, \nthen they should talk to one of the managers, but that is the way it \nis. There will be no more votes after the next one, but by noon today \nthere will be a determination as to whether there will be further \nactivity on this legislation.\n  We have a vote that is now going to be announced by the Chair in a \nminute. I hope everybody understands we have made great progress on \nthis bill. This legislation has passed 51 consecutive years. This will \nbe the 52nd year we have passed this bill. It would be untoward and not \ngood for our fighting men and women not to pass this legislation. Once \nwe pass it, we can't spend a lot more time on it. This is a massive \nbill. It has to go to conference with the House. The two managers and \nthe conferees have to work something out so we will have a final \nproduct before the end of the year.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In addition to putting together a finite list, which would \nbe the amendments which would apparently require rollcall votes, we \nwill continue to try to clear amendments which can be cleared on both \nsides. It is the amendments which we believe would require rollcall \nvotes in order for us to proceed that we are going to put on a finite \nlist. So don't give up on amendments just because they are not on the \nlist. If we indicate to our colleagues that we have a reasonable chance \nof clearing those amendments today or Monday, we would add those to the \npossibilities.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I hope our colleagues understand we \nare either going to do this finite list or we will have cloture and \nnonrelevant amendments will automatically fall. I hope everybody \nunderstands this is one of two options, and it seems to me if we agree \non a finite list, we can then have a better chance for amendments to be \nconsidered.\n  I wish to thank the majority leader and all our colleagues for their \npatience throughout this very difficult process. I hope, in the \ninterests of achieving the objective of passing this legislation, we \nwill allow the amendments that are relevant and debate and votes.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, I ask all Senators to know that word ``cloture'' \ndid not purse my lips.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would all Senators please note--I wish to thank the leader\n\n[[Page S7284]]\n\nfor this--he used the word, referring to Senator McCain and me, as \n``seasoned'' Senators rather than older Senators. Thank you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3073\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The next amendment to be offered is \namendment No. 3073.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I call up amendment No. 3073.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3073.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To repeal the requirement for reduction of survivor annuities \n under the Survivor Benefit Plan by veterans' dependency and indemnity \n                             compensation)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 643. REPEAL OF REQUIREMENT OF REDUCTION OF SURVIVOR \n                   BENEFITS PLAN SURVIVOR ANNUITIES BY DEPENDENCY \n                   AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--\n       (1) In general.--Subchapter II of chapter 73 of title 10, \n     United States Code, is amended as follows:\n       (A) In section 1450, by striking subsection (c).\n       (B) In section 1451(c)--\n       (i) by striking paragraph (2); and\n       (ii) by redesignating paragraphs (3) and (4) as paragraphs \n     (2) and (3), respectively.\n       (2) Conforming amendments.--Such subchapter is further \n     amended as follows:\n       (A) In section 1450--\n       (i) by striking subsection (e);\n       (ii) by striking subsection (k); and\n       (iii) by striking subsection (m).\n       (B) In section 1451(g)(1), by striking subparagraph (C).\n       (C) In section 1452--\n       (i) in subsection (f)(2), by striking ``does not apply--'' \n     and all that follows and inserting ``does not apply in the \n     case of a deduction made through administrative error.''; and\n       (ii) by striking subsection (g).\n       (D) In section 1455(c), by striking ``, 1450(k)(2),''.\n       (b) Prohibition on Retroactive Benefits.--No benefits may \n     be paid to any person for any period before the effective \n     date provided under subsection (f) by reason of the \n     amendments made by subsection (a).\n       (c) Prohibition on Recoupment of Certain Amounts Previously \n     Refunded to SBP Recipients.--A surviving spouse who is or has \n     been in receipt of an annuity under the Survivor Benefit Plan \n     under subchapter II of chapter 73 of title 10, United States \n     Code, that is in effect before the effective date provided \n     under subsection (f) and that is adjusted by reason of the \n     amendments made by subsection (a) and who has received a \n     refund of retired pay under section 1450(e) of title 10, \n     United States Code, shall not be required to repay such \n     refund to the United States.\n       (d) Repeal of Authority for Optional Annuity for Dependent \n     Children.--Section 1448(d) of such title is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2)(B), the Secretary concerned'' and inserting \n     ``The Secretary concerned''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) by striking ``Dependent children.--'' and all that \n     follows through ``In the case of a member described in \n     paragraph (1),'' and inserting ``Dependent children annuity \n     when no eligible surviving spouse.--In the case of a member \n     described in paragraph (1),''; and\n       (B) by striking subparagraph (B).\n       (e) Restoration of Eligibility for Previously Eligible \n     Spouses.--The Secretary of the military department concerned \n     shall restore annuity eligibility to any eligible surviving \n     spouse who, in consultation with the Secretary, previously \n     elected to transfer payment of such annuity to a surviving \n     child or children under the provisions of section \n     1448(d)(2)(B) of title 10, United States Code, as in effect \n     on the day before the effective date provided under \n     subsection (f). Such eligibility shall be restored whether or \n     not payment to such child or children subsequently was \n     terminated due to loss of dependent status or death. For the \n     purposes of this subsection, an eligible spouse includes a \n     spouse who was previously eligible for payment of such \n     annuity and is not remarried, or remarried after having \n     attained age 55, or whose second or subsequent marriage has \n     been terminated by death, divorce or annulment.\n       (f) Effective Date.--This section and the amendments made \n     by this section shall take effect on the later of--\n       (1) the first day of the first month that begins after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act; or\n       (2) the first day of the fiscal year that begins in the \n     calendar year in which this Act is enacted.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 3073.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I can explain this in 60 \nseconds. This is the widows and orphans offset. It is a moral issue \nbecause under the Veterans' Administration, someone who dies service \nconnected gets compensation of about $1,100 a month for their widow. At \nthe same time, many of those people have a life insurance contract, an \nannuity, called a survivor benefit plan. It pays equally the same \namount. Current law offsets the two.\n  The Senate has passed this six times in the last decade, and we have \nwhittled away at that offset in conference, but the major part of the \noffset is still there. That is the essence for the widows and orphans.\n  We have seen the movie ``Lincoln.'' Remember what Lincoln said in his \nsecond inaugural address; that the cost of war is borne not only by \nthose who fight but by their widows and orphans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I strongly support the policy Senator \nNelson has laid out. As a matter of fact, I have voted for it every \nsingle time he has brought it to the floor, and I thank him for \npointing out this problem that exists.\n  However, circumstances are different this time. We are all operating \nunder the Budget Control Act. The Nation is watching as we try to deal \nwith fiscal issues that are before us. The amounts that are in the \nBudget Control Act are counted as it relates to dealing with our \ndeficit and, unfortunately, this is not offset over the next decade, \nand that violates the budget by $7 billion.\n  For that reason, the pending measure, amendment No. 3073 to S. 3254, \nthe National Defense Reauthorization Act, would cause the underlying \nlegislation to exceed the authorizing committee's section 302(a) \nallocation of new budget authority for outlays. Therefore, I raise a \npoint of order against the measure pursuant to section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  I encourage all of us who want to solve this problem before the year \nends to vote against it. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I move to waive and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 58, the \nnays are 34. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of \norder is sustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3123, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KYL. If the Democratic manager of the bill has nothing right at \nthis moment, I wish to modify an amendment which is at the desk, No. \n3123, and ask that the amendment be withdrawn and the Senate consider, \ninstead, the amendment I have at the desk.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Senator yield, because I want to make sure we \nare on the same track.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is this the amendment that has been amended after \ndiscussions with Senator Kerry?\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Then is it the Senator's intent to send a new amendment to \nthe desk? Is that it?\n  Mr. KYL. The original amendment, No. 3123, would be withdrawn. The \nmodification of that amendment, as written by Senator Kerry, and I \nbelieve cleared by the Senator's side, would be the modified.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So, in other words, it would be the same numbered \namendment, as modified?\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What is the intent of my friend from Arizona to do with \nthat amendment now?\n  Mr. KYL. To make about a 45-second statement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Then have it adopted?\n  Mr. KYL. Eventually, but not today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Not to have it adopted at this time by voice vote?\n  Mr. KYL. Correct, although I would say I am not going to need a \nrollcall vote at the end.\n  Mr. LEVIN. At some point the Senator would be happy to take a voice \nvote on it?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. This amendment is also offered by Senators Lieberman, \nInhofe, Risch, Lugar, Sessions, DeMint, Cornyn, Rubio, Wicker, Ayotte, \nCollins, Corker, and Vitter. I do understand it has been cleared by \nboth sides, and I do appreciate the cooperation with Senator Kerry.\n  The amendment provides that the administration shall brief the \nappropriate committees on the dialogue between the United States and \nRussia on issues related to or limits on or controls on nuclear arms, \nmissile defense systems, or long-range conventional strike systems.\n  I think it is in the administration's interests to consult with the \nCongress and keep us adequately briefed on these discussions because \nthey could, of course, eventually lead to an agreement which might then \nrequire the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  I note former Senator Arthur Vandenburg first said, ``If I'm going to \nbe in on the crash landing, I want to be in on the takeoff,'' meaning, \nof course, that it is much easier for the administration to obtain our \nconsent if they seek advice during the consultation process. I would \nconfess this amendment was prompted by recent press stories, including \none on November 8, which reported that our Ambassador to Russia, \nMichael McFaul said, ``President Obama would like to have a serious \nconversation with President Putin about a further round of reductions \nin nuclear weapons to build on the START treaty.''\n  I conclude that another round of negotiations or discussions with \nRussia concerning nuclear arms will be extremely complicated and \nimportant and is likely to concern the missile defenses as conventional \nlong-range strike systems, about which I know I and others have serious \nmisgivings. I think this suggests the necessity and the desirability of \nthe kind of consultation we would be requesting of the administration \nprior to any agreement being reached.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' indulgence. At the appropriate time I \nwill ask for approval of the amendment, as modified.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3123), as modified,is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require briefings on dialogue between the United States \n and the Russian Federation on nuclear arms, missile defense, and long-\n                   range conventional strike systems)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1074. BRIEFINGS ON DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES \n                   AND THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION ON NUCLEAR ARMS, \n                   MISSILE DEFENSE, AND LONG-RANGE CONVENTIONAL \n                   STRIKE SYSTEMS.\n\n       (a) Briefings.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and not less than twice each year \n     thereafter, the President, or the President's designee, shall \n     brief the Committees on Foreign Relations and Armed Services \n     of the Senate on the dialogue between the United States and \n     the Russian Federation on issues related to limits or \n     controls on nuclear arms, missile defense systems, or long-\n     range conventional strike systems.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate on Certain Agreements.--It is the \n     sense of the Senate that any agreement between the United \n     States and the Russian Federation related to missile defense, \n     nuclear weapons, or long-range conventional strike systems \n     obligating the United States to reduce or limit the Armed \n     Forces or armaments of the United States in any militarily \n     significant manner may be made only pursuant to the treaty-\n     making power of the President as set forth in Article II, \n     section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me thank Senator Kyl with the way in which he has \nworked with Senator Kerry. It is very constructive and very important. \nI want to tell him how much we all appreciate that working together.\n  I believe Senator Shaheen is going to want to be recognized for up to \n10 minutes to talk on an amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to a provision that is \nactually already in this bill, the NDAA authorization bill before us. \nIt is a provision that would provide for reproductive health parity for \nwomen in the military.\n  You know, we talk a lot in this Chamber and in the Armed Services \nCommittee about the service of our men and women in uniform. We talk \nabout their courage in the face of our enemies, we talk about their \nselflessness as they continually deploy around the world, sometimes \nuprooting their families and sometimes leaving them behind. We talk \nabout our responsibilities to the men and women who are serving, from \nthe tools they will need to accomplish their missions to the support \nthey have earned when they return home.\n  I am pleased, as I know we all are, about the growing recognition of \nthe unprecedented contribution our female servicemembers are making to \nour national defense. There are over 214,000 women serving in our Armed \nForces. They make up over 14 percent of our total Armed Forces. Women \nare flying our F-15 Strike Eagles, Apaches, and Black Hawks. Women are \ntraining to be Marine Corps infantry officers and working alongside our \nspecial operations units in Afghanistan. Women are an integral part of \nnearly all of our military operations. Earlier this year the Department \nof Defense opened 14,000 new positions to women.\n  When he was asked about the move, Secretary Panetta said, ``Through \ntheir courage, sacrifice, patriotism and great skill, women have proven \ntheir ability to serve in an expanding number of roles on and off the \nbattlefield.''\n  The women serving in the U.S. military continue to overcome barriers \nand strive for new opportunities to serve their country. They have \ncarried on the finest traditions of our military and should make us all \nvery proud.\n  Yet despite their service, women in the military continue to face \ndiscrimination when it comes to reproductive\n\n[[Page S7286]]\n\nhealth care. In the United States, women are receiving health care \nthrough Medicaid, Medicare, the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram, and the Indian Health Service, so all of the Federal health \ncare programs. All have access to the care they need if they face \npregnancy resulting from rape or incest.\n  Even women incarcerated in Federal prison are protected in the case \nof rape. Yet right now our women in the military are not granted the \nsame access to abortion services in cases of rape or incest.\n  To be clear, a general ban on abortion coverage remains for millions \nof women who receive health care through the Federal Government. \nHowever, in nearly all cases, these bans allow for coverage if the life \nof the mother is in danger or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or \nincest. It is simply unfair that military women continue to be denied \nsuch reproductive health care.\n  Like so many of us in the Chamber, I was so encouraged that during \nthis year's markup of the NDAA, a strong bipartisan majority of my \ncolleagues on the Armed Services Committee, including Chair Levin and \nRanking Member McCain, supported providing reproductive health parity \nto our servicewomen.\n  The NDAA bill before us will finally bring the Department of Defense \npolicy on abortion coverage in line with the policies governing the \nrest of the Federal Government.\n  Over the coming weeks, I will continue to work with my colleagues \nhere in the Senate, many of whom are long-time champions on this issue, \nto ensure that this provision is included during the conference with \nthe House and ultimately signed by the President.\n  In the end, this is an issue of basic equality. Women serving in our \nArmed Forces should be able to access the same reproductive health \nservices as the civilians they protect. Access to care should no longer \nbe one of the sacrifices women in the U.S. military are forced to make. \nWomen in the military deserve the best, most comprehensive health care \nwe can provide.\n  I am encouraged by the bipartisan support this provision has received \nthus far, and I am hopeful we will see it become law this year. It is \nway past time, and it is the least we can do for our female \nservicemembers.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and the ranking member, for your \nsupport on this provision.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. She is an \nadvocate and a very active and important member of our committee.\n  I also would wish to thank her for arranging yesterday's event on \nbehalf of and in memory of one of the great Members of this body, \nWarren Rudman. I thought it was a wonderful event, and I thank the \nSenator, both senators from New Hampshire, for arranging what I think \nwas a very fitting tribute to one of the real giants of the Senate in \nthe New Hampshire tradition, so I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. If I could briefly reply, I very much appreciate the \nSenator's remarks about yesterday's reception and especially the \nwonderful tribute you made to Senator Rudman, who was a real giant, not \njust in the Senate but, of course, in New Hampshire. It was such a \nremarkable collection of celebrated political people from this \ncountry's history who were there yesterday to give tribute, and I so \nappreciate that.\n  Also, I so much appreciate Senator McCain's support for this \nprovision in the bill and thank the Senator for that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before Senator Shaheen leaves the floor, I \nwant to add my thanks to her and for those words expressed by Senator \nMcCain. Senator Shaheen is, indeed, an extraordinary Member of this \nbody and a great asset for us on the Armed Services Committee. I very \nmuch appreciate her work on so many issues including the one she just \nspoke about.\n  I so much regret I was unable to be at that event yesterday for \nSenator Rudman, because my memories of him are warm and I had very much \nlooked forward to being there. I could not be there, but I know that \nSenator McCain--I don't know who else spoke. I have heard rave reviews \nabout the quality of the speeches.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Vice President of the United States also was in \nattendance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And I understand that there was a quantity, and there was \nalso a fairly long speech by the Vice President which delayed things on \nthe floor by a few hours--by a few minutes, excuse me. But I hear it \nwas a wonderful tribute. I only wish I could have been there.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As my friend from Michigan knows, the Vice President of \nthe United States is not notorious for his brevity.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Yes, there was an interesting bet between former \nSecretary Cohen and the Vice President relative to who would have the \nshortest speech, and I think the Vice President lost that.\n  But I thank the Senator for his kind words, and the Senator would \nhave loved it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I didn't have to be there to know that the Vice President \nwould lose any bet where he is betting anyone that he will be shorter \nthan anybody on any subject.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, 15 months ago in August, the debt \nceiling of the United States was reached; that is, that we had borrowed \nall of the money we could lawfully borrow. A big discussion occurred \nand a number of things came out of it.\n  Finally, it was agreed to raise the debt ceiling so the government \ncould continue to borrow. Almost 40 cents of every dollar we spend now \nis borrowed. It is unbelievable, but it is true. We also agreed that \nover 10 years, we would reduce spending by $2.1 trillion. That is a lot \nof money, but compared to what we are spending, it is not so much.\n  For example, we were expected to spend, over the next 10 years, $47 \ntrillion over the--basically, $37 trillion we would spend now if we \nmaintain the current level, and we agreed to reduce it from 47 to 45. \nSpending over 10 years would grow by $8 trillion instead of $10 \ntrillion, not something that would destroy the Republic, but it was a \nstep of noticeable weight to change the debt course of America. We \nstill remain, after that agreement, totally on an unsustainable debt \ncourse. We have more work to do.\n\n  But the point I want to make is it passed both Houses of Congress, it \nhad the support of both leaders and the President of the United States. \nIt didn't freeze spending in a lot of things, it didn't cut spending in \na lot of things, but it did reduce the growth of spending and give us \nsome real teeth through that on certain accounts--not all accounts.\n  Well, today was the third vote in recent weeks in which this Senate \nsaid: We will abide by and adhere to the agreement we reached. We will \nnot spend more than we agreed to spend just August a year ago. This is \na 10-year agreement. We promised to stay within those limits for 10 \nyears. Yet within 15 months, a little over a year, we have now had the \nfifth bill on the floor of the Senate that violated that agreement. And \nthis is the third time the Members of the Senate said: No, we are not \ngoing to keep violating that agreement.\n  This survivor benefit program reform is something I have favored. I \nworked with Senator Nelson years ago. I was a cosponsor with him of the \nlegislation, and we have tried a lot of ways to do it. But we agreed to \nspending limitations. The amendment Senator Nelson offered today had a \ngreat goal, it is something I think we can figure a way to advance for \nsure, but there was no reduction of spending and no pay-for for this \namendment. There just wasn't. At the last moment he walks in with $7 \nbillion--almost $7 billion--in new spending, none of which was paid \nfor, in blatant, direct, total violation of the agreement we reached in \nAugust a year ago.\n  We had Members, Republican Members--and I appreciate Senator Carper \nbreaking ranks and voting to uphold the budget--who wanted to vote for \nthis and felt bad they were not able to allow the amendment to advance, \nbut it violates the budget. So I was proud\n\n[[Page S7287]]\n\nof that. I think it is the right thing for America.\n  We can do this. I believe our message is being sent. We brought up a \npopular bill, the Sportsmen's Act, and I was for that, but it wasn't \npaid for or it spent more money than we agreed to in the Budget Control \nAct. So this amendment would have spent more money--$7 billion more \nthan we agreed to. We blocked the Sportsmen's Act and it was $140 \nmillion more than we agreed to. The Senate said no, even though many of \nus liked what was in that bill. This was $7 billion above what we \nagreed to, and even with the good cause we said we should adhere to the \nlimits we have.\n  If we have new priorities that we want to fund, can't we find \nwasteful spending somewhere in our government? One of the dysfunctions \nwe have, one of the reasons it is so hard to get something such as that \naccomplished and fund a new spending program without borrowing the \nmoney, just increasing the debt, is everybody is jealous of their \naccount. How silly is that. We should all be focusing on the national \ninterest. So when we say we are going to reduce this program over here \nand we are going to pay for the benefits for widows, people \nautomatically say: No, you can't take my money. But it is all the \ntaxpayers' money, isn't it? It is not this Senator's money or this \ncommittee's money, it is not this program's money. It is all the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  We have been in denial. We think business as usual is going to \ncontinue, but this country has never, ever, ever been in a more \nsystemic, dangerous position with regard to our finances. Never. We \nhave had expert testimony on that. So we have to be honest about it. We \nhave to do the right thing. We can't have a Senator waltz in, even with \nsomething we would wish to support, and ask us to vote for it when it \nadds $7 billion above the amount we agreed to spend. I wanted to say \nthat because it is a troubling situation for us.\n  One more thing. The President of the United States is the one person \nwho speaks for America. He is now pushing and advancing an agenda that \nseems to me to raise taxes. But will it reduce spending? No. It seems \nthe new taxes are to fund new spending. Well, we don't have the \nnumbers, so I am going to be asking him to see the numbers. I am the \nranking member on the Budget Committee. I want to see how much new \nspending they have and how much new taxes they have, and if it is like \nwhat we have been seeing, there is a lot of flimflam. We had a budget \nprojection that was voted down 100 percent, not a single vote. The \nbudget he sent out earlier this year increased taxes $1.8 trillion but \nincreased spending $1.4. So it didn't pay down the debt.\n  I hope the President will look the American people in the eye and \ntell them we are on an unsustainable course. I have not heard him say \nthat. Why won't he say that? His own debt commissioner, Erskine Bowles, \nsaid we face the most predictable debt crisis in our Nation's history. \nWhy won't the President say we can't continue on this path and we have \nto change? Why won't he say we need to tighten our belt across the \ngovernment? This is one of the problems we have at the end of this \nyear.\n  I wanted to say to my friends who may have seen this differently that \nthose people who voted a few minutes ago to uphold the budget, not to \nwaive the Budget Act but to stay with the budget agreement we signed, I \nbelieve were doing what they truly felt was in the best interest of \nAmerica. I don't think they should be in any way accused of being hard-\nhearted. It is time for us to at least agree to stand by the numbers we \nhave agreed to.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about \ntwo of my amendments to the Defense authorization bill. I will maybe at \na later point speak on some of the other amendments I had filed, but I \nam not going to offer the amendments at this time.\n  I first rise to speak on the Udall-Corker amendment No. 3049. Last \nyear I introduced S. 1798, the Open Burn Pits Registry Act with Senator \nCorker. We have met with veterans and Active-duty members of the \nmilitary and they have told us how important it is that we act now on \nthis issue. The Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee agrees and has \npassed the legislation after holding hearings.\n  This week, Senator Corker and I submitted amendment No. 3049 to the \nDefense authorization bill because our veterans and Active-duty members \nsuffering from exposure to burn pits should not have to wait any \nlonger.\n  I began this work because of servicemembers such as MSgt Jesse Baca, \na member of the New Mexico Air National Guard, and his wife Maria. \nMaster Sergeant Baca was stationed in Balad, Iraq, and exposed to burn \npits. Because of the burn pits he has battled cancer, chronic \nbronchialitis, chemical-induced asthma, brain lesions, TBI, PTSD, and \nnumerous other ailments. He knows firsthand the suffering caused by \nburn pits and the need for answers.\n  In both Afghanistan and Iraq, open air burn pits were widely used at \nforward operating bases. Disposing of trash and other debris was a \nmajor challenge. Commanders had to find a way to dispose of the waste \nwhile concentrating on the important mission at hand. The solution that \nwas chosen, however, had serious risks. Pits of waste were set on fire, \nsometimes using jet fuel for ignition.\n  For example, the air samples at Joint Base Balad turned up some nasty \nstuff: particulate matter, chemicals that form from the incomplete \nburning of coal, oil, and gas, garbage, or other organic substances, \nalso volatile organic compounds such as acetone and benzene--benzene is \nknown to cause leukemia--and dioxins associated with Agent Orange.\n  A scientific study by the American Lung Association found the \nfollowing:\n\n       Emissions from burning waste contain fine particulate \n     matter, sulfur dioxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic \n     compounds and various irritant gases such as nitrogen oxides \n     that can scar the lungs.\n\n  All of this was in the air and our veterans have begun to raise the \nalarm.\n  We are forever in debt for their service so we must ask the question: \nHow did these burn pits impact the health of our returning heroes? This \namendment is a step toward finding the answers we owe them.\n  This amendment is supported by numerous groups, including Burn Pits \n360, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Association of the U.S. Navy, \nRetired Enlisted Association, Uniformed Services Disabled Retirees, and \nthe National Military Family Association.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this amendment so that Master Sergeant \nBaca and his fellow servicemembers and veterans can begin to heal.\n  Now I want to speak about a second amendment. This is an amendment \nthat deals with the issue of buying American solar. This amendment is \nUdall No. 3150, sponsored by Senators Schumer, Bingaman, and Wyden.\n  Solar power increases energy security for American military \ninstallations, but we should be using Buy American- compliant solar \npanels. The Department of Defense is a leader on utilizing solar power, \nnot for environmental reasons but for energy security reasons. When we \nuse taxpayer funds to support military solar power, we need a level \nplaying field for U.S. solar manufacturers in the contracting process. \nToday we have U.S. military bases with Chinese solar that violates the \ntrade laws, but there is no U.S. solar on Chinese military bases.\n  The 2011 Defense authorization bill took an important step to clarify \nDOD's Buy American Act requirements, making sure they apply to solar. \nMy amendment is needed to close existing loopholes in the 2011 Buy \nAmerican solar requirements. It would ensure Buy American standards \napply to solar on DOD property that is used to meet DOD energy goals.\n  This amendment is nearly identical to the one passed on voice vote \nlast year but dropped in conference with the House. The change from \nlast year's amendment is a 1-year term so we can test this provision. \nCBO estimated the cost of this amendment as insignificant, so we know \nthis amendment does not raise costs. The difference in price is very \nsmall. Chinese solar now has significant tariffs. Nations that are in \nthe WTO are not discriminated against. Buy American does not bar \nnations that allow reciprocal access to U.S. firms. Existing \nexemptions, such as availability and cost, still apply. We do not \nexpect this to harm DOD's procurement in any way.\n\n[[Page S7288]]\n\n  I would once again urge the Senate, when we have the opportunity, to \nadopt this amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to call up a list of \nnine amendments which have been cleared by Senator McCain and myself. \nWe expect that there will be, in perhaps an hour or so, an additional \nlist of perhaps 15 or 20 cleared amendments. Shortly thereafter it \nwould be our expectation to propound a unanimous consent proposal with \na finite list of amendments that would be considered before final \npassage.\n  At the time we do that, we would give our colleagues perhaps 20 \nminutes after we read that proposed unanimous consent agreement to come \nto the floor, if they choose, and talk to us about it or, if they so \nchoose, to object.\n  We hope that will not happen, obviously.

We hope our colleagues will take advantage of that \nopportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues and staffs who are \nobserving our deliberations would think seriously about their \namendments and how they can be consolidated, whether they really need \nto be considered. We are working through large numbers of amendments. \nWe will probably be revealing a finite list, and we hope we can satisfy \nall Members' concerns.\n  I yield.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nto offer a tribute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring Michael Schwartz\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to honor a member \nof my staff who is not retiring but as a result of his ailment can no \nlonger come to work on the Hill. This gentleman's name is Michael \nSchwartz. He has been my chief of staff for almost 15 years, beginning \nwhile I was in the House and here in the Senate as well.\n  A lot of people on the Hill know Michael. What they know is that he \nis one of the kindest, gentlest people anyone has ever met. He has been \na light focused on how we do things to honor other people.\n  Michael has been the kind of person who has always focused on others, \nespecially those in need. He is the kind of person who doesn't pass up \nthe homeless we all see around the Capitol but stops and tries to \nsatisfy their need. He offers them money and food, but he also offers \nthem friendship and his time. He offers them the love and dignity that \ncomes from being reminded that we are all children of the Creator.\n  Mike has also been an unapologetic defender of the family and of \nthose who cannot defend themselves, whether that be the disability \ncommunity, the unborn, the infirm, or the elderly. He has reminded me \nand my staff and all of us that a society is truly measured in how it \ntreats and cares for those less fortunate.\n  Mike is also a voracious reader and gifted leader. In a city where \npeople stop learning when they gain power, Mike has shown that the \ncloser one gets to power, the more one needs to humble oneself and \nlearn new things. He has been mentoring staff and others for years on \nthe Hill in both reading groups and Bible studies, where he has shared \nhis wisdom, his faith, and his heart.\n  As many in the Senate know, Mike has ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease. For \nweeks, he has been battling--actually months--to continue to fulfill \nhis responsibilities here when most of us would have said: It is too \ndifficult, I can't do it. He has overcome challenges that most of us \ncan scarcely imagine. He has done so with grace, humility, and an \nunbelievable level of courage. Through all this, we have watched him \ninspire everybody on my team with both his spirit and his tenacity.\n  In these difficult circumstances, Mike has been an extraordinary \nservant and faithful leader. He is still the guy who cares more about \nother people than himself. The kindness he has shown to everyone he has \nencountered, whether to a homeless person on the street or a leading \nSenator in the halls, he has reminded our team and me that we are all \nequal regardless of position in the eyes of God.\n  Let me close with a passage from 2 Corinthians that reminds me so \nvery much of Mike.\n\n       It is written: ``I believed; therefore I have spoken.'' \n     Since we have that same spirit of faith, we also believe and \n     therefore speak because we know that the one who raised the \n     Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and \n     present us with you to himself. All this is for your benefit, \n     so that the grace that is reaching more and more people--\n\n  That wonderful word ``grace,'' too often a shortage in Washington, \nthat Mike so well displays--\n\n     may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God. \n     Therefore, we do not lose heart.\n\n  Mike, don't lose heart.\n\n       Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are \n     being renewed day by day. For our light and momentary \n     troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far \n     outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, \n     but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but \n     what is unseen is eternal.\n\n  In a place preoccupied by titles and position and power, Mike has \nshown everyone by his life and his deeds and his words that things that \nare unseen are the things that matter. He has shown us what it means to \nrun the race and finish it strongly. Well done, good and faithful \nservant.\n  My hope is that God will bless Mike and Roseanne, their children and \ngrandchildren, as he closes this chapter of his life on the Hill. He \nwill still be doing projects for us because his intellect, his insight, \nand his knowledge are what we cannot bear to do without. So it has been \nmy privilege over the last 15 years to be modeled and mentored by my \nchief of staff.\n  Mike, we love you. God bless you.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the bill we have before us, the Defense \nauthorization bill, we all recognize as a pretty special bill. Every \nyear for the past 51 years Congress has sent to the President a Defense \nauthorization bill which has been bipartisan in nature. Based upon the \nprogress we have seen in this Chamber for these past several days, it \nappears this year will not be an exception.\n  I deeply appreciate the strong leadership of our colleagues, the \nSenator from Michigan and the Senator from Arizona, in managing this \nbill. They have put in countless hours and have worked to wade through \nnearly 400 amendments that Members have filed with respect to this \nbill. Not only the chairman and ranking member and their leadership, \nbut their staffs have worked incredibly hard. So I am pleased with \nwhere we are.\n  I think the Chair probably knows I am one of those Members who \ndoesn't have a tendency to pile on or add multiple amendments to this \nmeasure or to many measures, but on this bill I have broken with that \npractice by filing 10 amendments. Six of these amendments relate to \nfrustrations I have experienced in responding to force structure \nchanges that were announced by the Air Force this last February. I \nthink we recognize that force structure changes can be a euphemism for \nrealignments, and realignments are usually reserved for a BRAC round. \nBut faced with the need to meet rigid fiscal year 2013 budget \nobjectives, the Air Force didn't wait for a BRAC round and, instead, \nproposed a series of backdoor BRACs.\n  Most of these changes affected the Air National Guard and the Air \nForce Reserves. One of these changes would substantially realign and \nstop one step short of closing an Active-Duty air base, and I am \nreferring to Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks, AK.\n  Last February, the Air Force informed the Alaska congressional \ndelegation that it intended to make what\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\nthey call a ``warm'' base out of Eielson and reduce its current \npopulation of about 3,000 airmen by half. The reduction would most \nprofoundly affect the Active-Duty population, which would be reduced by \nabout two-thirds. It would have led to the laying off of hundreds of \ncivilian and contractor personnel.\n  In the words of one prominent Fairbanks community leader:\n\n       It's the Air Force's intention to change Eielson from a \n     base that is mission capable to a base that is mission \n     incapable.\n\n  The Air Force somehow concluded it could pull off a move of this \nmagnitude without ever having to face the BRAC Commission or answer to \nCongress. That takes a little bit of chutzpah. The Air Force knew this \nwas not going to sit well with the community. They promptly dispatched \nthen-Chief of Staff GEN Norton Schwartz to Alaska for a meeting with \ncommunity leaders. I appreciate his presence, and I was there when he \nspoke to those leaders. But his message didn't leave much room for \noptimism.\n  The Air Force official pretty much insisted this was a happening \nthing; that resistance was going to be futile. I have to admit it came \nas something as a surprise to me that the Air Force would select \nEielson as the only Active-Duty base slated for a backdoor BRAC. For \nthose who are not familiar with Eielson's strategic position, it sits \nat the gateway to the Pacific Area of Responsibility, the most \nstrategically important Area of Responsibility, according to this \nadministration's defense planner. It also sits at the front door of the \nJoint Pacific Alaska Range Complex, which the Air Force regards as its \ntop unencroached training facility with tremendous future upside \npotential. But for some reason this is the Active-Duty base that the \nAir Force chose to essentially throw under the bus.\n  Unfortunately, this isn't the first time. Back in 2005, the Air Force \nproposed to warm base Eielson. The BRAC Commission rejected that \nproposal. They, instead, suggested the Air Force should place an F-16 \nAggressor Squadron at Eielson to take advantage of its proximity to the \nJoint Pacific Alaska Range Complex. That Aggressor Squadron supports \ncutting edge exercises, such as Red Flag Alaska and Northern Edge--\nsuperior, phenomenal training exercises. Under the Air Force 2012 \nproposal, that squadron would now base at Joint Base Elmendorf \nRichardson, and they would essentially commute to future exercises \nlaunched out of Eielson Air Force Base.\n  So, Mr. President, I am left to conclude that perhaps there is \nsomebody in the Air Force who, for whatever reason, doesn't like \nEielson. I reach this conclusion with some hesitation and reluctance, \nbut when I see the Air Force prepared to sacrifice a base with one of \nthe longest runways in North America--it is a 14,531-foot runway, which \nI think the Chair can appreciate--it is significant. There are no \nencroachments, it has geographic superiority with respect to missions \nin the Pacific and, really, across the globe. So it really does cause \nme to wonder.\n  Since February, Senator Begich and I and our staffs have been in \ntouch with the Air Force on an almost daily basis trying to understand \nthe thinking of the Air Force. And it has been a moving target. It has \nbeen tough to pin down.\n  First, they claimed it would save money in 2013, and then they \nadmitted that, well, a move would cost unbudgeted money in 2013. They \nnext claimed the move could be accomplished without any NEPA review. \nThen they admitted that maybe an Environmental Impact Statement is \ngoing to be required. They concluded the move could be executable in \n2013 because there was sufficient housing that was proximate to JBER, \nbut then they came back and admitted their housing availability data \nhad come primarily off of Craig's list.\n  Later, there was a more disciplined study conducted that demonstrated \nif the move were to be executed in 2013 there was not going to be \nhousing that was sufficient and proximate to JBER in order to relocate \nthe airmen, and there probably wouldn't be sufficient classroom seats \nfor the military families either.\n  A whole series of issues have cropped up because they weren't \nthoroughly reviewed prior to the decision being made. So the Air Force \nhas now conceded that its plans are not executable in fiscal year 2013. \nThat is a wise decision, but it kind of begs the question: So what \nabout the future?\n  The Air Force may deny, but I think reasonable minds could conclude, \nthe Eielson plan is still moving full steam ahead. Let me offer the \nfollowing in evidence of that. The Senate Appropriations Committee has \ndirected the Air Force to spend no fiscal year 2013 money to implement \nthe force structure change until the Commission on the Future Structure \nof the Air Force reports. I think that is a good thing, and I intend to \nargue Eielson's case before that Commission. But I would note that S. \n3254 requires the Commission, which is only going to be created once \nthe Defense authorization bill is signed into law, to report by March \n31, 2013--essentially, a 3-month period. That is absolutely not \nadequate time for the rigorous analysis that is required. I have \nsubmitted an amendment this week, amendment 3135, which gives the \ncommission an additional year to complete its work.\n  Now, notwithstanding this direction to stop, the Air Force has \nannounced its plans to begin an Environmental Impact Statement on the \nEielson downsizing. They have announced this will commence January 2013 \nusing fiscal year 2012 money. I do agree an EIS is a legally required \ncondition precedent to implementing the Air Force's structure changes \nat Eielson, and that if the Air Force ultimately intends to downsize \nEielson and add airplanes and people to JBER, it will have to complete \nthe NEPA. Moreover, an EIS process will offer the Alaska community an \nopportunity to weigh in and to vent their frustrations and concerns \nwith the Air Force, which is appropriate. But one has to wonder after \nreading the Senate version of the Defense appropriations bill, what \npart of ``stop'' is the Air Force not understanding.\n  I actually put this question to them in writing in September. I still \nhave not received a satisfactory answer. Several of the amendments I \nhave introduced would bring this concept of ``stop'' into the Defense \nauthorization bill, but there may be an alternative to offering them--a \nsolution that I think could be a win for all.\n  It strikes me that an EIS is not going to address two questions I \nthink are critical and I think should be answered before the EIS \nprocess begins. The first is whether it makes any sense at all to throw \nEielson under the bus given its considerable strategic upside \npotential. And the second is whether the Air Force will truly achieve \nany cost savings by walking away from Eielson or simply transfer costs \nsomeplace else.\n  In addition, an EIS will not answer the question whether it makes \nsense for the Air Force to abandon a community that supports our airmen \nlike no other community in the country. This is a community that loves \nto fly. You have people who have float planes and small aircraft and \nbush planes. Everybody is a pilot there. They love to fly. This \ncommunity is more than willing to accommodate the Air Force's desire to \nconduct summer exercises at the expense of precious general aviation \nairspace, provided that the Air Force remains a good corporate citizen \nin the community.\n  My amendment No. 3156 is a good-faith effort to find that common \nground with the Air Force. It requires the Air Force submit a report to \nthe defense communities evaluating the upside potential of Eielson Air \nForce Base before it acts to tear down that base or relocate its \nassets.\n  I wish to take a minute here to speak to some of that upside \npotential, because I think it is considerable.\n  It is a well-known fact in interior Alaska that the Air Force \npublicly announced scoping on an EIS for F-35 basing at Eielson back in \n2008. So in 2008 they are talking about bringing in the F-35s. Then in \n2009, they walked away from that announcement but suggested that \nEielson would be a desirable OCONUS basing location for the F-35. I \nmight suggest that this abrupt downsizing that is being considered now \nof Eielson is inconsistent with that possible future use.\n  The 168th Air Refueling Wing of the Alaska National Guard fuels the \nNorth Pacific on a daily basis, every single day of the year. There has \nbeen some\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\ndiscussion about adding an active association and increasing the tanker \npresence proportionate to demand. But downsizing Eielson could \nundermine the efficiency of that operation.\n  I mentioned earlier the unencumbered airspace that Eielson has. This \nunencumbered airspace might make a perfect place for remote piloted \nvehicle testing. This is a mission that Senator Begich has been \nactively promoting for the past several years. So let's come to a \nconclusion about whether this is a viable possibility.\n  As the Pacific AOR becomes more important, Eielson might once again \nhave the potential as a combat-coded fighter base given its proximity \nto the world's hotspots. But let's not also forget that Eielson is the \nair base closest to the Arctic and may certainly have new \nresponsibilities in that rapidly changing part of the globe. That is \none of the reasons why the Department of Homeland Security needs to be \npart of this ongoing conversation.\n  So before the Air Force moves to potentially throw away all of this \nand potentially demolish perfectly good facilities that might support \nfuture missions, I think it needs to take a good hard look at the \nupside of Eielson--not just merely recite the same old lines that, \nquite honestly, failed back in 2005. That goes to the substance of the \nEielson decision.\n  I wish to spend a moment here to speak of the frustrations that I \nhave had about process as we have gone through this since February. \nCongress has created a process to ensure that realignments that occur \noutside of BRAC rounds are vetted by the congressional defense \ncommittees. But like many laws, the Pentagon has been kind of looking \naround for loopholes and the Air Force has been pretty adept at \nidentifying them--even if they might not actually be there. But there \nare some worthy amendments I have submitted that would close the \nloopholes. These are contained in 10 USC 993 and 10 USC 2687, and I \nhope they will be considered.\n  One of the more substantial loopholes that is contained in 10 USC \n2687 would seem to allow the Defense Department to characterize a \nsubstantial reduction in civilian personnel as a reduction in force \nrather than a realignment. That loophole, if it does exist, needs to be \nclosed.\n  Let me also note the difficulties we have had in obtaining \ninformation from the Air Force over the past several months. Just \nasking for specific information has been a struggle these past several \nmonths. Ask the Air Force a question, and you tend to get a heavily \nvetted and not terribly specific answer. Ask for documents explaining \nthe deliberative process of the Air Force, and maybe you get one \ndocument months after you have asked for it. And, again, the document \ndoesn't explain very much.\n  Perhaps it is time for personal offices to be able to use the Freedom \nof Information Act--the FOIA process--to get the documents they need in \na timely fashion, as journalists do. My amendment No. 3143 would \nprovide for an expedited review of FOIA requests pertaining to its \nactivities in a Member's home State, with no fees charged for \nprocessing that request. I think it would perhaps level the playing \nfield between the committees that can subpoena documents and personal \noffices that have a more limited option to obtain the documents they \nneed.\n  I think it is a positive contribution to oversight and I hope others \nhere in the Chamber will feel likewise. I will not be offering that \namendment up at this point in time in the hopes that the Air Force is \nclear on my message, that I wish to find a way we can work more \ncooperatively with this information exchange and that there can be \ngreater accommodation with the congressional request. I know that \nGeneral Welsh, as the new Chief of Staff, intends to improve the Air \nForce relationships with the Congress. I have had a very positive \nconversation with him about that. I want to give him an opportunity to \ndo so. I look forward to working with him on these issues and some of \nthe others I have had an opportunity to raise with him.\n  I wish to conclude my remarks by again thanking the chairman and \nranking member and all of the staffs for their yeomen's efforts on the \nbill, and I look forward to supporting final passage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have been working very hard to come up \nwith what we call a finite list of amendments that would be the only \nremaining first-degree amendments that would be in order to the bill. \nWe are working, obviously, on many other amendments to get them \ncleared, but this would be the list of the maximum number of first-\ndegree amendments that would be in order.\n  Twenty minutes from now, I will be asking unanimous consent, as we \npromised, that these amendments be the only remaining first-degree \namendments to the bill. We promised everybody they would have that \nopportunity, because it is a long list, and we want to keep that \npromise. But during that 20 minutes, we can reassure folks that if they \nhave a problem, things are the way we said they would be: Bingaman \n2984; Brown of Ohio 3216; Kerry and Brown of Massachusetts 3034; Kohl \n2887; Lieberman 3167; Lieberman 3276; Mikulski 3217; Nelson of Nebraska \n3274, Pryor 2946; Reed of Rhode Island 3014; Reed of Rhode Island 3255; \nReid of Nevada 3244; Reid of Nevada 3047; Tester 3028--that is not the \nsportsmen's amendment, by the way. There was an objection to it and \nSenator Tester was willing to not have that on the list--Udall of New \nMexico 3049; Udall of New Mexico 3150; Akaka 3204; Begich 3194; Bennet \n3226; Bingaman 3208; Boxer 3265; Brown of Ohio 3113; Carper 3241; Casey \n2997; Conrad 3227; Coons 3289; Hagan 3056; Harkin 3147; Johnson of \nSouth Dakota 3100; Kohl 2887; Lautenberg 3288; Levin 3164; Levin 3280; \nLevin 3284; Nelson of Florida 3267; Reed of Rhode Island 3165; Reed of \nRhode Island 3255; Rockefeller 2996; Warner 3145; Warner 3188; Webb \n2943; Webb 2957, Whitehouse 3181; Wyden 2959; Alexander 3258; Ayotte \n3003; Ayotte 3004; Ayotte 3080; Barrasso 3081; Barrasso 3082; Barrasso \n3198; Blunt 3728; Boozman 3221; Brown of Massachusetts 3160; Brown of \nMassachusetts 3270; Burr 3219; Coats 2923; Collins 3042; Collins 3196; \nCollins 3259; Collins 3282; Corker 3172; DeMint 3134; Graham 3203; \nGrassley 2990; Grassley 3079; Hatch 3268; Hutchison 3078; Inhofe 2978; \nKyl 2927; Kyl 3033; Kyl 3239; Lee 3185; McCain 3054; McCain 3091; \nMcCain 3247; McCain 3262; McCain 3281; Moran 3285; Murkowski 3135; \nMurkowski 3136; Murkowski 3156; Murkowski 3197; Paul 3118; Paul 3119; \nPortman 3142; Risch, 3093; Risch 3094; Roberts 3032; Rubio 3175; Rubio \n3176; Sessions 3007; Sessions 3008; Sessions 3013; Shelby 3070; Snowe \n3218; Thune 3210; Thune 3277; Toomey 3060; Toomey 3065, with a \nmodification; Toomey 3066; Vitter 3087; Wicker 3000; and Wicker 3002.\n  Again, the UC will be offered at a quarter to 4. If anyone has \nquestions, please call our staff through the cloakroom. We have done a \nhuge amount of work to get to this point. I emphasize again that many \nof our colleagues are understanding that we are working through \nadditional amendments that are not on this list, and we would hope they \nwould continue to cooperate with us in that regard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I say we now have, believe it or \nnot, a pretty manageable list. We have been working for 3 days on \namendments, on compiling amendments, on disposing of amendments, \nvarious managers' packages, and we will have an additional managers' \npackage or two today.\n  I ask our colleagues to cooperate in the next 20 minutes and have \ntheir staffs--and themselves if they are in their offices--examine this \nlist, which is available, and make sure it is agreeable to them so we \ncan lock this down and then move forward to having voice votes, \nmanagers' packages, and, where required, rollcall votes. We will not \ndeny any Senator this right, starting on Monday night. We look forward \nto having agreement from everybody. I believe we can, beginning on \nMonday, get this legislation done.\n  I would also like to say that I appreciate the patience of the \nmajority leader, who has a large calendar. We appreciate his patience \non this issue.\n  Finally, I would say again that I think we are showing and can show\n\n[[Page S7293]]\n\nMonday night that this body is capable of taking up a piece of \nlegislation without a cloture vote, without filling up the tree, \nwithout all the other parliamentary maneuvers and objections, and come \nforth with a piece of legislation that I think all of us can be proud \nof but, more importantly, that is of significant importance to the men \nand women who are serving in the military and our ability to protect \nthis Nation.\n  I thank the chairman again for his unstinting effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I extend our thanks to our colleagues and \ntheir staffs who are working with us to keep this manageable. It is \nmanageable. I know it sounds overwhelming and it is daunting, but it is \nmanageable, providing understanding is there for this process and what \nwe are doing. I thank the staff who are working so hard. I thank the \nPresiding Officer, who I know is changing his schedule this afternoon \nso he can continue to preside.\n  At quarter-to--when I added up the minutes, at quarter-to, I will put \nthis unanimous consent request. I again emphasize that we are also \nworking on many amendments that are not on this list, and we are still \ntrying to clear them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are going to withhold the unanimous \nconsent agreement at this time. There have been a number of questions \nraised about it. The time is being well spent actually. Those questions \nneed to be asked, but there are enough of them so that we will pick \nthat up on Monday. But we are making good progress. We are going to \nhave another 17 cleared amendments that will be coming up, we hope, in \nthe next 5 or 10 minutes.\n  We have already disposed of 77 amendments. I think we have done it in \na way which will make this body proud that we are legislating. If \npeople want to filibuster, threaten to filibuster or debate something, \nwe are going to say: Come over and debate--which we have. So we have \navoided these long periods of space. We have had no threat of a \nfilibuster that has required a threshold of 60. We have had majority \nvotes, and not the 60-threshold votes except for that one technical \nbudget amendment issue.\n  We are making great progress. I believe we will continue to make \nprogress. The leader, in a moment, I believe, is going to a file \ncloture motion which is going to help with progress. But between now \nand the time we vote on cloture, both this afternoon and on Monday, we \nare going to continue to work on amendments to try to clear amendments.\n  I am sure we will voice-vote amendments in the cases that they have \nbeen cleared and do not require a voice vote. The leader will, in a \nmoment, again, state what his plans are. But for the time being, I want \nto thank our leader for the support he has given to the managers. It is \nessential. We have had that support. We are grateful for it, and to all \nof our colleagues and staffs working on this bill, which is always \ncomplex and always has literally hundreds of amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. The work done has been exemplary by the two managers. I \nappreciate it very much. We have disposed of 75 amendments. We have \nanother batch we are going to approve very quickly. We have had \nrollcall votes. There has been significant progress made. We are not \ngoing to be able to lock in a finite list of amendments. That is always \nhard to do. But I am confident we are going to be able to get this \ndone.\n  Senators McCain and Levin and their staffs will be available over the \nweekend, and staff will be available more than the two Senators, who \nhave spent many hours on the Senate floor. We need to make sure people \nwho have problems with the proposal made by the two managers, that they \nlet them know because we need to lock this in as quickly as possible.\n  I am going to file cloture in just a minute. I encourage people to \nwork with the managers. We are going to go out. Senators Levin and \nMcCain are going to clear a few amendments, and then we are going to go \nout for the weekend. This has been a very productive week.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a cloture motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on S. 3254, a bill \n     to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2013 for military \n     activities of the Department of Defense, for military \n     construction, and for defense activities of the Department of \n     Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such \n     fiscal year, and for other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Carl Levin, Kay R.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent under rule XXII that \nthe mandatory quorum be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Levin will announce to the Senate at a later time--\nbut just to give an idea of what to expect--there will be a Maryland \njudge's vote on Monday evening. Then that will be followed by a cloture \nvote on the matter that I just sent the motion on to the desk.\n  We would hope that there will be the ability at that time--while the \n30 hours are running--to clear a bunch of amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/30/senate-section/article/S7293-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the National Defense Authorization Act, \nNDAA, that was enacted into law last December contained several deeply \ntroubling provisions related to the indefinite detention of individuals \nwithout charge or trial. These provisions undermine our Nation's \nfundamental principles of due process and civil liberties. I strongly \nopposed these provisions during last year's debate, and believe that we \nmust eliminate and fix those flawed provisions. Toward that end, I \nvoted last night in favor of the amendment offered by Senator \nFeinstein, which clarified that our Government cannot detain \nindefinitely any citizen or legal permanent resident apprehended in the \nUnited States. It is my hope that this is a positive step forward in \nour efforts to undo some of the damage from last year's NDAA.\n  But our work is not done. As I have stated before, I believe that the \nvital protections of our Constitution extend to all persons here in the \nUnited States, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. That is \nwhy I cosponsored an amendment filed by Senator Mark Udall that would \ngo beyond the scope of the Feinstein amendment to extend the protection \nagainst indefinite detention to any person within the United States. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Udall and others in our continuing \nefforts to improve the law in this area.\n  I am fundamentally opposed to indefinite detention without charge or \ntrial. I fought against the Bush administration policies that led to \nthe current situation, with indefinite detention as the de facto \npolicy. I opposed President Obama's executive order in March 2011 that \ncontemplated indefinite detention, and I helped lead the efforts \nagainst the detention-related provisions in last year's NDAA. Simply \nput, a policy of indefinite detention has no place in the justice \nsystem of any democracy let alone the greatest democracy in the world.\n  The American justice system is the envy of the world, and a regime of \nindefinite detention diminishes the credibility of this great Nation \naround the globe, particularly when we criticize other governments for \nengaging in such conduct, and as new governments in the midst of \nestablishing legal systems look to us as a model of justice. Indefinite \ndetention contradicts the most basic principles of law that I have \npledged to uphold since my years as a prosecutor and in our senatorial \noath to defend the Constitution. That is why I have opposed and will \ncontinue to oppose indefinite detention.\n  Last December, Senator Feinstein introduced the Due Process Guarantee \nAct, which was at the core of her amendment to this year's NDAA. Both \nthe Due Process Guarantee Act and Senator Feinstein's amendment make \nclear that neither an authorization to use military force nor a \ndeclaration of war confer unfettered authority to the executive branch \nto hold Americans in indefinite detention. In February, I chaired a \nhearing to examine the Due Process Guarantee Act, and the Judiciary \nCommittee heard testimony from witnesses who asserted that no \nindividual arrested within the United States should be detained \nindefinitely regardless of citizenship or immigration status. I \nwholeheartedly agree, and I believe that the Constitution requires no \nless.\n  The notion of indefinitely imprisoning American citizens is the most \nstriking, but to me the Constitution creates a framework that imposes \nimportant legal limits on the Government and provides that all people \nin the U.S. have fundamental liberty protections. That is why I have \ncosponsored Senator Udall's amendment, which provides expansive \nprotections against indefinite detention and fixes this unwise policy \nfor all people. As I said before, though, I view the adoption of \nSenator Feinstein's amendment as a positive first step towards this \ngoal.\n  During last night's Senate floor debate on Senator Feinstein's \namendment, however, some made fundamentally flawed legal arguments and \ninterpretations. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I feel \nit is important to set the record straight.\n  According to those who had opposed our efforts and support indefinite \ndetention, Senator Feinstein's amendment should somehow be read as \nauthorizing the indefinite detention of United States citizens captured \non U.S. soil. They contended that the Supreme Court in Hamdi v. \nRumsfeld held that the Authorization for the Use of Military Force \n(AUMF) expressly authorized the indefinite detention of citizens, \nregardless of where they were apprehended. This assertion is flatly \nwrong, entirely unsupported by the actual text of the opinion and, I \nbelieve, contrary to the Constitution.\n  Much of last night's debate centered on the language in Senator \nFeinstein's amendment that prohibited the ``detention without charge or \ntrial of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States \napprehended in the United States, unless an act of Congress expressly \nauthorizes such detention.'' Senators who had opposed our remedial \nefforts and support indefinite detention asserted that the Supreme \nCourt in Hamdi concluded that the AUMF was an ``explicit \nauthorization'' of such detention even for citizens captured in the \nU.S. and that the AUMF was an act of Congress that fulfills the \nexception in the Feinstein amendment. The Senators ignore the fact that \nthe text of the AUMF contains no reference whatsoever to the detention \nof individuals without charge or trial, and certainly no express \nreference to or authority for the detention of citizens in such a \nmanner. Moreover, nowhere in the plurality or dissenting opinions in \nHamdi do any of the Justices state that the AUMF expressly authorizes \nthe detention of citizens without charge or trial.\n  The preexistence of the AUMF does not fulfill the requirement that \nthe amendment seeks to create and that requires express congressional \nauthorization of exceptional authority after the adoption of the \nFeinstein amendment. Senator Feinstein did not intend to write and the \nSenate did not intend to pass a nullity. If this opposition argument \nwere right, the amendment changed nothing.\n  Senator Levin acknowledged in his remarks last night that the \n``Supreme Court in Hamdi held that the existing authorization for use \nof military force does address this issue and does explicitly, in their \nwords, authorize detention of United States citizens in that situation \nwhich was on the battlefield in Afghanistan.'' (emphasis added) The \nHamdi case did not address and did not expressly authorize the \nindefinite detention of U.S. citizens apprehended in the U.S. As \nSenator Feinstein and Senator Durbin have pointed out, the Hamdi ruling \nwas limited to ``individuals who fought against the United States in \nAfghanistan as part of the Taliban.''\n  The substance of the Supreme Court's legal analysis is important \nhere, and the attempts to gloss over the actual text of the Hamdi \nopinion cannot go unchecked. The starting point of the Court's analysis \nin this regard was the text of the Non-Detention Act, codified at 18 \nU.S.C. Section 4001(a), which states that ``no citizen shall be \nimprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant \nto an Act of Congress.'' The Hamdi court then turned to whether the \nAUMF constituted an act of Congress within the scope of this exception, \nsuch that Hamdi's detention would be authorized. In her plurality \nopinion, Justice O'Connor concluded that the answer was yes, but she \nmade certain to circumscribe carefully the scope of that ruling by \nsaying ``we conclude that the AUMF is explicit congressional \nauthorization for the detention of individuals in the narrow category \nwe describe,'' i.e. ``individuals who fought against the United States \nin Afghanistan as part of the Taliban.'' Stated simply, the Hamdi \ndecision does not stand for the proposition that the AUMF expressly \nauthorizes the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens captured on U.S. \nsoil.\n  Although last night's debate on the Hamdi decision focused largely on \nthe\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\nstatutory authority to detain individuals, we must also not lose sight \nof other aspects of that opinion regarding the nature and duration of \nlaw of war detention, and how changing circumstances might warrant re-\nexamination of the authority for such detention. Last night, Senator \nGraham stated that Hamdi's imprisonment ``could last for the rest of \nhis life because the law of war detention can last for the duration of \nthe relevant conflict.'' Although I do not necessarily disagree that \nlaw of war detention has historically been viewed as appropriate for \nthe duration of the relevant conflict, this statement begs the question \nof when and how the duration of the relevant conflict is determined.\n  In her opinion in Hamdi, Justice O'Connor stated that the AUMF \njustified detention as part of the exercise of necessary and \nappropriate force ``if the record establishes that United States troops \nare still involved in active combat in Afghanistan'' against Taliban \ncombatants. Significantly, Justice O'Connor wrote that ``if the \npractical circumstances of a given conflict are entirely unlike those \nof the conflicts that informed the development of the law of war, that \nunderstanding may unravel.'' Accordingly, as we wind down our combat \noperations in Afghanistan, Congress and the courts should consider \ncarefully how those changing circumstances might affect the legitimacy \nof so-called law of war detention authority under the AUMF.\n  I also continue to be deeply disturbed by the mandatory military \ndetention provisions that were included in last year's NDAA through \nSection 1022. In the fight against al Qaeda and other terrorist \nthreats, we should give our intelligence, military, and law enforcement \nprofessionals all the tools they need not limit those tools, as was \nrequired by this law. That is why the Secretary of Defense, Attorney \nGeneral, Director of the FBI, and Director of National Intelligence all \nobjected to this section and it was modified to require the President \nto produce procedures to determine who meets the definition of a person \nsubject to mandatory military detention. I appreciate that the \nPresident took an aggressive approach in these procedures to preserve \nthe flexibility of law enforcement, as well as military and \nintelligence professionals, to investigate and prosecute alleged \nterrorists.\n  However, these procedures do not mitigate my concerns that the \nmandatory military detention requirements are overly broad and threaten \ncore constitutional principles. Once sacrificed, our treasured \nconstitutional protections are not easily restored. After all, the \npolicy directive of this President can be undone by a future \nadministration. That is why I have cosponsored Senator Udall's \namendment to this year's NDAA that would repeal this ill-advised \nauthority.\n  In Hamdi, Justice O'Connor stated unequivocally that ``[w]e have long \nsince made clear that a state of war is not a blank check for the \nPresident when it comes to the rights of the Nation's citizens.'' We \ncan never forget that the power of our Federal Government is bound by \nthe Constitution. The detention provisions enacted through last year's \nNDAA are deeply troublesome. They do not represent Vermont values, they \ndo not represent American values, and they have no place in this world. \nMoving forward, I urge all Senators to join in support of upholding the \nprinciples of our Constitution, protecting American values, and \nchampioning the rule of law. We need a bipartisan effort to guarantee \nthat the United States remains the model for the rule of law to the \nworld.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss several issues of \nimportance to the future of our Nation's military. The National Defense \nAuthorization Act before us this year will affect the size and strength \nof the U.S. Armed Forces and the resources and programs available to \nour service members and their families.\n  According to GEN Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, ``capability is more important than size.'' As the size of our \nmilitary begins to decrease, there is more need than ever to ensure \nthat they have the right equipment to fulfill their missions. \nTherefore, I am pleased that the committee has given the Pentagon the \nauthority through this bill to negotiate multiyear procurements for the \nmilitary's workhorse, the CH-47 Chinook, and for the V-22 Osprey and \nthe unique capabilities it brings to the field. I also want to note my \nfrustration with the Army's lack of strategic and long-term thinking \nrelated to armored combat vehicles. The Army's desire to temporarily \ncease production of tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles without long-\nterm plans as to what will replace them is nonsense. These proposals, \nshould they be approved, jeopardize the Nation's combat vehicle \nindustrial base, our national security and the livelihoods of many \nindividuals throughout the Nation.\n  Small businesses are the backbone of the economy both in Pennsylvania \nand across the Nation. Given their importance, I am committed to \nadvocating for the needs of businesses, particularly women and minority \nbusiness enterprises, in the U.S. Senate. My amendment, No. 2986, would \nensure that subcontractors are aware of their inclusion on bids for \nFederal contracts and establish a system to report fraudulent \nprocurement practices.\n  In order to secure government contracts, big companies routinely list \nsmall businesses as subcontractors on their bids in order to strengthen \ntheir applications without the intention of actually giving the work to \nthe named subcontractor. This especially happens with women and \nminority owned businesses. Currently, there is no legal requirement to \nnotify subcontractors of their inclusion on Federal bids and no way to \nreport this. This is taking business away from hard working men and \nwomen and it is time for this fraudulent activity to end.\n  Amendment No. 2986 would prohibit prime contractors from using small \nbusinesses as straw men to win government bids. First, it would require \nthat subcontractors identified on a solicitation for a competitive \nproposal are notified by the prime contractor before the application is \nsubmitted. Second, it would establish a reporting mechanism that allows \nsubcontractors to report any fraudulent activity. This amendment is in \ndirect response to concerns raised by my constituents, Alexander \nNicholas of the Western Pennsylvania Minority Supplier Development \nCouncil, and Craig Bingham, owner of DCI Logistics in Carnegie, PA. I \nask my colleagues to join me in support for promoting transparency and \naccountability in Federal procurement processes and support amendment \nNo. 2986.\n  Another long-term objective that the Nation and our military must \nrecognize is the need for a secure and reliable source of strategic \nmaterials, such as rare earths. In filing amendment No. 2994 to the \nfiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, I want the \nDepartment of Defense to conduct a cost-benefit analysis on the \nfeasibility of recycling heavy rare earth elements from fluorescent \nlighting waste. New innovations by Pennsylvanian businesses have taken \nthe theory of recycling rare earths and made it a reality. With China \ncontrolling 95 percent of the world supply of rare earth elements, the \nUnited States must look at methods, including the recycling of \nproducts, to increase our domestic supply of rare earths.\n  Investing in alternative fuels and energy technology is also critical \nto sustaining our national defense capabilities in the 21st century. \nDOD is the largest single user of oil in the world and their fuel bill \nwas more than $17 billion in fiscal year 2011. DOD recognizes that this \ntype of expenditure, not to mention where we have to go in the world to \nget that oil, is unsustainable. That is why they began investing in \nalternative fuels and energy technology under Secretary Rumsfeld back \nin the early 2000s. I think it would be a mistake to disinvest in that \neffort now when the return on investment could be so beneficial to our \ncountry.\n  As they are currently written, sections 313 and 2823 of the NDAA put \nunnecessary restrictions on our military's ability to invest in \nalternative fuels, which could prove harmful to our national defense \ncapabilities and our economy by keeping our military dependent on \nimported fossil fuels. I think it is very important that we fix \nsections 313 and 2823 with Senator Udall's amendment 2985 and Senator \nHagan's amendment 3095, respectively.\n  Currently, DOD invests only a small portion of their budget in \nalternative fuel development but this is an important investment for \nAmerican businesses that focus on alternative fuel\n\n[[Page S7300]]\n\ndevelopment and energy technology research. Therefore, our Nation \nbenefits three times from the fruits of these investments: once by \nimproving our national defense capabilities, a second time by \nsupporting jobs in the energy research and development sector, and \nagain because these innovations can be applied in the marketplace \nbenefiting all Americans. It is a smart investment to keep our military \nstrong and develop 21st century energy solutions that we can use here \nand export abroad. Therefore, I support my colleagues' amendments to \nstrike sections 313 and 2823 from the NDAA.\n  Lastly, we must take care of the military families who continue to \nsacrifice without complaint. As chairman of the Joint Economic \nCommittee, I studied the economic effects that the military lifestyle \nhas on the earnings of military spouses. In 2010, the unemployment rate \nfor military wives was 15.0 percent compared to 7.3 percent for \ncivilian wives. One cause of this disparity may have to do with the \nnumerous relocations military families undergo. In this same time \nperiod, 24.1 percent of military wives moved across State lines, \ncompared with only 2.4 percent of civilian wives. Frequent moves \ncoupled with military spouses holding jobs that require State-level \nrelicensing create barriers that spouses must overcome when seeking \nemployment. Therefore, I introduced S. 697, the Military Spouse Job \nContinuity Act, which would provide a $500 tax credit for military \nspouses who need to renew or transfer their professional licenses or \ncertifications due to military relocations. While this specific bill \ncannot be taken up today for procedural reasons, I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in a sense-of-the-Senate amendment recognizing that we must \nwork with the Pentagon and State and local governments to reduce the \nemployment barriers for military spouses, without whom we would not \nhave the superb military we have today.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting these important \namendments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer for his \npatience and long period of time in the chair today. We, obviously, \nhave a couple of members in the media who have no other lives.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank Senator McCain. He very humorously, with his \ngreat, good nature, kind of joshes himself comparing his patience to \nmine. My standard is not the one that anybody wants to follow around \nhere; We will never get anything done.\n  He is more than patient, and I am very grateful that he is standing \nthere in that ranking position and sitting right in that ranking \nposition. I hope he stays in that ranking position in some committee at \nleast for many, many, many years--in the ranking position.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank our distinguished chairman. Obviously, you have \nbeen here a long time.\n  I also appreciate our staffs who, again, show that work-release \nprograms are quite successful in the Senate. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I join in that too.\n  Now, we have to close. I don't know if we have the closing. We do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/30/senate-section/article/S7300-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the \nlife of Senator George McGovern, a man that many in this body called a \nfriend, and an inspiration.\n  Senator McGovern was more than an elected official, although his 22-\nyear career in the Senate and House of Representatives serving the \ngreat people of South Dakota left a lasting legacy filled with numerous \naccomplishments and achievements. Senator McGovern inspired me and many \nothers into public service.\n  Like my mother, Senator McGovern was a PK, a preacher's kid, and I \nrecall from my mother's memories that this was not easy. Senator \nMcGovern often talked about growing up not only as a Methodist PK who \ncouldn't attend movies, but also as a child of the Depression, living \nin a small parsonage that shared the little they had with those in the \ncongregation who had even less.\n  His Methodist background provided the foundation for his deep sense \nof morality and social justice. It was the force that led him to be a \nlifelong advocate for feeding the hungry, for serving his country as a \nbomber pilot during World War II, and then returning home to work for \npeaceful solutions to international conflicts.\n  Each chapter of Senator McGovern's life was as riveting and \nspellbinding as the chapters of the many books he penned over the \nyears. Numerous honors were bestowed upon him, including the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom, the World Food Prize, and the Air Medal.\n  From his heroic military service where he flew 35 missions as a B-24 \nLiberator pilot and earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for making a \nhazardous emergency landing of his damaged plane and saving his crew; \nhis tenacious advocacy in fighting world hunger and working to provide \nschool meals for millions of children in dozens of countries; to his \nunwavering and passionate support of various social programs, his \nstrongly stated political views, and his wisdom on a spectrum of \ncontemporary political and world issues, Senator McGovern's life has \nhad a profound impact on our nation and world.\n  He traveled the world to advocate for better nutrition programs and \nestablish efforts to fight hunger. He was the first U.N. Global \nAmbassador on World Hunger. He was the first director of the Food for \nPeace Program under President John F. Kennedy. He developed the \n``McGovern Report'', which led to a new set of nutritional standards \nand guidelines for Americans. He joined longtime friend Senator Bob \nDole in establishing the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education \nand Child Nutrition Program that provided school meals to millions of \nchildren. He served 3 years as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations \nAgencies for Food and Agriculture.\n  Yet Senator McGovern never forgot the people of South Dakota, \nresiding many months out of the year in his hometown of Mitchell, \nlocation of the George and Eleanor McGovern Library and Museum. George \nwould often take his dog, Dakota, on daily walks on the campus of \nDakota Wesleyan University, sometimes stopping to eat at the university \ncafeteria and visit with students.\n  Senator McGovern once said that ``politics is an act of faith,'' \nmeaning that you need faith that the people can make good and moral \ndecisions. He had that faith, and his life of moral and intellectual \nleadership has made it easier for all of us to carry that faith \nforward.\n  One of the characteristics that I most admired in Senator McGovern \nwas that his belief in good and moral decisions extended to leaders in \nboth parties, and led to his lifelong friendships with statesmen like \nthe aforementioned Senator Dole, with whom he formed a deep friendship \nas they worked on hunger issues, and William Buckley, with whom he \ndelighted in debating the issues whether in public, on ``Firing Line'', \nor over a drink as they traveled together debating their opposing \nviews.\n  Senator McGovern knew and valued what so many have forgotten today; \nthat America needs a strong two-party system built on respect and \ncooperation if we are to survive as a democracy.\n  He also found time to write 14 books on political issues and \nphilosophy. And he found time to check off a few items from his \npersonal bucket list. In his late eighties, he parachuted from an \nairplane. He drove a stock car at a local speedway. Even this past \nsummer, as he was to observe his 90th birthday, he had hoped to fly a \nB-1 aircraft.\n  With all of his accomplishments, perhaps his greatest was his \nmarriage to Eleanor.

Mr. President, Monday, December 3, will mark the third \nanniversary of the imprisonment of Alan Gross by Cuba as a political \nprisoner.\n  In 2009, Mr. Gross went to Cuba on a USAID contract to assist the \nJewish community in improving access to the internet by installing \nwireless equipment. He was arrested by the Cuban government and held \nfor 14 months before being charged as a spy. After a sham trial, Mr. \nGross was sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n  Alan Gross a Maryland native, is a former social worker who spent a \nquarter of a decade working in international development--helping \npeople around the world. A graduate of the University of Maryland, Mr. \nGross has lived in Potomac, MD for many years. I've met his wife on \nnumerous occasions and her continued strength and focus inspires me. \nWhile her husband has been held in a Cuban prison, she has held down \nthe fort and held the pressure on the Cuban government for its poor \ntreatment of her husband.\n  Despite facing severe health problems and complications caused by his \nimprisonment, Alan Gross has remained strong. He has developed a daily \nroutine to maintain his strength. Yet he has lost more than 100 pounds, \nhas difficulty walking, and has a large mass behind his shoulder that \nhas gone untreated. The information shared by the Cuban government \nabout Mr. Gross's medical condition is incomplete and raises new \nconcerns for his family.\n  Mr. Gross's family has also encountered substantial health problems \nof their own over the past 3 years and they are facing significant \nfinancial hardship. His mother has inoperable lung cancer and the \nfamily is concerned they will not have a chance to be together to say \ngoodbye. The family's contact with Mr. Gross remains extremely limited.\n  I have been hopeful that America and Cuba could move closer \ntogether--in trade, in community connections, and for the individual \nfamilies that have been separated. Yet, concern over the detention of \nAlan Gross has put a hold on efforts to improve relations and the case \nshows that Cuba is not serious about moving forward and has stalled any \neffort in the Senate to move towards normalizing our relationship.\n  President Obama has stated that until Cuba's current government \nimproves human rights and freedoms, the embargo against Cuba remains in \nour Nation's national interests. What had become a yearly effort to \nmodify the embargo was halted in the Senate this year because of the \ncontinued detention of Alan Gross. The Cuban government needs to heed \nwhat it has heard from Senators and now hears from me: if you unjustly \nimprison our citizens, we cannot and will not improve the relationship \nbetween our countries.\n  In a recent letter to the Cuban government, I and several of my \nSenate colleagues called for the release of Mr. Gross on humanitarian \ngrounds. The government's response has called our request illegitimate. \nThis is not the way to move forward. That is why I will join with \nSenators Cardin and Moran to submit a resolution that will apply \nadditional pressure on Cuba to let Alan come home. I want to close by \nsending my continued thoughts and prayers to Mr. Gross, his wife Judy, \nand their family. I think of the challenges you are facing daily and I \nremain hopeful that you will all be reunited soon. Your strength and \ndetermination inspire me as you face difficult challenges.\n  I urge the government of Cuba to release Alan Gross immediately. I \npromise I will continue standing up for Alan and calling for his return \nhome to Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/30/senate-section/article/S7301-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7301-S7302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SALUTE TO ADAM MERCHANT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, so much of the news we hear today is \nriddled in tragedy, but every so often a story of joy and hope \ntranscends the negativity and warms our hearts. I would like to share \nsuch a story and salute a constituent of mine, fifteen-year-old Adam \nMerchant of Barre, VT.\n  Adam is in remission after battling Burkitt lymphoma, a cancer that \nattacks the lymphatic system. Through the kindness of the Make-A-Wish \nFoundation, Adam received his wish: to see his favorite team play, the \ndefending Super Bowl champions New York Giants. Not only did he see his \nGiants defeat the Green Bay Packers on Sunday night, but Adam also \ndelivered an impromptu, pregame motivating speech to the Giants, which \nmany of the team's players cited as an inspiration to their 38-to-10 \nvictory over the mighty Packers. Adam described the night as a \n``dream,'' but it is the rest of us who should be moved by Adam's \nbravery and persistence battling lymphoma. The Make-A-Wish Foundation \nbrightens so many young lives, and I thank them and the New York Giants \nfor helping make Adam's dream come true.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Christian Red's article in the November \n27, 2012, edition of the New York Daily News, ``Young Adam Merchant, \nteenager fight cancer, gives NY Giants inspired pep talk before rout of \nGreen Bay Packers,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the New York Daily News, Nov. 27, 2012]\n\nYoung Adam Merchant, Teenager Fighting Cancer, Gives NY Giants Inspired \n               Pep Talk Before Rout of Green Bay Packers\n\n                           (By Christian Red)\n\n       Adam Merchant says he was ``a little bit'' fatigued Monday \n     afternoon, which was understandable given the dizzying \n     schedule the 15-year-old native of tiny Barre, Vt., has kept \n     since Thursday, the best four-day stretch of his young life.\n       ``I'm feeling pretty good,'' Merchant told the Daily News \n     on Monday.\n       Merchant flew down to the New York area on Thursday, gave \n     an unrehearsed rallying speech to Giants players Friday and \n     then watched Big Blue's romp over Green Bay Sunday night. He \n     also had the luxury of roaming the home team's sideline after \n     the first quarter, and then got a choice seat next to Justin \n     Tuck after the game. Not a bad way to spend a few days in the \n     Big Apple.\n       ``That's the happiest I've seen him in a long time, Heather \n     Merchant said of her son. ``Actually, that is the happiest \n     I've ever seen him.''\n       The unique experience came together through the Make-A-Wish \n     Foundation. Adam Merchant was diagnosed with Stage 3 Burkitt \n     lymphoma, a cancer that attacks the lymphatic system, in \n     March. Although Adam's cancer is in remission after \n     chemotherapy, he had to have his gall bladder removed during \n     the course of his treatment.\n       While he was hospitalized, his mother began researching \n     Make-A-Wish, calling the Vermont chapter, which in turn \n     worked with the New York/New Jersey chapters to put together \n     Adam's dream scenario.\n       Soon a ``wish granter'' visited the Merchants with a \n     special announcement. Originally, the Merchants were supposed \n     to come to the Nov. 4 game against the Steelers, but their \n     travel plans were postponed in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.\n       Instead of watching a deflating loss to Pittsburgh, the \n     Merchants got to take in a pummeling of the powerhouse \n     Packers. ``They're definitely no slouch team,'' Adam said of \n     Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay.\n       Heather Merchant, a supervisor at Stowe ski resort, says \n     her son has always been a Giants fan, despite living in \n     Patriot country. Adam and his father, Adam Sr., a licensed \n     nurse's aide, have stood their ground in enemy territory, \n     surrounded by Tom Brady fans. Those two Super Bowl victories \n     over Brady and Co. don't hurt.\n       ``He's a walking encyclopedia, especially about football,'' \n     Heather Merchant, who has two other children, says of Adam.\n       Despite his penchant for stats and football history, \n     nothing could have prepared Adam for his big moment Friday, \n     when he was called into the Giants' huddle after practice and \n     had to make an impromptu speech.\n       He spoke barely above a whisper.\n       ``I thought about it a little bit before I spoke,'' Adam \n     said. ``It came to me that the only thing that needed to be \n     said was what I said--I told them, `Go out and play, show \n     them why we're world champs.' ''\n       ``He was getting really emotional,'' said Heather Merchant, \n     who added that her son is back in school and ``getting back \n     on track'' after his treatment.\n       Every player, from Eli Manning to Tuck to Adam's favorite, \n     Jason Pierre-Paul, spoke about how the speech inspired them \n     to get the victory. Adam, for one, thinks the team has turned \n     the corner and has another Super Bowl run in the making.\n       ``Oh, definitely. We've come through so much adversity in \n     the past that I think we can do anything,'' said Adam \n     Merchant, who might as well have been speaking for himself as \n     well as the Giants.\n\n[[Page S7302]]\n\n       When the 38-10 win was in the books, Adam sat next to Tuck \n     for the celebration, even though he was sporting a No. 90 \n     Pierre-Paul jersey. Tuck didn't mind, Adam said, and even \n     gave him a No. 91 jersey to add to his wardrobe.\n       ``I have a newfound love for Justin Tuck,'' Adam said. \n     ``The locker room was awesome. Make-A-Wish didn't just create \n     a wish--it was a dream.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/30/senate-section/article/S7302-1", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING JIM SPELLMAN\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to one of \nConnecticut's most dedicated and admired public officials, former \nStonington first selectman, James Spellman, Sr., who passed away at the \nage of 92.\n  Mr. Spellman's legacy of public service is remarkable. Elected 12 \ntimes over a span of 24 years, he made history as Stonington's longest \nserving first selectman. And he retired as Connecticut's longest \nserving municipal executive. At age 80, he received a rare, lifetime \npublic service award from the town of Stonington. His lasting impact \nwill be measured by the local landmarks erected under his leadership \nthat will endure for generations.\n  As first selectman, Mr. Spellman was an expert manager during a time \nof tremendous growth, and he guided historic development in \ninfrastructure. Most especially, he oversaw construction of the portion \nof Interstate 95 connecting Stonington with the rest of the State and \neast coast, and the development of several schools and shared \nrecreational spaces. Mr. Spellman always stayed true to the core values \nof his hometown. Born and raised in the area, he considered the town \nhis family.\n  Mr. Spellman's loved ones are quick to point out he never asked for--\nor expected--a local namesake. In fact, town officials quickly chose to \ndedicate Spellman Drive at a time when Mr. Spellman was physically \nunable to decline the honor while hospitalized.\n  His work was his life and his job was his personal pride. In this \nway, one of his shining accomplishments--the preservation of the \nStonington Town Dock and commercial fishing for Stonington--is both \npersonal and public. He was a courageous and highly decorated veteran \nof the U.S. Navy during World War II, and he led deliberately, kindly, \nand with stellar intuition.\n  In addition to his leadership of town hall, Mr. Spellman chaired the \nWater Pollution Control Authority and guided the creation of an \nintermunicipal sewage system. He also donated his time serving on the \nschool board, and volunteering with the Pawcatuck Fire Department, the \nAtlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, and the Connecticut \nJudicial Selection Commission. In 1955, he was one of the first \nConnecticut residents to be given a real-estate brokerage license, and \nfrom 1956 to 1961 was appointed by then-Governor Abraham Ribicoff as \njudge of the Stonington Town Court--the only appointee without a law \ndegree.\n  Even in retirement, Mr. Spellman demonstrated his truly heartfelt \ncare and concern for Stonington. He was generous with sage advice for \nlocal leaders throughout Connecticut, checking in frequently at town \nhall, and writing to the local newspaper.\n  Mr. Spellman was deservedly proud of all his family, including his \nson Steve, a friend and former colleague in the State senate. He will \nbe missed for his caring courage, sense of humor, and good heart. A \ntrue statesman, he will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/30/senate-section/article/S7302-2", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING JUDGE MARK KRAVITZ\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nour Nation's most preeminent legal minds and dedicated public servants, \nwho recently passed away. U.S. District Judge Mark Kravitz was known \nthroughout Connecticut and our Nation's highest courts as a respected \njudicial authority, experienced appellate litigator, legal scholar, and \ncommunity leader.\n  Judge Kravitz was deeply regarded and admired for his extraordinary \nanalytical mind and trial expertise. He devoted his vast experience--27 \nyears at New Haven firm Wiggin and Dana as a trial and appellate \nlawyer--to public service. Just out of law school, he emerged as a \nleader, clerking for Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who, in 2003, \nswore him in as a U.S. district judge. In 2001, and then again in 2007, \nhe was appointed by Chief Justice Roberts to serve on the Committee on \nthe Rules of Practice and Procedure and to chair the Advisory Committee \non Civil Rules. Over the years, he engaged in vital national \ndiscussions, writing for the National Law Journal and serving as an \nAmerican Law Institute Fellow and a board member of the American \nAcademy of Appellate Lawyers. In addition, he taught at the University \nof Connecticut School of Law, Yale Law, and the University of Melbourne \nGraduate School of Law.\n  I knew Judge Kravitz personally and professionally, on and off the \nbench. As attorney general, I appeared before him, arguing positions \nand causes that did not always prevail. Win or lose, I felt that the \nresult was fair and well-reasoned. And that view of him was common to \nalmost all litigants in his courtroom. Judge Kravitz presided and ruled \non important national issues, including the constitutionality of No \nChild Left Behind, free speech and property cases, and recently first \namendment rights cases raised by the movement to ``occupy Wall Street'' \non the New Haven Green. Even when diagnosed with ALS, he continued \nrelentlessly and tirelessly to work full time, demonstrating his \npassion for the law and dedication to his country.\n  As a footnote, I spent many hours with Judge Kravitz, even before he \nbecame a judge. He headed a moot court team that prepared me for \nSupreme Court arguments.\n  More importantly, I consistently witnessed Judge Kravitz's commitment \nto the philosophy of equality under the law, while remaining carefully \nattuned to the facets of each legal question before him. He was \ntrustworthy, and loyal in his relationship with others, especially his \nbeloved family--and my dear colleague and friend.\n  Outside of the law, he gave back to Connecticut as founding director \nof both the Yale Children's Hospital and Connecticut Food Bank. In \naddition, he volunteered his time on the boards of several nonprofit \norganizations, including the Connecticut Foundation for Open \nGovernment, Guilford Library Association, and Board of Ethics for the \nTown of Guilford. Judge Kravitz cared deeply about morality and \nintegrity--and lived according to the highest principles.\n  I was inspired and moved by a recent unveiling of his portrait, \ncommissioned by the Connecticut Bar Foundation, which will be hung in \nNew Haven's Federal courthouse. I invite my Senate colleagues to join \nme in paying respect to Judge Mark Kravitz and sending condolences to \nhis family, friends, and colleagues, who mourn his loss, and remember a \nman who made his life's work contributing to the world around him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/11/30/senate-section/article/S7302-3", "month": "11", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 2:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 915.

Res. 606\n\n       Whereas 19-year-old Catherine Spalding, born in Charles \n     County, Maryland, and Bishop John Baptist David, born in \n     France, responded to the need for education on the Kentucky \n     frontier by founding the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth \n     (referred to in this preamble as the ``Sisters''), on \n     December 1, 1812;\n       Whereas, after Ellen O'Connell, a gifted teacher from \n     Baltimore, Maryland, and daughter of a college professor, \n     joined the Sisters and prepared Catherine Spalding and \n     Harriet Gardiner for teaching, the 3 Sisters opened their \n     first school, in 1814, at St. Thomas Farm, in Nelson County, \n     Kentucky;\n       Whereas, after 2 years of teaching, the school serviced \n     both boarding and day students with a total enrollment of 37 \n     girls, including 13 non-Catholic students;\n       Whereas, in 1822, the Sisters purchased property located 3 \n     miles north of Bardstown, Kentucky and named that property \n     Nazareth;\n       Whereas, at Nazareth, the Sisters built log houses and a \n     new school, known as Nazareth Academy;\n       Whereas, in 1825, Henry Clay, Kentucky statesman and \n     orator, gave the first commencement address at Nazareth \n     Academy, where his daughter, granddaughter, and great-\n     granddaughter eventually received an education, along with \n     Sarah Knox Taylor, the daughter of President Zachary Taylor;\n       Whereas, during the Civil War, the Sisters nursed both \n     Union and Confederate soldiers;\n       Whereas Dr. J.O. Murray, a physician in the Union Army in \n     Louisville, Kentucky, wrote to Nazareth, ``I regret very much \n     to inform you of the death of Sister Catherine Malone on \n     January 31, 1862, at General Hospital No. 1 in this city. \n     She, as well as the other sisters at this hospital, have been \n     untiring and most efficient in nursing the sick soldiers. The \n     military authorities are under the greatest obligation to the \n     sisters of your order.'';\n       Whereas, in 1861, at the request of a commanding officer of \n     the Union Army, 22-year-old Sister Mary Lucy Dosh and the \n     other Sisters at St. Mary's Academy in Paducah, Kentucky \n     closed their school to nurse Union soldiers and Confederate \n     prisoners of war;\n       Whereas, while nursing, Sister Mary Lucy Dosh consoled \n     patients and often gave up her own food to provide \n     nourishment for the sick and wounded;\n       Whereas Sister Mary Lucy Dosh contracted typhoid fever and \n     died on December 29, 1861, resulting in doctors and soldiers \n     from Union and Confederate forces calling a truce to mourn \n     her death and officers from both sides accompanying her body \n     up the Ohio River on the U.S. Gunboat Peacock, for burial at \n     St. Vincent's Academy, in Union County, Kentucky;\n       Whereas, on January 17, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln \n     sent the following letter to Nazareth as a precaution against \n     any military intrusion: ``Let no depredation be committed \n     upon the property or possessions of the Sisters of Charity at \n     Nazareth Academy, near Bardstown, Kentucky.'';\n       Whereas, in 1878, a yellow fever epidemic besieged the \n     people of the Mississippi River Valley, during which time \n     approximately 120,000 cases of yellow fever were reported and \n     20,000 people died;\n       Whereas, in Holly Springs, Mississippi, the Sisters closed \n     a local parochial school to nurse the sick, with 6 of the \n     Sisters succumbing to yellow fever between September 22 and \n     October 11, 1878, which prompted the townspeople to erect a \n     monument at the gravesites of the 6 Sisters, honoring their \n     service and sacrifice;\n       Whereas, in 1918, 29 Sisters, along with sisters from other \n     orders, helped nurse over 10,000 wounded and sick World War I \n     soldiers at Camp Taylor, in Louisville;\n       Whereas the Sisters, finding the soldiers sleeping on bare \n     mattresses and dressed in uniforms and boots, requested bed \n     linens and hospital clothing for the sick and wounded at Camp \n     Taylor;\n       Whereas 90 soldiers, many with Spanish Influenza and battle \n     wounds, died during the night that the Sisters first arrived \n     at Camp Taylor;\n       Whereas deaths at Camp Taylor noticeably declined as the \n     Sisters provided skilled nursing and a commitment to hygiene;\n       Whereas an officer remarked that he knew when a Sister was \n     in the barracks at Camp Taylor, because the men were \n     especially quiet and well-mannered;\n       Whereas, by the mid-20th century, the Sisters were located \n     in 10 States, taught in more than 100 elementary schools, 30 \n     secondary schools, 2 colleges, and 6 schools of nursing, and \n     cared for the sick in 12 hospitals and children in 6 \n     orphanages;\n       Whereas the Sisters opened their first foreign mission in \n     India in 1947, and subsequent foreign missions in Belize in \n     1975, Nepal in 1979, and Botswana in 2000;\n       Whereas, in 1986, Nazareth Home, a nursing care facility \n     that the Sisters opened in 1976, in Louisville, became the \n     first long-term care facility in Kentucky to accept HIV/AIDS \n     patients;\n       Whereas, as of November 2012, the Sisters--\n       (1) staff an HIV/AIDS hospice and administer 2 preschools \n     in Botswana;

The \n     military authorities are under the greatest obligation to the \n     sisters of your order.'';\n       Whereas, in 1861, at the request of a commanding officer of \n     the Union Army, 22-year-old Sister Mary Lucy Dosh and the \n     other Sisters at St. Mary's Academy in Paducah, Kentucky \n     closed their school to nurse Union soldiers and Confederate \n     prisoners of war;\n       Whereas, while nursing, Sister Mary Lucy Dosh consoled \n     patients and often gave up her own food to provide \n     nourishment for the sick and wounded;\n       Whereas Sister Mary Lucy Dosh contracted typhoid fever and \n     died on December 29, 1861, resulting in doctors and soldiers \n     from Union and Confederate forces calling a truce to mourn \n     her death and officers from both sides accompanying her body \n     up the Ohio River on the U.S. Gunboat Peacock, for burial at \n     St. Vincent's Academy, in Union County, Kentucky;\n       Whereas, on January 17, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln \n     sent the following letter to Nazareth as a precaution against \n     any military intrusion: ``Let no depredation be committed \n     upon the property or possessions of the Sisters of Charity at \n     Nazareth Academy, near Bardstown, Kentucky.'';\n       Whereas, in 1878, a yellow fever epidemic besieged the \n     people of the Mississippi River Valley, during which time \n     approximately 120,000 cases of yellow fever were reported and \n     20,000 people died;\n       Whereas, in Holly Springs, Mississippi, the Sisters closed \n     a local parochial school to nurse the sick, with 6 of the \n     Sisters succumbing to yellow fever between September 22 and \n     October 11, 1878, which prompted the townspeople to erect a \n     monument at the gravesites of the 6 Sisters, honoring their \n     service and sacrifice;\n       Whereas, in 1918, 29 Sisters, along with sisters from other \n     orders, helped nurse over 10,000 wounded and sick World War I \n     soldiers at Camp Taylor, in Louisville;\n       Whereas the Sisters, finding the soldiers sleeping on bare \n     mattresses and dressed in uniforms and boots, requested bed \n     linens and hospital clothing for the sick and wounded at Camp \n     Taylor;\n       Whereas 90 soldiers, many with Spanish Influenza and battle \n     wounds, died during the night that the Sisters first arrived \n     at Camp Taylor;\n       Whereas deaths at Camp Taylor noticeably declined as the \n     Sisters provided skilled nursing and a commitment to hygiene;\n       Whereas an officer remarked that he knew when a Sister was \n     in the barracks at Camp Taylor, because the men were \n     especially quiet and well-mannered;\n       Whereas, by the mid-20th century, the Sisters were located \n     in 10 States, taught in more than 100 elementary schools, 30 \n     secondary schools, 2 colleges, and 6 schools of nursing, and \n     cared for the sick in 12 hospitals and children in 6 \n     orphanages;\n       Whereas the Sisters opened their first foreign mission in \n     India in 1947, and subsequent foreign missions in Belize in \n     1975, Nepal in 1979, and Botswana in 2000;\n       Whereas, in 1986, Nazareth Home, a nursing care facility \n     that the Sisters opened in 1976, in Louisville, became the \n     first long-term care facility in Kentucky to accept HIV/AIDS \n     patients;\n       Whereas, as of November 2012, the Sisters--\n       (1) staff an HIV/AIDS hospice and administer 2 preschools \n     in Botswana;
