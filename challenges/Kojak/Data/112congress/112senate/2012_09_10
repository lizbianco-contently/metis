Mr. President, I wish to take a minute to talk about \nCongressman Paul Ryan's arithmetic. It is very interesting. He said he \nran a marathon. A marathon is 26.2 miles long. While being questioned \nby the press, he said he ran it in about 2 hours and 50 minutes. Now, \nthat is pretty fast. I would like to take a minute and apply the Ryan \nmath to my marathon times. I will pick just one marathon time.\n  I ran the Boston Marathon, and using the Ryan math my time would not \nhave been a world record but within minutes of a world record. I could \nhave made the Olympic team. By using Ryan math, I would have been \nsuperb. Well, the Ryan math doesn't work in marathons. As we all know, \nwe can always check someone's math, and his math doesn't work for \nrunning a marathon or anything else.\n  The Ryan math doesn't work with his budgets, it doesn't work with \nMedicare, and it doesn't work with his tax plan. It doesn't work with \nanything he has suggested and opined. It is no more than his little \nassertion that I guess he thought no one would check. When people run \nthese races, they keep records. For all of my marathons, they have kept \nrecords. So as much as I would like to have the Ryan math apply to my \nmarathons, it doesn't work.\n  The Senate is going to resume its work in a few minutes on the heels \nof the two conventions. One was in Florida and one in North Carolina. \nThe Republicans used their virtually fact-free convention to showcase \nthe richest style economic policies.\n  The Democrats took a different approach. I am sure we all had our \nfavorites. I thought Congressman Cleaver's speech was so terrific. I \ndon't know how many were able to see it, but it was great. He was up \nthere marching. He was just outstanding.\n  Gov. Jennifer Granholm from Michigan was so good as she explained to \neveryone about jobs and why Detroit should not have gone bankrupt.\n  I thought Joe Biden's speech was typical for Joe Biden. It was \nwonderful. I admire him so much. I served with him for a quarter of a \ncentury. What a good man. He has contributed such valuable service to \nhis country. While talking about his life story, we saw when his son \nintroduced him. Tears were coming from his eyes.\n  The President's and Mrs. Obama's messages were very clear. They did \nso well.\n  In Charlotte Democrats presented Americans with a clear and honest \nassessment of the challenges we face as a nation and a concrete plan to \novercome the problems we have together. That is why President Obama has \nseen a significant rise in the polls since that convention and all of \nthose speeches--not just his speech but all of them. Even the \nRepublican-skewed Rasmussen poll had him ahead by 5 points.\n  In fact, we presented Americans with clear choices. It was not a \nchoice between two candidates or two parties; it\n\n[[Page S6024]]\n\nwas a choice between two visions: the Romney vision and the vision we \ncertainly think was pronounced at that convention, the Obama vision and \na vision about America's future.\n  The Republican vision would return us to the failed economic policies \nthat brought us to the great recession. It would return us to 8 years \nof wars, rumors of wars, and massive debt, everything unpaid for.\n  We don't want to go back to that. We can't go back to that. It would \nfurther tilt the playing field in favor of those who have every \nadvantage, millionaires and billionaires. They already have an \nadvantage. We don't need to give them any more.\n  President Obama showed a vision of America where every person has a \nshot at success, where fairness replaces favoritism. His policies led \nto 30 straight months of private sector job growth. Would we like more? \nOf course we would.\n  I met with Harold Schaitberger this morning, general president of the \nfirefighters. He has been working in the field with firefighters. He \nstarted out as a firefighter. As a boy, his father died, and before he \nwas old enough to be a firefighter, he actually lived in a firehouse by \nhimself with the rest of the firefighters. That is where he got the \nidea that was what he wanted to do with his life's work. He has \ndedicated so much to making America a better place.\n  In my conversation with him we discussed how we are approaching 1 \nmillion people who have been laid off in the public sector. I am sure \nit has happened in Connecticut. It has happened in Nevada. It has \nhappened everyplace. We thought we had a way of solving that problem.\n  Mr. President, you voted, I voted, and we thought we should stop the \nlayoffs of firefighters, police officers, and teachers, and we would \npay for it and have no more debt. We would pay for it by having a \nthree-tenths of 1 percent surtax on people making more than $1 million \na year. Every Republican voted against public employees. Three-tenths \nof 1 percent would have taken care of all of that.\n  I enjoyed my conversation with President Schaitberger. We lamented \nthe fact that all of these public employees have been laid off, and we \nhave to get back to where we can have a public sector where people are \nnot so overworked. I know in Nevada we have too few firefighters, too \nfew police officers, and teachers who have been laid off, and that is a \nshame.\n  We have had 30 straight months of private sector job growth. Too bad \nthe numbers are not more than 4\\1/2\\ million, but that is where they \nare. We lost 8 million jobs in the Bush years, and we have gained more \nthan half of them back. We are making progress. We wish we could do \nbetter, and everyone acknowledges that. There is more work to be done. \nToo many Americans are still hurting.\n  President Obama has a plan to put more than 1 million people back to \nwork next year. His plan will create jobs for the middle class and not \njust profits for the CEOs. We all want profits for these companies--and \nthat is good--but we also want to make sure there is a fair program out \nthere and that we do something to stop the middle class from being \nsqueezed so hard. A lot of the CEOs are doing extremely well, and I am \nhappy.\n  The Dow is up more than 6,000 points since President Obama took \noffice. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney has failed to offer a single concrete \nidea to get good-paying jobs for American workers.\n  I watched part of an interview of Congressman Ryan today. It was a \nreplay from yesterday. I think he was on ABC with George \nStephanopoulos. All I could see was the back of Stephanopoulos's head, \nbut I think that is who it was. He was saying they want to close these \ntax loopholes. So Romney has been asked and Ryan has been asked: What \nloopholes do you want to close? They will not say. It is part of their \nfictitious math because when they start talking about how fast they ran \na marathon or talk about holes they want to plug, they have to give \nfacts. And they have refused to do that.\n  Do they want to get rid of charitable donations? Do they want to get \nrid of the deduction for buying a home? They will not say. It is \nobvious why; they are afraid. So they give the Ryan math and the Romney \nmath, which doesn't add up.\n  It is no surprise that Governor Romney has failed to offer a single \nproposal to create a good-paying job. After all, he belongs to the same \nRepublican Party that has put partisan politics ahead of creating jobs \nfor almost 4 years now. In fact, some would say 6 years. We have never \nhad such obstruction in the history of the country. Nothing even comes \nclose.\n  In the almost 6 years we have had the majority in the Senate, we have \nhad to file cloture 380 times. There were times when the Congress would \nfile cloture a handful of times, maybe 10 times. It has been 380 times \nin less than 6 years. This is the same Republican Party whose leader \nhas said his No. 1 goal is to defeat President Obama, not create jobs \nfor the American people in the private or public sector.\n  We have been rolling up our sleeves to put teachers, firefighters, \npolice, and construction workers back on the job. For every $1 billion \nwe spend as a Federal Government for infrastructure, there are 47,500 \nhigh-paying jobs. There are other lower paying jobs that spin off of \nthat. These are not government jobs. We don't send a truck out that \nsays ``U.S. Federal Government'' on it to do this work. This money goes \nto the private sector to create jobs.\n  So while we have been working to try to create jobs, Republicans have \nbeen throwing up their hands--or worse, standing in the way of \nprogress. Our No. 1 goal is to get our economy back on track. I repeat, \nthe Republicans' No. 1 goal is to defeat President Obama. What a shame.\n  We are resolute in our commitment to restore the economy. That is why \nwe proposed the Veterans Job Corps Act, a measure that fulfills our \npromise to the brave men and women who dedicated their lives to making \nour lives safer.\n  President Obama kept his promise to end the war in Iraq and wind down \nthe war in Afghanistan. The war in Iraq is over, and each year about \n200,000 servicemembers reenter the civilian workplace. That is the way \nit is right now. As this new generation of veterans returns home ready \nto work, it is our job to make sure they have the opportunity to work \nand succeed.\n  The bill that is now before the Senate, the Veterans Job Corps Act, \nwill reinvest in our returning servicemembers, easing the sometimes \ndifficult transition back to civilian life.\n  The measure will also offer priority hiring for veterans who want to \nbecome first responders. As we have talked about already, these include \nfirefighters, police officers, and EMTs. It will also create jobs for \nveterans restoring forests, parks, coasts, and public lands. These are \nreally good jobs. These are really important jobs. We tried this once \nbefore when we were really struggling as a country during the Great \nDepression. We had the Works Progress Administration. We had the \nCivilian Conservation Corps. In my little town of Searchlight, NV, \nthere were numerous projects that were developed by these individuals \nduring the Great Depression. They would fix watering holes, put in \nwindmills, build walkways, and many of these things are still in \nexistence. So I commend the senior Senator from Florida, Mr. Bill \nNelson, and the junior Senator from Montana, Mr. Jon Tester, for their \nwork on this legislation. Unfortunately, we once again face Republican \nobstruction.\n  I repeat something I said a few minutes ago. Since we took control of \nthe Senate in 2006-2007, Republicans have mounted an unprecedented 380 \nfilibusters. This is outrageous. This obstruction exceeds anything we \nhave ever seen before in the Senate. This is not using Romney-Ryan \nmath; these are actual, valid numbers. By comparison, in Lyndon \nJohnson's 6 years as majority leader--I could ask everyone here to take \na guess as to how many filibusters he had to overcome. Remember, these \nwere the years when he was President and we had the civil rights stuff \ngoing on and all kinds of problems. Everyone would fail the test. He \nhad to overcome one filibuster. I have been faced with 308.\n  I hope Republican colleagues will join us tomorrow as we vote to \nadvance this measure. It is too bad we have had to file cloture on \nmoving to proceed to this bill. The heroes who fought for their country \noverseas shouldn't have to fight for jobs once they get home.\n\n[[Page S6025]]\n\n  Tomorrow marks the 11th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist \nattacks. The date is a reminder that through over a decade of war, the \nbravery and dedication of America's Armed Forces has never wavered. It \nis a reminder that our commitment to those fine young and women should \nnever waver, either.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6025-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6025-S6033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           VETERANS JOBS CORPS ACT OF 2012--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Convention Response\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to speak about two claims that \nwere made at the recent Democratic Convention that I believe require a \nresponse. Obviously, the Republican Convention went first and they did \nnot have an opportunity to respond to everything that was said, but I \nthink there are two things, as I said, that were claimed that just are \nnot true. The first is that Republican policies caused the economic \nrecession, so that in the Democrats' view electing Governor Romney \nwould simply return us to those same, allegedly, failed policies. \nSecond, it was said by several spokesmen on the Democratic side that \nthere were no new or big ideas coming out of the Republican Convention, \nso you might as well give President Obama another 4 years in office. I \nwould like to respond to both of those claims.\n  First, President Obama and his supporters would like Americans to \nbelieve that the so-called Bush tax cuts, deficits, and deregulation \ncaused the great recession. Those are the Republican policies that got \nus into the mess, they say. The facts show this is not true. As James \nPethakoukis of the American Enterprise Institute asks, if the 2001 and \n2003 tax cuts caused the great recession, then why does President Obama \nwant to keep most of them? And why did he sign a 2-year extension of \nthose tax cuts a year and a half ago? That is a good question.\n  Obama supporters also claim that huge deficits resulting from these \n2001 and 2003 bills caused the recession. But here are the facts. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office--nonpartisan--the 2001 and \n2003 tax relief has only been responsible for 16 percent of the swing \nfrom surplus to deficit that they had estimated. If you look at the \nupper income tax relief only, that relief makes up just 4 percent of \nthe swing. So it is impossible to say the tax cuts on the rich caused \nthe recession. The maximum that the Congressional Budget Office can \nidentify is potentially 4 percent. It is also important to note that \nsince the CBO does not take into account the progrowth effects of \nmarginal tax rate reductions--which all economists agree with--these \nnumbers are even likely smaller than 4 percent.\n  Over that same period of time, new spending--this is the real \nproblem--and interest on that spending were 12 times as responsible as \nthe upper income tax reductions. So the real culprit here is not \nreducing the tax rate on Americans and especially those who are in the \nwealthier brackets but, rather, the new spending in which the Federal \nGovernment engaged. That is the cause of the deficits, and that did \nhave an impact eventually on our ability to recover from the great \nrecession.\n  One other note on this. The rich people, even though their tax rates \nwere cut, ended up paying a far bigger percentage of taxes after the \nBush tax cuts. The upper bracket earners paid--according to CBO again, \nin 2008 and 2009, the years for which they have figures, the top 20 \npercent of taxpayers paid 90 percent of income taxes--94 percent of \nincome taxes. Before the Bush tax cuts, before 2001, that same top 20 \npercent paid only 81 percent. So the tax cuts in the upper income tax \nbrackets resulted in an increase in the total dollar amount of taxes \npaid by the upper income people from 81 percent to 94 percent. So you \ncannot even make the argument that it was less fair. If anything, the \nupper income folks obviously paid a lot more--94 percent of all the \nincome taxes paid.\n  Now, if deficits are the problem the Democrats are talking about, \nthen President Obama would clearly make the problem worse. Pethakoukis \nnotes:\n\n       The most recent Obama budget, according to CBO, would add \n     $6.4 trillion more to the federal budget deficit over the \n     next decade, leaving debt as a share of the economy stuck at \n     around 76 percent of GDP versus 37 percent pre-recession.\n\n  Think about it. The Obama budget leaves us with 76 percent debt as a \nshare of GDP as opposed to 37 percent before the recession. So if debt \nand deficits are a problem, it is far worse under President Obama's \nbudget than before. But, again, it turns out that is not really what \ncaused the great recession, nor was it the third item that has been \npointed to; that is, deregulation.\n  Deregulation under President Bush did not cause the problem. \nPethakoukis writes:\n\n       Glass-Steagall ended during the Clinton administration, and \n     studies have found no evidence that any rule changes by the \n     Bush SEC contributed to the financial crisis.\n\n  Glass-Steagall is the law that used to regulate how banks made \ninvestments. That law was eventually repealed during the Clinton \nadministration. The Bush SEC--that stands for Securities and Exchange \nCommission, and there are rules changes in every administration for the \nSEC--he is making the point that there is no evidence that any \nparticular rule change in the SEC had anything to do with the financial \ncrisis.\n  So it was not the tax cuts, it was not the deficit, and it was not \nderegulation. What did cause the recession? AEI's Peter Wallison has \nput it simply this way:\n\n       The financial crisis was a result of government housing \n     policy. . . . Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were the \n     implementers of a substantial portion of the government \n     housing policy.\n\n  Now, I would note that Republicans in Congress tried to reform Fannie \nand Freddie, but we were opposed by Democratic Members both in the \nHouse and in the Senate, including then-Senator Barack Obama.\n  Most experts, I believe, will agree that the biggest reason for the \ncollapse that occurred after 2006 was the housing market--the sale of \nall of these mortgages that were not worth the paper on which they were \nwritten. When that paper was all added together, bundled together and \nsold in big chunks to investors, and they found out their investment \nwas not worth what they had paid for it, you had a crash and you had \nseveral people on Wall Street who went bankrupt as a result of that \ncrash. That is the reality.\n  The bottom line is that there is no Republican policy that caused the \nrecession, so it is bogus for the President to keep saying Governor \nRomney would just return us to the ``same failed policies.''\n  The second claim is that there were no new big Republican ideas to \ncome\n\n[[Page S6026]]\n\nout of the GOP convention. I submit that claim reveals just how radical \nthe Obama team's economic policies are. It is true that Governor \nRomney's ideas for economic recovery are not new. But they are big. In \nfact, his faith in the American people and the free enterprise system \nis a very big idea--not new but tried and tested as the basis for \ncreating the wealthiest Nation ever on Earth.\n  Capitalism and free markets have lifted the standard of living for \nmore people around the world than any government program or any other \nsystem. Planned economies compare very poorly to the free enterprise \nsystem of America. Margaret Thatcher once famously observed:\n\n       The problem with socialism is that, eventually, you run out \n     of other people's money.\n\n  Yes, a key theme of the Republican Convention was freedom, \nopportunity, and earned success. Americans did build our own success. \nTo the extent that government provided any infrastructure along the \nway, it was paid for by taxes that Americans paid on what they earned \nbecause of their success. And, yes, this is in contrast to the theme of \nthe Democratic Convention that our success comes from the collective, \nembodied mostly in government, so the bigger the government the better.\n  The bottom line is this: Returning to free market principles and \nprogrowth policies will move us forward. Continued reliance on more \nspending, higher taxes, and bigger government will not solve our \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Rose Nomination\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I am a \nstrong and enthusiastic advocate of Stephanie Rose to serve as a \ndistrict court judge in Iowa's southern judicial district. I was \nhonored to recommend to the President that he nominate this outstanding \nattorney. I encourage my colleagues to vote for her confirmation when \nthe vote occurs later this afternoon.\n  Let me begin by first thanking Senator Leahy and his staff for their \nhard work in advancing Ms. Rose's nomination. I also want to thank my \nsenior colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, for his invaluable \nsupport and assistance. For all the years we have served together here \nin the Senate, which now goes on, I think, 27 years, Senator Grassley \nand I have cooperated in a spirit of good will on judicial nominations \nin our State.\n  I am proud we are continuing Iowa's tradition regarding judicial \nselections. I can honestly say that Senator Grassley has never opposed \none of my selectees, I have never opposed one of his, even when there \nhas been a different President in the White House, depending upon the \nparty that is in control of the Congress. I think we have both been \nvery judicious, if I might use that word, in our selection of people \nfor the bench. I say that both on behalf of Senator Grassley and \nmyself. So therefore we have worked together in this very close spirit \nof cooperation.\n  I also want to thank Senator Grassley's staff, in particular Jeremy \nParis, Ted Lehman, and Senator Grassley's Chief of Staff, David Young, \nfor their support and their help in advancing the nomination. On my \nstaff, I want to thank my Chief of Staff, Brian Ahlberg, Dan Goldberg, \nDerek Miller, and Pam Smith, all of whom have worked very hard to make \nsure we had a thorough interview process, a thorough vetting of the \ncandidates, and to make sure that we got to the point where her vote \nwill be coming up later this afternoon.\n  Stephanie Rose possesses in abundance the personal and professional \nqualities we expect from those we consider to take on the profound \nresponsibilities of a Federal judge. She is a superb attorney. Among \njurists, prosecutors, and the defense bar, she has a reputation as \nsomeone who is unfailingly fair and ethical and who possesses \nexceptional legal ability, intellect, integrity, and judgment.\n  As Charles Larson, the former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District \nof Iowa under President George W. Bush, wrote to the Judiciary \nCommittee, Ms. Rose ``has all the requisite abilities and traits to \nserve all litigants of the Southern District of Iowa in the manner \nexpected of a federal judge. Ms. Rose would be a distinguished member \nof the judiciary.''\n  Ms. Rose was born in Topeka, KS, and moved to Mason City, IA, when \nshe was 4. Both of her parents were public schoolteachers. She and her \nhusband Rob have two children, Kyl and Missy. Ms. Rose has two sisters, \none of whom was adopted after coming to the family as a foster child, \none of five foster children her parents welcomed into their home.\n  After graduating from Mason City High School, Ms. Rose earned her \nbachelor's degree with honors from the University of Iowa in just 3 \nyears. Then she earned her doctorate of jurisprudence from the \nUniversity of Iowa College of Law in just 2 years, graduating in the \ntop 5 percent of her class.\n  She could easily have commanded a big salary from a top law firm. \nInstead she opted for public service and long hours as a Federal \nprosecutor, working to uphold the rule of law, making our neighborhoods \nsafer, and advancing the cause of justice.\n  I might add that she served as a Federal prosecutor under district \nattorneys appointed both by Democratic Presidents and Republican \nPresidents. In 2009, the Senate unanimously confirmed Ms. Rose to \nbecome U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Iowa, having \npreviously served 12 years as an assistant U.S. attorney.\n  Even before becoming U.S. attorney, she was lead counsel in 260 \nfelony cases and made 34 oral arguments before the eighth circuit. She \nreceived a national award from the Department of Justice for her work \nin prosecuting the largest unlawful Internet pharmacy case in the \nUnited States.\n  As U.S. attorney, Ms. Rose has helped make Iowa and our Nation safer, \nreduced violent crime and gang violence, and promoted civil rights. In \naddition, she has the distinction of serving on the Attorney General's \nAdvisory Committee. It is no surprise that the American Bar Association \ngave Ms. Rose a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating, the highest rating \nby the American Bar Association.\n  Finally, I wanted to comment on the historic nature of her \nconfirmation. Ms. Rose was the first woman to be confirmed as U.S. \nattorney in Iowa's Northern District, and when confirmed later today, \nshe will be the first woman confirmed as a U.S. district court judge in \nIowa's Southern District.\n  Ms. Rose is a person of truly outstanding intellect, integrity, and \ncharacter. She is exceptionally well qualified to serve as a United \nStates district judge for the Southern District of Iowa. I urge all of \nmy colleagues to support her nomination.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Honoring Otis a. Brumby, Jr.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an 8-page eulogy that appeared in the Marietta Daily \nJournal on Sunday of this week.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Mariettta Daily Journal, Sept. 8, 2012]\n\n        Journal Publisher Dies After Two-Year Battle With Cancer\n\n                             (By Joe Kirby)\n\n       Otis A. Brumby Jr. served nearly a half-century as \n     publisher of the Marietta Daily Journal. During those decades \n     he oversaw the transformation of the MDJ from a small-city \n     newspaper into the award-winning flagship of a metro-wide \n     chain of suburban papers; used those publications as ``bully \n     pulpits'' for lower taxes and against political\n\n[[Page S6027]]\n\n     corruption; crusaded successfully for stronger ``Sunshine \n     Laws''; fought passionately for education reform; and was a \n     widely respected kingmaker in state and local politics. \n     Brumby, who was diagnosed with Stage 4 prostate cancer nearly \n     two years ago and had waged a strenuous fight against it \n     since then, passed away peacefully at his home on Saturday at \n     age 72, surrounded by family and friends.\n       Said former Gov. Roy Barnes of Marietta, ``I can think of \n     no single person who's had bigger impact on Cobb County and \n     this state than Otis. He excelled as a community leader and \n     in education reform. And I think that a giant oak has fallen \n     that will be very difficult to replace.''\n       Otis A. Brumby Jr. was born April 9, 1940 in Atlanta, son \n     of the late Otis A. Brumby Sr. and Elisabeth Dobbs Brumby of \n     Marietta. His family had a long history and deep roots in \n     county history. One member (Col. Anoldus V. Brumby) had \n     served as commandant of the Georgia Military Institute on \n     Powder Springs Road in Marietta (now site of the Marietta \n     Hilton and Conference Center). Otis Jr. was the great-\n     grandson of Thomas Micajah Brumby, who with his brother James \n     had co-founded the Brumby Chair Company here just after the \n     Civil War (a company that Otis Jr. would successfully \n     resurrect in the mid-1990s). Both Thomas and his son, Thomas \n     Jr., served as mayors of Marietta, the latter dying in \n     office.\n       Thomas Jr.'s son Otis Sr. had founded the weekly Cobb \n     County Times in 1916 and acquired the MDJ in 1951.\n       The publisher and his young family, which also included \n     daughter Bebe in addition to Otis, lived on then-rural \n     Terrell Mill Road just south of Marietta.\n       Despite growing up around the newspaper, Otis Jr. had \n     planned on a legal career. After graduating from the \n     University of the South in Sewanee, Tenn., with a major in \n     political science and a minor in economics, he earned a law \n     degree from The University of Georgia in Athens (where his \n     roommates included future famed criminal defense lawyer Ed \n     Garland, banking tycoon James Blanchard of Synovus and \n     prominent attorney Wyck Knox of Augusta).\n       But shortly after he returned to Marietta in 1965 as \n     assistant to the publisher (a training period that also \n     included a lengthy stint as a ``cub'' reporter) and two years \n     later was named publisher.\n       He wasted little time making his mark. In 1969 he launched \n     the Neighbor Newspaper group, which ultimately grew into a \n     chain of 27 free suburban weeklies circling metro Atlanta, \n     with satellite offices in each county feeding copy back to \n     Marietta.\n       ``Otis Jr. was still in his 20s when he made the visionary \n     decision to start the Neighbor newspapers,'' retired Kennesaw \n     State University history professor Tom Scott, Ph.D., told the \n     MDJ. ``In the competitive world of modern reporting, with so \n     many alternatives to print journalism, it's hard to see how \n     the MDJ could have been so profitable without the mass \n     circulation of those suburban newspapers.''\n       Meanwhile, with delivery issues in mind and with an eye on \n     the need for better access to then-new Interstate 75, Brumby \n     moved the newspaper's offices from their traditional Marietta \n     Square location to a new plant on Fairground Street just \n     downhill from Lockheed.\n       Brumby's newspaper, with its emphasis on short stories and \n     readability, became a model for the industry. When Gannett \n     began laying plans for what would become USA Today, it sent a \n     team of editors to spend a week in the MDJ newsroom studying \n     the Marietta newspaper model.\n       The MDJ's meat-and-potatoes was and is coverage of \n     community events that are too routine for bigger media to pay \n     much attention to: the rezonings, the road widenings, the \n     church news, the school news, the new business openings. But \n     unlike many community-oriented newspapers, and unlike many \n     bigger ones as well, the MDJ under Brumby's leadership also \n     kept its editorial eye riveted on the doings of its local \n     governments. The MDJ hammered home through the years the need \n     for leaner government and lower taxes.\n       ``He was always a populist in his views and opposed what he \n     deemed to be wasteful spending on any level of government,'' \n     recalled state Senator and former Cobb school board Chairman \n     Lindsey Tippins.\n       Added former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, ``Otis was \n     consistently one of the strongest voices for more efficient \n     government, for smaller government and for creating new jobs. \n     He was a passionate advocate for the development of northside \n     Atlanta. Just look at the amount of what in his youth was \n     farmland that now is full of homes and factories and schools. \n     He was integral to the growth of Cobb.''\n       Said legendary retired Georgia journalist and syndicated \n     columnist Bill Shipp of Kennesaw, ``Of all the publishers and \n     editors I met and worked for, he was far and above the best \n     one. He had a model daily newspaper. He not only reported the \n     news, his newspaper was an active, dynamic watchdog in this \n     county.\n       ``He ran a newspaper that appealed to local newspaper \n     readers and was a cause for community good. And the MDJ is \n     without equal in the entire state in that regard.''\n       Added Barnes, ``We have not had any major government \n     corruption scandals in Cobb, and the reason is that Otis was \n     a vigilant watchdog making sure the public knew what was \n     going on. We've escaped embarrassment, corruption and scandal \n     because of his efforts.''\n       Like most editors and publishers, Brumby felt strongly \n     about First Amendment issues. But unlike the perfunctory \n     support sometimes heard from such quarters, Brumby's front-\n     and-center push for government transparency was unwavering.\n       ``His legacy in journalism was his consistent, unrelenting \n     effort to ensure government transparency and open meetings \n     and records,'' said U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) \n     ``There's not a journalist or publisher or editorial writer \n     in this state that did more than Otis to ensure the public's \n     business was done in the open. There wouldn't be an Open \n     Meetings and Open Records Act without Otis.''\n       Continued Isakson, ``When the publisher of your hometown \n     paper and your personal friend has a passion for open \n     government and you're an elected official, if you don't \n     embrace that concept too, you won't last very long.''\n       Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens of east Cobb described \n     Brumby as ``a great teacher and mentor. His love of the First \n     Amendment and his desire for elected officials to be held \n     accountable are much appreciated.''\n       Retired ambulance company owner Bo Pounds was part of a \n     group that successfully brought suit against Cobb EMC \n     regarding misuse of corporate assets, an effort that was \n     fueled by the MDJ's close coverage.\n       ``Otis is the best I've ever seen at letting the public \n     know what in the hell the government is doing,'' he told the \n     MDJ. ``Otis is as responsible for openness in Georgia law as \n     anyone.''\n       The newspaper went on to win the prestigious annual Freedom \n     of Information Award numerous times from the Georgia \n     Associated Press and the Georgia Press Association.\n       As Brumby saw it, the Sunshine laws were tools for use by \n     the public and media to help hold elected officials \n     accountable.\n       Shipp, the retired columnist, said that public officials \n     ``were and are absolutely terrified of the MDJ, and that's a \n     good thing. We don't have much of that kind of journalism \n     anymore. It's the kind of journalism that keeps people in the \n     middle of the road.''\n       Said Marietta Mayor Steve Tumlin, ``I had one rule with \n     Otis as a politician: Tell the truth early on and hide \n     nothing, as he knew it or was going to know it anyway.''\n       It's notable that the three Georgia elected officials who \n     arguably worked the hardest and most successfully to \n     strengthen the sunshine laws Barnes, Olens and Isakson--had \n     something in common.\n       ``They were all under tutelage of Otis Brumby,'' Barnes \n     said. ``He impressed upon us and all who would listen the \n     importance of making sure that government is open and \n     conducted in the sunshine. He always argued that was the best \n     way to keep government from becoming too bureaucratic and to \n     try to prevent corruption. I could have had no better ally on \n     that than Otis Brumby. It was not just lip service, but \n     something he was passionate about.''\n       Former state Sen. Chuck Clay (R-Marietta) recalls Brumby as \n     ``an absolutely uncompromising warrior on behalf of open \n     government and open records. The people of Georgia have been \n     well served by his efforts. I just hope they know what a \n     legal quorum is in heaven or there is going to be trouble, \n     and I bet on Otis.''\n       Brumby also was passionate about education reform and \n     strong public schools. The result was, first, his appointment \n     to the Marietta School Board by then-Mayor Joe Mack Wilson \n     and the City Council in 1993; and later, his appointment as \n     chairman of the State School Board by Barnes in 1999.\n       ``I went to his house and said, I want you to be \n     chairman,''' Barnes recalled. ``That's a tough job, but he \n     thought about it and said, That's not the job I want, but \n     it's a job I can't say no' to. Education is too important.' \n     He was always willing to serve, and he always gave 100 \n     percent.''\n       But perhaps Brumby's biggest contribution to public schools \n     was the ``vote of confidence'' in them by virtue of the \n     decision he and wife Martha Lee made to send all five of \n     their children to the Marietta School System, rather than to \n     private schools as many Mariettans were doing.\n       ``He chose to send them to public school when he could have \n     afforded to send them to any private school in the country,'' \n     observed former U.S. Rep. Buddy Darden (D-Marietta).\n       Brumby was fond of quoting former Mayor Joe Mack Wilson's \n     observation that the city school system ``is the glue that \n     holds Marietta together.''\n       Brumby was fascinated by politics, an interest honed when \n     he served in the 1950s as congressional page for his cousin, \n     U.S. Sen. Richard B. Russell in Washington, D.C. (Brumby went \n     on to graduate from The Capitol Page School in Washington.)\n       ``Other than his family, which he was more proud of than \n     anything, I think he was most proud of his days as a page for \n     Richard Russell,'' recalled syndicated columnist Matt Towery \n     of Vinings. ``He didn't have as many pages as the other \n     senators, and not many could say they paged for him. And that \n     relationship helped form many of his views on politics and \n     life.''\n       Russell was one of the most powerful senators and was the \n     intellectual force behind the Southern bloc that then \n     controlled the seniority-driven body. Russell also was a \n     confidante of both then- President Dwight Eisenhower and \n     then-Senate Majority Leader (and future President) Lyndon B. \n     Johnson. The young Brumby would recall in later years that he \n     was routinely designated by Johnson to answer his personal \n     phone on the floor of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S6028]]\n\n       Cobb and Georgia politics in that era were overwhelmingly \n     Democratic. But Brumby took the reins of the MDJ just as \n     Cobb's previously next-to-nonexistent Republican Party was \n     first beginning to stir. Fueled by an influx of residents \n     from other parts of the country into east Cobb, the county \n     GOP would be a force to be reckoned with by the early 1980s.\n       ``Otis always thought that a strong two-party system was in \n     the best interest of the state,'' said Isakson, who first ran \n     for office in the early 1970s. ``And being part of the \n     minority party early in my career, he gave us the chance to \n     make our case. He didn't prop us up, but he made sure the \n     access was there. We had a chance, and in a lot of \n     communities, you never did.''\n       Added Gingrich, who in those days represented a district on \n     the southside of Atlanta, ``Otis was a warrior for \n     conservatism who by the creation of the Neighbor Newspapers \n     on top of the MDJ dramatically offset the impact of the \n     Atlanta newspapers. You can't understand Georgia politics \n     over the last 30 years without understanding how important a \n     figure he was.\n       ``It's hard for folks now to remember how dominant the \n     liberal voice of the Atlanta newspaper was back in the 1970s, \n     and how exciting it was to have Otis and his newspaper as a \n     conservative voice. And it was great for our morale, too. \n     Later, when I was Speaker, I always felt like he had my \n     back.''\n       But Brumby's personal politics remained somewhat amorphous. \n     He endorsed and gave financial contributions to candidates of \n     both parties. Although personalities sometimes figured into \n     the equation, for him the bottom line usually was not party \n     label but whether the candidate was suitably conservative, \n     especially on fiscal matters.\n       A similar rule of thumb determined whether to editorially \n     support various proposals floated by local officials. The \n     main criterion was whether the project or referendum made \n     financial sense for taxpayers.\n       ``As a politician, I'll miss the question that I've heard \n     over and over, both in Cobb and in the state Capitol: ``What \n     does Otis think about this?''' Tumlin said.\n       It's hard to be a crusading journalist without making one's \n     share of enemies, and Brumby made his share--and then some. \n     But he not only possessed bulldog tenacity when it came to \n     following a story, but also with the rare gift of retaining \n     the friendship and respect of those who were momentarily \n     feeling the heat.\n       ``He doesn't have a single friend who didn't have a \n     disagreement with him, but we all learned to put those behind \n     us,'' Darden said. ``And he had the ability to move forward. \n     We didn't always agree, but it didn't come in the way of what \n     I consider one of my closest friendships in my entire adult \n     life.''\n       Said Isakson, ``I'll be the first to say we didn't agree on \n     everything, but I learned that it was best to focus on what \n     we agreed about and move on.''\n       Numerous others told the MDJ the same thing, including \n     Barnes.\n       ``Johnny and I are two of his close friends and he'd hammer \n     both of us from time to time, but we understood what he was \n     doing,'' he said. ``As I used to kid him, I never forget that \n     you're first and foremost a newspaper man. The ink flowed \n     through his bones and blood. But we remained friends. That is \n     a unique ability, to continue to have a close relationship. I \n     knew his secrets and he knew mine. He never betrayed a \n     confidence of mine or vice-versa. But at same time I \n     understood he had a job to do.\n       ``In my world, loyalty is the coin of the realm, and Otis \n     was loyal to me and I was loyal to him. That does not mean \n     there would not be criticism. But in the end, we remained \n     friends. He told me once that Johnny and I were the only ones \n     that understood completely what the press needs to do and has \n     to do.''\n       Smyrna Mayor Max Bacon said he understood the awkward \n     position Brumby would sometimes be in.\n       ``Being an editor and living here locally has got to be a \n     tough job.''\n       There were two sides to Otis Brumby--the one as the \n     publisher that the public saw, and the private one as a man \n     utterly devoted to his community, to his church, to various \n     other charities and, above all, to his family.\n       He is survived by his wife Martha Lee, daughters Spain \n     Gregory, Lee Garrett, Betsy Tarbutton, Anna Brumby and son \n     Otis Brumby III; 10 grandchildren; and his sister, Bebe \n     Brumby Leonard.\n       The late Mr. Brumby was a trustee of the University of \n     Georgia Foundation, the Arch Foundation of UGA and the \n     Kennesaw College Foundation. He represented the Seventh \n     Congressional District on the state Board of Transportation \n     from 1985-90. He endowed a professorship of First Amendment \n     Law for journalism and law students at UGA in 2004. He was \n     for decades an avid member of the Marietta Kiwanis Club, \n     serving as its president; and past president of numerous \n     professional organizations.\n       He remained an avid UGA football fan, and often remarked \n     that there was nothing like enjoying a game at Sanford \n     Stadium ``with 100,000 of your closest friends.''\n       He was a lifetime member of First United Methodist Church \n     of Marietta.\n       ``Otis was a faithful and generous churchman and he served \n     where he was needed, whether helping plan the church's future \n     or ushering and greeting newcomers on Sunday morning,'' said \n     the Rev. Sam Matthews, pastor. ``I witnessed profound \n     gestures of kindness and consideration from him, gestures \n     that most of us would be challenged to match.\n       Former Congressman Darden, a fellow member, noted Brumby's \n     steady giving to the church, and quoting the Book of Matthew, \n     said, ``For where your treasure is, there your heart will be \n     also.''\n       Former Georgia Supreme Court Justice Conley Ingram sat in \n     the pew just ahead of the Brumbys for years.\n       ``He did the smallest job to the greatest job at our \n     church,'' he said. ``He was a greeter at the door, or took up \n     collection, but you could always count on him to be there.\n       ``His life was one of love and dedication to his family and \n     his church and to the First Amendment and to UGA. He was a \n     great friend, and he never tried to take credit for the many \n     things he did for our community. He was a great family man \n     and a great church man and above all, a loyal friend. It's \n     not going to be the same without him.''\n       Many of those who shared their reminiscences for this story \n     remarked on the contrast between Brumby's towering \n     journalistic presence and his personal preference for staying \n     out of the spotlight.\n       ``For all his greatness, the greatest thing about him was \n     that he was so humble,'' Towery said. ``He could be tough in \n     the business place, but when he got out in public, he was \n     shy. You couldn't get him to talk about himself in front of \n     other people.''\n       Remembered Barnes, ``To have held the position of influence \n     he did in this community, he was one of the most humble guys \n     I've ever been around. He never overstated his influence or \n     importance.''\n       Brumby also was recalled by Barnes and others as a terrific \n     storyteller.\n       ``He had a lot of fun in him,'' he said. ``A lot of those \n     who didn't know him didn't realize what a great sense of \n     humor he had.''\n       Brumby's middle name, ``Anoldus,'' had been passed down \n     through the generations, and he joked to an editor this \n     summer in mock surprise that, ``I offered it to all my \n     children to use as a name for their children, and none of \n     them wanted it!''\n       And Brumby, whose hairstyle and sartorial choices were \n     nowhere close to ``cutting edge,'' could be self-deprecating, \n     too.\n       ``He used to jokingly call himself the Marietta Square,''' \n     Towery said. ``But he wasn't just the Marietta Square.' He \n     was Cobb County. And life without Otis Brumby is not going to \n     be as much fun.''\n       Added Isakson, ``I'm going to miss my friend Otis.''\n       A memorial service will be held Wednesday at 11 a.m. at the \n     First United Methodist Church of Marietta.\n       In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to First \n     United Methodist Church 56 Whitlock Avenue Marietta, GA 30064 \n     or the Georgia Press Educational Foundation 3066 Mercer \n     university drive Atlanta, GA 30341. Mayes Ward-Dobbins \n     Funeral Home in Marietta is in charge of arrangements.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, this is a poignant eulogy of many of the \naccomplishments of one of my best and personal friends, Otis Brumby, \nJr. I could read all of his accomplishments if I wanted to. There are \ntimes we are called on to offer eulogies on the floor of the Senate \nbecause we have to or because it is appropriate. There are times we \ngive eulogies for great past leaders of our State, but on rare \noccasions, such as the one I have today, we do it for someone for whom \nwe have tremendous respect, love, and compassion.\n  To Otis Brumby, Jr.'s wife Martha Lee, his daughters Anna, Betsy, \nLee, Spain, his son-in-law Heath, and his son Otis Brumby III, my love \nand compassion goes out to each of them during their tragedy.\n  Wednesday morning I will return to Marietta, GA, to be part of the \nmemorial service to honor Otis Brumby. I thought it would be better to \ntalk about the Otis Brumby I knew rather than the one the papers are \nwriting about. To me he was the epitome of a journalist, a father, a \nfriend, and a husband. Otis Brumby, Jr. got his start in some ways on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate because in the late 1950s his father \narranged for him to page for Richard B. Russell, who, as all of us \nknow, was really the master of the Senate before Lyndon Johnson when he \nwas leader, later Vice President, and finally President.\n  Otis Brumby learned a lot in this Chamber and on this floor. He has \ntold me what it was like before the cameras were here back in the good \nold days when there was camaraderie and friendship in the Senate. He \nalso told me about the difficult days of the civil rights era, and \nparticularly as a son of the South and what that meant to him.\n  He came back to Georgia. After graduating from high school, he went \nto the University of the South in Sewanee, and then earned a law degree \nfrom the University of Georgia. He then headed to his passion, the law, \nbut he didn't make it. Instead he made it to the Marietta Daily Journal \nas a cub reporter for his father's newspaper. At the age of 27 he was a \nfloor manager\n\n[[Page S6029]]\n\nand assistant publisher for the paper. He offered his expertise at a \nvery young age.\n  At the age of 29 he came up with a unique concept. He said people \nwould like to see their kids' pictures in the paper. They like to have \nstories about their sports victories. They like to have lots of \npictures and stories--but just to them--and not all the fodder that \nmight go with it. He started what became known as the Marietta Daily \nJournal and the Neighbor Newspaper Group. He created 27 neighborhood \nnewspapers and all 27 of them were weekly.\n  They were so successful that when Gannett decided it was going to try \nto do a national paper called USA Today, they sent a team of \ninvestigators for 7 days to the Marietta Daily Journal to investigate \ntheir template, the way they published their paper, their meat and \npotatoes. Quite frankly, a lot of credit for USA Today goes to the \nnewsroom at the Marietta Daily Journal and the brilliance of that young \n29-year-old reporter who later became a publisher of that newspaper.\n  Otis Brumby died last week of prostate cancer and the effects of \nprostate cancer. He suffered for 2 years, and that has been a tragedy. \nBut the tragedy for all of us is that he is gone; he has left a mark on \nour State, county, and community that can't be easily replaced.\n  Although he had an affinity for politics, he never served. When \ncalled on by Governors for appointments, he took them; first as State \nboard of education chairman and later as board of education chairman \nfor the Marietta public school system. A very wealthy man because of \nhis success and investments, Otis Brumby never sent his children to \nprivate schools that he could afford because he believed the public \nschools needed to be the best, and he thought he would send his \nchildren there as a role model. And he did. They all were superstars in \ntheir schools whether in academics or athletics. Their father Otis \nsupported those public school systems as a leader, a mentor, and a \nboard member.\n  To Marietta, GA, Otis Brumby was just about everything. He was its \nconscience, benefactor, and leader, and from time to time he was its \nprotagonist where he would promote discord and a lack of harmony in \norder to come up with the right decision.\n  I can tell my colleagues, as a politician, when he wrote about \nsomeone and they heard they were in the paper, the first thing they did \nwas grab the newspaper. In fact, there is a column he wrote called \n``Around Town'' that appeared every Saturday morning in the newspaper--\na pretty thin part of the paper, but it was a one-page discourse on \nwhat politicians in the county were up to. On Saturday morning every \npolitician in Marietta, GA, and Cobb County, GA, went to their mailbox \nand got their Marietta Daily Journal. They didn't want to see what the \nfootball score was; they wanted to see what Otis Brumby had said about \nthem during the previous week. He was the conscience of all the \npoliticians in the community. He was the leader in the community, and \nhe was the benefactor of the community. He made it a much better place.\n  Otis was not a Republican nor was he a Democrat. He was, if anything, \na populist, but he had a fiscally conservative bent to him. Unlike a \nlot who commentate on politics, Otis put his money where his mouth was. \nHe wrote checks to local politicians and to people in the U.S. Senate. \nThere wasn't a party bent to him, but there was always a fiscally \nconservative bent.\n  In fact, I will tell my colleagues when I first ran for office in \nCobb County in 1974, we didn't have any Republicans. I ran as a \nRepublican because I was a fiscal conservative. Everybody told me I was \ncrazy. They were right; I got beat. But Otis Brumby took an interest \nand wrote about the campaign and some of the things we talked about and \nsome of the things we tried to do. He propped me up long enough to get \na chance to stand on my own two legs. Sure, he would knock me down from \ntime to time--and some of those times I deserved it--but he gave me a \nchance. He gave everybody a chance. He was one of those journalists who \nwould comment on what someone did, but he gave them the strength to do \nwhat was right.\n  Wednesday morning I am going to the funeral of my dear friend. I miss \nhim already and will miss him more as the days go by. I love him and \nhis family for all they have done for me, my community, and my country. \nSo at one of those rare times when we come to the floor to eulogize, \nthis time for me it is personal but this time for America we have lost \na son, a journalist, a patriot, and I have lost a best friend.\n  May God bless Otis Brumby and his family, his grandchildren, and our \ncommunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have been listening to our colleague, \nthe Senator from Georgia, who is one of the real gentlemen of this \nbody. I listened to his warm words about his friend who has passed. \nSometimes what people say about others is a better reflection on them \nthan on who they are describing. In many ways, I thought that about \nwhat Senator Isakson was just saying because what he just said about \nhis friend, any one of us in the Senate could say about him because he \nis a gentleman.\n  I was very much moved by the words of my friend. We thank him for all \nhe does to make this a better place.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  I have come to the floor on different business, which is to talk \nabout the budget circumstance we are in and to try to answer the \nquestion we have heard asked in recent days: Are we better off now than \nwe were 4 years ago? I believe the answer to that question is very \nclear.\n  To answer the question we have to take ourselves back 4 years and \nremember the conditions we faced then. I will never forget as long as I \nlive being called to an urgent meeting in the Capitol late one evening \nin September 2008. I was the last one to arrive. There were assembled \nthe leaders of the House and the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, and the Secretary of the Treasury of \nthe Bush administration.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nquickly told us they were going to take over the giant insurer AIG the \nnext morning. They weren't there to ask our approval or seek our \nsupport; they were there to tell us what they were doing. They told us \nif they did not do it, they believed we would have a financial collapse \nwithin days.\n  This was September 2008. Barack Obama was not the President of the \nUnited States; George W. Bush was the President of the United States, \nand we were on the brink of financial collapse, according to the \ndescription of his own Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n  Let's remember what the economy was doing in the fourth quarter of \n2008. The economy was shrinking at a rate of over 8 percent. In fact, \nit was shrinking at a rate of almost 9 percent. In the first month of \n2009, the last month of the Bush administration, we lost 800,000 jobs \nin 1 month. So when people ask if we are better off today than we were \nthen, just as a factual matter there can be no dispute. We are \ndramatically better off today than we were 4 years ago.\n  Four years ago we were on the brink of financial collapse. Four years \nago the economy was shrinking at a rate of almost 9 percent, and we \nwere losing 800,000 jobs a month. Those are facts. They cannot be \ndisputed.\n  Today we are growing, not as fast as we would like; jobs are being \ncreated, not as fast as we would like, but that is a dramatic \nimprovement over 4 years ago. Let's remember the housing market was in \ncrisis. Home building and sales were plummeting. There were record \nforeclosures. The financial market crisis threatened global economic \ncollapse. That was 4 years ago. Anybody who wonders can go back and \nread the headlines. Those were grim days.\n  I also remember as though it were yesterday being part of the group \nwho was given a responsibility to negotiate the TARP--the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program. I remember being in this complex late on a \nSaturday night, again with the Secretary of the Treasury of the Bush \nadministration, and him telling us if we did not come up with a \nsolution by 5 o'clock Sunday night, the Asian markets would open and \nthey would collapse, and our markets would open the next day and they \nwould collapse.\n\n[[Page S6030]]\n\n  So when people ask if we are better off today than we were 4 years \nago, as a factual matter there really is no question--none. We are \ndramatically better off.\n  The other thing we should keep in mind is, what happens after a \nsevere financial crisis such as the one we faced 4 years ago? Dr. \nCarmen Reinhart, from the Peter Peterson Institute for International \nEconomics, and her husband, Dr. Vincent Reinhart of the American \nEnterprise Institute--which, by the way, is a pretty conservative \nplace--have done an analysis, and here is what they found: After a \nsevere financial crisis such as the one we suffered 4 years ago, \neconomic recoveries are shallower and take much longer.\n  Here is the quote from their analysis:\n\n       Real per capita GDP growth rates are significantly lower \n     during the decade following severe financial crises. In the \n     ten-year window following severe financial crises, \n     unemployment rates are significantly higher than in the \n     decade that preceded the crisis. . . .\n\n  That is what we had in 2008. Again, Barack Obama was not the \nPresident of the United States; George W. Bush was President of the \nUnited States, and we had a severe financial crisis. We were on the \nbrink of financial collapse. It takes a long time to dig out from a \ndisaster of that magnitude.\n  Two of the most distinguished economists in the country--one of whom, \nby the way, advised John McCain in his most recent Presidential race, \nand the other who is Deputy Chairman of the Federal Reserve--did an \nanalysis of what would have happened without the Federal response, what \nwould have happened in terms of jobs. Here is what they found: With a \nFederal response we got 8 million jobs we would not have had otherwise. \nIn other words, if there had been no Federal response, the red line is \nwhat would have happened to jobs. The green line is what happened as a \nresult of Federal action: 8 million fewer jobs lost than if there had \nbeen no Federal response.\n  Again, this is work that was done by Alan Blinder, former Vice \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, and Mark Zandi, who was one of the \neconomic advisers to John McCain in the last Presidential race.\n  So when we go back to this question, are we better off now than we \nwere 4 years ago, I think the answer is unequivocally, yes. We are \ndramatically better off than we were 4 years ago.\n  Now, those people who are still unemployed don't feel better off. I \nunderstand that. That is dreadful, that is painful, and it is painful \nin every way. Not only does it hurt in the pocketbook, but much more \nthan that: It hurts the way people feel about themselves. It hurts the \nway people feel about their role in their families. So we have lots of \nwork to do, but if we are going to be honest with people about \ncomparing where we are today and where we were 4 years ago, there \nreally can be no serious question about the answer to that question.\n  This chart shows the economy in the fourth quarter of 2008--that is \nthe last quarter of the Bush administration--was shrinking at a rate of \nalmost 9 percent. Now the economy is growing at a rate of 1.7 percent, \nfor the most recent quarter. Is that good? No. Would we like it to be \nstronger? Absolutely. But is this better than almost any other \ndeveloped country in the world? Yes. The Eurozone is in recession. \nTheir economies are shrinking. Japan is not doing as well as we are \ndoing.\n  So when we look around the world and compare ourselves, the answer by \ncomparison is we are doing remarkably well given the depth of the \nfinancial crisis we experienced.\n  Not only is it true in economic growth, it is true in terms of \nprivate sector jobs. Again, in the last month of the Bush \nadministration, this economy lost over 800,000 jobs--in 1 month. In the \nmost recent month in the United States, we gained 103,000 private \nsector jobs. That is a turnaround of over 900,000 jobs in a month. That \nis a dramatic improvement.\n\n  And if we look at the stock market, we can answer that question as \nwell. Are we better off now than we were 4 years ago? Well, this chart \nshows the stock market. In March of 2009, it hit its low of 6547--the \nlow during this period. Look where it is today. More than double what \nit was 4 years ago.\n  So, again, if we are seriously asking the question, Are we better off \nthan we were 4 years ago? In terms of economic growth? Yes. In terms of \njob creation? Yes. In terms of the stock market? Yes. In terms of \neconomic performance? Yes.\n  I have also heard my colleagues on the other side say at the \nconvention just concluded that there has been no budget here for 3 \nyears. Well, there has been no budget resolution. But there is a budget \nlaw that was passed called the Budget Control Act. And a law is much \nstronger than any resolution. A resolution is purely a congressional \ndocument. It never goes to the President for his signature. A law, \nobviously, has to go to the President for his signature.\n  So when they say there has been no budget passed, there has been no \nbudget resolution passed, but, instead, Congress passed the Budget \nControl Act. Look what it said in the Budget Control Act:\n\n       . . . the allocations, aggregates, and [spending] levels \n     set in subsection (b)(1) shall apply in the Senate in the \n     same manner as for a concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2012. . . .\n\n  That same language is repeated in the next paragraph:\n\n       . . . the allocations, aggregates, and levels set in \n     subsection (b)(2) shall apply in the Senate in the same \n     manner as for a concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2013. . . .\n\n  I say to you, a budget is a limitation on spending. The Budget \nControl Act contained very clear limitations on spending for 2012 and \n2013. So when our friends say there has been no budget passed by this \nbody, oh, yes, there has. There has been a budget passed for 2012, and \none for 2013. Instead of a resolution, it was done in a law.\n  What we do not have is a long-term plan, a 10-year plan. That is what \nwe need. But it is pretty clear both sides are not ready yet, and \nperhaps will not be until we have had this election, to sit down and \nagree to the kind of 10-year plan we so desperately need.\n  The Budget Control Act represented the largest deficit reduction \npackage in the history of the United States. How can that be? Well, \nbecause it contained $900 billion in discretionary savings over 10 \nyears, and it included the so-called sequester that we hear so much \nabout that added another $1.2 trillion of spending cuts over the next \n10 years, for a total of $2.1 trillion in spending cuts. That is the \nlargest deficit reduction package we have ever passed.\n  So, again, when people say there is no budget, there has been no \naction taken, it is not accurate. The Budget Control Act operates in \nthe same way as a budget resolution, and it is a law, not a resolution \nthat is purely a congressional document that never goes to the \nPresident. The Budget Control Act passed both Houses of Congress, went \nto the President for his signature, and cut $2.1 trillion in spending.\n  People may not like it. There are a lot of things I do not like about \nit--certainly the sequester. I think we ought to find alternative \nsavings for it. But the fact is, this is now law, and it cut $2.1 \ntrillion. That still leaves us with the problem that we are borrowing \n40 cents of every $1 we spend, and that cannot be permitted to \ncontinue.\n  So we have to add a package on top of the Budget Control Act. We have \nto do more. I would prefer, strongly, to do another at least $3 \ntrillion. I tried to convince the Bowles-Simpson Commission to do a \npackage of $5 trillion of deficit reduction. Actually, I tried to \npersuade them to do a package of $5.6 trillion of deficit reduction \nbecause we can balance the budget if we would do a package that large. \nThe people who were on that commission will tell you I tried repeatedly \nto convince my colleagues to go big, let's do a package that really \nbalanced the budget.\n  And we could do it. It is not that hard. I think people sometimes get \nit in their head this is some impossible task. I told them, let's talk \nabout a 6-percent solution. If we would do 6 percent more revenue than \ncurrent law provides and 6 percent less spending, we would save $6 \ntrillion over 10 years and balance the budget. I actually would argue \nfor more weighting on the spending cut side of the ledger than on the \nrevenue side. But I do this for illustrative purposes, to indicate we \ncannot do 6 percent? Come on. We cannot do 6 percent? Sure we can.\n  The occupant of the chair, the Governor of West Virginia in his \nprevious life in politics, I will tell you, he did not have any trouble \nmaking tough decisions, and I will bet you he reduced\n\n[[Page S6031]]\n\nspending a lot more than 6 percent. He survived. He is here. He is \nrespected.\n  We can do this. Hey, we have done much tougher things than this in \nthe past. I hope colleagues think about this carefully.\n  This next chart is so important because it looks at the spending and \nthe revenue lines of the Federal Government going back to 1950. This is \n60 years of our economic history on one little chart.\n  The red line is the spending line. The green line is the revenue \nline. And look what it shows. We got to, in 2010, an all-time high in \nspending for the last 60 years, taking out the effect of inflation, so \nyou have an even-steven comparison over that 60-year period. And we \nwere at a 60-year high in spending--not surprising given the dimensions \nof the financial crisis we faced. But at the same time, we were at a \n60-year low in revenue. When you have record spending and record low \nrevenue, you have record deficits and record additions to the debt. \nThat is exactly what was happening to us.\n  We have seen some improvement in the last few years. Spending is down \nas a share of GDP. Revenue is up a little bit. We still have a big \nchasm.\n  In the midst of all this comes Representative Ryan and his plan. I \nwould say to those who might be attracted to his plan: Be careful what \nyou wish for--be careful what you wish for--because, first of all, the \nRyan plan does not balance the budget, if ever, until 2040, and it only \nbalances in 2040 because of certain assumptions he told the \nCongressional Budget Office to make about his plan and the revenue \ncontained in it. I personally do not think it ever balances. I do not \nbelieve it ever balances. It is absolutely an unbalanced plan. All of \nthe deficit reduction is on the spending side. He actually digs the \nrevenue hole much deeper, extends all the Bush era tax cuts, and then \nadds hundreds of billions of dollars of more tax cuts, primarily to the \nmost fortunate among us.\n  There is $1 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthiest. He gives those \nwith an income of over $1 million an average tax cut of $265,000 a \nyear. Somebody is sitting out there saying: How is that possible? A \nperson earning $1 million a year probably does not pay much more than \n$265,000. How can they, on average, be getting a $265,000 tax cut? \nRemember, this is the average for everybody over $1 million, so this \nincludes people making $1 billion a year. And there are a fortunate few \nwho make $1 billion a year. So if you take everybody over $1 million, \nand you average the tax cut they get under the Ryan plan, it is over \n$265,000 a year.\n\n  He has $2.9 trillion in health care cuts. So first of all, he extends \nall the Bush era tax cuts. Then he adds hundreds of billions more of \ntax cuts for those who are the most fortunate. And to start to make up \nfor it, he has $2.9 trillion in health care cuts--not million, not \nbillion: trillion. He repeals health care reform. He shifts Medicare to \nvouchers. And he block-grants Medicaid and cuts Medicaid drastically.\n  Who benefits from Medicaid? Well, low-income people, disabled people, \nbut also a lot of middle-income people in this country benefit from \nMedicaid because their folks are in nursing homes and they have spent \ndown their assets, and the only way they can stay in the nursing home \nis that Medicaid picks up the tab. There are hundreds of thousands of \nfamilies in America, middle-class families, who have benefited from \nMedicaid because that is what has paid the nursing home bills for their \nrelatives--their mom, their dad, their grandpa, their grandma. That is \nthe truth.\n  The Ryan budget also dramatically cuts the safety net for seniors, \nthe children, the disabled. It increases the uninsured by more than 30 \nmillion people. It is going to increase the number of uninsured by 30 \nmillion. Well, if you are not uninsured, why should you care? I will \ntell you why you should care. Because if they are not paid for by \ninsurance, they are going to be paid for by all the rest of us. Because \nthe hard reality of how the health care system works in America is \nthis: If you are in a car accident and you do not have insurance and \nyou are taken to the hospital, you are treated. If you do not have \ninsurance to pay for it, and you do not have resources to pay for it, \nguess who pays for it. All the rest of us pay for it.\n  That is why it is absolutely in our interest to have as many people \ninsured as is possible. It is not just a nice thing to do; it is a \nsmart thing to do. Because one of the things we have found out is that \nabout a third of the people who do not have insurance can afford it. \nThey can afford it. They just choose not to have it because they know \nif something drastic happens to them, all the rest of us are going to \npay.\n  There are also large cuts in the Ryan budget for education, for \nenergy, for infrastructure--building roads, bridges, highways, and the \nrest. Those things undermine the engines of economic growth. So I do \nnot think that is the way to go.\n  When we look at the Ryan budget plan on revenue, here is what we \nfind. It provides $1 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthiest among us. \nIt gives millionaires an average tax cut of more than $265,000 a year. \nIt does not contribute one dime of revenue to deficit reduction. And \nthe revenues reach 18.7 percent of GDP by 2022. Now why does that \nmatter? Because the last four times we have balanced, the revenue of \nthe country has been 19.6 percent, 19.7 percent, 19.8 percent, 20.6 \npercent. So, hey, if we are going to be serious about belling this cat, \nwe are going to have to cut spending, we are going to have to reform \nthe entitlements, we are also going to have to raise some revenue, \nhopefully not in a way that hurts economic growth, because we think we \nhave found ways of doing it.\n  But the Ryan tax plan, I have to say, I do not think adds up. Why \ndon't I believe it adds up? Well, let's look at what he proposes.\n  First of all, he says we should reduce individual tax rates to just \ntwo--one at 10 percent and one at 25 percent. Right now, the top rate \nis 35 percent. If you reduce that rate to 25 percent, and you have only \none other rate of 10 percent, that package costs $2.5 trillion over the \nnext 10 years. So instead of filling in the hole, you are digging the \nhole deeper. Then he puts the top corporate rate at 25 percent. Again, \nthat is a significant reduction from the top corporate rate today. That \ncosts another $1 trillion. Then he repeals the alternative minimum tax. \nThat costs another $670 billion. Then he repeals all the tax levies in \nthe health care reform. That costs another $350 billion. Then he allows \nthe stimulus provisions to expire from the Recovery Act, which raises \n$210 billion.\n  Before he starts filling in the hole, he has dug the hole deeper by \nalmost $4\\1/2\\ trillion, and he says he is going to offset all of that \nwith individual base broadening and corporate base broadening. We are \nspending about $1.2 trillion a year in tax expenditures. Over 10 years \nthat is about $15 trillion with inflation.\n  So we could come up with this $4\\1/2\\ trillion, but what would we \nhave to do in order to do it? Almost every objective observer has said \nwe would have to raise taxes on the middle class--because he says this \nis going to be somehow, in the Romney plan, revenue neutral. I do not \nknow that the Ryan plan ever claimed to be revenue neutral. But if we \nare going to pay for this, how are we going to do it, which of the \nexemptions and the exclusions? Are we going to reduce the mortgage \ninterest exemption? Are we going to reduce the health care tax \nexclusion? Because those two affect middle-class people. Let's be \nhonest. Let's be straight. So there is no way Congressman Ryan's plan \ndoes all the things he claims for it without raising taxes on the \nmiddle class.\n  When he gets to a revenue level of 18.7 percent and says that is the \nhistoric average, that is true. The problem with that is we have never \nbalanced the budget, going back to 1969, with that amount of revenue. \nThe five times we have balanced since 1969--that is 43 years ago--\nrevenues have been at 19.7, 19.9, 19.8, 20.6, 19.5. So just getting \nback to the historic average, I do not think it is going to be enough. \nIf we are looking at what it has taken to actually balance the budget \nin our history, we can see we have to be very close to 20 percent.\n  By the way, these levels of revenue were before the baby boom \ngeneration, and the baby boom generation, that is not a forecast. That \nis not a prediction. Those people have been born. They are alive today. \nThey are going to be eligible for Social Security and Medicare. If\n\n[[Page S6032]]\n\nwe are going to be honest with ourselves, honest with the American \npeople, I do not think what Congressman Ryan is talking about adds up.\n  If we look at his budget on health care, we see $2.9 trillion in \nhealth care cuts. As I indicated, he repeals health care reform. I hear \na lot--I hear it in my State: Let's repeal health care reform. Why not? \nBecause the Congressional Budget Office tells us if we repeal it we add \nover $1 trillion to the debt. We add over $1 trillion to the debt, we \ndeny coverage to 30 million people who would otherwise have it.\n  His plan also ends the effort to promote quality over quantity of \ncare, reopens the prescription drug doughnut hole that raises costs to \nseniors by $4,200, allows insurance companies to drop coverage when we \nget sick. It ends the provision allowing young adults to stay on their \nparents' plan until the age of 26. It shifts Medicare to vouchers in \n2023 and includes, after that, an aggressive cap on payments that most \nanalysts have said would dramatically increase what Medicare \nbeneficiaries would have to pay for their own health care.\n  Currently, Medicare pays 75 percent of the cost. The beneficiary pays \n25 percent. If the Ryan plan were adopted, the original Ryan plan--he \nhas subsequently put out other plans. But his original plan would have \nstood that on its head. He would have Medicare beneficiaries paying the \nsubstantial majority of the cost. Instead of Medicare beneficiaries \npaying 25 percent, he would have them paying 68 percent of the cost--\nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  I have a brother who is gravely ill in the hospital, Medicare \neligible. I can tell you, he is getting phenomenal care--very costly. I \nwould say it would break our family. If we had to pay 68 percent of the \ncost instead of 25 percent, it would break our family. We are a middle-\nclass family. I am talking about the extended family.\n  These things have real consequences. Anybody who thinks these are \njust political statements and they do not affect people's lives, oh, \nyes, they do. They have a profound effect on people's lives.\n  The Ryan plan block grants Medicaid, shifts the cost to seniors, \nchildren, disabled, and States. I do not think that is the path America \nhas in mind. I like Paul Ryan. I agree with him that we are on an \nunsustainable course. I was on the Bowles-Simpson Commission with him.\n  But unlike him, I was one of the 11 who supported the recommendations \nof Bowles-Simpson. Of the 11 of us who did, 5 are Democrats, 5 \nRepublicans, and 1 Independent. That is about as bipartisan as we can \nget. There were 18 Commissioners. We had to get 14 to get the \nrecommendations to a vote in the Congress. We got 11.\n  That is 60 percent of the membership who voted yes; five Democrats, \nfive Republicans, one Independent. Paul Ryan was part of Bowles-\nSimpson. He voted no because it was not just the way he wanted it. It \nwas not just the way I wanted it either. I hated things on almost every \npage of that report. But as I told my staff, the only thing worse than \nbeing for it would be being against it because it would have gotten us \nback on track. It would have lowered our deficit and debt by $4 \ntrillion and have done it with revenue and spending cuts and reform of \nentitlements, maybe not as much on any one of those areas as I would \ndo, but it would have made a profound difference in the economic future \nof this country.\n  Perhaps the most striking thing to me in all the speeches at the \nRepublican convention was the claim by Congressman Ryan and the attack \non President Obama for supporting $716 billion in Medicare savings. Why \nwas I so taken aback by that? Because I have read Congressman Ryan's \nown budget. His budget has precisely that same level of Medicare \nsavings that he now politically attacks President Barack Obama for \nsupporting.\n  Did you see what former President Clinton said? He said that takes \nreal brass, to attack somebody for something you have done. Congressman \nRyan, when you give a speech, make your speech before tens of millions \nof people listening and you attack the President for supporting $716 \nbillion in Medicare savings and you have the exact same savings in your \nbudget, shame on you. Shame on you.\n  The Catholic bishops reviewed the Ryan budget. Here is what they \nsaid. They said it fails the moral test. These are Catholic bishops in \nAmerica. Look, they have issues with the President too. I understand \nthat, but this is what they said about the Ryan budget. They said: It \nfails the moral test. The Nation's Catholic bishops reiterated their \ndemand that the Federal budget protect the poor and said the GOP \nmeasure fails to meet these moral criteria. I think they got that \nright. Here is what a former Reagan economic adviser said about the \nRyan budget. This is Bruce Bartlett, former Reagan administration \neconomic adviser. This is what he said about the Ryan budget. Again, \nthis is a former President Reagan economic adviser. Here is what he \nsaid about the Ryan budget:\n\n       Distributionally, the Ryan plan is a monstrosity. The rich \n     would receive huge tax cuts while the social safety net would \n     be shredded to pay for them. Even as an opening bid to begin \n     budget negotiations with the Democrats, the Ryan plan cannot \n     be taken seriously. It is less of a wish list than a fairy \n     tale utterly disconnected from the real world, backed up by \n     make-believe numbers and unreasonable assumptions. Ryan's \n     plan isn't even an act of courage; it's just pandering to the \n     Tea Party. A real act of courage would have been for him to \n     admit, as all serious budget analysts know, that revenues \n     will have to rise well above 19 percent of GDP to stabilize \n     the debt.\n\n  Mr. Bartlett, I do not know the man. He is telling the truth. He is \ntelling the truth, as painful as it is. He is telling the truth. When \nwe go to the question of are we better off than we were 4 years ago, \nlet's remember where we were 4 years ago. We were on the brink of \nfinancial collapse.\n  Republican policies led the United States to the brink of financial \ncollapse. They cannot rewrite history. We know what happened. We tried \ntheir experiment. It did not work. Now things have improved, not as \nmuch as we would like, and there is much more work to be done. But I \ntrust in the judgment of the American people. I do not think they have \nforgotten. I certainly have not forgotten. I will never forget where \ntheir policies took us in the fall of 2008. We were on the brink of \nfinancial collapse. Let's not repeat that failed experiment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will now observe a moment of \nsilence for the 40th anniversary of the Munich Olympics massacre.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I stand here today with my colleagues \nto observe 1 minute of silence on the first day of session since the \npassage of the 40th anniversary of the 1972 Munich Olympic terrorist \nattack that killed 11 athletes and coaches from the Israeli Olympic \nteam.\n  Prior to the extraordinary summer games in London, where so many of \nour athletes excelled and made our country so proud, the Senate passed \na bipartisan resolution that I authored with Senator Rubio. With this \nresolution, which was supported by more than 30 of our colleagues, the \nSenate called on the International Olympic Committee to hold a moment \nof silence in London to honor these 11 slain Israeli Olympians. It is \nregrettable they chose not to. Today, here in the Senate, we right that \nwrong. The Munich tragedy was an outrageous attack against innocent \nathletes and against the unifying spirit of the Olympics. Observing a \nmoment of silence at the 2012 Olympic games' opening ceremony, when the \nworld's attention was focused on this symbol of international \ncooperation and peace, would have sent such a powerful message of unity \nin our fight against terrorism.\n  On September 5, 1972, a Palestinian terrorist group called Black \nSeptember broke into the Munich Olympic Village, killed an Israeli \nathlete and coach, and took nine other athletes and coaches hostage. A \nGerman police\n\n[[Page S6033]]\n\nofficer was killed and nine hostages were murdered during a rescue \nattempt.\n  In observing this minute of silence, as in our resolution, we \ncommemorate the 40th anniversary of the 1972 Munich Olympic terrorist \nattack, remember those who lost their lives, and reject and repudiate \nterrorism as antithetical to the Olympic goal of peaceful competition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New York \nand my colleague, Senator Rubio of Florida, for calling this historic \ntragedy to our attention on the sad 40th anniversary of the killing of \nthe Israeli participants at the Munich Olympics.\n  Having just witnessed, as the Senator from New York noted, the \nspectacular Olympics that were staged in London and realizing how the \nOlympics started as a way to transcend national differences and to \ncreate an Olympic global spirit, what happened in Munich was especially \nheartbreaking. We followed it in those early days of television as it \nwas being reported on by some of the sports announcers who were \nactually at the Olympics. It was hard to believe, as hostages were \nbeing taken, that they would all be killed when it was over.\n  I sincerely hope we in the world will learn a lesson from this \ntragedy--a lesson that violence begets violence and we need to end this \nsort of terrorist activity and stand together in that Olympic global \nspirit.\n  Again, my thanks to Senators Gillibrand and Rubio for their efforts \nto make this part of the London Olympics but also to make certain this \nday has not been forgotten here on the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Gillibrand for \nbringing this to the attention of the Senate and the American people \nand to thank Senators Rubio and Durbin for being here.\n  It is hard to believe it has been 40 years since that tragic event in \nwhich terrorists had the attention of the world during the Olympics in \nMunich.\n  It is hard to believe that over the last 40 years we have experienced \nso much of the violence from extremists and terrorists.\n  Tomorrow we will commemorate the 11th anniversary of the attack on \nour own country. We recognize the only way we could stand up for this \ntype of extremism is to never forget and to rededicate ourselves to do \neverything we can to root out extremists, to root out terrorists, and \nto never forget the consequences of their actions.\n  I wish to thank Senator Gillibrand and Senator Rubio for the \nresolution we passed in this Congress to let those who were victimized \n40 years ago know we will not forget them and that we continue to \ndedicate our efforts to root out this type of hatred and this type of \nextremism to make sure the Olympic spirit--which is world competition \nto bring peace in the world--is alive and well in the Senate and the \nUnited States of America. We will continue to commemorate what happened \nso we don't forget and dedicate ourselves to a more peaceful world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND.

Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are beginning about 3 minutes late. I \nask unanimous consent that the time be divided in such a way that the \nvote still starts at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. When the Senate recessed more than a month ago, 22 \njudicial nominees to fill vacancies in courtrooms around the country \nwere left pending, awaiting a Senate vote. Today, Senate Republicans \nhave agreed to vote on just one of those nominees. I want to commend \nSenator Harkin for working with Senator Grassley and the Majority \nLeader to get this vote on the nomination of Stephanie Rose of Iowa. I \nurge votes on the other nominees, as well, without further delay.\n  There are currently 78 Federal judicial vacancies. Judicial vacancies \nduring the last few years have been at historically high levels and \nhave remained near or above 80 for nearly the entire first term of the \nPresident. Nearly one out of every 11 Federal judgeships is currently \nvacant. Vacancies on the Federal courts are more than two and one half \ntimes as many as they were on this date during the first term of \nPresident Bush. One key reason for these numerous vacancies and for the \nextensive backlog of nominees is that Senate Republicans allowed votes \non just one district court nominee per week for the last seven weeks \nbefore the August recess. This unnecessarily slow pace of consideration \nof judicial nominees has disserved the American people and should not \ncontinue.\n  The across-the-board obstruction and foot dragging from Senate \nRepublicans since day one of President Obama's tenure means that we are \nlikely to complete his first term with more judicial vacancies than \nwhen he took office. The partisan obstruction from Senate Republicans \nhas been particularly damaging with respect to Federal trial courts. In \na sharp departure from the past, Senate Republicans have stalled Senate \napproval of district court nominees, including those Republican home \nstate Senators support.\n  Before the American people elected Barack Obama as our President, \ndistrict court nominees were generally confirmed within a couple of \nweeks of being reported by the Judiciary Committee. This was true of \nthose nominated by Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. \nDeference was traditionally afforded to home State Senators and \ndistrict court nominees supported by home State Senators were almost \nalways confirmed unanimously. During the 18 months that I was chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee in 2001 and 2002, we confirmed 83 of \nPresident Bush's district court nominees, and only one of them received \nany votes in opposition. Even though some Senate Democrats opposed the \nnominee, we nevertheless scheduled a vote for him just 11 days after he \nwas reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Indeed, only five district court nominees received any votes in \nopposition in all 8 years of the previous Republican presidency, and \nnone was a party-line vote. Among those nominees was one so extreme \nthat he had announced that ``concern for rape victims is a red herring \nbecause conceptions from rape occur with approximately the same \nfrequency as snowfall in Miami.'' That observation was much like the \noutrageous recent comments about rape by a Republican House member and \nSenate candidate.\n  In all, the Senate confirmed 264 of President Bush's district court \nnominees, and only five of them received any votes in opposition. \nSenate Democrats were willing to work with a very conservative \nRepublican President to fill vacancies on our Federal trial courts. We \nrecognized that filling vacancies on district courts is essential to \nensuring that the American people have functioning courts to serve them \nand provide access to justice. We know that it is unacceptable for \nhardworking Americans who turn to their courts for justice to suffer \nunnecessary delays. When an injured plaintiff sues to help cover the \ncost of his or her medical expenses, that plaintiff should not have to \nwait 3 years before a judge hears the\n\n[[Page S6034]]\n\ncase. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they \nshould not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.\n  In The Atlantic Andrew Cohen has written recently about the ``Human \nCosts of Judicial Confirmation Delays.'' In that article, the Chief \nJudge of the Middle District of Pennsylvania describes the costs of \nvacancies on individuals in Pennsylvania and the pervasive and harmful \ndelays they are suffering because there are not enough judges.\n  At this point in President Bush's first term, Senate Democrats had \nworked with Republicans to confirm 165 of his district court nominees. \nDespite the fact that President Obama has worked with home state \nSenators of both parties to select moderate, superbly-qualified \njudicial nominees, Senate Republicans have engaged in unprecedented \nobstruction of Federal trial court nominees for the last four years.\n  As Carl Tobias noted last month in a letter to the New York Times:\n\n       Republican senators have created and applied practices that \n     substantially depart from procedures employed in prior \n     administrations, even as recently as that of President George \n     W. Bush. The most important change is the refusal by the \n     G.O.P. leadership to enter voting agreements on well-\n     qualified, uncontroversial district court nominees, so they \n     languish for months on the Senate floor.\n\n  Professor Tobias is correct, and the result is that at this point in \nhis first term President Obama's district court nominees have had to \nwait nearly three times longer for a Senate vote and the Senate has \nconfirmed more than three dozen fewer.\n  Senate Republicans have made a habit of delaying and opposing \nPresident Obama's district court nominees, voting against more than a \nquarter of them--36 out of 127 to be precise. And they stall \nconfirmations for months of noncontroversial nominees including those \nsupported by home state Republican Senators who are eventually \nconfirmed overwhelmingly.\n  This extreme partisanship has not just resulted in persistently high \nvacancies--Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy recently observed that \nit is also ``bad for the legal system'' as a whole. He indicated: ``It \nmakes the judiciary look politicized when it is not, and it has to \nstop.'' District courts in particular should not be politicized. The 18 \ndistrict court nominees currently pending before the Senate were not \nchosen based on some ideological litmus test. They were selected for \ntheir legal excellence, whether as practicing attorneys or sitting \njudges.\n  Recently, the Republican Senator from Pennsylvania signaled his \nnewfound willingness to abandon the unprecedented delays and \nobstruction that his caucus has employed against President Obama's \ntrial court nominees. I only wish he had done so 2 years ago. What \nSenate Republicans have been doing is wrong and hurts all Americans \nseeking justice in our Federal courts.\n  Today, the Senate will vote on the nomination of Stephanie Rose to \nfill a judicial vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Iowa. She was rated unanimously well qualified by the ABA \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the highest possible \nrating. She has the bipartisan support of her home state Senators. I \nworked with Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley to ensure prompt \nJudiciary Committee consideration of her nomination, which was reported \nwith a virtually unanimous voice vote by the Judiciary Committee nearly \nfive months ago. The only objection came as a protest on another issue \nby Senator Lee.\n  Stephanie Rose currently serves as the first woman U.S. Attorney for \nthe Northern District of Iowa, where she has been serving since 2009. \nMs. Rose has devoted her entire career to public service, having served \nfor 15 years as a Federal prosecutor and having been promoted to Deputy \nCriminal Chief in 2008. In her tenure as a Federal prosecutor, she has \ntried 33 cases to verdict. When confirmed, she will be the first woman \nto serve as a Federal judge in the Southern District of Iowa and only \nthe second woman to serve on the Federal bench in Iowa's history.\n  With the elections approaching, the Senate will recess, again, in \njust a few weeks. When the Senate recessed in 2009, 10 judicial \nnominees were left without a final confirmation vote. When the Senate \nrecessed in 2010, 19 judicial nominees were left pending without a \nfinal confirmation vote. When the Senate recessed last year, in 2011, \n19 judicial nominees were left pending without a final vote. I urge \nSenate Republicans not to continue their practice of stalling qualified \nnominees from confirmation. I urge them to agree to schedule debate and \nvotes on the 18 district court nominees from California, Connecticut, \nFlorida, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania \nand Utah who, like Stephanie Rose, could be confirmed with strong \nbipartisan support and without further delay. A dozen of those nominees \nwould fill judicial emergency vacancies.\n  Let us act on these nominations. There is no doubt that recent \nprecedent shows we can do this even in September of a Presidential \nelection year. In 2008, the final year of President Bush's presidency, \nSenate Democrats were willing to confirm 10 of his district court \nnominees in a single day, all by unanimous consent. It took only a few \nseconds. Earlier in that Republican presidency, and again with a \nDemocratic Majority, the Senate confirmed 18 judicial nominees in just \none day and vacancies went down to 60 throughout the country, on the \nway down to 28. If we confirm all of the district nominees ready for \nfinal Senate action today, we can similarly reduce vacancies back down \nto 60.\n  I hope that Senate Republicans will not extend their wrongheaded \napplication of the ``Thurmond Rule'' and further stall confirmation of \nconsensus, well-qualified district court nominees. Given our \noverburdened Federal courts and the need to provide all Americans with \nprompt justice, the Senate should be working in a bipartisan fashion to \nconfirm these nominees without further delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article to which I referred be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          [From the Atlantic]\n\n    In Pennsylvania, the Human Costs of Judicial Confirmation Delays\n\n                           (By Andrew Cohen)\n\n       The William J. Nealon courthouse in Scranton, Pennsylvania. \n     (Wikimedia Commons) Daniel Wasserman had seen enough. An \n     Orthodox rabbi affiliated with Shaare Torah Synagogue in a \n     suburb of Pittsburgh, Wasserman had grown tired of state \n     interference with Jewish funeral rituals, ancient and \n     eternal, which require burial within 24 hours and which \n     prohibit embalming. He resented the threats of fines and \n     penalties he was receiving from state officials trying to \n     enforce a 19th-century funeral director's law. He believed he \n     was being singled out for the practice of his religious \n     beliefs.\n       And so Rabbi Wasserman did what many people do in America \n     when they believe their constitutional rights--their First \n     Amendment rights, their rights to religious freedom--are \n     being infringed by state action. He sued the state. On August \n     6th, in federal district court in Scranton, in the Middle \n     District of Pennsylvania, Rabbi Wasserman's lawyers sought an \n     injunction to preclude state officials from continuing to \n     threaten him for what he considers to be the lawful exercise \n     of his religious beliefs. The lawsuit, his attorneys allege, \n     is designed to: preserve and restore the historical right of \n     clergy to conduct religious burial and funeral rites free \n     from interference and harassment by the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania and professional, secular funeral directors who \n     serve no health or safety interest.\n       But justice won't come quickly for Rabbi Wasserman--if it \n     comes at all. There simply aren't enough federal judges in \n     the Middle District of Pennsylvania to handle his case. U.S. \n     District Judge John Jones, the well-regarded jurist to whom \n     the Rabbi's case was assigned, couldn't get the urgent \n     injunction hearing onto his schedule until late September. \n     The timing didn't discourage the Rabbi but it clearly \n     frustrated the judge. ``Obviously when you receive something \n     like this you have to move with some alacrity,'' Judge Jones \n     told me late last month. ``But you can only land so many \n     planes in one hour.''\n\n\n                              the district\n\n       Boundary-wise, the Middle District of Pennsylvania is the \n     largest federal judicial district in the state. It covers the \n     state capital of Harrisburg, which means it is the chief \n     venue for litigation against the state of Pennsylvania. It \n     comprises no fewer than 32 counties, up and down the center \n     of the state, from Adams County to York County, from the \n     state's northern border to New York to its southern border \n     with Maryland, the Mason-Dixon line. There are four \n     courthouses in the district, including one in Williamsport, \n     which is several hours drive away from either Harrisburg or \n     Scranton.\n\n[[Page S6035]]\n\n       All of this volume and distance would be manageable if the \n     Middle District were fully staffed with federal trial judges. \n     It is not--and it hasn't been for years. ``We are down a \n     third of our active court,'' Judge Jones says. In March 2009, \n     the first vacancy in the Middle District was created when \n     Judge Richard Caputo (more on him later) took senior status. \n     Another vacancy was created in April 2010, when the Senate \n     confirmed the appellate nomination of U.S. District Judge \n     Thomas I. Vanaskie. Two long years later, just this past May, \n     President Obama nominated two men to fill those posts.\n       Both Middle District nominees--Malachy E. Mannion and \n     Matthew W. Brann--were quickly endorsed by the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee by voice vote, which means there were no \n     substantive objections raised by Republican members of that \n     Committee. Both nominees also have the support of the state's \n     two senators, Democrat Bob Casey and Republican Pat Toomey, \n     who have publicly lobbied their Republican colleagues this \n     year to allow the nominations to come to a vote on the Senate \n     floor. So far, those efforts have failed. But the Senate is \n     expected to take up new judicial nominations in the next week \n     or so.\n\n\n                               the judges\n\n       While the Senate fiddles, what's life like for the current \n     judges of the Middle District? Very difficult. Judges \n     frequently have to drive three hours or more a day to handle \n     cases in Williamsport. The aforementioned Judge Caputo, who \n     is in his early 70s, carries the most cases of any of the \n     judges--more than 500 civil and criminal combined--despite \n     his senior status. ``He's hanging in because he feels like he \n     is letting the court down if it doesn't,'' Judge Jones says \n     of his colleague. ``Because of the judge he is he won't \n     relent.'' But compared to some of his other colleagues in the \n     Middle District, however, Judge Caputo is practically a kid.\n       Sitting in senior status, picking up the slack for the \n     empty full-time benches, are Judge Edwin M. Kosic, Judge \n     William J. Nealon, Judge Richard P. Conaboy and Judge William \n     W. Caldwell--all of these men are at least 86 years old. Two \n     other Middle District Judges in senior status--Judge Sylvia \n     H. Rambo and Judge James M. Munley--are both over 76 years \n     old. ``All have a substantial case load,'' Judge Jones says, \n     ``but we've created this absurdity where we are leaning on \n     aging'' and perhaps frail senior judges. Judge Nealon, for \n     example, a remarkable jurist by any standard, has more than \n     150 cases--at age 89.\n       The Middle District today is so understaffed, its current \n     judges so overwhelmed by their relentless workload, that the \n     Chief Judge of the 3rd U.S. Circuit, the federal appeals \n     panel which covers Pennsylvania and other mid-Atlantic \n     states, has authorized trial judges from the Eastern District \n     of Pennsylvania to cross over and help their colleagues in \n     the Middle District. But it's not like the Eastern District \n     has it much better. There are now six judicial vacancies \n     there (five judges have in the past few years taken senior \n     status). President Obama has yet nominated no one--no one--to \n     replace those Eastern District trial judges.\n\n\n                              the problem\n\n       Washington talks ceaselessly about the slow pace of \n     judicial nominations. But few advocates are able to cite \n     specific examples of what judicial vacancies mean for the \n     American people, for litigants like Rabbi Wasserman, who look \n     to the courts to resolve disputes. Part of the reason for \n     this is prudence--current litigants I spoke with for this \n     article were reluctant to publicly complain about how long it \n     is taking their federal civil cases to be resolved. No one \n     wants to tick off their judge. But that doesn't mean such \n     delays aren't real--and pervasive. I ended up asking a \n     federal judge himself to detail the cost of judicial \n     vacancies.\n       ``Inevitably, what it leads to is extra time to decide \n     almost any motion that is filed,'' Judge Jones told me. `` . \n     . . [T]he federal courts are stacked up with motions to \n     dismiss and motions for summary judgment which are very fact \n     specific and require a great deal of time. When you have \n     fewer judges, and the judges who are in service have more \n     motions, everything is delayed.'' The judge calls it the \n     ``justice delayed syndrome'' and it impacts individuals like \n     the rabbi as well as large corporations who must factor into \n     their business plans the ``uncertainty'' inherent in long, \n     drawn-out litigation.\n       Rebecca Kourlis, a former justice of the Colorado Supreme \n     Court and now executive director of the Institute for the \n     Advancement of the American Legal System, is even more blunt. \n     ``Vacancies in the judiciary create holes in the judicial \n     system,'' Kourlis told me last week, ``and civil cases are \n     the most likely to fall through those holes. What this means \n     is that civil cases suffer increased continuances and delays \n     and the possibilities of changing judges in mid-stream. For \n     civil litigants, this means untenable disruptions to their \n     lives and businesses, the possibility of increased costs, and \n     overall, a breach of the promise of access to justice.''\n\n\n                              the politics\n\n       For this piece, I picked the ``judicial emergency'' in the \n     Middle District of Pennsylvania to make a point. Although I \n     have been a strident critic (see accompanying box) of the \n     Republican use of the Senate filibuster to keep bipartisan-\n     approved nominees off the bench, there is no denying that the \n     Obama Administration has in many cases made a bad situation \n     worse by failing to quickly nominate judges when vacancies \n     occur. There is simply no excuse, for example, for the length \n     of time it took the White House to appoint Mannion and Brann \n     to help fill the void in the Middle District. None.\n       Sen. Toomey, the Pennsylvania Republican, refused comment \n     for this story. His Democratic counterpart, Sen. Bob Casey, \n     would say only that both sides ``need to come together to \n     fill these critical positions'' and that ``the real-life \n     consequences of delay are unacceptable.'' Both men, it is \n     fair to say, don't want to say anything publicly to tick off \n     the Republican leadership in the Senate, leadership which \n     already has announced to the world that it intends to confirm \n     no more of President Obama's federal appellate nominees by \n     invoking what's become known as the ``Thurmond Rule.''\n       The story of the Middle District is one of basic \n     governance. It's about the executive branch and the \n     legislative branch failing to perform its constitutional \n     function of ensuring a viable judicial branch. It's about \n     politicians in Washington failing or refusing to provide to \n     the American people--in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, \n     for example--one of the most elemental services a government \n     can provide to the governed--functioning courts of law. It's \n     a disgrace that those old judges in Pennsylvania have to work \n     like that. It's even more of a disgrace that Congress and the \n     White House can't timely agree on their replacements.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nIowa. I reserve the balance of my time and ask it be under the control \nof Senator Harkin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Leahy, for his courtesies.\n  I rise in support of the nomination of Stephanie Marie Rose to be \nU.S. district judge for the Southern District of Iowa. In addition, she \nhas the support of Senator Harkin and is well regarded throughout my \nhome State of Iowa. She was reported out of our committee on voice \nvote. She was previously confirmed by this Senate for her current \nposition, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Iowa.\n  Ms. Rose is a Hawkeye through and through, receiving two degrees from \nthe University of Iowa--her B.A. in 1994 and her J.D. in 1996. \nObviously, Ms. Rose was on the fast track through law school.\n  After graduation from law school, she wisely chose to remain in \nIowa--and Iowa is fortunate for that decision. She first served as a \nlaw clerk in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of \nIowa. In 1997, she was hired as a full-time attorney in that same \noffice, where she has risen through the ranks and now heads that \noffice.\n  She served as a special assistant U.S. attorney from 1997 to 1999 and \nas an assistant U.S. attorney from 1999 to 2009. During this time, she \nwas lead counsel in the prosecution of more than 250 cases. These cases \nspanned a wide range of legal issues from violent crimes and drug \noffense to immigration violations and money laundering. Additionally, \nshe has handled approximately 45 Federal civil cases. These cases have \nincluded postconviction relief and asset forfeiture matters, as well as \nFreedom of Information Act and property return lawsuits.\n  In 2009, Ms. Rose was nominated by the President and then confirmed \nby the Senate to serve as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District \nof Iowa. In this role, she oversees most every aspect of the office. \nThis includes overseeing the civil and criminal work completed by \noffice staff and making final determinations regarding charging \ndecisions, plea offers, and civil settlements.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary unanimously rated Ms. Rose as ``well qualified'' for this \nposition of district judge.\n  In addition, she is supported by the legal community and judges \nthroughout our State. Newspaper articles published in the Cedar Rapids \nGazette on February 2 and February 20, 2012, captured some of that \nsupport.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record these two \narticles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Gazette, Feb. 2, 2012]\n\n                     Rose Picked for Federal Bench\n\n                          (by Trish Mehaffey)\n\n       Cedar Rapids.--President Barack Obama nominated U.S. \n     Attorney Stephanie Rose late Thursday as the next federal \n     judge in the Southern District of Iowa.\n\n[[Page S6036]]\n\n       Rose, of Center Point, said she received the call from Sen. \n     Tom Harkin in late afternoon and then got the news release \n     from the White House.\n       ``This has been a really involved process and I'm honored \n     to be selected, especially with the other talented women that \n     were also nominated,'' she said last night. ``If the Senate \n     confirms me, I will be happy to serve and look forward to the \n     diversity of the Southern District and the new \n     opportunities.''\n       Obama said Rose and Michael Shea, whom he nominated \n     Thursday as a federal judge in Connecticut, have \n     ``demonstrated the talent, expertise, and fair-mindedness \n     Americans expect and deserve from their judicial system. I am \n     grateful for their willingness to serve and confident that \n     they will apply the law with the utmost impartiality and \n     integrity.''\n       In a news release, Harkin, D-Iowa, said Rose is a ``superb \n     attorney and among jurists, prosecutors and the defense bar \n     has a reputation as an extremely fair and ethical prosecutor \n     who possesses great legal ability, intellect, and judgment.''\n       ``There is no question in my mind that Stephanie Rose would \n     be an outstanding federal judge,'' he continued. ``. . . I \n     urge my Senate colleagues to confirm her for this important \n     position as quickly as possible.''\n       Rose served 12 years as an assistant U.S. attorney before \n     being appointed the top prosecutor in 2009. She will be the \n     first woman to serve as a federal judge in the Southern \n     District and only the second woman to serve on the federal \n     bench in Iowa's history.\n       Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Teig, who retired last \n     year after 31 years, said Thursday that Rose will make an \n     ``excellent'' federal judge.\n       ``She has experience in the courtroom and as an \n     administrator,'' Teig said. ``She has a broad view of the \n     federal legal system and she's very intelligent. Stephanie \n     will make a great additional to the federal bench.''\n       Teig worked with Rose throughout her career with the U.S. \n     Attorney's Office.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the Gazette, Feb. 20, 2012]\n\n          Colleagues Call Rose a Good Choice for Federal Bench\n\n                          (By Trish Mehaffey)\n\n       The career path of a U.S. attorney and nominee for federal \n     judge could have taken a much different course if she had \n     followed her early passions for music and journalism.\n       When Stephanie Rose told her parents she was going into \n     law, they were surprised at first. She was the girl who sang \n     and danced, played the piano and oboe, majored in sociology \n     and loved to write.\n       Stephanie Rose of Center Point, the federal prosecutor for \n     the Northern District of Iowa, has been nominated by \n     President Barack Obama as the next federal judge in the \n     Southern District. (Brian Ray/The Gazette)\n       But Rose said she started looking at a law career because \n     of her childhood experience growing up with foster siblings. \n     Rose's mother and father were foster parents, and one of the \n     children in their custody had to go through a painful \n     parental termination because her biological mother, who was \n     in and out of jail, fought the proceeding.\n       Through the appeal process, the Iowa Supreme Court \n     terminated the mother's rights, changing children's rights in \n     Iowa and allowing the girl to be adopted into a permanent \n     home.\n       That showed Rose how the law can change people's lives.\n\n\n                           Acclaimed in field\n\n       ``Fairness,'' above all else, is the one word judges, \n     prosecutors and even defense attorneys, who have been \n     adversaries of Rose over the years, kept mentioning last week \n     to describe her. They said she is a good choice for the \n     federal bench because she's extremely intelligent, \n     hardworking, compassionate, humble, open-minded and \n     forthright.\n       President Barack Obama nominated Rose two weeks ago to \n     become the next federal judge in the Southern District of \n     Iowa when U.S. District Chief Judge Robert Pratt retires July \n     1.\n       Rose, 39, of Center Point, has worked in the U.S. \n     Attorney's Office since graduating from law school, one of \n     the youngest hired at the time. She worked her way up to the \n     top spot in 2009, prosecuting more than 800 felony cases. She \n     was lead prosecutor on 260 of those cases and has handled \n     another 45 civil cases and 34 appeals.\n       Assistant Johnson County Attorney Andy Chappell, who has \n     been friends with Rose since law school, said it's difficult \n     to ``imagine anybody more deserving.'' Rose is bright, \n     straightforward and incapable of pretense, he said.\n       Assistant U.S. Attorney C.J. Williams said Rose's ability \n     to quickly comprehend complex issues has helped her succeed. \n     She received recognition and awards for prosecuting two \n     complicated cases involving Internet pharmaceutical \n     companies, where doctors were prescribing pills online to \n     patients they never treated, he said.\n       The six-year case spanned many states and required the \n     review of hundreds of documents. Some may have not pursued \n     it, Williams said, but the challenge never deterred Rose.\n       Her determination paid off. The case ended with 26 \n     convictions in this district, more than $7 million in \n     forfeitures and more than $4 million that went to agencies in \n     Dubuque, Cedar Rapids and Des Moines.\n       ``She is very skilled,'' said U.S. District Judge Mark \n     Bennett, who presided over Rose's first jury trial. ``She \n     learns from any mistakes and doesn't repeat them. She doesn't \n     have a personal agenda. She goes by the law.''\n       U.S. District Judge John Jarvey of the Southern District \n     said her prosecution record is impressive for her age because \n     not all federal judges have that kind of experience, \n     especially in criminal law.\n       ``Stephanie has won the respect of prosecutors and defense \n     lawyers,'' Jarvey said.\n\n\n                          Respect from defense\n\n       Steve Swift is one of the defense attorneys who say she has \n     earned a good reputation among the defense bar. He joined a \n     dozen other defense attorneys who supported Rose for her U.S. \n     attorney nomination. They said she was fair and went by the \n     law in handling the controversial prosecution of more than \n     380 illegal immigrants charged in the 2008 Agriprocessors \n     raid.\n       ``She's not politically connected, not active in a party . \n     . . this is based on merit,'' he said. ``She's a great \n     advocate for the government, very forthright--no \n     shenanigans.''\n       Leon Spies, a defense attorney, said Rose has always been \n     interested in seeing that ``justice is accomplished.'' It's \n     more important for her to ``get it right than to win,'' he \n     said.\n       Spies, also the president of the Academy of Trial Lawyers, \n     nominated Rose to the academy in 2008 because she exhibited \n     what the organization strives for--the ``highest quality of \n     trial advocacy and ethical responsibilities to clients and \n     the law.''\n       ``It's a quite an honor to be nominated,'' said David \n     Brown, a Des Moines attorney and secretary/treasurer of the \n     academy. ``There are over 8,000 lawyers in Iowa and there are \n     only 250 members. There are less prosecutors and less women, \n     but not by design.''\n       Rose is one of 15 women in the academy.\n       Sen. Tom Harkin said all those qualities are why he \n     recommended Rose for the U.S. attorney job and for the \n     federal bench.\n       ``I was enthralled by her at the interview,'' Harkin said. \n     ``She has such a presence and such eloquence without the \n     window dressing,'' he said laughing. ``She's genuine and \n     sincere.''\n       Harkin said he doesn't foresee any problems with her being \n     confirmed. More than 80 percent of President Barack Obama's \n     nominees have been confirmed so far.\n\n\n                              What's next\n\n       Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond School of Law in \n     Richmond, Va., who analyzes the judiciary, said it's in \n     Rose's favor that she has been through a previous \n     confirmation because it could go more quickly.\n       ``It's kind of murky right now with the presidential \n     election,'' he said. ``The confirmation process could slow \n     down and even stop until after the convention. It's good that \n     she has home state support from Sen. Chuck Grassley, who's on \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee, but there are 21 others \n     (federal judge nominees) ahead of her.''\n       However, Tobias didn't rule out the chance that Rose could \n     be confirmed in time to take the bench in July.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Assistant U.S. attorney C.J. Williams described Ms. \nRose's ability to quickly comprehend complex issues. Former assistant \nU.S. attorney Bob Teig, who retired last year after 31 years, said \nThursday that Rose will make an ``excellent'' Federal judge. He went on \nto say:\n\n       She has experience in the courtroom and as an \n     administrator. She has a broad view of the federal legal \n     system and she's very intelligent. Stephanie will make a \n     great addition to the federal bench.\n\n  U.S. District Judge Mark Bennett said:\n\n       She is very skilled. She doesn't have a personal agenda. \n     She goes by the law.\n\n  U.S. District Judge John Jarvey of the Southern District said her \nprosecution record is impressive, noting ``Stephanie has won the \nrespect of prosecutors and defense lawyers.''\n  Ms. Rose is also a member of the Iowa Academy of Trial Lawyers. \nMembership in the academy is limited to just 250 attorneys whose \nprimary focus is on trial advocacy. Membership in this distinguished \ngroup is by invitation only, with unanimous approval by the Board of \nGovernors. So Ms. Rose is 1 of only 15 women on the academy.\n  Mr. Leon Spies, the gentleman who nominated Ms. Rose for the academy, \nsaid he nominated her because she exhibited exactly what the \norganization strives for, ``the highest quality of trial advocacy and \nethical responsibilities to clients and the law.''\n  If confirmed--and I am sure she will be confirmed--Ms. Rose will be \nthe first woman to serve as Federal judge in the Southern District and \nonly the second woman to serve on the Federal bench in Iowa's history. \nI congratulate Ms. Rose and wish her well as she assumes her duties as \na U.S. district judge.\n  With her confirmation today the Senate will have confirmed 156 of \nPresident Obama's nominees to the district and circuit courts. The fact \nis we have\n\n[[Page S6037]]\n\nconfirmed over 80 percent of President Obama's district nominees. \nDuring the last Presidential election year, the year 2008, the Senate \nconfirmed a total of 28 judges--24 district and 4 circuit. This \nPresidential election year we will have exceeded those numbers. We have \nconfirmed five circuit nominees, and Judge Rose will be the 29th \ndistrict judge confirmed. That is a total of 34 judges this year versus \n28 in the last Presidential election year. Yet even as we make \nconsistent progress in filling judicial vacancies, there are still \nvoices out there claiming otherwise.\n  For example, early last month the Des Moines Register of my State ran \nan editorial titled ``Judges Remain Hostages in the Senate.'' They \nstated in that editorial, in reference to the nomination of Ms. Rose, \n``She will be lucky to come up for confirmation when the Senate \nreconvenes.'' Of course the vote had already been scheduled at that \npoint, but they overlooked that fact.\n  The Register and other critics who erroneously blame vacancy rates in \nthe Federal judiciary on Republican obstructionism overlook other facts \nas well. You have heard me say on the Senate floor that the Senate can \nonly confirm judges who have been sent here from the White House. So if \nthe White House has not sent judges here, we cannot, obviously, confirm \njudges who have not been submitted to the Senate.\n  In that regard, I would like to point out something from the New York \nTimes--because a lot of times I think the New York Times would not do \nmuch to give us a basis for our position that we have done a pretty \ngood job of confirming judges, and why aren't judges up here. An \narticle dated August 17, 2012, sheds some light on this very subject. \nIn that article, ``Obama Lags on Judicial Picks, Limiting His Mark on \nCourts,'' this newspaper, the Times, points out how President Obama \nmade judicial nominations a lower political priority. The article \ndiscusses how two Supreme Court nominations, personnel upheavals, and \nthe President's emphasis upon diversity also slowed the nominations \nprocess for lower court judges. In fact, even as we continue to confirm \njudges, the President continues to lag in nominations, including \nnominations to so-called judicial emergencies.\n  Today only 32 of the 78 current vacancies have a nominee here from \nthe White House. Stated differently, nearly 60 percent of the current \nvacancies are without nominees. That has been the pattern for most of \nthis administration.\n  Once again, I wanted to set the record straight, and I hope I have \nset it straight. Republicans have been more than fair to this President \nand his judicial nominees, considering the fact that we have so many \nvacancies that have not had a nominee submitted to the Senate for our \nconsideration.\n  Again, I congratulate Ms. Rose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I spoke earlier in greater detail about \nthe nomination of Stephanie Rose to serve as a district court judge in \nIowa's Southern District. That is the vote that is coming up at 5:30.\n  As the Senate begins to vote, I want to reiterate what an outstanding \nnominee she is. It is no surprise the American Bar Association rated \nher ``unanimously well qualified,'' which is their highest rating.\n  After graduating from law school in just 2 years in the top 5 percent \nof her class, she served for 12 years as an assistant U.S. attorney in \nthe Northern District of Iowa under attorneys who were appointed by \nboth Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. She was lead \ncounsel in 260 felony cases and made 34 oral arguments before the \nEighth Circuit. Most notably, she received a national award from the \nDepartment of Justice for prosecuting the largest unlawful Internet \npharmacy case in the United States. Her work was so impressive that in \n2009 I recommended her to the President to serve as U.S. attorney. In \n2009 the Senate unanimously confirmed her, and she has been outstanding \nin her work as U.S. attorney since then.\n  Throughout her career of public service Ms. Rose has worked to uphold \nthe rule of law, made our neighborhoods safer, promoted civil rights, \nand advanced the cause of justice. She possesses all the qualifications \nnecessary to be a remarkably good Federal judge. She is a superb \nattorney and among jurists, prosecutors, and the defense bar she has a \nreputation of someone who is unfailingly fair and ethical and one who \npossesses exceptional legal ability, intellect, and judgment.\n  Finally, let me reiterate my appreciation to Senator Leahy, the \nchairman, but also, again, to Senator Grassley, my senior Senator from \nthe State of Iowa, and to their staffs, especially Jeremy Paris and Ted \nLehman, and Senator Grassley's chief of staff, David Young, for their \nsupport and all their assistance in getting this nomination through.\n  I also thank my chief of staff Brian Albert, and Dan Goldberg, Derek \nMiller, and Pam Smith on my staff and my committee staff.\n  In essence, Ms. Rose is a person of truly outstanding intellect and \ncharacter. She is exceptionally qualified to serve as U.S. district \njudge for the Southern District of Iowa. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport her confirmation when the vote occurs in just a few minutes.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Stephanie Marie Rose, of Iowa, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Southern District of Iowa?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                             The Farm Bill\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, as we come back into session this \nevening and into September, as Chair of the Agriculture Committee I \nhave one message for colleagues in the House of Representatives--for \nthe Speaker, for the Republican leadership--and that is, we need a farm \nbill now.\n  We have 20 days until the farm bill expires--only 20 days. If that \nhappens, if the Republican leadership does not work with us to pass a \n5-year farm bill, they are going to reset the clock for rural America \nall the way back to 1949. Because if the farm bill expires, we go back \nto Depression-era policies that include government planting \nrestrictions and expensive price supports--absolutely unacceptable.\n  Some of those policies even reference prices from before World War I. \nThis would be terrible for our family farmers and ranchers. It would \nthrow the markets into complete disarray. There is no reason this \nshould be allowed to happen. The full Senate has worked together and \npassed a bipartisan farm bill. The House Agriculture Committee worked \ntogether and passed a bipartisan farm bill. It is time for the House to \ncomplete its work. The House Republican leadership has refused to let \nthe bipartisan bill come up for a vote.\n  Despite our best efforts in speaking with colleagues and working \ntogether over the August break to try to come up with a way to get this \ndone, we find ourselves in a position now where our only opportunity is \nfor the House to take up the bill that was passed by their committee \nand get this done. I have never seen a situation where a farm bill--\nthis is my fourth one I have been involved with--comes out of committee \non a bipartisan basis, and then the House will not take it up, which is \nexactly where we are.\n  Instead, they sent us a so-called disaster relief bill that, \nunfortunately, only helps some livestock producers with the drought \nthis year. It does nothing for the rest of the Nation's farmers who \nhave been hurt so badly this year by frost and freezes. Our farm bill \ndoes that. In fact, our farm bill is better for livestock. It is a \npermanent livestock disaster assistance program with a better structure \nand support than that which was sent by the House of Representatives.\n  A full 5-year farm bill gives much more comprehensive disaster \nassistance to livestock producers and to other farmers who have been \nhit. Other farmers who have watched as their crops withered under the \nunforgiving Sun want to know that not only will we have a 5-year policy \nin place, but that we are going to strengthen crop insurance, which is \nreally the backbone of supporting farmers in these kinds of situations.\n  We strengthen crop insurance and expand it so more farmers can have \naccess to risk management tools on their farms. That was the No. 1 \nissue that we heard in all of our hearings, to strengthen crop \ninsurance. And that is what we did. That is one of the reasons we need \nto get a 5-year farm bill done.\n  I am looking at my colleague from Iowa, the distinguished Senator who \nchaired the committee before me. I know he shares the same feeling that \nI do, that we need to get this bill done in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  We know our farm bill also fixes dairy support so dairies do not go \nthrough what they went through in 2009, when thousands of farms went \nbankrupt. Frankly, not changing the policy for dairy is a disaster \nwaiting to happen. So we need to get the farm bill done.\n  We also reform programs. We know we have ended direct payments and \naltogether four different subsidies, saving $15 billion while \nstrengthening crop insurance. We streamline and address duplication, \ncrack down on waste, fraud, and abuse. In the end, our bill saves $23 \nbillion for taxpayers--$23 billion to pay down the debt. The only real \ndeficit reform we passed in the Senate was our farm bill, which we \nworked on together.\n  Unbelievably, the House Republican leadership still stands in the way \nof passing our bipartisan bill or their own committee's bipartisan \nbill. On Wednesday we are going to see thousands of farmers around the \ncountry coming to Washington with a simple message: We need a farm bill \nnow. Members are going to have visits from farmers and ranchers from \ntheir States. House Members will be hearing from members in their \ndistricts. They have one simple message. Those farmers knew when there \nis work to be done you do not put it off to another day. Not if you are \ngoing to be successful as a farmer. And we shouldn't be kicking the can \ndown the road either. They can't say: I don't want to harvest my crops \nright now. I think I will do it in a few months or next year or tell \nthe banker to wait until later so I can figure out what I have to make \ndecisions on for next year. They know that when the crops need to be \nharvested, the work needs to get done now.\n\n  Well, we have 19 days left. This is day 20. We are going to count it \ndown every day because we have to get this done in the House of \nRepresentatives. We did our job in the Senate on a bipartisan basis. I \nwas very proud to join with our colleague Senator Roberts and all of \nour committee who worked so well together and worked so hard, and I \nagain thank the leadership on both sides of the aisle for giving us the \ntime to get it done. We got it done, and we did it in enough time to \ngive the House time to do it in July before the August break. But that \ndidn't happen. Now it is time to get it done. The House Agriculture \nCommittee did its job. It is time for the House Republican leadership \nto schedule a vote to get this done, to support rural America--our \nfarmers and ranchers and families who are counting on the safest, most \naffordable food system in the world to be able to continue. We don't \nneed to kick this can down the road and create another crisis for farm \ncountry.\n  Madam President, I wish to thank my colleagues who are waiting to \ntalk about another very important subject. I appreciate their giving me \nthe time for a few words.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I would like to compliment the Senator \nfrom Michigan for her great leadership on agriculture policy, food \npolicy. A big part of this bill is making sure that our kids in America \nget adequate nutrition, that our elderly get good nutrition. Our summer \nand afterschool feeding programs and feeding programs for our seniors \nare all wrapped up in this bill too.\n  I was in Iowa in August and met with a lot of farmers, and they were \na little perplexed.\n  They said: Wait a minute. You passed a bill in the Senate?\n  I said: Yes.\n  So I ask the Senator from Michigan, did not that bill have the \nsupport of all the major farm organizations?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. We had the support of farm groups and \nconservation groups all across the country.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the Senator from Michigan, did not her bill, the \nbill she engineered and got through here, have the support of consumer \ngroups and parent groups?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It had all that support?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. And because of the wonderful work of the \nSenator from Iowa on our school nutrition efforts and the Fresh Fruit \nand Vegetable Program, we had the strong support of families, \neducators, and schools across the country.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Conservation groups supported the bill?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, what farmers asked me was this: If you had a bill \nthat passed the Senate, a bipartisan bill supported by all the major \nfarm groups, supported by consumer and\n\n[[Page S6039]]\n\nconservation groups, why didn't the House just pick it up and pass it?\n  I didn't have an answer. Does the Senator from Michigan have an \nanswer? Because I don't understand why the House can't take a bill that \nis so widely supported and is such a bipartisan bill and just pass it.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Well, the distinguished Senator is absolutely right. \nOne would think this would be the time to just pass it. And frankly, if \nnot, because we know the House committee has a little different view on \ncommodities, we offered to sit down all through August to work that out \nso we could come back now and come up with something that was a \ncompromise. But the House committee wasn't able to do that because they \ndo not have the support of the leadership to get that done. So here is \nwhere we are. What I know is that we have to have movement. We have to \nhave the House act or we are not going to be able to get this done.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Michigan, my leader on \nagricultural policy, she knows there is enough anxiety in farm country \nnow because of the terrible droughts we are having around the country, \nthe shortages that are looming, that now is not the time to add more \nanxiety to farmers and to farm families and our rural communities \nacross America. So I thank the Senator for her great leadership and for \npointing out that as well as acting. Our committee has acted, the \nSenate has acted, and what the House is doing I just can't figure out.\n  Again, I compliment the chairwoman of our committee for pointing out \nthat we have 20 days left and we are counting down. I am hopeful the \nHouse will hear the voices of our farm country and the bipartisan \nvoices here in the Senate and get a bill passed--or agree to the bill \npassed in the Senate. I thank the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when I have \ncompleted my statement, Senator Harkin be permitted to take the floor \nat that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The Ryan Budget\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to thank Senator Harkin because he and I were \nspending a little time together in the great State of our Presiding \nOfficer, and he and I agreed that one of the issues that ought to be \ntalked about a little bit more involves the stark choice we are facing \nin November in large part due to the budget of Paul Ryan, who is now \nthe Vice Presidential nominee for the Republicans. And Governor Romney \nhas endorsed and embraced the Ryan budget.\n  I think it was Senator Harkin's idea that we ought to explain that \nRyan budget, so I am going to do my best to talk about it as the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has the \njurisdiction of highways, bridges, transportation systems, and the \nenvironment, and I will also make a couple of comments about Medicare. \nI know Senator Harkin is going to go into that in great depth.\n  I want to make sure everybody understands that what I am talking \nabout comes straight from the budget. So if you look at page 78 of the \nreport accompanying the Ryan budget resolution, Mr. Ryan makes it clear \nhe wants to make devastating cuts to transportation. What do I mean \nwhen I say that? I mean devastating. I mean a 50-percent cut, which \nmeans about 1 million jobs would be lost if the Ryan budget were to go \ninto effect. We are talking about construction jobs--an area that has \nbeen hit so hard. We still haven't come back from this recession. And \nif there is one thing we learned when we were in the Presiding \nOfficer's great State at that convention, it was the depth of this \nrecession--the worst since the Great Depression. What a time Paul Ryan \npicks to bring devastating cuts to the construction industry. I am \ntalking about businesses and jobs mostly in the private sector, not the \npublic sector.\n\n  We have to think about the fact that 70,000 of our bridges are \ndeficient and 50 percent of our roads are not in good condition. We \nknow bridges fail. We have seen it happen. We are not only talking \nabout devastating cuts to the construction industry and its workers but \na devastating situation for people who use our bridges--the 70,000 of \nwhich are structurally deficient--and our roads, which need help. So no \ncountry can lead the world if we can't move people and goods, and we \ncannot be a world power when it comes to transportation.\n  The Ryan budget is a jobs killer. I am talking about 1 million jobs \nthat would be lost--in the private sector mostly--and it would put our \nfamilies at risk by neglecting our bridges, our highways and our \ntransit systems. Now, President Obama, on the other hand--and, frankly, \na lot of us here on both sides of the aisle--reject the notion that we \ncan walk away from rebuilding our infrastructure. So this is a very key \nissue.\n  I said I wanted to speak as the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, and I have talked a little bit about public \nworks, but what does the Ryan budget do to the environment? What he \ndoes is he undermines the public health protections provided by the \nClean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and \nother landmark laws.\n  If we look at pages 13 to page 15 of his budget, we can see he cuts \n$62 billion for activities such as protecting our drinking water, \nprotecting our air, and preserving our public lands. Let's face it: \nWhen kids get asthma, when people are too sick to go to work, when \nchildren are too sick to go to school, and when people die prematurely \nfrom heart attacks because of the air quality, there are no real \nsavings. He says he is cutting $62 billion from the budget. Let me just \nsay that for every dollar we spend on clean air protections, we know we \nget $30 worth of benefits. In 2010 alone, the Clean Air Act prevented \n160,000 premature deaths. Ask a family who stands to lose the \nbreadwinner in that family: Did we save money? No.\n  Let me cite some numbers: 1.7 million asthma attacks, 130,000 heart \nattacks, 86,000 emergency room visits, 13 million lost workdays, and \n3.2 million lost schooldays. In 2010 the Clean Air Act prevented all \nthat.\n  So what is the point, Mr. Ryan? What is the point? It will cost the \nAmerican public dearly out of their pockets and out of their lives if \nthey suffer more asthma attacks, emergency room visits, lost workdays, \nlost schooldays, and they have more heart attacks and premature deaths. \nThat is shortsighted. The American Lung Association--and they are not \nRepublican or Democratic--says that 40 percent of our population lives \nin areas with unhealthy levels of smog or toxic soot.\n  So let's remember that when we look at a budget, there is a set of \nvalues that accompany the numbers. And I don't think it is an American \nvalue to say to our people that we don't care if they get sick, they \nmiss work, or they go to the emergency room.\n  Finally, I want to set the stage for Senator Harkin's very in-depth \ndiscussion about health care. I am just going to talk about Medicare \nand Medicaid as someone who is privileged to represent, along with \nSenator Feinstein, the largest State in the Union, with the most senior \ncitizens. We have almost 38 million people. So whenever I talk about \nthis Ryan budget and how many people get hurt, believe me, I speak from \nthe heart when I say we can't let it happen.\n  The American people know Medicare, they like it, and they do not want \nto change it. Now, the Republicans tell us their plan saves Medicare. \nBut just ask someone. Ask someone who is going to be the victim of the \nPaul Ryan plan if we don't stop it. That person will find they are \ngetting a voucher; they are not getting Medicare. Medicare will be \ngone. They will get a voucher, and experts tell us and the studies show \nthat voucher will be almost $6,000 a year short. Imagine an older \nperson who really is struggling for a quality of life having to have \nthe added worry of not knowing whether he or she will be able to find \nhealth insurance.\n  Look, putting Republicans in charge of Medicare is like putting the \nCookie Monster in charge of your favorite bakery. And I am not \noverstating it. No one would put the Cookie Monster in charge of their \nfavorite bakery. Well, we can't put the Republicans in charge of \nMedicare, and I will prove why. This isn't just rhetoric. Listen. In \n1995 Newt Gingrich said he thought Medicare, in his words, should \nwither on the vine. In his 1996 Presidential campaign, Senate majority \nleader Bob Dole bragged:\n\n\n[[Page S6040]]\n\n\n       I was there fighting the fight, voting against Medicare, \n     because we knew it wouldn't work in 1965.\n\n  Really? Really. Medicare works. Why would we end it? We are not going \nto end it. But if Paul Ryan gets into power, he will have a good chance \nof ending it with his friend and Presidential candidate Mitt Romney who \nhas endorsed the Ryan budget.\n  Listen to what Michael Steele, the head of the Republican National \nCommittee, said in 2009:\n\n       I mean, the reality of it is this single-payer program \n     known as Medicare is a good example of what we should not \n     have happen.\n\n  The Ryan budget at page 53 shreds Medicare. As if he hasn't slammed \nMedicare enough, look what he does to Medicaid. He cuts it by more than \n$800 billion. Where are low-income families going to go?\n  Senator Harkin is the expert, but I can tell you this. So many of our \nelderly rely on Medicaid for nursing home costs. It is a disaster. We \nknow that in addition to all these terrible cuts--and by the way, when \nPaul Ryan attacks President Obama for cutting money from Medicare, what \nhe isn't telling us is the President has found savings from \noverpayments to providers. Do you know what he does with the money? He \nputs it right back into Medicare, extends the life of the program for 8 \nyears, closes the doughnut hole to help seniors, and gives senior \ncitizens preventive health care, well checkups, and the like.\n  To quote President Clinton, that ``takes a lot of brass.'' Because \nthe fact is, President Obama has strengthened Medicare and has extended \nthe life of Medicare. What Paul Ryan does is he takes those cuts and he \ngives tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding, and I thank the Senator \nfor her keen eye on the Ryan budget and what it does.\n  I listened to the Senator's explanation of President Obama's goal to \ncut down overpayments, fraud and abuse, and to put that money back into \nhelping beneficiaries. I ask the Senator, isn't it true that both Ryan \nbudgets incorporate those very same cuts President Obama wants to do?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. Both his budgets take the same amount. But \ninstead of putting it back into Medicare, he robs Medicare, and \nMedicare will go broke--my understanding--in 2016 under the Ryan plan; \nwhereas, President Obama puts the money back into Medicare, extends the \nlife 8 years, and gives more benefits.\n  I am going to finish up and just say this. However you look at this, \nthis Ryan budget is a roadmap for disaster for the American people. He \ncuts the heart out of things the American people like. The American \npeople want clean air, they want safe drinking water, they want \nMedicare, they want to make sure our seniors can be safe in nursing \nhomes. The American people want transportation--and they don't want to \nbe worried if a car is on a bridge that is going to fall down into the \nwater below. It has happened.\n  Here is the deal. If we were to say to Mr. Ryan: Are you cutting all \nthis so you could balance the budget today, he would say: Oh, no; that \nis 25 years from now.\n  What is he doing with the ``savings''? He is giving these huge tax \nbreaks. I will close with this. People earning more than $1 million a \nyear are going to receive $400,000 more in tax breaks every year. So he \ncuts everything to give these tax breaks to the people who already have \nmillions and billions, but it is still not enough. As President Obama \nhas pointed out, he will then have to go after the middle class and \ntake away middle-class tax deductions, such as the home mortgage \ndeduction, because he doesn't even get enough money from these \nDraconian cuts. He has to go ahead and raise taxes on the middle class.\n  I watched Presidential nominee Romney be asked this question: What \nare you going to cut? He said: Well, we will discuss it later. Mr. \nRyan, the Republican Vice Presidential nominee, said: We will work with \nCongress on it. Right.\n  Listen, they know they have to make Draconian tax increases on the \nmiddle class and the working poor. They have to cut the things America \nwants in order to pay for their tax cuts. No wonder Mr. Romney picked \nMr. Ryan. Mr. Romney will be in the 1-percent tax bracket--that is what \nthe experts say--can you imagine?--while his secretaries and everybody \nelse pay through the nose.\n  These next 60 days or so is an important time for us. I wish to thank \nmy friend from Iowa because I was very interested in laying out some of \nthese issues and he encouraged me to do so. I am very delighted to be \nhere with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, let me thank my colleague Senator Boxer \nfor always being on point and for always being very eloquent in her \nfocus and explanation of the fallacies of the Ryan-Romney budget and \nhow it is going to affect our middle-class families in the future.\n  Since we recessed around the 1st of August and have been out of \nsession, Congressman Paul Ryan--our colleague in the House--has become \nthe Vice Presidential nominee of the Republican Party, and, of course, \nMr. Romney has accepted the nomination to be President. Congressman \nRyan is not an unknown quantity. He has been here quite a few years, \nand as the head of the Budget Committee he has put forward a couple \nbudgets. Budgets are blueprints. If one is going to build a building or \na house, they need a blueprint. If you are going to try to move the \ncountry in a certain direction, you need a blueprint, and that \nblueprint is a budget. A budget sort of tells us where it is that the \nproponent of that budget wants to take us as a country--a Federal \nbudget. If it was a State budget, we would say that is where they want \nto take the State.\n  So we on this side intend, over the next several days, couple weeks--\nhowever long we are in session--to let the American people know what is \nin the Ryan budget and where it would take America: What is the \nblueprint they have for America?\n  Our Nation faces an absolutely fundamental choice in November: Are we \ngoing to rescue, restore, and rebuild the struggling middle class in \nthis country or are we going to continue to shift even more wealth and \nadvantage to those at the top at the expense of the middle class? \nRepublicans have made it very clear where they stand on this \ncritical choice. They did so when nearly every Republican in Congress \nvoted in favor of the Ryan budget plan, and Governor Romney embraced \nthat plan as marvelous--not exactly a word most average Americans would \nuse to describe something they like. But if you are having tea at the \nRitz, I guess ``marvelous'' kind of fits for some people. Anyway, he \nembraced the plan as marvelous.\n\n  The very centerpiece of the Ryan budget is a dramatic shift of even \nmore wealth to those at the top, huge new tax cuts for the richest 2 \npercent. As the Senator from California pointed out, if we take the \nBush tax cuts and extend those--which Mr. Romney would do and Mr. \nRyan's budget does--then add on to it the tax cuts in the Ryan budget--\nwhich Mr. Romney supports, so I can call it the Romney-Ryan budget or \nthe Ryan-Romney budget. If we do that and you make over $1 million a \nyear, you are going to get nearly $400,000 a year in new tax cuts. \nThink about it. It takes your breath away--$129,000 in the Bush tax \ncuts would be extended, plus an additional $265,000 that would be in \nthe Ryan budget.\n  We hear a lot about entitlements; we are going to cut entitlements. \nBut this is an entitlement. Think about it. If someone makes over $1 \nmillion a year, they are entitled to that. They don't have to do \nanything else. They don't have to jump through any hoops. They don't \nhave to show any hurt or anything else. Just if someone makes over $1 \nmillion, they are entitled to it. How about this entitlement? \nRepublicans always want to make it seem as though entitlements only go \nto poor people or the elderly or children. They talk about Medicaid as \nan entitlement. What about this? This is an entitlement to those who \nare rich.\n  How do the Republicans pay for this? They don't want to say how, but \nall we have to do is look at the Ryan budget and that will tell us how \nthey pay for it. They pay for it by massive Draconian cuts to programs \nthat undergird the middle class and essential to the quality of life in \nthis country, such as\n\n[[Page S6041]]\n\neducation cuts, student grants and loan cuts, law enforcement, clean \nair and clean water, food safety, medical research, highways, bridges \nand other infrastructure that was focused on by the Senator from \nCalifornia--all those would be cut.\n  The Republican plan would end Medicare, period. It would turn it into \nvoucher care. So now we have a new word, not Medicare but voucher care, \nthat would force seniors to pay nearly $6,000 more per year out of \npocket for their health care in future years. We don't get Medicare; we \nget a voucher. That plan would strip tens of millions of Americans of \ntheir health care coverage and cut millions of poor kids from nutrition \nprograms. Their plan would leave America with a less-skilled workforce, \na deteriorating infrastructure, making us less competitive in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  Lastly, Republicans offset these big new tax cuts by actually raising \ntaxes on the middle class. That is a dirty little secret you won't find \nunless you dig into the Ryan budget. It is true. Here is why: Under the \nRepublican plan, under the Ryan-Romney budget, middle-class families \nare net losers, paying significantly higher taxes. The wealthy are huge \nnet winners. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that under the \nRomney-Ryan budget, middle-class families with children would see their \ntaxes go up, on average, by more than $2,000 a year.\n  The bottom line is that the Romney-Ryan budget does not reduce the \ndeficit. I hear Congressman Ryan and Mr. Romney out there talking on \nthe stump about the budget and the deficit, and they go on and on. Why \ndon't they own up to it? The Ryan budget keeps us in a deficit for 28 \nmore years. Yes, you heard me right. The Ryan budget keeps us in the \nred for 28 more years.\n  When President Clinton was inaugurated in January of 1993 and we put \nthrough the Clinton budget--which, I might point out, not one \nRepublican supported--it turned those deficits right around, and within \n5 or 6 years we were in a surplus. It doesn't take 28 years. It only \ntook a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress passing the \nlegislation in 1993 to end the slide into deficits and turn it into a \nsurplus in only 5 or 6 years. The Ryan budget keeps us in a deficit for \n28 years. Again, the savings they gain by slashing spending and raising \ntaxes on the middle class go to partially offsetting the $4.5 trillion \nin new tax cuts, most of which goes to the wealthiest Americans.\n  The truth is Representative Ryan is not interested in balancing the \nbudget. That is not his interest. Even under his most rosy assumptions, \nthe budget would not balance until 2040. The reality is the Ryan \nbudget's overriding goal is not to balance the budget but to reduce \ntaxes on those at the top. Congressman Ryan has turned out to be a true \nacolyte of former Vice President Cheney, who famously said in an \nunguarded moment: ``Deficits don't matter.'' Do you remember that? Vice \nPresident Cheney, ``Deficits don't matter.'' I guess they didn't to him \nand President George W. Bush because look at the deficits they plunged \nus into. Now Congressman Ryan is basically, with his budget--he will \nnot say it publicly, but with his budget he is saying the same thing: \nDeficits just don't matter. What matters are tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\n  Never in our history have we seen a deficit proposal so radical and \nextreme. I was here. I was in the House and then later in the Senate \nwhen President Reagan was President. He was conservative, but he was \nnot radical and as extreme as this budget. When I tell people back in \nIowa about the Ryan budget, they say: Come on. That approach is so \nextreme and unbalanced you must be making it up.\n  The Romney-Ryan plan is extreme and unbalanced, and I am not making \nit up. Don't take my word for it. Listen to former House Speaker Newt \nGingrich. He criticized the Ryan budget. He called it ``rightwing \nsocial engineering.'' All I can say is, Newt, you got that one right.\n  Representative Ryan believes in radically shrinking the size of \ngovernment to what it was over a half century ago. His aim is to use \nthe deficit crisis as a pretext for degrading and dismantling \neverything from Medicare and Medicaid to education, environmental \nprotection, workplace safety, medical and scientific research, and on \nand on. It doubles down, as President Clinton said--it doubles down on \nthe theory that if we just give more and more of our national wealth to \nthose at the top, it will magically trickle down.\n  We have tried that before. It sure does not work.\n  I would like to focus some more of my remarks this evening on the \ndevastating impact of the Romney-Ryan budget on Medicare and Medicaid, \nbut health care more generally. Since he first arrived in Congress, \nRepresentative Ryan has consistently pushed a very radical health care \nprogram--to end Medicare. End Medicare, as we say, ``as we know it'' \nbut to go to voucher care. Give everybody a voucher. Under his \nproposal, seniors would no longer have the guaranteed medical benefits \nthey have enjoyed for decades. Instead, they would get a voucher from \nthe Federal Government and they can go out and buy individual private \ninsurance or Medicare.\n  That is the catchy little thing. We will hear Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney \nsay they can buy Medicare if they would like to or they can buy private \ninsurance. Let's look at that.\n  They say this is a tough-minded solution to our debt problem, but it \nis just a scheme, a scheme to shift costs onto America's seniors rather \nthan making debt reduction a shared sacrifice for all of us.\n  Again, let's look at this voucher system. They would get a voucher \nprogram. A senior could buy traditional Medicare or health insurance. \nSo what is the catch? The voucher will not be enough to cover health \ncare costs. So seniors' out-of-pocket health care costs will steadily \nincrease. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected \nthat the Ryan budget proposal could increase annual out-of-pocket costs \nfor seniors by more than $1,200 in 2030 and $6,000 in 2050.\n  What this chart shows is the increase in health care costs in today's \ndollars, constant dollars, that elderly persons will have to pay for \nduring their expected lifetime, their average life expectancy from the \ntime they retire. In 2023 the average senior living an average lifespan \nwould pay $59,500 more. Senator Boxer rounded that off and said $60,000 \nmore. But look what happens when we get to 2030. The average senior \nwill pay $124,600 more over their expected lifespan; in 2040, $216,000 \nmore. By 2050, $331,000 more for their retirement years they would have \nto pay in health care costs. That is in constant 2012 dollars.\n  They say: But a senior can go out and buy traditional Medicare or \nprivate health insurance. Here is the catch on that. What they do is \nput Medicare in a death spiral. Here is how.\n  If a person is a very healthy senior they can go out in the private \ninsurance market and probably get a pretty good deal. If they have no \npreexisting conditions, if they have never had cancer, no one in their \nfamily has had it, if they are very healthy, they have never smoked, \nthey are just in great physical shape, they can probably go out and get \na private, cheap private insurance policy with their voucher.\n  So who stays in Medicare then? The oldest and the sickest, and \ntherefore the costs of Medicare spiral up and spiral up and it becomes \nuntenable. It is a death spiral. That is Mr. Ryan's way of killing \nMedicare.\n  Yes, he says people will get a voucher, and they can buy Medicare or \nthey can buy private insurance, but it puts Medicare into a death \nspiral. The Ryan budget turns this successful, reliable, comprehensive \nsource of health care that seniors have relied on for decades--and have \npaid into, I might add, during their years of hard work--into some \nunproven, unpredictable, rightwing, conservative experiment. I do not \nwant to experiment with the elderly. I want them to have good health \ncare they can afford, that is universal, and that they can count on.\n  President Obama has fought to strengthen Medicare, and he believes, \nas we do, it is a sacred contract. He has made a commitment to \nstrengthen Medicare in the Affordable Care Act. For example, by \neliminating the gaps in coverage, closing the doughnut hole--which we \nhave already started to do--elderly Iowans, I think, received over $600 \nback this year just from closing the doughnut hole.\n  Reducing the cost of prescription drugs. According to Medicare's own \nactuaries, the Affordable Care Act,\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\nObamaCare, extends the program solvency from 2016 to 2024. Again, how? \nAs the Senator from California said, by fighting waste, fraud, abuse \nand by getting rid of wasteful subsidies to insurance companies. Our \nplan for Medicare is basically summed up: Mend it but don't end it.\n  I was taken a little aback yesterday. Over the weekend Governor \nRomney stated he would keep some of the popular provisions of the \nAffordable Care Act. Like what? Well, like kids staying on their \nparents' insurance plans until they are 26 and ensuring coverage for \nfolks with preexisting conditions.\n  I said: Wait a second. I thought he said on the first day he was \ngoing to repeal ObamaCare? But now he says he wants to keep those. I \nwas a little confused, but my confusion was short-lived because his \ncampaign then came out with a clarifying statement. They clarified what \nGovernor Romney said, and this is the quote:\n\n       Governor Romney will ensure that discrimination against \n     individuals with preexisting conditions who maintain \n     continuous coverage is prohibited.\n\n  The Washington Post reports that 89 million Americans would be left \nout of Romney's preexisting condition plan. Why? They were working and \nthey had a health plan. They were out of work for a month or two--maybe \nwent someplace else to work and got a different plan: Sorry, you didn't \nhave continuous coverage. You don't get covered.\n\n  These are the little games that Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan \nare playing with the American people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Iowa yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was trying to understand this Republican position. It \nused to be crystal clear. In 23 debates we heard Republican candidates \nsay, one after another after another: First day in office ObamaCare is \ngone. But I heard the same thing the Senator did, and I have tried to \nunderstand it.\n  I do give Governor Romney some credence in this regard. I have said, \nwhen asked, he is the baby daddy of ObamaCare because it was Governor \nRomney who created the first version of ObamaCare in the Commonwealth \nof Massachusetts, and he understood--I hope the Senator from Iowa can \nhelp me to understand, and those listening--he understood the concept \nof insurance. If everyone who bought an insurance policy wrecked their \ncar or got sick the next day, insurance would not work. The only way it \nworks is most people are safe drivers. They buy insurance and a small \npercentage use it. So there is a pool of money collected from premiums \ncreating a reserve for accidents.\n  Here we have a situation where Governor Romney has agreed with us--I \ncommend him--that people with preexisting conditions when it comes to \nhealth care should not be discriminated against. But the Senator from \nIowa, as chair of the committee that dealt with ObamaCare, knows what \nadverse selection means. It means if people wait until they are sick to \nbuy health insurance the whole system falls apart. So in Massachusetts \nthey required everybody to buy health insurance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think that is called an individual mandate?\n  Mr. DURBIN. An individual mandate, some critics might say. Some of us \ncall it individual responsibility. And we did the same, when it came to \nhealth care reform, keeping in mind if people currently have health \ninsurance and like their doctor, like their hospital, we are not going \nto change their lives one bit. But for those who are out in the \nmarketplace, the availability of health insurance would be there, but \neveryone has the responsibility to buy it.\n  We don't think twice when we have a closing on a home. We need fire \ninsurance on this home. My home has never burned down, thank goodness, \nbut I buy fire insurance. That is individual responsibility so there is \nsomething to pay the mortgage off if the house burns down.\n  But in this circumstance what I understand Governor Romney to say is \nwe don't think insurance companies should discriminate against people \nwith preexisting conditions. OK, I am with him. But then he goes on to \nsay--I think the point the Senator made--let's kind of bear on this for \na minute--what he goes on to say is so long as people have had \ncontinuous insurance.\n  What if a person was unlucky enough to lose a job? Out of luck. Their \npreexisting conditions just disqualified them from health insurance. \nThey are stuck, under the Romney approach. What if they had any kind of \ninterruption whatsoever in their insurance coverage? They are dead in \nthe water. So when we talk about taking uninsured people, bringing them \ninto insurance that has quality to it, quality coverage where they \ncannot discriminate against people, we are saying whatever their \nprevious insurance experience we are all going to get into this \ntogether. We are all coming into the tent together and they cannot be \ndiscriminated against because they are a woman, had a baby--all the \ndifferent things they have used.\n  So when we listen closely to it, here was Governor Romney basically \nsaying he is against the discrimination on preexisting conditions, but \nthen footnoted down at the bottom of the page--as long as people have \nhad continuous coverage. It is an empty promise. It doesn't give people \nanywhere near the protection and insurance that ObamaCare gives. That \nis what I understand to be the difference.\n  Is that the way the Senator understands Governor Romney's \nclarification of his statement of yesterday?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thoroughly agree with my friend from Illinois. Governor \nRomney makes the statement. It is on a very popular well-viewed Sunday \ntalk show, ``Meet The Press.'' So the average American says: Oh, \nGovernor Romney, he is for keeping coverage for preexisting conditions. \nThat is good. That is nice to know.\n  They do not hear the clarification that came about later because that \nwas not on ``Meet The Press.'' That was sort of under the radar, when \nthey said they wanted to clarify what Governor Romney meant was he \nwould prevent discrimination against individuals with preexisting \nconditions who maintain continuous coverage. As the Washington Post \npointed out, there are 89 million Americans who would be disqualified \nbecause they had a plan, they lost it because they moved or something \nlike that, and picked up another plan. There goes their coverage. Just \nthink about that. You are a family. Let's say your spouse has a \npreexisting condition--it could be diabetes, it could be cancer, it \ncould be anything--but you have been covered under a plan. President \nObama, with the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, says beginning in 2014, \njust as we now cover children, no plan can discriminate against you \nbecause of a preexisting condition. What Romney is saying with his \nclarification is only if you have always had that plan. What if you are \na family that moved from one State to another due to a job issue? You \nmove and your spouse or maybe one of your children who is perhaps still \non your policy and has a preexisting condition won't be covered. They \nwill not cover them. Mr. Romney didn't say that on ``Meet the Press.''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Iowa that I met so many people \nin my State of Illinois who said, I cannot leave my job because I don't \nknow if I can ever find health insurance again. I am stuck because I \nhave a child or a spouse with a problem. The real world of human \nexperience tells us this happens all the time. It makes me wonder \nsometimes. There are 8 or 9 million Americans--almost one out of three \nAmericans--not covered by this Romney plan. How does this solve any \nproblems? If we are not going to have health insurance we can count on \nwhen we need it, it is worthless. It is a subsidy the insurance company \ndoesn't pay off when the family needs it.\n  I didn't mean to interrupt the Senator from Iowa, but I wanted to \nmake that point very strongly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to say one other thing about this idea of the \nindividual mandate then-Governor Romney supported in Massachusetts. We \nall have it within us--I think especially as Americans--that we don't \nlike to be told anything. We don't like to have a mandate put on us. \nWell, as the chair of the health committee, and someone who is very \nmuch involved in this process of getting the Affordable Care Act \nthrough, I want to make it very clear, you don't have to buy insurance. \nThere is no individual mandate that says you have to buy insurance. I \nwant to make that clear, and I want to keep making\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\nthat point. I have been making that point for months now. You don't \nhave to buy insurance. It just says if you don't buy it and you get \nreal sick and want to get in line to get health insurance, you pay a \npenalty. They call it a free-rider penalty.\n  Have we ever seen that before? How about Medicare? We have it in \nMedicare. When you turn 65, you don't have to get Part B. No one tells \nyou that you have to do that. If you wait until you are 67, 68, 69, or \n70, you pay more. You will pay a lot more than if you picked it up at \n62 or 65 when you retired because it is a free-rider penalty. So we \nhave to get rid of this idea that this is some kind of individual \nmandate that you are forced to do something. No, you are not forced to \ndo it. But if you are a free rider, and you say I will only go when I \nget sick--like the car accident the Senator pointed out--yes, you pay a \npenalty. That is all. You don't have a mandate. You just have to pay a \npenalty. I think when we describe that, I would say that sounds fair. \nIf you are not going to be in the insurance pool--it is as though I am \nnot going to have car insurance, but if I have a wreck, I want to call \nthe insurance company and they will insure me to the moment right \nbefore the wreck. That is nonsense. Of course, we don't do that.\n  Well, as I said, I intend to take the floor today, tomorrow, and for \nthe next several days to point out what the Ryan plan does overall but \nbasically in health care.\n  We mentioned Medicare. Let's talk about Medicaid. How about Medicaid? \nWhat does Medicaid do? Basically, as I have said many times, it is \nthere to give a decent quality of health care and a quality of life to \nthe hopeless, the helpless, and the hapless. It is for people who \notherwise sort of fall through the cracks, people who need health care \nwho cannot afford it or who, because of their life situation, have \nnever been able to get any kind of health care coverage.\n  Well, here is what he does. I will get into this more. The Medicaid \nfunding, which the Senator from California mentioned, over 10 years \ntakes over $810 billion--that is with a ``b,'' not million--out of \nMedicare. What does that mean? Who does that hurt? Well, 1 out of every \n2 Americans with a disability uses Medicaid. That is who is hurt. \nServices in the Medicaid Program allow our citizens with disabilities \nto live with dignity and purpose in their homes and in their \ncommunities. Three million seniors and people with disabilities use the \nprogram to avoid having to go into a nursing home.\n  How about Medicaid for middle-class families? We always think that \nMedicaid is just for people with disabilities or just for poor people. \nHow about Americans in the middle class? How about American middle-\nclass families? There are hundreds of thousands of American families \nwho have children with lifelong disabilities such as Down's syndrome or \nautism. Medicaid gives them a lifeline or middle-class families would \nbe paying out of their pockets for the health care costs of their \nchildren for their entire lifetimes. Yes, this is one of the \nentitlements they want to cut. Medicaid is an entitlement.\n  Well, how about that tax plan? If you are a millionaire--that is all \nyou have to be. All you have to do is have an income of over $1 million \na year and you get huge tax benefits. How about that entitlement? No, \nthey don't touch that one. At the center of the Ryan budget is his \npromise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, a commonsense \nhealth reform that led the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to have one of \nthe lowest uninsurance rates in the country. ObamaCare--I know the \nRepublicans have been using that as a pejorative. I say it proudly.\n  I was with President Obama in Iowa a couple of weeks ago when he \nspoke to a huge group of students at my alma mater, Iowa State \nUniversity. There was a big sign in the back that said ``ObamaCare.'' \nPresident Obama looked at it and said, yes, ObamaCare. Speaking of \nhimself in the third person, he said: Yes, Obama does care. He said, I \ncare about making sure everyone is covered who has a preexisting \ncondition. I want to make sure that kids can stay on their parents' \npolicy while they are in college. Yes, I want to make sure that the \nelderly have a good, affordable Medicare Program. Yes, I want to make \nsure that people have good preventive health care systems in America. \nObama cares, that is what ObamaCare is. Obama cares, and he cares very \ndeeply that we have a health care system for all and not just for a \nfew. As was said by President Clinton in his speech, an American policy \nbased upon ``we're all in this together is much better than the policy \nof tough luck, you're on your own,'' which is the Ryan budget \nphilosophy.\n  When we get past the political theater and look at what the Ryan \nbudget actually means, it is not a very pretty picture. The Ryan budget \nwould repeal the prescription drug doughnut hole closure we are doing. \nIt would allow insurance companies to charge as much as $300 for \npreventive services. One of the key elements we put in ObamaCare: 86 \nmillion Americans received at least one free preventive service last \nyear, and more this year. Almost 1 million Iowans received one free \npreventive service in 2011. That means they got preventive care so they \ndon't get sicker and cost us more money. Again, the Ryan budget would \nallow people to deny you coverage or increase your premiums if you have \na preexisting condition.\n  This protection means a lot to this person right here. This is \nEleanor Pierce from Cedar Falls, IA. I spoke about her before. She was \ndenied health insurance when she lost her job because of her \npreexisting condition of high blood pressure. Without coverage she \nracked up $60,000 in medical debt. The Ryan budget would repeal \nObamaCare. They would tell people like Eleanor Pierce: Tough luck, you \nare on your own. We are not all in this together. You mean you are not \nworth $1 million? Tough luck, you are on your own.\n  Repeal will allow insurance companies to put limits on the coverage \nof more than 100 million Americans, stopping benefits right when they \nget sick. Repeal would kick more than 3 million young people off their \nparents' policy.\n  This is Emily Schlichting who testified before the committee. She is \nan elegant young woman going to college in Omaha. She said young people \nare the future of this country and we are the most affected by reform. \nWe are the generation that is most uninsured. We need the Affordable \nCare Act because it is literally an investment in the future of this \ncountry. She suffers from a rare autoimmune disorder that would totally \nmake her uninsurable in the old days and under the Ryan budget, which \nbrings back those old days. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, she can \nstay on her parents' policy until she is 26. By 2014, regardless of her \npreexisting condition, she will get affordable health insurance \ncoverage.\n  Repeal under the Ryan budget would allow insurance companies to spend \nAmerica's premium dollars on CEO bonuses, marketing, and fancy \nbuildings rather than actual health care. Under the health reform \nmedical loss ratio requirement, policyholders nationwide will receive \nmore than $1 billion in rebates from insurers this year. That is $1 \nbillion in rebates this year that goes back to policyholders and \nfamilies; otherwise, that $1 billion would be going into CEO bonuses, \nmarketing, private jets, company planes, fancy buildings, and things \nsuch as that. These are just a few of the ways the Romney-Ryan budget \nwould repeal ObamaCare and drag America back to the bad old days.\n  Again, I will repeat that over the last few weeks Representative Ryan \nhas been telling everyone how the President's health reform plan robs \nMedicare. That is totally fallacious. First, the nonpartisan economists \nhave certified that ObamaCare strengthens the Medicare Program and \nextends its solvency by 8 years. What President Obama did--as the \nSenator from California previously pointed out--was make the program \nmore efficient and save money on wasteful overpayments to private \ninsurance companies and cracking down on fraud.\n  What Mr. Ryan won't tell us is that the very reforms President Obama \nhas in our Affordable Care Act are the same he has in his Ryan budget \nplan. What he doesn't tell us is that while President Obama takes those \nsavings and puts them back into Medicare, Mr. Ryan takes those \nsavings--yes, you guessed it--and puts them into more tax breaks for \nthe wealthy.\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\n  By repealing the Affordable Care Act, the Ryan plan would again put \nAmericans at the mercy of insurance companies and deprive more than 30 \nmillion people of affordable coverage.\n  I was just going to get the chart for my own State of Iowa. I had one \nhere on Iowa I wanted to point out, because I am obviously very \ninterested in my seniors in Iowa. This chart shows that the Ryan plan \nmeans almost 440,000 Iowa seniors would be forced onto vouchers when \nthey retire. We have to get those vouchers, right? Sixty thousand Iowa \nseniors would be forced back into the prescription drug doughnut hole. \nThe doughnut hole would open again. Four hundred thousand Iowa seniors \nwould pay more for preventive services this year.\n  I can tell my colleagues our seniors in Iowa are flocking to get \ntheir preventive health care services. They know an ounce of prevention \nis worth a pound of cure. But before those preventive services cost \nmoney. Now they get them free. It is going to make their lives better \nand save us a lot of money.\n  ObamaCare decreases the deficit by almost $110 billion over the first \n10 years and more than $1 trillion in the next decade. Mr. Romney and \nMr. Ryan won't tell us that, but it is true. It reduces the deficit. It \ninsures more than 94 percent of all Americans. Over 94 percent of all \nAmericans will have that coverage.\n  The bottom line is very simple, and I will be talking about this in \nthe days ahead. President Obama will protect Medicare, will protect \nhealth care not only for our seniors but for young people, for middle-\nclass Americans and, yes, for those at the bottom rung of the ladder \nwho need Medicaid to sustain them and to give them quality health care. \nThe Ryan budget rolls back all of this. So, again, we are faced with \nthis choice: the Ryan budget or what President Obama has come forward \nwith in his budget and with his ObamaCare to make sure America remains \na good middle-class country where people on the bottom, at the lowest \nrung of the ladder, can get into that middle class; where the middle \nclass knows they can leave a job and go to another job and not lose \ntheir health care plan; where someone can start a small business and \nknow they will have health care coverage for themselves and the one or \ntwo or three or four or five workers who work for them or small \nbusinesses now can become more competitive with the big businesses in \nAmerica.\n  I think it is safe to say that if only the American people will study \nthe Ryan budget, the blueprint, they will find that this is where they \nwant to take you and me and all of America--back to an America that our \nparents moved beyond; where our parents said, no, we are going to move \nforward; where we have buttressed ourselves in our own lifetimes, in \nmoving America forward to a country where we truly are all in this \ntogether; where we are not just a lottery country in which if a person \nwins the lottery, they are OK, they have it made; if a person doesn't \nwin, then tough luck, sucker, they are on their own. That is not the \nAmerica our parents fought for in World War II or Korea or Vietnam; it \nis not the kind of America Martin Luther King, Jr., marched for and \ndied for. It is not the kind of America we want to see for our kids and \nour grandkids.\n  We have a choice. The choice is clear. Let's move forward.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, most commissions appointed in Washington--\nat least in my experience--hardly make a ripple, people hardly notice \nthem. After a lot of hard work, a report is published and that is about \nit. Some historian at a later date may look at the work they have done \nand the research they have done and that is about it, that is the \nextent of it.\n  There are a few exceptions. I was fortunate enough almost 2 years ago \nto be appointed to one of those exceptions and that was President \nObama's deficit reduction commission, the Simpson-Bowles Commission. I \nwas appointed because I am a member of the Appropriations Committee and \nSenator Reid said we should have someone from Finance, Appropriations, \nand Budget. I took the assignment of one of the three Democratic \nSenators. There were three Republican Senators, three Republican House \nMembers, three Democratic House Members, and an additional six public \nmembers. The public members consisted of a number of people, including \nAlice Rivlin, respected in Washington, as well as a number of business \nand community leaders.\n  We met for about a year and considered the budget deficit and all of \nthe Federal spending and came to know one another a little bit during \nthat period of time. One of the members of that commission was Paul \nRyan, a Congressman from Janesville, WI, just over the border from my \nState of Illinois. I knew Paul before and got to know him a little \nbetter during the course of that commission. He is a very bright \nperson. We have some common friends in the Janesville area, and I know \nhe worked with Senator Feingold, a Democrat from Wisconsin, on some \nissues before.\n  What surprised me at the end of the day was despite his obvious \ntraining and knowledge on the budget deficit, when it came time for a \nvote on this bipartisan deficit commission report, all three House \nRepublican Members, including Congressman Paul Ryan, voted no. I voted \nyes. Two out of the three Democratic Senators voted yes. I was \nsurprised, in a way, because I thought that although the Simpson-Bowles \nplan had its shortcomings--things I disagreed with and said so--it was \na dramatic step forward to try to deal with our deficit in a fair \nfashion.\n  Jeb Hensarling of Texas was another Republican Congressman, along \nwith Dave Camp of Michigan, the chair of the House Finance Committee, \nand Congressman Paul Ryan, who all voted no.\n  I was surprised that at the Republican convention in Tampa, FL, \nCongressman Ryan, the Republican Vice Presidential nominee, criticized \nPresident Obama over the Simpson-Bowles Commission report, saying he \nhad worked hard to implement. I thought that was a curious position for \nCongressman Ryan to take, because he had voted against it. Now he was \ncriticizing President Obama for not working hard enough on the \ncommission report. But I came to understand that a little more when I \ntook a closer look at Congressman Paul Ryan's budget plan for America.\n\n  Before he was chosen to run as Governor Romney's running mate, 5Paul \nRyan, the Congressman and chairman of the House Budget Committee, \nissued his vision of what America should be doing over the next several \nyears. One of the most controversial sections relates to Medicare. \nMedicare, of course, is the insurance policy for the elderly and many \ndisabled in our country. It is a lifeline for 40 million-plus \nAmericans. It means even in their old age they will have good \nprotection for health insurance because they have paid into it during \nall of their working years. Paul Ryan observed that the Medicare \nProgram would come to an end if it weren't changed. We know it has \nabout 12 years of solvency left and change will be needed. His \nproposal, though, would do more than change Medicare; it would end it \nas we know it. The Ryan approach would create vouchers--coupons--for \nsenior citizens to buy health insurance. It would force them to pay \nmore out of pocket for Medicare. According to the CBO--the \nCongressional Budget Office--the Romney-Ryan plan would force Medicare \nbeneficiaries to pay up to $1,200 more by 2030 and almost $6,000 by \n2050. That is about $500 a month, ultimately.\n  Congressman Ryan said seniors could choose to stay in traditional \nMedicare or they could basically go into a private health insurance \nmarket. A senior who is both healthy and wealthy would have an option. \nThose not so healthy or wealthy would find the only option traditional \nMedicare, and more and more people with a history of illness would be \nforced into traditional Medicare, making it a very expensive insurance \nprogram and difficult to maintain.\n  The Paul Ryan voucher plan puts Medicare in competition with private \ninsurance companies and, as I said, many seniors would find that the \ncompetition wouldn't want them and they would be stuck with traditional \nMedicare, much different than it is today.\n\n[[Page S6045]]\n\nMedicare would be taking care of the seniors whose care costs more, so \nMedicare premiums would increase. As they go up and seniors begin to \nleave Medicare, it causes premiums to rise further, which would cripple \nthe program.\n  The Paul Ryan program eliminates all the consumer protections in the \nAffordable Care Act, putting insurance companies back in the driver's \nseat. I don't think most Americans believes that is a good place to be, \nat the mercy of an insurance company, an adjuster who will decide what \nthey are covering and how much one will pay.\n  Young adults would no longer stay on their parents' insurance plan \nunder the Romney-Ryan proposal to eliminate ObamaCare. People with \npreexisting conditions would be denied coverage--going back to the \nconversation I had earlier, my dialog with Senator Harkin on the floor. \nFamilies would once again face lifetime limits on coverage, and seniors \nwould be forced back into the doughnut hole, meaning paying more out-\nof-pocket expenses for their Medicare prescription drugs.\n  I don't think this is a good plan for America and I don't think \nAmericans, once they hear the details, are going to like it.\n  The ObamaCare program has already helped a lot of people. A report \ntoday said there was a 16-percent increase in coverage of younger \nAmericans because of ObamaCare. These are younger Americans up to the \nage of 26 who now can stay on their family plans. And 1.6 million \nAmericans have been added into coverage under their parents' plan \nbecause of this change in the law.\n  Now, those who say ``I will repeal ObamaCare'' would repeal that \nprotection, forcing 1.6 million young people, without jobs or coverage, \nout of the protection they have today. I cannot imagine 125,000 young \nadults in Illinois who have benefited from ObamaCare would believe that \nis a good idea, nor would their families.\n  Since the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, Medicare \nbeneficiaries in Illinois have saved over $171 million on their \nprescription drugs.\n  There was a discussion earlier about the Medicaid Program. Medicaid \nis an important program in Illinois and most States. I asked Julie \nHamos, who administers our program in Illinois, to explain it in a few \nwords. Here is what she said: One out of three children in Illinois is \ncovered by Medicaid. That is their health insurance--one out of three. \nIn Illinois, Medicaid pays for 52 percent of the births; that is, \nprenatal care and the delivery of the child--52 percent paid for by \nMedicaid. But those two things--child coverage and coverage for new \nmoms and their babies--do not even represent half the cost of Medicaid \nin Illinois.\n  Sixty percent of the cost of Medicaid in Illinois is for the elderly \nand disabled, many of whom are completely out of luck and out of money. \nThey live on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. They are in \nnursing homes and convalescent centers. They do not have anyplace to \nturn. So Medicaid is a critical insurance program for some of the most \nvulnerable people in America.\n  Many seniors and disabled people on Medicare also receive State \nMedicaid. The ``dual-eligibles'' they are called. That is 15 percent of \nMedicaid enrollees, but 39 percent of Medicaid spending--low-income \nelderly people who have no place else to turn.\n  So when Paul Ryan, in his budget, suggests he is going to cut back on \nMedicaid payments each year, giving a smaller amount of money to \nStates, saying: Make do, who is at risk? Children: one out of three in \nIllinois is on Medicaid; moms having babies: over half of the moms \nhaving babies in our State; and the elderly folks who have no place to \nturn.\n  Think about what that means. A child without basic health insurance, \nMedicaid, in my State or anywhere, is less likely to have a doctor, \nimmunizations when needed, and an office visit to avoid a trip to an \nemergency room. A mother without prenatal care is, unfortunately, more \nlikely to give birth to a child with a problem. And we do not want to \nsee that for the sake of the child first, certainly for the mom, for \nthe family, or for taxpayers, for goodness' sake. There is no money \nsaved by scrimping on Medicare for new moms. The Ryan plan would force \nthat kind of scrimping.\n  The Ryan plan converts Medicaid into a block grant and cuts Federal \nfunding for the program by 34 percent over the next 10 years--34 \npercent.\n  So I would ask Congressman Ryan: Which of those groups do you want to \ncut back on in terms of coverage? According to CBO, cuts at the level \nthe Ryan plan calls for would mean States would have to reduce \neligibility for Medicaid and children's health insurance or cover fewer \nservices.\n  I might add--I am sure it is true in the State of Oregon; it is \ncertainly true in Illinois--one of the most critical areas of medical \nneed is dental care. I talk to doctors every time I go back home in \nemergency rooms at hospitals who have people coming in to see them in \npain because of problems with their teeth, and they end up getting pain \nmedication but nothing is taken care of.\n  So when we talk about restricting care, as Paul Ryan has suggested in \nhis budget, I have to tell you, I think it is extremely shortsighted. A \ntooth ache can turn into a life-threatening situation for some people, \nnot to mention the pain and discomfort they are going through. So if \nanything, we ought to review basic Medicaid services to expand at least \ninto dental care. I would support that. I think it is extremely \nshortsighted for us not to include it.\n  This Paul Ryan budget would not expand Medicaid. It would cut it back \ndramatically. States would lower payments to doctors and nurses by one-\nthird. Can you imagine what that would do? It would reduce the number \nof providers, which makes it more difficult.\n  Just to give you an example, in the Quad Cities in Illinois, there is \na great clinic put together by a friend of mine in the Hispanic section \nof Moline. They provide basic, basic primary health care. If you need a \nspecialist, you are referred, with at least an hour-and-a-half drive, \nto Peoria or with an almost 3-hour drive to Chicago. Remember, these \nare the poorest people living in our towns. Do they make it to the \nspecialist? Usually not. The Paul Ryan approach, reducing the amount of \nmoney that is paid to providers, would mean even fewer specialists \nwould be willing to help those who are poor.\n  But the thing that troubles me the most about Congressman Ryan is--at \nleast in his budget views and his deficit views--as he talks a good \ngame about reducing the deficit and voted against the Simpson-Bowles \nCommission report, he comes up with a budget that he produces in the \nHouse and says he and Governor Romney are going to protect the Bush tax \ncuts for the wealthiest people in America and increase defense \nspending. This does not work. It does not add up. It does not pass what \nPresident Clinton called the arithmetic test. You cannot increase tax \ncuts and increase spending on defense without, as President Clinton \nsaid, digging the hole deeper and deeper.\n  So they sound pretty good when they give the speeches about fiscal \nconservatism and that we have to be serious about the deficit, but \ntheir proposals just do not match. The idea of lowering tax rates, as \nthey proposed, even below the Bush tax cuts--they said: Well, we will \nuse tax reform to get to it. The estimates suggest that the middle-\nincome families will end up losing in that. As a result of tax reform \nas proposed by Romney-Ryan, they think middle-income families face a \nhigher tax of $2,000 a year to protect tax cuts for the wealthiest \npeople. That certainly is not a positive thing in terms of deficit \nreduction or helping a lot of working families living paycheck to \npaycheck.\n  We have debated Congressman Ryan's plan for 2 years now. The only \npeople who seem to like it are some Republicans serving in Congress. \nThe majority of Americans would oppose the Paul Ryan budget plan to end \nMedicare as we know it. The majority of Americans certainly oppose his \nidea of raising taxes on middle-income families to pay for tax breaks \nfor the wealthiest. Congressman Ryan has had his chance to make his \ncase to the American people for his view of where we are going, and it \nwill not work. I wish he had joined us in the bipartisan effort of \nSimpson-Bowles. His vote in favor of that would have given him more \ncredibility and maybe a better understanding of the reality of budget \ndeficit reduction.\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6046-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the budget \nproposed by Congressman Paul Ryan, which has been approved twice by the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The Ryan budget, which is purported to be a measure of fiscal \nresponsibility, is in fact an attempt to rewrite the social contract in \nthis country while at the same time adding to the national debt.\n  Let me explain. There are four major components of the Ryan budget.\n  The first is another round of tax cuts for the wealthy. According to \nthe non-partisan Tax Policy Center, the Ryan tax plan would add an \nadditional $4.5 trillion to the Nation's debt. That is on top of the \nstaggering cost of the Bush tax cuts.\n  Second, the Ryan budget would virtually eliminate spending on \ndomestic programs, imposing debilitating funding cuts for education, \nair quality, roads, bridges, railways, national parks, first responder \nprograms and a host of other vital national interests.\n  Third, this budget ends Medicare as we know it and converts Medicaid \ninto a block-grant program with capped funds. The Ryan budget endangers \nour two most vital sources of health care services for seniors, the \npoor and those with disabilities.\n  Finally, the budget repeals the health reform law, reducing the \nsolvency of Medicare and eliminating critical consumer protections.\n  The tax proposal in the Ryan budget is especially troubling. \nAccording to the Tax Policy Center, the Ryan budget would mean a tax \nwindfall of $265,000 a year for millionaires.\n  At the same time, the middle class and working poor would see few if \nany benefits.\n  The Ryan tax plan is very similar to that of Mitt Romney. Both plans \nwould substantially reduce tax rates on the wealthy, and both are \nsupposedly paid for by closing unspecified tax loopholes.\n  The Tax Policy Center has already analyzed Mitt Romney's plan. In \norder to substantially lower tax rates and remain revenue neutral, the \nRomney plan would have to eliminate so many tax credits and deductions \nthat it would actually raise taxes on the middle class.\n  To make matters worse, the Ryan budget does not stand up to scrutiny. \nThis is a question of basic arithmetic.\n  How do you reduce the national debt while at the same time handing \nmassive tax cuts to the wealthy? Congressman Ryan already took one \noption off the table--reducing the Defense Department budget. In fact, \nhis budget proposes to spend even more money on defense, money the \nPentagon does not even want.\n  That leaves deeper cuts to domestic programs and entitlement spending \nas the only remaining options. And it is important to note that \nCongressman Ryan refuses to specify what those cuts would be--because \nthey would be so painful to so many Americans.\n  Medicare in particular would be savaged by the Ryan budget.\n  Beginning in 2023, his budget ends the traditional guaranteed \nbenefits structure of Medicare, instead offering vouchers to purchase \neither a private health insurance plan or traditional Medicare.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, that means new Medicare \nbeneficiaries would pay $1,200 more out of pocket by 2030 and $5,900 \nmore by 2050. Experts say the Ryan budget would also likely lead to \nreduced access to health care and diminished quality of care for \nbeneficiaries.\n  Essentially, seniors would be forced to purchase more expensive care \nwith less.\n  Consider that in 2010, half of all Medicare beneficiaries had incomes \nof less than $21,000 and you can see why this proposal is so dangerous.\n  The Center for American Progress estimates that if the Ryan budget \nwere to pass, someone who is 54 years old today would face increased \ncosts of $59,450 during retirement. Someone who is 29 years old today \nwould spend $331,000 more over the course of their retirement.\n  I would also note that the Ryan budget includes $700 billion in \nMedicare savings the exact same amount that was included in the health \nreform law he seeks to repeal.\n  The difference is that rather than applying those savings to lower \ncosts and increased benefits for seniors, the Ryan budget diverts those \nsavings to even more tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.\n  Speaking of Congressman Ryan's desire to repeal health reform--his \nefforts to unwind that law, which has been upheld by the Supreme Court, \nwould add tens of millions of Americans to the ranks of the uninsured, \nit would eliminate critical consumer protections, and it would hasten \nthe insolvency of Medicare by 8 years.\n  House Republicans want to put insurance companies back in the \ndriver's seat, able to charge higher rates based on gender and deny \ncoverage to people with preexisting conditions. They would remove \nprotections that guarantee children the right to health insurance.\n  American families would again be at risk for bankruptcy because of \ncostly illnesses like cancer. More than 12 million Californians would \nonce again face lifetime limits on their health coverage.\n  The budget would reopen the prescription drug ``doughnut hole,'' \nforcing 5.2 million seniors to once again dip into their pockets to \ncover the full cost of prescription drugs.\n  In California, 3.4 million seniors would be forced to pay more for \npreventive services, such as cancer screenings and mammograms, meaning \nfewer seniors would have access to these services.\n  Let me be clear: the health reform law extended the life of Medicare \nby 8 years. In addition to forcing seniors to pay more for services, \nthe Ryan budget would place the Medicare Trust Fund on a track for \ninsolvency by 2016.\n  Medicaid is another big loss in the Ryan budget. He would change \nMedicaid from a State-Federal match program to a block grant program, \nincluding dangerous funding caps. Millions more of the most at-risk \nAmericans would become uninsured or underinsured because of this \nbudget.\n  Medicaid spending would be slashed by $810 billion over 10 years, a \n22 percent cut.\n  This would jeopardize health care for nearly 7.3 million Medi-Cal \nbeneficiaries in California, many of whom would see reduced \neligibility, coverage of fewer services and increased out-of-pocket \nexpenses.\n  Low-income pregnant women who depend on Medicaid could be dropped \nfrom the program, a threat to health of both mother and baby.\n  Let me be candid: The Ryan budget is just another salvo in the war \nagainst the middle class and working poor.\n  It would mean more tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of \ninvestments in our future, it would lead to greater numbers of \nuninsured and it would demolish some of the most vital safety net \nprograms in the Nation.\n  Let's set aside the politics and get to work on real solutions for \nthe country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6046-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I stand before you today to congratulate the \nCongressional Management Foundation on its 35th anniversary of service \nto Capitol Hill. Founded in 1977, CMF is a non-profit, nonpartisan \norganization dedicated to improving management practices within the \nHalls of Congress, as well as facilitating better communication between \nlegislators and their constituents. By improving congressional \noperations, providing institutional research, and educating Americans \non how Congress actually works, the Congressional Management Foundation \nhas been a valuable contributor to building trust and effectiveness in \nCongress.\n  The Congressional Management Foundation strives to help legislators \nget off on the right foot even before they are sworn into office. \nWithin 5 days after election day, all incoming freshmen receive a copy \nof ``Setting Course'' and ``The 90-Day Road Map''--\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\ntwo experience-driven publications produced by CMF that provide new \nHouse Members, Senators, and their staff a detailed outline for setting \nup and running an effective office. ``Keeping it Local'' stresses the \nimportance of maintaining a strong presence in district offices and the \nvalue of effective constituent outreach and interaction at the local \nlevel. These publications are time-tested, indispensable resources that \nprovide our leaders with the appropriate tools they need to overcome \nthe challenges of lawmaking on the national stage.\n  In the past decade, CMF has adapted its mission to keep up with the \nrapid introduction of new technology on Capitol Hill. Recently CMF has \noffered guidance on how to design effective and accessible Web sites, \nculminating in CMF's Gold Mouse Awards for the best congressional Web \nsites. CMF has helped Senators significantly improve their online \noperations, resulting in more transparency and accountability in \ngovernment. Because of CMF's research and guidance in Web sites and \nonline communications, Americans have a better understanding of the \nCongress and better access to necessary services.\n  Finally, I wish to congratulate CMF on focusing on improving the \nCongress in a nonpartisan way. There are only a few places left in \nWashington where those of us who are in public service can gather and \ntruly engage in problem solving. I congratulate the Congressional \nManagement Foundation on more than three decades of outstanding work \nand wish them success in all of their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6047-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN J. CLOOBECK\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr President, I rise to honor my friend Steve Cloobeck of \nLas Vegas, the chairman of the board for Brand USA. This month, Steve \nwill step down from the board after 2 years of working tirelessly to \nbuild Brand USA from the ground up.\n  Over the past decades, the United States lost valuable tourism \ndollars as international visitors traveled to other destinations \ninstead of the U.S. In part, the United States lost market share \nbecause we failed to promote tourism, while other countries invested in \ntourism promotion. To encourage tourists to visit the U.S., I worked \nfor the passage of the Travel Promotion Act. This bipartisan \nlegislation established the first-ever United States public-private \ninitiative to promote tourism. The new organization would help attract \nmillions of international visitors by advertising our Nation abroad--\nall at no cost to the taxpayers.\n  If this new organization, Brand USA, was going to be successful, it \nwould need a strong leader with a bold vision to promote tourism. \nFortunately, we found that leader in Steve Cloobeck. From the moment he \njoined the board, Steve established aggressive timelines for setting up \nthe new organization. He helped draft the organization's strategic \nplatform and goals, while ensuring that operations continued on \nschedule.\n  Steve was also actively engaged in building partnerships with the \nprivate sector. Because of his business relationships in the tourism \nindustry, Steve received many large commitments and contributions from \ncompanies in Nevada and across the Nation. With a slate of committed \npartners from Marriott to Best Western to Disney, Brand USA will raise \nmore than $50 million from the private sector this year alone.\n  Under the direction of Steve and the board, Brand USA unveiled their \nnew advertising campaign. Featuring a song by Rosanne Cash, these ads \nshowcase America as a ``Land of Dreams'' where anything is possible. \nThese advertisements, which have been running in nine key international \nmarkets, have created a strong brand identity for the United States \nabroad.\n  Today, we can already see that Brand USA is making a difference. So \nfar this year, international visitation to the U.S. has increased 12 \npercent and we are heading for a record-setting year. And most \nimportantly, during these hard economic times, travel promotion is \ncreating new, good-paying jobs as we welcome millions of new visitors \nto our Nation's world-class cities, national parks, and tourist \nattractions.\n  Under Chairman Cloobeck's leadership, Brand USA has been a tremendous \nsuccess for our Nation and the travel industry. His enthusiasm and \ndedication have ensured that Brand USA is well positioned for the \nfuture. I am confident that Brand USA will be a critical asset to \nAmerican tourism for years to come, and I am proud to join everyone at \nBrand USA and the travel industry in thanking Steve for his important \ncontributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6047-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6047-S6050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  TANF\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the GAO opinion letter dated September 4, 2012, and the TANF \nInformation Memorandum dated July 12, 2012.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   U.S. Government\n\n\n                                        Accountability Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 2012.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Dave Camp,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of \n         Representatives.\n       By letter of July 31, 2012, you asked whether an \n     Information Memorandum issued by the Department of Health and \n     Human Services (HHS) on July 12, 2012 concerning the \n     Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program \n     constitutes a rule for the purposes of the Congressional \n     Review Act (CRA). The CRA is intended to keep Congress \n     informed of the rulemaking activities of federal agencies and \n     provides that before a rule can take effect, the agency must \n     submit the rule to each House of Congress and the Comptroller \n     General. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that \n     the July 12, 2012 Information Memorandum is a rule under the \n     CRA. Therefore, it must be submitted to Congress and the \n     Comptroller General before taking effect.\n\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n       The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant, \n     administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human \n     Services, provides federal funding to states for both \n     traditional welfare cash assistance as well as a variety of \n     other benefits and services to meet the needs of low-income \n     families and children. While states have some flexibility in \n     implementing and administering their state TANF programs, \n     there are numerous federal requirements and guidelines that \n     states must meet. For example, under section 402 of the \n     Social Security Act, in order to be eligible to receive TANF \n     funds, a state must submit to HHS a written plan outlining, \n     among other things, how it will implement various aspects of \n     its TANF program. More specifically, under section \n     402(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Social Security Act, the written \n     plan must outline how the state will ensure that TANF \n     recipients engage in work activities. Under section 407 of \n     the Social Security Act, states must also ensure that a \n     specified percentage of their TANF recipients engage in work \n     activities as defined by federal law.\n       In its July 12 Information Memorandum, HHS notified states \n     of HHS' willingness to exercise its waiver authority under \n     section 1115 of the Social Security Act. Under section 1115, \n     HHS has the authority to waive compliance with the \n     requirements of section 402 in the case of experimental, \n     pilot, or demonstration projects which the Secretary \n     determines are likely to assist in promoting the objectives \n     of TANF. In its Information Memorandum, HHS asserted that it \n     has the authority to waive the requirement in section \n     402(a)(1)(A)(iii) and authorize states to ``test approaches \n     and methods other than those set forth in section 407,'' \n     including definitions of work activities and the calculation \n     of participation rates. HHS informed states that it would use \n     this waiver authority to allow states to test various \n     strategies, policies, and procedures designed to improve \n     employment outcomes for needy families. The Information \n     Memorandum sets forth requirements that must be met for a \n     waiver request to be considered by HHS, including an \n     evaluation plan, a set of performance measures that states \n     will track to monitor ongoing performance and outcomes, and a \n     budget including the costs of program evaluation. In \n     addition, the Information Memorandum provides that states \n     must seek public input on the proposal prior to approval by \n     HHS.\n\n\n                                ANALYSIS\n\n       The definition of ``rule'' in the CRA incorporates by \n     reference the definition of ``rule'' in the Administrative \n     Procedure Act (APA), with some exceptions. Therefore, our \n     analysis of whether the July 12 Information Memorandum is a \n     rule under the CRA involves determining whether it is rule \n     under the APA and whether it falls within any of the \n     exceptions contained in the CRA. The APA defines a rule as \n     follows:\n       ``[T]he whole or a part of an agency statement of general \n     or particular applicability and future effect designed to \n     implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or \n     describing the organization, procedure, or practice \n     requirements of an agency and includes the approval or \n     prescription for the future of\n\n[[Page S6048]]\n\n     rates, wages, corporate or financial structures or \n     reorganizations thereof, prices, facilities, appliances, \n     services or allowances therefor or of valuations, costs, or \n     accounting, or practices bearing on any of the foregoing[.]''\n       This definition of a rule has been said to include ``nearly \n     every statement an agency may make.''\n       The CRA identifies 3 exceptions from its definition of a \n     rule: (1) any rule of particular applicability; (2) any rule \n     relating to agency management or personnel; or (3) any rule \n     of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not \n     substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency \n     parties. 5 U.S.C. 804(3).\n       The definition of a rule under the CRA is very broad. See \n     B-287557, May 14, 2001 (Congress intended that the CRA should \n     be broadly interpreted both as to type and scope of rules \n     covered). The CRA borrows the definition of a rule from 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 551, as opposed to the more narrow definition of \n     legislative rules requiring notice and comment contained in 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 553. As a result, agency pronouncements may be \n     rules within the definition of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 551, and the \n     CRA, even if they are not subject to notice and comment \n     rulemaking requirements under section 553. See B-316048, \n     April 17, 2008 (the breadth of the term ``rule'' reaches \n     agency pronouncements beyond those that require notice and \n     comment rulemaking) and B-287557, cited above. In addition to \n     the plain language of the CRA, the legislative history \n     confirms that it is intended to include within its purview \n     almost all rules that an agency issues and not only those \n     rules that must be promulgated according to the notice and \n     comment requirements in section 553 of the APA. In his floor \n     statement during final consideration of the bill, \n     Representative McIntosh, a principal sponsor of the \n     legislation, emphasized this point:\n       ``Although agency interpretive rules, general statements of \n     policy, guideline documents, and agency policy and procedure \n     manuals may not be subject to the notice and comment \n     provisions of section 553(c) of title 5, United States Code, \n     these types of documents are covered under the congressional \n     review provisions of the new chapter 8 of title 5.\n       Under section 801(a), covered rules, with very few \n     exceptions, may not go into effect until the relevant agency \n     submits a copy of the rule and an accompanying report to both \n     Houses of Congress. Interpretive rules, general statements of \n     policy, and analogous agency policy guidelines are covered \n     without qualification because they meet the definition of a \n     `rule' borrowed from section 551 of title 5, and are not \n     excluded from the definition of a rule.''\n       On its face, the July 12 Information Memorandum falls \n     within the definition of a rule under the APA definition \n     incorporated into the CRA. First, consistent with our prior \n     decisions, we look to the scope of the agency's action to \n     determine whether it is a general statement of policy or an \n     interpretation of law of general applicability. That \n     determination does not require a finding that it has general \n     applicability to the population as a whole; instead, all that \n     is required is that it has general applicability within its \n     intended range. See B-287557, cited above (a record of \n     decision affecting the issues of water flow in two rivers was \n     a general statement of policy with general applicability \n     within its intended range). Applying these principles, we \n     have held that a letter released by the Centers for Medicare \n     and Medicaid Services to state health officials concerning \n     the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was of \n     general applicability because it extended to all states that \n     sought to enroll children with family incomes exceeding 250 \n     percent of the federal poverty level in their SCHIP programs, \n     as well as all states that had already enrolled such \n     children. Similarly, the July 12 Information Memorandum is of \n     general, rather than particular, applicability because it \n     extends to all states administering Temporary Assistance for \n     Needy Families (TANF) programs that seek a waiver for a \n     demonstration project.\n       Next we must determine whether the action is prospective in \n     nature, that is, whether it is concerned with policy \n     considerations for the future and not with the evaluation of \n     past conduct. In B-316048, we held that the SCHIP letter was \n     intended to clarify and explain the manner in which CMS \n     applies statutory and regulatory requirements to states that \n     wanted to extend coverage under the SCHIP programs. \n     Similarly, the July 12 Information Memorandum is concerned \n     with authorizing demonstration projects in the future, rather \n     than the evaluation of past or present demonstration \n     projects. Specifically, the Information Memorandum informs \n     states that HHS will use its statutory authority to consider \n     waiver requests, and sets out requirements that waiver \n     requests must meet. Accordingly, it is designed to implement, \n     interpret, or prescribe law or policy.\n       In addition, the Information Memorandum does not fall \n     within any of the three exclusions for a rule under the CRA. \n     As discussed above, the Information Memorandum applies to all \n     states that administer TANF programs, and therefore is of \n     general applicability, rather than particular applicability. \n     The Information Memorandum applies to the states, and does \n     not relate to agency management or personnel. Finally, the \n     Information Memorandum sets out the criteria by which states \n     may apply for waivers from certain requirements of the TANF \n     program. These criteria affect the obligations of the states, \n     which are non-agency parties.\n       GAO has consistently emphasized the broad scope of the \n     definition of ``rule'' in the CRA in determining the \n     applicability of the CRA to an agency document. Other \n     documents deemed to be rules include letters, records of \n     decision, booklets, interim guidance, and memoranda. See, for \n     example, B-316048, April 17, 2008 (a letter released by the \n     Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services of HHS concerning a \n     State Children's Health Insurance Program measure, to ensure \n     that coverage under a state plan does not substitute for \n     coverage under group health plans, described by the agency as \n     a general statement of policy, was a rule) and B-287557, May \n     14, 2001 (a ``record of decision'' issued by the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service of the Department of Interior in connection \n     with a federal irrigation project was a rule).\n       Finally, the cases where we have found that an agency \n     pronouncement was not a rule involved facts that are clearly \n     distinguishable from the July 12 Information Memorandum.\n       We requested the views of the General Counsel of HHS on \n     whether the July 12 Information Memorandum is a rule for \n     purposes of the CRA by letter dated August 3, 2012. HHS \n     responded on August 31, 2012, stating that the Information \n     Memorandum was issued as a non-binding guidance document, and \n     that HHS contends that guidance documents do not need to be \n     submitted pursuant to the CRA. Furthermore, HHS notes that it \n     informally notified Congress by providing notice to the \n     Majority and Minority staff members of the House Ways and \n     Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee on the day the \n     Information Memorandum was issued.\n       We cannot agree with HHS's conclusion that guidance \n     documents are not rules for the purposes of the CRA and HHS \n     cites no support for this position. The definition of \n     ``rule'' is expansive and specifically includes documents \n     that implement or interpret law or policy. This is exactly \n     what the HHS Information Memorandum does. It interprets \n     section 402(a) and section 1115 to permit waivers for a \n     demonstration program HHS is initiating. We have held that \n     agency guidance, including guidance characterized as non-\n     binding, constitutes a rule under the CRA. See B-281575, \n     cited above. In addition, the legislative history of the CRA \n     specifically includes guidance documents as an example of an \n     agency pronouncement subject to the CRA. A joint statement \n     for the record by Senators Nickles, Reid, and Stevens, \n     submitted to the Congressional Record upon enactment of the \n     CRA, details four categories of rules covered by the \n     definition in section 551. These categories include formal \n     rulemaking under sections 556 and 557, notice-and-comment \n     rulemaking under section 553, statements of general policy \n     and interpretations of general applicability under section \n     552, and ``a body of materials that fall within the APA \n     definition of a `rule' . . . but that meet none of procedural \n     specifications of the first three classes. These include \n     guidance documents and the like.'' Finally, while HHS may \n     have informally notified the cited Congressional committees \n     of the issuance of the Information Memorandum, informal \n     notification does not meet the reporting requirements of the \n     CRA.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       We find that the July 12 Information Memorandum issued by \n     HHS is a statement of general applicability and future \n     effect, designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or \n     policy with regard to TANF. Furthermore, it does not come \n     within any of the exceptions to the definition of rule \n     contained in the CRA. Accordingly, the Information Memorandum \n     is a rule under the Congressional Review Act.\n       We note that this opinion is limited to the issue of \n     whether the Information Memorandum is a rule under the CRA. \n     We are not expressing an opinion on the applicability of any \n     other legal requirements, including, but not limited to, \n     notice and comment rulemaking requirements under the APA, or \n     whether the Information Memorandum would be a valid exercise \n     or interpretation of statutes or regulations.\n       Accordingly, given our conclusions above, and in accordance \n     with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(1), the Information \n     Memorandum is subject to the requirement that it be submitted \n     to both Houses of Congress and the Comptroller General before \n     it can take effect.\n       If you have any questions concerning this opinion, please \n     contact Edda Emmanuelli Perez, Managing Associate General \n     Counsel.\n                                                   Lynn H.

[42 \n     U.S.C. 1315]; Section 402 of the Social Security Act. [42 \n     U.S.C. 602]\n       Background: Section 1115 of the Social Security Act \n     provides authority for the Secretary of the Department of \n     Health and\n\n[[Page S6049]]\n\n     Human Services (HHS) to consider and approve experimental, \n     pilot, or demonstration projects which, in the Secretary's \n     judgment, are likely to assist in promoting the objectives of \n     Title IV-A. Section 1115 allows for waiver of compliance with \n     section 402 of the Social Security Act to the extent and for \n     the period necessary to enable a state to carry out an \n     approved project. The statute also provides authority for \n     costs of such projects which would not otherwise be an \n     allowable use of funds under Part A of Title IV to be \n     regarded as an allowable use of funds, to the extent and for \n     the period approved.\n       As specified in statute, the purpose of Part A is to \n     increase the flexibility of states in operating a program \n     designed to: (1) provide assistance to needy families so that \n     children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes \n     of relatives; (2) end the dependence of needy parents on \n     government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and \n     marriage; (3) prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-\n     wedlock pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals for \n     preventing and reducing the incidence of these pregnancies; \n     and (4) encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent \n     families.\n       Purpose: HHS is encouraging states to consider new, more \n     effective ways to meet the goals of TANF, particularly \n     helping parents successfully prepare for, find, and retain \n     employment. Therefore, HHS is issuing this information \n     memorandum to notify states of the Secretary's willingness to \n     exercise her waiver authority under section 1115 of the \n     Social Security Act to allow states to test alternative and \n     innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are \n     designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families.\n       States led the way on welfare reform in the 1990s--testing \n     new approaches and learning what worked and what did not. The \n     Secretary is interested in using her authority to approve \n     waiver demonstrations to challenge states to engage in a new \n     round of innovation that seeks to find more effective \n     mechanisms for helping families succeed in employment. In \n     providing for these demonstrations, HHS will hold states \n     accountable by requiring both a federally-approved evaluation \n     and interim performance targets that ensure an immediate \n     focus on measurable outcomes. States must develop evaluation \n     plans that are sufficient to evaluate the effect of the \n     proposed approach in furthering a TANF purpose as well as \n     interim targets the state commits to achieve. States that \n     fail to meet interim outcome targets will be required to \n     develop an improvement plan and can face termination of the \n     waiver project.\n       The demonstration authority provided by section 1115 and \n     sound evaluation of approved projects will provide valuable \n     knowledge that will help lead to improvements in achieving \n     the purposes of the TANF program.\n       Information: Scope of Authority. Section 1115 authorizes \n     waivers concerning section 402. Accordingly, other provisions \n     of the TANF statute are not waivable. For example, the \n     purposes of TANF are not waivable, because they are contained \n     in section 401. The prohibitions on assistance are not \n     waivable, because they are contained in section 408.\n       While the TANF work participation requirements are \n     contained in section 407, section 402(a)(1)(A)(iii) requires \n     that the state plan ``[e]nsure that parents and caretakers \n     receiving assistance under the program engage in work \n     activities in accordance with section 407.'' Thus, HHS has \n     authority to waive compliance with this 402 requirement and \n     authorize a state to test approaches and methods other than \n     those set forth in section 407, including definitions of work \n     activities and engagement, specified limitations, \n     verification procedures, and the calculation of participation \n     rates. As described below, however, HHS will only consider \n     approving waivers relating to the work participation \n     requirements that make changes intended to lead to more \n     effective means of meeting the work goals of TANF.\n       Moreover, HHS is committed to ensuring that any \n     demonstration projects approved under this authority will be \n     focused on improving employment outcomes and contributing to \n     the evidence base for effective programs; therefore, terms \n     and conditions will require a federally-approved evaluation \n     plan designed to build our knowledge base. TANF funds may be \n     used to fund an approved evaluation and state funds spent on \n     an approved evaluation may be considered state maintenance-\n     of-effort (MOE) expenditures. In addition, terms and \n     conditions will require either interim targets for each \n     performance measure or a strategy for establishing baseline \n     performance on a set of performance measures and a framework \n     for how interim goals will be set after the baseline measures \n     are established. The terms and conditions will establish \n     consequences for failing to meet interim performance targets \n     including, but not limited to, the implementation of an \n     improvement plan and, if the failure to meet performance \n     targets continues, termination of the waivers and \n     demonstration project.\n       HHS Priorities. In exercising her broad discretion for \n     waivers, the Secretary is interested in approaches that seek \n     to improve employment outcomes. Accordingly:\n       Waivers will be granted only for provisions related to \n     section 402.\n       The purposes of TANF, the prohibitions contained in section \n     408 (including the time limits on assistance contained in \n     that section), or any other provision of TANF other than \n     those specified in section 402 will not be waived.\n       The Secretary will not approve a waiver for an initiative \n     that appears substantially likely to reduce access to \n     assistance or employment for needy families.\n       The Secretary will not use her authority to allow use of \n     TANF funds to provide assistance to individuals or families \n     subject to the TANF prohibitions on assistance.\n       The Secretary will not waive section 402(a)(5) relating to \n     requirements to provide equitable access to Indians.\n       Waiver demonstration projects may be conducted in \n     limited geographic areas or statewide. The Administration \n     for Children and Families (ACF) is interested in more \n     efficient or effective means to promote employment entry, \n     retention, advancement, or access to jobs that offer \n     opportunities for earnings and advancement that will allow \n     participants to avoid dependence on government benefits. \n     The following are examples of projects that states may \n     want to consider--these are illustrative only:\n       Projects that improve coordination with other components of \n     the workforce investment system, including programs operated \n     under the Workforce Investment Act, or to test an innovative \n     approach to use performance-based contracts and management in \n     order to improve employment outcomes.\n       Projects that demonstrate attainment of superior employment \n     outcomes if a state is held accountable for negotiated \n     employment outcomes in lieu of participation rate \n     requirements.\n       Projects under which a state would count individuals in \n     TANF-subsidized jobs but no longer receiving TANF assistance \n     toward participation rates for a specified period of time in \n     conjunction with an evaluation of the effectiveness of a \n     subsidized jobs strategy.\n       Projects that improve collaboration with the workforce and/\n     or post-secondary education systems to test multi-year career \n     pathways models for TANF recipients that combine learning and \n     work.\n       Projects that demonstrate strategies for more effectively \n     serving individuals with disabilities, along with an \n     alternative approach to measuring participation and outcomes \n     for individuals with disabilities.\n       Projects that test the impact of a comprehensive universal \n     engagement system in lieu of certain participation rate \n     requirements.\n       Projects that test systematically extending the period in \n     which vocational educational training or job search/readiness \n     programs count toward participation rates, either generally \n     or for particular subgroups, such as an extended training \n     period for those pursuing a credential. The purpose of such a \n     waiver would be to determine through evaluation whether a \n     program that allows for longer periods in certain activities \n     improves employment outcomes.\n       Note that this is not a comprehensive list, and HHS will \n     consider other projects consistent with the statute and the \n     guidance provided in this IM. HHS is especially interested in \n     testing approaches that build on existing evidence on \n     successful strategies for improving employment outcomes.\n       Waiver requests must include an evaluation plan. In order \n     to provide the strongest evidence about the effectiveness of \n     the demonstration, the preferred evaluation approach is a \n     random assignment methodology, unless the Secretary \n     determines that an alternative approach is more appropriate \n     in light of the demonstration proposed. All evaluation plans \n     and funds to support them must reflect an adequate level of \n     effort and sound methods to produce credible findings. ACF \n     anticipates actively engaging with states to ensure that \n     evaluation plans are appropriate in light of the nature of \n     the demonstration and that the evaluation findings can \n     reasonably be expected to provide information that will \n     enhance understanding of whether the initiative was \n     successful in furthering HHS priorities. ACF staff members \n     are available to work collaboratively with states to develop \n     further or refine the evaluation plan.\n       Waiver requests must include a set of performance measures \n     that states will track to monitor ongoing performance and \n     outcomes throughout the length of the demonstration project, \n     along with the evaluation. Waiver applications must specify \n     interim targets for each performance measure, including a \n     framework for how often the measures will be reported, or a \n     strategy for establishing baseline performance on a set of \n     performance measures and a framework for how interim goals \n     will be set after the baseline measures are established. \n     Performance measures must be designed to track improvement \n     across the entire set of families targeted as well as \n     appropriate subgroups. In developing the final terms and \n     conditions for an approved waiver, ACF will work with the \n     state to further refine the appropriate performance measures \n     and interim targets as needed. All approved waivers will \n     include a provision that requires timely reporting to HHS on \n     the agreed upon performance measures and progress toward \n     meeting established interim targets. States that fail to meet \n     interim targets will be required to develop improvement \n     plans. Repeated failure to meet performance benchmarks may \n     lead to the termination of the waiver demonstration pilot.\n       The request must specify the proposed length of time for \n     the demonstration project. The final terms and conditions \n     will specify the approved length of the project. Absent \n     special circumstances, the length of an approved project will \n     not exceed five years.\n       A state will need to develop and submit a budget that \n     includes the costs of program\n\n[[Page S6050]]\n\n     evaluation. TANF and state MOE funds can be used for the \n     costs of evaluation, including third party contributions \n     counting toward meeting a state's MOE requirement.\n       HHS recognizes the importance of public input into the \n     process of developing and implementing a waiver demonstration \n     project. Therefore, the state must provide the public with a \n     meaningful opportunity to provide input into the decision-\n     making process prior to the time a proposal is approved by \n     HHS. Further guidance concerning this requirement will be \n     forthcoming.\n       Waivers are subject to HHS and Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB) approval and terms and conditions may include \n     additional requirements, such as site visits, before \n     implementation.\n       Terms and conditions will require periodic reporting on how \n     the implementation and operation of the demonstration is \n     progressing, including reporting on the performance measures, \n     in addition to evaluation reports. To support learning and \n     knowledge development, ACF staff may conduct on-site visits \n     to observe demonstration operations and meet with relevant \n     managers and staff.\n       Inquiries: Inquiries and applications for projects \n     involving waiver requests should be directed to the \n     appropriate Regional TANF Program Manager.\n                                                  Earl S. Johnson,\n     Director, Office of Family Assistance.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 12, 2012.\n       Dear State Human Service Official: Today, the \n     Administration for Children and Families' Office of Family \n     Assistance issued an Information Memorandum that informs \n     states that the Department of Health and Human Services will \n     use its statutory authority to consider waiver requests that \n     strengthen the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) \n     program. This Information Memorandum reflects the \n     Department's commitment to provide states, tribes, and \n     territories with more flexibility to innovate in the TANF \n     program with the goal of helping more families find jobs and \n     move toward self-sufficiency.\n       On February 28, 2011, President Obama issued a Presidential \n     Memorandum that directed federal agencies ``to work closely \n     with state, local, and tribal governments to identify \n     administrative, regulatory, and legislative barriers in \n     Federally funded programs that currently prevent states, \n     localities, and tribes, from efficiently using tax dollars to \n     achieve the best results for their constituents.''\n       The Administration for Children and Families took this \n     charge seriously and held a series of consultation meetings \n     with states, tribes, and territories on a variety of topics \n     including TANF. During those consultations, many \n     jurisdictions expressed a strong interest in greater \n     flexibility in TANF and indicated that greater flexibility \n     could be used by states to improve program effectiveness. We \n     also heard concerns that some TANF rules stifle innovation \n     and focus attention on paperwork rather than helping parents \n     find jobs. States offered a range of suggestions for ways in \n     which expanded flexibility could lead to more effective \n     employment outcomes for families. Two states--Utah and \n     Nevada--submitted written comments that specifically \n     identified waivers as one mechanism for testing new \n     approaches to promoting employment and self-sufficiency, and \n     a number of others states--including California, Connecticut, \n     and Minnesota--have asked about the potential for waivers.\n       As described in more detail in the Information Memorandum, \n     the Social Security Act provides the Secretary of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services with the authority to \n     grant states waivers of certain TANF provisions for the \n     purpose of testing new approaches to meeting the goals of the \n     TANF statute. The Secretary is interested in using her \n     authority to allow states to test alternative and innovative \n     strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to \n     improve employment outcomes for needy families. The statute \n     does not permit tribes to receive waivers under Section 1115, \n     however we are committed to using the underlying flexibility \n     in federal law to help tribes innovate in their programs.\n       TANF Waiver demonstration projects under Section 1115 must \n     be accompanied by a high quality evaluation plan, which is \n     critical to ensuring that the pilots result in rigorous \n     evidence about what works and what doesn't in order to inform \n     future decisions made by policymakers at the federal, state, \n     tribal, territorial, and local levels. In addition, states \n     that apply for a waiver must identify interim performance \n     targets that will be used to hold states accountable for \n     improving outcomes for families. We will work with states \n     interested in developing waiver demonstration projects to \n     design these performance measures and targets.\n       The Information Memorandum outlines the types of waivers \n     that will and will not be considered. The Secretary is only \n     interested in approving waivers if the state can explain in a \n     compelling fashion why the proposed approach may be a more \n     efficient or effective means to promote employment entry, \n     retention, advancement, or access to jobs that offer \n     opportunities for earnings and advancement that will allow \n     participants to avoid dependence on government benefits.\n       States have shown their ability to innovate in ways that \n     help parents find jobs. In 2009 and 2010, 42 states used the \n     TANF Emergency Fund authorized under the American Recovery \n     and Reinvestment Act to create 260,000 subsidized jobs for \n     jobless parents and disadvantaged youth. Over a short period \n     of time, states exhibited enormous creativity as they \n     developed new subsidized employment initiatives that \n     responded to an urgent need for jobs in communities across \n     the country.\n       It is critical that we work together to develop effective \n     employment strategies that prepare workers for the jobs of \n     the 21st century. We stand ready to work with states \n     interested in developing innovative demonstration projects \n     that test new approaches to helping parents succeed in the \n     labor market.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George Sheldon,\n     Acting Assistant Secretary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6050-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6050-S6051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RICHARD F.

Grimmett, specialist in international \nsecurity with the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division of the \nCongressional Research Service, who is retiring on September 30, after \n38 years of distinguished government service. A native of Akron, OH, \nRichard graduated with honors from Kent State University, where he also \nreceived a Ph.D. in American history with a focus on recent U.S. \nnational security policy.\n  Since 1974, when he joined CRS, Richard has been involved in a wide \nrange of major international security policy issues that have \nconfronted the Congress, from questions involving intelligence \ncommunity oversight, war powers, and the basing and use of U.S. \nmilitary forces overseas, to the international arms trade and arms \nexport controls. Through his nearly four decades as a staff adviser to \nthe Congress and several of its major committees, his various \nappearances as a con1mittee witness, and through his authoring of \nnumerous in-depth CRS reports, Richard has become recognized as a \nnational expert in these critical defense and foreign policy issues.\n  The broad sweep of his intellect is reflected in the substantive \nreports and memoranda he has written for the Congress. Yet an \nespecially significant part of his contributions to congressional \npolicy debates has been through the numerous consultations and \nbriefings he has provided to major committees of the Senate and House \non key issues before them. At the beginning of his career at CRS, \nRichard provided direct support to major congressional investigations \nof events of great consequence for U.S. national security interests. \nAmong these were his analytical support for the Senate and House Select \nIntelligence Committees--the panels chaired by Senator Frank Church and \nRepresentative Otis Pike--charged with investigating the activities of \nthe U.S. intelligence community during 1975 to 1976, investigations \nthat ultimately led to the creation of permanent select committees in \nthe House and Senate that oversee the budget and activities of the U.S. \nintelligence community today. Later, in 1985 to 1987, Richard was a \nsenior coordinator of the support provided by CRS to the House and \nSenate joint committee investigating the Iran-Contra affair, personally \nproviding advice and suggestions that focused attention on key \ndeficiencies in U.S. law, several of which were later corrected by \nlegislative enactment. Immediately after the attacks on the United \nStates on September 11, 2001, he directly assisted the Senate and the \nHouse in clarifying its understanding of the legislative options \navailable to the Congress to respond, through use of force, against \nthose responsible for the attacks on this country. His comprehensive \nunderstanding of the War Powers Resolution and its provisions have \nproven invaluable to the Congress when it has needed to consider what \nactions it might take when the President has engaged the U.S. military \nin hostile operations overseas. In 2005 Richard provided the Congress \nwith an analytical roadmap that highlighted the common policy \nsuggestions for legislation that the 9/11 Commission and previous \nsimilar inquiries had 1nade to bolster U.S. internal security against \nthe threat of terrorism. Subsequently, several of these proposals were \nenacted into law.\n  Throughout his career Richard has been the leading specialist at CRS \non issues relating to U.S. arms sales to foreign nations, U.S. arms \nexport control law, and the international arms trade in general. From \nthe mid-1970s to the present, he has advised the Congress and its \npolicy committees on\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\nissues associated with every controversial foreign arms sale proposal \nthat has come before them. Since 1982 he has produced a comprehensive \nannual report for the Congress detailing the agreements and deliveries \nconcluded by the world's conventional weapons suppliers, a work that \nhas set the gold standard on this subject. Richard was also the editor \nand coauthor of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee print ``Treaties \nand Other International Agreements: The Role of the United States \nSenate'' the definitive reference document on this subject.\n  In the area of arms export control and oversight legislation, Richard \nhas provided continuing expert support and advice to the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, from the \noriginal drafting of the Arms Export Control Act in 1976 through its \nvarious periods of amendment to the present day. More recently, he \ndirectly supported the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's exhaustive \nreview of the Defense Trade Cooperation Treaty between the United \nStates and the United Kingdom. In this endeavor, Richard provided his \nspecialized expertise to the committee on the complex issues posed by \nthis treaty, from its proposal by the President in 2007 through the \nCommittee's consideration and the Senate's advice and consent to it in \nSeptember 2010.\n  In all of the examples I have noted, Richard Grimmett's institutional \nmemory and command of the substance of the issues for which he has been \nresponsible has made him an invaluable resource for the U.S. Congress \nat large and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in particular. I am \nconfident that the Members of the Senate and the House join me in \nexpressing our deepest appreciation to Richard for the extraordinary \nservice he has provided to us over his long and distinguished career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6051-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVATE FLOOD INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to discuss a provision of the \nBiggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 which reaffirms that \nprivate flood insurance can be used to satisfy a mandatory purchase \nrequirement. This provision defines the term ``private flood \ninsurance,'' and the definition makes a specific reference to private \nflood insurance from a surplus lines insurer in connection with \nnonresidential commercial property coverage. I would note, however, \nthat insurance provided by surplus lines insurers also can cover \nresidential properties--particularly when licensed and admitted \ninsurers are unwilling or unable to provide the desired coverage--and \nthis is authorized under state insurance law. The provision defines \nprivate flood insurance to include insurance provided by an insurer \n``licensed, admitted, or otherwise approved'' to engage in the business \nof insurance by a State. Surplus lines insurers, also sometimes known \nas nonadmitted insurers, are approved to conduct such business by \nStates. Is it the understanding of the Chairman that the ``private \nflood insurance'' definition includes surplus lines flood insurance \ncoverage?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator from Idaho for his question. The \nanswer is yes--the definition of ``private flood insurance'' includes \nprivate flood insurance provided by a surplus lines insurer and is not \nintended to limit surplus lines eligibility to nonresidential \nproperties. While the Senator is correct that surplus lines insurance \nis specifically mentioned in that context, overall the definition \naccommodates private flood insurance from insurers who are ``licensed, \nadmitted, or otherwise approved'' in the State where the property is \nlocated.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank my friend from South Dakota for this important \nclarification. This is an important issue, particularly in those \nlimited high-risk areas where surplus lines insurance serves as an \nessential part of the homeowners insurance market. I agree with his \nreading of the statute, because state law already sets the parameters \nas to when surplus lines insurance is acceptable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6051-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONOR FLIGHT 2012\n\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Having evolved from three \nearlier institutions--Franklin Male Academy, Louisburg Female Academy, \nand Louisburg Female College--Louisburg College is the oldest two-year \nresidential college in the Nation and the only one in North Carolina.\n  The college is praised for years for its value, personal teaching \nmethods, diversity, familial environment, and the way it prepares its \nstudents for future success.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor William E. \nSchulze, a veteran of World War II.\n  It is my honor to share the story of William's service in World War \nII, because no story of bravery--and especially not one from our \n``greatest generation''--should ever be forgotten.\n  Bill was born in Milwaukee, WI. A Golden Glove Boxing Champion, Bill \nwas working for the Pacific Bridge Company at Pearl Harbor as a welder \nwhen our Nation came under attack on December 7, 1941. Bill soon joined \nthe Navy and put his skills to use in the\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\n302nd Construction Battalion--known as the Sea-Bees. Bill and his unit \nwent from island to island across the Pacific building floating bridges \nfrom cargo ships to landing areas so that supplies could reach American \ntroops onshore. When one mission was complete, Bill and the Sea-Bees \npacked up their bridges and moved to the next island in support of \nAmerica's victories in the Pacific. Bill supported U.S. troops in Guam, \nSaipan, New Guinea and the Philippines, just to name a few. Without \nBill's efforts, our troops would have been left without needed arms and \nsupplies as they battled Japan's Imperial Army.\n  Bill earned the medals we will present today for his service during \nWorld War II, but I would be remiss not to mention his service in \nsupport of veterans long after the war concluded.\n  After World War II, Bill headed back to Wisconsin, started a family, \nand worked for 45 years as an engineer and a welder.\n  After his wife's passing, his love for the outdoors brought him to \nBillings where he remarried and made the lives of his fellow veterans a \nlittle easier.\n  Mind you, Bill was getting up in years himself by this point, but \nthat didn't stop him from volunteering as a driver for Disabled \nAmerican Veterans. In fact, Bill's last award before retiring once \nagain was for driving more than 10,000 miles, taking veterans back and \nforth to their medical appointments all over Montana.\n  But today we honor Bill's heroic service during World War II.\n  After his service, Bill Schulze did not receive all the medals he \nearned from the Navy. Earlier this month, it was my honor to finally \npresent William's widow Betty with the American Campaign Medal, the \nCombat Action Ribbon, and the Sharp Shooter Rifle Ribbon.\n  It was also my honor to present the Navy Discharge Button, the \nHonorable Service Lapel Pin, and an additional Bronze Star to the \nAsiatic Pacific Campaign Medal.\n  These decorations are small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of \ntrue heroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.\n  They are presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6052-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO LEWIS W.

Lewis, on behalf of all \nMontanans and all Americans, I thank you for your service to this \nNation.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Lewis Holzheimer's service in \nWorld War II because no story of heroism should ever fall through the \ncracks.\n  Lewis was born in Neihart, MT.\n  He was working as a lineman's apprentice in Cascade County when Pearl \nHarbor was attacked. He tried to enlist in Seattle but was turned away, \nbecause he did not have his birth certificate. He successfully enlisted \nin Montana and was sent to Fort Benning, GA, where he was trained to \noperate heavy weapons and was assigned to operate a Browning automatic \nrifle.\n  He was assigned to Company G, of the 60th Regiment of the 9th \nInfantry Division. He arrived in Normandy in early July 1944 on D-day \nplus 30. On August 8, 1944, Lewis was participating in the Battle of \nthe Hedge Rows when he was wounded in the foot. After recovering, he \nheaded back to his unit, only to find that they had been wiped out by \nwhat was believed to be a V-2 rocket attack. It turned out to be \nfriendly fire.\n  Lewis said the blast made a hole in the ground that looked like a \ndeep mine crater.\n  Lewis was reassigned to Company B in the same regiment. On December \n12, his unit was responsible for an attack on the town of Hoven in \nBelgium for which they were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.\n  Lewis demonstrated outstanding bravery during that attack and was \npromoted to staff sergeant.\n  His unit went on to see heavy action in the Battle of the Hurtgen \nForest from late 1944 until early 1945. On the 1st of February 1945, \nLewis's company was cut off from the rest of his regiment and was \npinned down by sniper fire. The members of the company took turns \nrunning back toward the nearest American forces. When Lewis ran, he was \nshot under his left arm. When he informed his scout that he was wounded \nand would have to seek medical attention, a shell exploded near them. \nDespite being severely wounded, Lewis insisted that his scout be taken \nto the hospital first. He was informed that the scout was dead, was \ncarried to a jeep, and was then taken to the nearest field hospital.\n  Lewis nearly lost his leg and underwent several years of surgery and \nrehabilitation. He still carries the shrapnel in him today.\n  After his service, Lewis Holzheimer never received the medals he \nearned from the Army.\n  Last month, in the presence of his family, it was my honor to finally \npresent to Lewis his Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart with one Bronze \nOak Leaf Cluster, Combat Infantryman Badge, and his Presidential Unit \nCitation.\n  These decorations are small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of \ntrue heroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6052-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO HERBERT S.

Herb, on behalf of all Montanans \nand all Americans, I thank you for your service to this Nation.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Herb Kindsfater's service to our \nNation. Herb was born in Rocky Fort, CO. At the age of 17, he tried to \njoin the Navy, but was turned away. He was told he could join the Army \nor work in the Butte silver mines, and he chose the Army.\n  Herb was a machine gunner in Company H, 172nd Regiment, 43rd Infantry \nDivision--the ``Green Mountain Boys'' of Vermont. Herb's unit served in \nthe Pacific Theater. He engaged in combat in the Solomon Islands and \nNew Guinea, where he suffered injuries from shrapnel.\n  In the Philippines, Herb and his fellow soldiers fought mile-by-mile \nto reach Manila. They then took the island of Luzon. At Ipo Dam, Herb \nwas badly wounded in both arms, and he spent months recuperating in a \nhospital.\n  After his military service, Herb moved to Billings where he married \nhis wife Betty and worked for the railroad. During the first several \nyears of their marriage, he still suffered from malaria that he had \ncontracted in the war.\n  After serving his country with honor, Herb never received all of the \nmedals he earned from the Army.\n  Earlier this month, in the presence of his wife Betty and his son \nBruce, it was my honor to finally present to Herb his Bronze Star, a \nPurple Heart, and a Good Conduct Medal.\n  It was also my honor to present a Presidential Unit Citation, an \nAsiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with three Bronze Service Stars, and a \nWorld War II Victory Medal.\n  Earlier this month, I also presented to Herb a Combat Infantry Badge \nFirst Award, a Philippine Liberation Ribbon with one Bronze Service \nStar, and a Honorable Service Lapel Button.\n  These decorations are small tokens, but they are powerful symbols of \ntrue heroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6052-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6052-S6053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO NICHOLAS J.

He became an Army \nscout assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, \n2-9 Cavalry Regiment.\n  Nicholas arrived in Iraq in October 2005. He served in the north and \ncentral zones near Baghdad, Mosul, Adwar and\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\nTikrit. While in country, Nicholas survived gunshots, 24 I.E.D. blasts, \nand a helicopter crash. He continues to be treated for injuries that he \nsuffered in the war.\n  Since retiring from the Army in 2008, Nicholas attended the \nUniversity of Montana and now drives trucks in North Dakota.\n  After serving his country with honor, Nicholas Wells never received \nall of the medals he earned from the Army.\n  Earlier this month, in the presence of his family, it was my honor to \nfinally present to Nicholas his Iraq Campaign Medal with two Bronze \nStars.

Now, ProLiteracy is \nmoving to the Near West Side of Syracuse. The renovated building is an \nenvironmentally and technologically advanced facility that allows the \norganization to produce and test new and better curricula and \neducational materials, as well as to develop and implement local \ntraining, technical assistance, and professional development projects. \nThe knowledge, best practices, and key findings ProLiteracy will \ngenerate through these efforts will be shared locally, nationally, and \nglobally.\n  Because ProLiteracy's headquarters will be located in an area readily \naccessible to adult learners, the organization is providing learning \nexperiences such as an adult literacy library housing New Readers Press \nmaterials and other resources.\n  ProLiteracy is to be commended for the work they do and the efforts \nthey support every day to help increase the quality of and access to \nadult literacy services. An estimated 30 million adults nationwide do \nnot yet have the basic literacy skills to read or write above a fifth-\ngrade level.

Mr. President, today I would like to take a \nmoment to recognize a fellow West Virginian who has devoted himself to \nthe service of our State and the advancement of our education system. \nAs a former college president, I know how invaluable education is to \nbuilding our communities, growing our economy, and raising and \ninspiring the next generation. I commend West Virginia State school \nboard member Lloyd Jackson for his enduring commitment to such an \nimportant cause.\n  My friend, Lloyd Jackson served as a State senator for 12 years and \nhe has been a leader in improving both the early and higher education \nsystems of West Virginia. While a senator, he was the primary sponsor \nof the PROMISE scholarship legislation, a merit-based financial aid \nprogram that has helped thousands of West Virginians afford college.\n  He has also been a vocal advocate for prekindergarten care, and his \ndedication has led to vast improvements in our State's preschool \neducation. He began his fight through personal experience; his wife had \nto drive their children long distances to a private day care because of \nthe lack of access in their area. Mr. Jackson believed that all \nchildren should have the same chance to receive a quality early \neducation.\n  As State senate education chairman, Mr. Jackson championed \ncomprehensive early childhood legislation. In 2002, he helped create \nWest Virginia Universal Pre-K and put the State on track to have \nuniversal access by 2012. Thanks to his efforts, West Virginia is today \nconsidered a leader in providing public and universal preschool \neducation. In the 2011-12 school year, over 15,000 children were \nenrolled in prekindergarten, and this year every 4-year-old in the \nState will have access to quality schooling. In a 2011 report, West \nVirginia ranked fifth in the Nation in preschool access for 4-year-olds \nand fourth in spending on prekindergarten programs.\n  Lloyd Jackson has fought long and hard to make sure our children are \nreceiving the education they deserve. I applaud his commitment to \neducation, and I am proud of the success he has helped West Virginia \nachieve. Providing our children with a strong education is the greatest \ninvestment we could make in the future of our State and of our Nation. \nLloyd Jackson deserves our appreciation, and I am proud to have worked \nwith him for years and I am delighted to congratulate him for all he \nhas done for education in West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6053-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO KENNETH AND VANESE CEDAR\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, every year I have the honor, \nas a member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, to \nrecognize a West Virginia family for its efforts to promote adoption \nand provide homes for our Nation's vulnerable children. It is a \nwonderful program that highlights the change one couple can make in the \nlife of a child.\n  Throughout my career, I have been a strong advocate of legislation \nthat supports adoption and other permanency efforts. I am inspired by \nthe men and women who devote their lives to caring for these children. \nToday, I would like to recognize one such West Virginian family: \nKenneth and Vanese Cedar, who are truly angels in adoption.\n  Kenneth and Vanese have cared for 57 children over the years, \nincluding two biological sons of their own. Currently, they have \nadopted three children and serve as guardians for two teenagers. They \nalso care for a foster child. They have raised their children in a \nclose and devoted family, taking them to church, teaching them \ngardening and cooking, and playing sports together.\n  Even when challenges have arisen, Kenneth and Vanese have remained \ndedicated to helping their own family and other children in need. In \n2009, Kenneth lost his job. Yet the couple took the obstacle as an \nopportunity to go back to school and earn regents bachelor of arts \ndegrees, which they hope to use in social work and child protective \nservices. When one of their sons nearly passed away from acute \nrespiratory disease syndrome, they stood together as a family until he \nrecovered, and he recently welcomed a child of his own.\n  Kenneth and Vanese Cedar are a selfless and giving couple who deserve \nour respect and admiration. They have provided so many children with \nnot simply a home but a family. I would like to thank these angels in \nadoption for the love and care they have provided to so many. They are \ntruly an inspiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6053-4", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6053-S6054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DAVE AND LAURA WHELCHEL\n\n Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \nremarkable foster couple from Harrisburg, NE, whom I recently nominated \nto be 2012 `Angels in Adoption' recipients. Dave and Laura Whelchel are \nthe parents of two grown biological children, Chance and Jenna, as well \nas four adopted children, Reuben, Josefina, Arielle and San Juan, who \nare siblings. They are hoping to finalize the adoption of a fifth \nsibling, Kayleigh, by the end of the year. Each of the adopted children \nhas come into their home with special physical, occupational or speech \ntherapy needs.\n  Dave and Laura's dedication to providing these children with the love \nand support they need is incredible. As I witnessed firsthand during a \nvisit to their family farm in August, the Whelchels are doing an \noutstanding job ensuring their children are able to live full and happy \nlives.\n  But the Whelchels' kindness and compassion does not stop with their\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\nchildren. Three years ago, the couple created Camp Grace, a summer camp \nfor other children with special needs. Held monthly at the Whelchel \nfarm, the camp is designed to help children work toward specific \ntherapy goals. They also donate countless hours of their time \ncoordinating with volunteers, therapists, and other families to ensure \nthe camp's success.\n  It is an honor to nominate Dave and Laura as `Angels in Adoption'. \nThe award, which honors those who have enriched the lives of foster and \nadopted children in the U.S., is a small token of appreciation for the \nlove and compassion they have shown their children over the years. I \ncould not think of a more deserving family for this award. My hope is \nthat more families will follow the wonderful example set by the \nWhelchels by providing loving homes to deserving children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6054-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO RYAN AND AMBER JOHNSON\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Ryan and \nAmber Johnson of Sioux Falls, SD, as my nominees for the 2012 Angels in \nAdoption Award. Since 1999, the Angels in Adoption program through the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption Institution has honored more than \n1,800 individuals, couples, and organizations nationwide for their work \nin providing children with loving, stable homes.\n  After being married for only a short time, Ryan and Amber Johnson \nbegan to consider expanding their family. After overcoming initial \npersonal setbacks, the Johnson family decided to open their home to \nchildren in need by becoming foster parents. The couple quickly \naccepted the opportunity to become long-term foster parents of three \nsiblings between the ages of 7 months and 6 years, and later, the \nJohnsons provided a temporary, loving home for a 4-year-old foster \nchild. The Johnsons were soon blessed again with two Native American \nhalf-brothers as foster children. It quickly became evident to Ryan and \nAmber how wonderful the addition of these two boys was to their family. \nShortly after, Ryan and Amber adopted Lukias, age 3, and are in the \nprocess of finalizing the adoption of his younger brother. During the \nadoption process, the Johnson family learned that they were pregnant, \nand on May 1, 2011, welcomed their newest family member, Sophia. The \nyoung family now consists of 3 siblings, ages 1, 2, and 3.\n  Foster homes regularly see children come and go, staying for varying \nlengths of time. The changing environment often places an emotional \ntoll on the caregivers who develop deep, personal relationships with \ntheir foster children. Despite the challenges that foster parents face, \nthe Johnsons have used their life lessons to create a warm, loving home \nfor children in need of a nurturing environment to grow and develop. \nRyan and Amber plan to continue taking in foster children and possibly \neven expand their family by giving other children a place to call home.\n  National Adoption Day is around the corner, and it is important to \nrecognize the compassionate families who bring joy to the lives of \nchildren as foster and adoptive parents. It brings me great pride to be \nable to honor South Dakotans Ryan and Amber Johnson, my nominees for \nthe 2012 Angels in Adoption Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6054-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ALAN HAMEL\n\n Mr. UDALL of COLORADO. Mr. President, today I wish to pay \ntribute to a true leader of Colorado's water community, Mr. Alan Hamel. \nAlan retired from his position on the Board of Water Works of Pueblo, \nCO, at the end of August after more than 50 years of service for the \nboard.\n  Alan began his career as a student helper in 1960 working summers for \nthe board. He returned after graduating from Colorado State University \nin Pueblo to become a full-time pump station operator. Over the next 20 \nyears, Alan worked his way up the ladder through various management \npositions until he was appointed executive director in 1982.\n  Under Alan's direction, Pueblo has built one of the most modern water \ninfrastructure systems in the Nation. Because of his leadership, the \nPueblo area's future water supplies are sufficient and secure, which is \ntruly impressive given all of the water challenges facing Colorado. The \nboard has also benefited from extraordinary continuity during Alan's \n29-year tenure at the helm, which I am confident will continue under \nnew executive director Terry Book's guidance.\n  Alan has also been a water leader statewide. He is a member of the \nColorado Water Conservation Board, CWCB, Colorado Water Congress, CWC, \nand Statewide Water Supply Initiative. He has also held leadership \npositions on the Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District and \nArkansas Basin Roundtable among many others. He also received CWC's top \naward in 2010, the prestigious Wayne Aspinall Water Leader of the Year \nAward, for his lifetime of achievement.\n  On a more personal level, Alan has earned the respect and admiration \nof the Colorado water community because he is a true public servant in \nthe best sense of the word. He is unflappable, a fountain of knowledge \nabout water, and always seeks common ground with opposing views while \nfighting fiercely and fairly for the needs of his community. He cares \ndeeply about Pueblo and Colorado and has served both remarkably.\n  And above all, Alan is a family man who knows none of this could be \npossible without the support of his wife Mary Kay and children. While \nhe lives and breathes water, his family comes first and foremost.\n  As with most water warriors, Alan's retirement will only be partial. \nHe will continue his work on CWCB and the Arkansas Basin Roundtable, \nand I am sure many of us will still call upon his wisdom and experience \noften. I suppose after more than 50 years of service he has earned the \nright to switch to part-time work.\n  I wish him well in his next endeavors and congratulate him on an \nimpressive career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6054-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6054-4", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/10/senate-section/article/S6054-5", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6054-S6055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on August 3, 2012, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nthat the Clerk is directed to inform the Senate that the House of \nRepresentatives failed to agree to the resolution of the Senate (S. \nCon.
