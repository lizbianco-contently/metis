Madam President, the next hour will be equally divided, \nwith the majority controlling the first half and Republicans \ncontrolling the final half. We will continue to debate flood insurance. \nI hope we can reach an agreement to complete action on this bill. We \nalso need to consider the transportation and the student loan \nextensions before the end of this week.\n  There are a lot of things going on on Capitol Hill today. We have \nbeen in touch with the Speaker's office. Our staffs have been meeting. \nWhen we come to these kinds of bills, the Finance Committee is \nextremely important. And Senator Baucus and I have had many meetings \nwith him and conversations with him. The Senator is key to getting \neverything done. He is needed on the highway bill, he is needed on the \nflood insurance bill, and he is needed in student loans. He realizes \nthat and has a tremendous obligation and burden to bear, but he always \ncomes through. He has a good relationship with his counterpart in the \nHouse, David Camp.\n  I am cautiously optimistic we can end this week tomorrow even, with a \nlittle bit of luck, but we may not be able to. We have to see what \nhappens in the next 24 hours, which will be key.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Monday's U.S. Supreme Court decision striking most of the \nunconstitutional Arizona immigration law reaffirms something most of us \nalready knew: the onus is on Congress to repair our broken system. No \none denies that the system is broken. But in the 40 hours since the \nSupreme Court's ruling, Republicans have engaged in revisionist history \nto explain why it has taken so long to fix it.\n  Here are the facts. When Democrats brought a comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill to the floor in 2007, Republicans filibustered \nthe legislation. This legislation was led by Senator McCain and Senator \nKennedy, among others. The Republicans filibustered this legislation \neven though Republican President Bush supported it. They twice \nfilibustered the DREAM Act, which would allow children brought to the \nUnited States by their parents to go to college, serve in the military, \nand work toward citizenship.\n  Democrats have done everything that is humanly possible to pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform. We have been trying to do it for \nyears. Two Congresses ago, we spent more time on immigration on the \nfloor than any other issue, and we were spending that time because we \nwere being slow-walked by the Republicans.\n\n[[Page S4646]]\n\n  The Republicans are divided on this issue; we are not. Ninety percent \nof Democrats support comprehensive immigration reform and, of course, \nthe DREAM Act. Everytime Democrats offer to work together on \ncomprehensive immigration reform, even bringing to the floor bipartisan \nideas originally proposed by Republicans, the other side finds an \nexcuse not to support the change.\n\n  On the floor today is the senior Senator from Illinois, the assistant \nmajority leader. He was one of the pushers of the DREAM Act. He had \nwith him two Republican Senators who were pushing just as hard, but \nthose two Senators have disappeared in supporting the legislation. Yet \nRepublicans blame Democrats for inaction. Well, they cannot have it \nboth ways--they cannot blame Democrats for not passing a bipartisan \nimmigration bill when they are the ones who blocked the bill.\n  Moving forward, Congress has two things in its favor. Thanks to \nPresident Obama's decisive action, the specter of deportation no longer \nhangs over the heads of 800,000 young men and women brought to the \ncountry as children. And the Supreme Court offered yet another \naffirmation that a long-term fix for a broken immigration system must \ncome from Congress and not from the States.\n  Now is not the time for Republicans to continue this harangue that \nthey have had: It is not our fault. It is time for them to work with us \nfor a reasonable solution, one that continues to secure our borders, \npunishes unscrupulous employers who exploit immigrants and undercut \nAmerican wages, improves our dysfunctional legal immigration system, \nand finally requires the 11 million people who are undocumented to \nregister with the government, pay fines, taxes, learn English, and then \nthey do not go to the front of the line, they go to the back of the \nline. They do this in order to change their status. If my Republican \ncolleagues truly care about changing the status quo, they should step \nforward now and work with Democrats, not criticize from the sidelines. \nUnfortunately, Republicans who once favored a permanent solution for \nAmerica's broken immigration system are deserting efforts to find \ncommon ground.\n  The only decisive Republican voice on this issue today seems to be \nfrom Mitt Romney, who has called the unconstitutional Arizona law the \n``model for the Nation.'' That is what he said. He has also promised to \nveto the DREAM Act. He said that, I didn't. Democrats believe that the \nkind of institutionalized racism in the Arizona law is hardly the \n``model for reform'' in a country that stands for liberty and justice \nfor all. We believe upstanding young people who have never known any \nhome but the United States of America should be able to go to college, \nfight for their country, and contribute to society, not face \ndeportation. But at least we know where Mitt Romney stands on those \nissues, even if we disagree with him. He is for vetoing the DREAM Act, \nand he believes the Arizona law is the ``model'' for our country. That \nis really too bad.\n  As long as Republicans remain unwilling to vote for comprehensive, \nbipartisan immigration reform, we will remain at an impasse. I want my \nRepublican colleagues to know this: As soon as they are willing to join \nus to craft a commonsense legislative solution that is tough, fair, and \npractical, we are ready to join them.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nfollowing hour will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with the majority controlling the first \nhalf and the Republicans controlling the final half.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me follow up on what the majority leader spoke to on \nthe issue of immigration because this is the right time to bring it up.\n  I had several meetings yesterday that were as touching emotionally as \nanything I have witnessed as a Senator. They were students who came \nfrom all over the United States of America to walk peacefully in front \nof the Supreme Court. They were DREAMers, undocumented students who \nhave attended schools or are attending colleges and schools in America. \nThey are not asking for special treatment, they are asking for a \nchance--a chance to earn their way into the only country they have ever \ncalled home.\n  These poor kids out there literally have no country. They were \nbrought here to the United States as babies and infants. They did not \nhave a choice in the matter. They were packed into a car or onto a bus. \nThey grew up in America. As Senator Menendez from New Jersey often \nsays--he comes to the floor and reminds us that these kids put their \nhands on their hearts and they pledge allegiance to flags every day. \nThey only know one national anthem: America's. They are just asking for \na chance to be part of this country.\n\n  Eleven years ago, I introduced a bill called the DREAM Act. It was a \nbipartisan bill, as Senator Reid said. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah was \nmy cosponsor. In fact, we had words over who would be the lead sponsor. \nI bowed in his direction because he was the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I felt, well, that will help us pass the bill. \nSadly, today there are only a handful of Republican Senators who will \neven vote for it and virtually none who openly sponsor it at this \nmoment. What has happened in 11 years? These kids have not changed. \nTheir problems are the same. The country has not changed; it is still a \nnation of immigrants. Yet the Republican Party has decided it has no \nuse for this approach. There are exceptions. I thank those exceptions.\n  Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana, a courageous man, 2 years ago wrote a \nletter with me to President Obama asking him to give temporary \nprotected status to the DREAM Act students. I called Senator Lugar the \nmorning of that announcement, on June 15, to thank him for his courage. \nIt is rare, and it should be recognized. In his case, I believe it will \nbe recognized by many.\n  Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted with me on the DREAM Act. That \nwas a courageous move on her part. I thanked her for it. She is a very \nindependent person. She said that there are Hispanics in Alaska--though \nyou may not think it--and they are watching this carefully and closely.\n  Let me also salute Senator Marco Rubio. Some of my colleagues have \ncriticized him for what he said about the DREAM Act. I have not. I am \nglad he is trying. I need Republican votes to break the Republican \nfilibuster on the DREAM Act. Marco Rubio came to my office and offered \na good-faith effort to do it. I told him: I will stand by you. I think \nwhat you are trying to achieve is not what I want completely, but it is \non the path to that goal. Let's work on it together.\n  He tried. I salute him for trying. I hope he will try again.\n  I look at the situation in this country today on immigration and \nwonder, can this Congress come together on a bipartisan basis and even \nhonestly debate the issue? That is a challenge we should face because \nthe problem is out there.\n  The other day my friend--and he is my friend--Senator McCain of \nArizona came to the floor and talked about border problems in Arizona. \nIt is a legitimate concern in his State and the border States. But I \nalso would call to his attention an article I read this morning in the \nNational Journal Daily that was written by Major Garrett. It talks \nabout what we have done on the borders of America. Now, I was one of \nthose who thought we were going overboard--too many agents, too much \nmoney, too many different ideas.\n  But I bought into it and said if we have to do this first, let's do \nit. Even if it is more than I think is necessary, let's do it to prove \nour bona fides in terms of wanting to stop illegal immigration. Here is \nwhat Major Garrett wrote in the National Journal Daily:\n\n       After President George W. Bush's attempt at comprehensive \n     immigration reform failed, Congress adopted a default \n     presumption in favor of spending more every year on border\n\n[[Page S4647]]\n\n     control. From 2008 to 2012, Congress devoted $17.8 billion \n     for U.S. Border Patrol agents and equipment. From 2006 to \n     2012, the number of Border Patrol agents has increased 73 \n     percent (from 12,350 agents to 21,370). The number of agents \n     assigned to the nation's Southwest border increased 67 \n     percent (from 11,032 to 18,415).\n       The House Homeland Security spending bill for fiscal 2013 \n     devotes $11.7 billion to Customs and Border Patrol, $77 \n     million more than President Obama requested. It also pegs \n     spending for ICE (Immigration Control Agency) at $5.8 \n     billion, a $142 million increase over Obama's budget request.\n       The nation now has more Border Patrol agents and ICE \n     detention beds (34,000) than at any time in history. For \n     context, Border Patrol apprehensions totaled 340,252 in \n     fiscal 2011. That's down 53 percent from 2008 (due in part to \n     the recession and lack of available work). But that number of \n     apprehensions was one-fifth the 2000 total.\n       Criminal and noncriminal deportations are also up. Way up. \n     This, too, is a bipartisan achievement.\n\n  He goes on to cite numbers showing that the Obama administration has \ndeported more in the name of prioritizing deportations than even the \nBush administration.\n  So to those who say we need to get tough at the border and tough in \nterms of deportation, I say the evidence is there. In fact, it is \noverwhelming that we have done that. My challenge back to them is: Now \ncan we talk about what to do about the 10 million or 11 million \nAmericans living here who are in questionable status or undocumented? \nCan we come up with a reasonable approach that is fair to them, to \ntheir families, to the Nation, and to the workers of this country? I \nthink we can and we should. Why else are we elected if we don't face an \nissue like that?\n  The State of Arizona basically lost in the U.S. Supreme Court this \nweek. Out of four major provisions in the law, three were stricken, and \none was put on probation. The Supreme Court said we are going to watch \nyou, Arizona, and if you do this wrong, we will be back. In fairness to \nArizona, their argument is that until there is a national immigration \nlaw, we are going to take matters in our own hands. The Supreme Court \nsaid: Not so fast. And that doesn't absolve us from our responsibility \nto Arizona and other States.\n  We have to move together to get this done. I have been listening \ncarefully, and I know where President Obama is on this issue. I sat a \nfew feet away from him in this Chamber working on comprehensive \nimmigration reform with Senators Obama, McCain, and Specter, trying to \nget this done. I know it was a genuine effort. I don't know where \nGovernor Romney stands. He said he would veto the DREAM Act. Is that \nthe starting point of his immigration policy? I hope not. I hope he \nwill reconsider that. I hope he will say--as I hope others will say--\nwhat the President did in granting temporary renewable protected status \nto these DREAM students is going to be the standard until we pass a \npermanent law. That is only fair. Looking in the eyes of those students \nyesterday, I have to tell you that is our responsibility--to do the \nhumane, just thing.\n  I will close because I see my colleague from Rhode Island on the \nfloor, and he wants to speak in morning business. I got started in this \njourney because of a young lady named Theresa Lee. She was a Korean \nliving in Chicago, who was from a very poor family and decided that her \nonly ticket to a future was the piano. She became an accomplished \npianist, to the point where she was seeking admission to Juilliard in \nthe State of New York, and the Manhattan Conservatory, and only when it \ncalled for a Social Security number did she realize she had a problem.\n  She had been brought here at the age of 2 from Brazil, where she was \nborn, by her Korean parents, and they never filed a paper. She called \nour office and we found out there was no recourse for her, no place to \nturn. The law said leave the country for 10 years and apply to come \nback in. That isn't fair. So she went on to school at Manhattan \nConservatory of Music to study piano. Two families--the Foreman family \nand the Harris family--in Chicago paid for her education because they \nbelieved in this young girl.\n  There is a happy ending to her story. She not only graduated from the \nManhattan Conservatory of Music, she played in Carnegie Hall. She had \nher debut concert there and is now studying for a PhD in music at the \nManhattan Conservatory. She married a young man, and she is now a \ncitizen. She could have been lost. Her talents could have been lost to \nthis country if the law had been followed 11 years ago as it was \nwritten. She was given a chance and proved she was a person of quality \nwho had something to give back to this great Nation with her musical \nskills and, ultimately, her talents in writing and teaching music.\n  It is a great story and a lesson for all of us about the DREAM Act \nand what it needs to be. I urge my colleagues, many of whom have turned \na blind eye to this, to meet these young people, look them in the eye, \nand they will come to know this isn't just a legal issue, this is a \nhuman issue that will define us not only as a Congress but as a Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, before I embark on my own remarks, \nlet me say how pleased I am to have a chance to follow the Senator from \nIllinois. I have had the chance to preside in the Senate, as the \nSenator from New York is doing now, on several occasions, and to be \npresent on the floor on other occasions when Senator Durbin has come to \nthe floor to speak about the DREAM Act and his passion for the \nopportunity it provides to young people who are in this country through \nno fault of their own, who know no other home in the world, and who \nwill one day be great Americans--people who will be leaders and \nperformers and experts and scientists and provide great value to our \ncountry--I am delighted he is doing it again. His persistence matches \nhis passion. And, finally, with the President's decision the other day, \nit is beginning to reap some rewards. I hope there is more to come in \nthe future.\n  Madam President, I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Environmental Health\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I will speak on carbon pollution and \nthe damage we are doing to our world. As I try to point out every \nweek--and last week I was not able to, but Senator Kerry made a \nwonderful, marvelous, very compelling speech on this subject. We have \nkept the floor busy every week between the two of us. I hope other \nSenators will join us more and more.\n  This is an issue we have to address. It is a disgrace, frankly, that \nthis is one of the very few buildings in this country in which climate \ndenial is still happening wholesale. Here and the boardroom of \nExxonMobil are probably the two holdout locations.\n  I want to address a few things that happened this week. I want to \nbegin by correcting an error I made in remarks last week when I came to \nthe floor and spoke in favor of EPA's mercury and air toxic standards \nfor powerplants.\n  This is very important to Rhode Island, as we are a downwind State--\nas is a good deal of New York--and we are bombarded by Midwestern \npowerplants that, frankly, deliberately send polluted air into the \natmosphere through high smokestacks so that it will land elsewhere. \nGuess what. We are the elsewhere.\n  We were about to vote on a resolution that would have avoided these \nstandards and put Rhode Island at considerable peril. It would have \ngone so far as to bar the EPA from ever issuing a similar rule. It \nwould have had a lasting, as well as damaging, effect. It was a \nreckless proposal. I am pleased we defeated it in the Senate.\n  During my remarks about this rule, I discussed the health hazards \nthat mercury pollution poses for the people of my Rhode Island, the \npollution that comes out of these tall smokestacks, very often with no \nscrubbers of any kind, and which spews right out and comes to Rhode \nIsland in the form of ozone, which causes us to have ``bad air days,'' \nwhere children, people with breathing difficulties, and old folks have \nto stay indoors. They are basically kept prisoners indoors because of \nout-of-State polluters who won't clean up their act. The other thing is \nmercury and mercury poisoning, which is serious in my State.\n  The Rhode Island Department of Health warns that ``high-risk'' \npopulations--pregnant women, women who\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\nmay become pregnant, and small children--should not eat any freshwater \nfish in Rhode Island because of the danger of mercury poison and \nmercury contamination. That is sadly correct. I also said that the \nhealth department warns that no one should ever eat any of the fish \ncaught in three bodies of water in Rhode Island--the Quidnick \nReservoir, Wincheck Pond, and Yawgoog Pond. That sadly is also true.\n  Finally, I said the health department suggests that anyone who \ncatches freshwater fish in Rhode Island should limit their intake to \none serving of this fish a month to protect their health from mercury \ncontamination. In fact, it is more nuanced than that. The health \ndepartment has issued different warnings for the general population \ndepending on the body of water. So it is not always true that anybody \nwho catches freshwater fish should limit it to one serving a month. I \nsuggest Rhode Islanders consider consulting the health department's Web \nsite, where the agency lists fish advisories by pond and river. That \nway they can make an informed decision for themselves and their \nfamilies as to where and when fish are safe to eat.\n  It doesn't obviously change the larger point that mercury \ncontamination is a continuing public health problem in Rhode Island, \nand one we can do little about without EPA defending us, because in \nthese other States it is a great deal for them to be able to poison our \nState's water but get cheaper power in their States because they don't \nforce their utilities to put scrubbers on and to keep themselves \noperating at appropriate levels of pollution control.\n  On that same front, this was a good news week from the EPA. They have \nfought hard to show that carbon dioxide is in fact a pollutant under \nthe Clean Air Act. That case was taken all the way to the Supreme \nCourt, and the Court agreed that could be the case if the EPA \ndetermined those greenhouse gases might ``reasonably be anticipated to \nendanger public health or welfare.'' The EPA went forward and, in 2009, \nthey made this endangerment finding. There have been delays along the \nway, but I won't get into the history of that rule under the Bush \nadministration now.\n  The EPA made that endangerment finding and promulgated three \nadditional rules, which are the tailpipe rule, which sets greenhouse \ngas emissions for motor vehicles; the timing rule, which clarifies when \nthe stationary sources are required to meet pollution standards for \ngreenhouse gases; third is the tailoring rule, which limits the \napplication of this rule to the big polluters so that you are not going \nafter small or inconsequential sources, you are targeting the folks who \nare putting out tons of pollution.\n  That was a very good day. The DC Circuit decision was quite strong. I \nwill take a moment to read some of it into the Record:\n\n       Industry Petitioners also assert that the scientific \n     evidence does not adequately support the Endangerment \n     Finding. As we have stated before in reviewing the science-\n     based decisions of agencies such as EPA, ``[a]lthough we \n     perform a searching and careful inquiry into the facts \n     underlying the agency's decisions, we will presume the \n     validity of agency action as long as a rational basis for it \n     is presented.''\n\n  They went on to say this:\n\n       The body of scientific evidence marshaled by EPA in support \n     of the Endangerment Finding is substantial. EPA's scientific \n     evidence of record included support for the proposition that \n     greenhouse gases trap heat on earth that would otherwise \n     dissipate into space; that this ``greenhouse effect'' warms \n     the climate; that human activity is contributing to increased \n     atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases; and that the climate \n     system is warming.\n       Based on this scientific record, EPA made the linchpin \n     finding: in its judgment, the ``root cause'' of the recently \n     observed climate changes is ``very likely'' the observed \n     increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  And they continue below:\n\n       Relying again upon substantial scientific evidence, EPA \n     determined that anthropogenically induced climate change \n     threatens both public health and public welfare. It found \n     extreme weather events, changes in air quality, increases \n     in food-borne and waterborne pathogens, and increases in \n     temperature are likely to have adverse health effects. The \n     record also supports EPA's conclusion that climate change \n     endangers human welfare by creating risk to food \n     production and agriculture, forestry, energy, \n     infrastructure, ecosystems, and wildlife. Substantial \n     evidence further supported EPA's conclusion that the \n     warming resulting from the greenhouse gas emissions could \n     be expected to create risks to water resources and in \n     general to coastal areas--\n\n  Such as my home State of Rhode Island, I will interject--\n\n     as a result of expected increase in sea level.\n       Industry Petitioners do not find fault with much of the \n     substantial record EPA amassed in support of the Endangerment \n     Finding--\n\n  Nor could they, I would interject--\n\n     rather, they contend that the record evidences too much \n     uncertainty to support that judgment. But the existence of \n     some uncertainty does not, without more, warrant invalidation \n     of an endangerment finding.\n       As we have stated before, ``Awaiting certainty will often \n     allow for only reactive, not preventive, regulation. This \n     language [in the Clean Air Act describing endangerment \n     findings] requires a precautionary, forward-looking \n     scientific judgment about the risks of a particular air \n     pollutant, consistent with the Clean Air Act's \n     ``precautionary and preventive orientation.''\n\n  So here we have three judges of the rather conservative District of \nColumbia Court of Appeals throwing out all of the challenges to the \nendangerment findings--the ``tailpipe'' rule, the ``timing'' rule, and \nthe ``tailoring'' rule--and recognizing that although there may be some \ndoubt on the fringes, there is plenty of evidence for reasonable people \nto take sensible precautions and to do what is right.\n  As I have said before in other speeches, there is a strategy that is \nbeing pursued by the polluting industries, and it is to create enough \ndoubt not to affect what is really happening out there but to affect \npublic judgment; to put enough propaganda into the system that people \nthink: Oh, maybe we shouldn't be so sure about this.\n  The context I put that doubt in is how prudent a parent would be for \nthe care of a child. The statistics are that 97 percent of practicing \nclimate scientists acknowledge climate change is happening, that we are \ncausing it with carbon pollution, and we have to get serious about it--\n97 percent.\n  So translate that to your own life as a parent. Your child has \nsymptoms, doesn't look right, and you go to the doctor. The doctors \nsays: I am pretty sure she has this condition and she needs treatment.\n  The treatments may be a little unpleasant, a little expensive, so you \nwant to be careful and you decide to get a second opinion. You go to \nanother doctor, and the doctor says the exact same thing. But you have \na friend who is a doctor, and so you decide to get a third opinion. You \ngo to your friend and you get a third opinion. At that point most \nprudent parents would probably act.\n  What the polluting industry and the people who support them in this \nChamber expect us to do is to act like that parent except go to 100 \ndoctors, get 99 second opinions, and then, when only three of them say \nyour kid is OK, don't worry about it, you don't need to do a thing, or \nthere is some doubt about what the disease is, even though 97 percent \nof those doctors say, yes, she is sick, you better get her this \ntreatment--and ignore the 97 percent. Listen to the 3 percent. No \ndecent parent would do that. In fact, you would probably lose your \nright to continue to be a parent for your child in those circumstances \nif the child welfare agency became aware of the kind of risk you were \nputting your child in in those circumstances. But that is the way they \nwant us to behave in this institution.\n  I am at a loss for a word to describe what kind of logic it is that \nwould be appropriate to the dignity and decorum of this particular \nChamber.\n  There is a magazine--a rather conservative magazine--called The \nEconomist. It is hardly associated with liberal or environmental \ncauses. It is a world magazine. They have just done a special that is \ncalled ``The Vanishing North,'' about what is happening in the Arctic. \nIn the summary of the report, they say:\n\n       The Arctic's glaciers, including those of Greenland's vast \n     ice cap, are retreating. The land is thawing: the area \n     covered by snow in June is roughly a fifth less than in the \n     1960s. The permafrost is shrinking. Alien plants, birds, fish \n     and animals are creeping north: Atlantic mackerel, haddock \n     and cod are coming up in Arctic nets. Some Arctic species \n     will probably die out.\n       It is a stunning illustration of global warming, the cause \n     of the melt. It also contains grave warnings of its dangers. \n     The world would be mad to ignore them.\n\n  It is printed in England, so ``mad'' has the English sense of the \nword ``insane.''\n  The report continues:\n\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\n\n       The main reason appears to be a catalytic warming effect, \n     triggered by global warning. When snow or ice melt, they are \n     replaced by darker melt-water pools, land or sea. As a \n     result, the Arctic surface absorbs more solar heat. This \n     causes local warming, therefore more melting, which causes \n     more warming, and so on. This positive feedback shows how \n     even a small change to the Earth's systems can trigger much \n     greater ones.\n\n  The report continues:\n\n       The worry that needs to be taken most seriously is climate \n     change itself. The impact of the melting Arctic may have a \n     calamitous effect on the planet. It is likely to disrupt \n     oceanic circulation--the mixing of warm tropical and cold \n     polar waters, of which the gulf stream is a part--and thawing \n     permafrost will lead to the emission of masses of carbon \n     dioxide and methane, and thus further warming. It is also \n     raising sea levels. The Greenland ice sheet has recently shed \n     around 200 gigatonnes of ice a year, a fourfold increase on a \n     decade ago. If the warming continues, it could eventually \n     disintegrate, raising the sea level by seven meters.\n\n  The ocean State of Rhode Island could ill-afford a sea-level rise of \n7 meters.\n\n       Many of the world's biggest cities--\n\n  And the Senator from New York, who is presiding, represents one of \nthe worlds's biggest--\n\n     would be inundated long before that happened.\n\n  That is from the summary of The Economist report. If I go into the \nactual report itself, there are a few other compelling parts, speaking \nto the Arctic.\n\n       The summer sea ice is at its lowest level for at least \n     2,000 years. Six of the hottest years on record--going back \n     to 1880--have occurred since 2004. . . . The last time the \n     polar regions were significantly warmer was about 125,000 \n     years ago. This transformation is in fact happening faster \n     than anyone had predicted. According to an authoritative 2011 \n     assessment for the Arctic Council, ``it is now becoming very \n     clear that the cryosphere--\n\n  That is the frozen part of the Arctic--\n\n     is changing rapidly and that neither observations nor models \n     are able to tell the full story.''\n\n  This is not without cost. Further quoting from The Economist:\n\n       The World Bank estimates the cost of adapting to climate \n     change between 2010 and 2050 at $75 billion-$100 billion a \n     year; other estimates are higher.\n\n  Here is what they conclude:\n\n       Sooner or later such arithmetic is going to force \n     governments to get serious about dealing with climate change. \n     It is already clear what is required; policies to put an \n     appropriate price on carbon emissions through a tax or \n     market-based system, that is sufficient to persuade polluters \n     to develop and adopt cleaner technologies. These are already \n     available, and so is the ingenuity needed to force down their \n     costs and bring them to market.\n\n  But then, in a sentimental closing, the article concludes:\n\n       But the Arctic will nonetheless be radically changed. . . . \n     This much is already inevitable.\n\n  So the denial that continues in this body continues to have a high \nprice. As I have pointed out, the science on this is neither new nor \nquestionable. The scientist Tyndall, back at the time of the Civil War, \nfirst determined that a carbon CO2 blanket creates a warming \neffect. That was nearly 150 years ago. So there is nothing new about \nthis.\n  The fringe scientists who are used by the polluters to create this \ndoubt for propaganda purposes are indeed a fringe, as this resounding \ndecision from the U.S. District Court shows. The perils our planet is \nfacing are manifesting themselves now in the Arctic. As one of the \nscientists said in The Economist report--and I will have to paraphrase \nbecause I don't have the quote in front of me--when you get up here, \nGreenland, Norway, the Arctic, climate change is not a theory, it is an \nobservation. It is what is happening around us. It is happening in the \npolar regions because they are more vulnerable, but we are seeing it \neverywhere.\n  Wildfires tear through the West, Florida is beaten under \nunprecedented levels of rainstorms, and insurance companies across the \ncountry are predicting even worse storms. The biggest insurers and \nreinsurers came to Washington to join with environmental Senators to \nsay: You have to do something about this. This is really coming.\n  These aren't liberals, these aren't environmentalists, these aren't \npeople from the Sierra Club. These are the flinty-eyed accountants of \nthe major international insurance and reinsurance companies, and their \nwarnings deserve listening to.\n  My time has expired, Madam President. I yield the floor at this \npoint, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nour economy, the threat of the pending fiscal cliff, and the need to \naddress the challenges we face.\n  Two years ago last week, the Obama administration hailed the advent \nof the ``Summer of Economic Recovery.'' The President claimed, ``The \neconomy is headed in the right direction.'' Vice President Biden \nconfidently predicted the creation of 250,000 to 500,000 new jobs a \nmonth. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner published an op-ed in \nthe New York Times boldly entitled, ``Welcome to the Recovery.''\n  Well, 2 years later, Madam President, Americans are still waiting for \nthe recovery. Today's jobs figures are well below the 250,000 to \n500,000 jobs per month Vice President Biden forecasted.\n  This year, the economy created a dismal 77,000 jobs in April and just \n69,000 jobs in May--less than half the 150,000 jobs that are needed \neach month just to keep up with population growth.\n  Unemployment--which the White House predicted would shrink below 6 \npercent by April of 2012--has remained at or above 8 percent for 40 \nstraight months.\n  Looking at the facts, it is clear the private sector is not doing \nfine. In fact, the President's economic policies have made the economic \nsituation in this country worse. The President seems to prefer more \nstimulus spending from Washington, DC, but the President's $831 billion \nin stimulus money has not led to the job creation he claimed it would. \nUnder this administration, there has been a record 4 years with \ndeficits over $1 trillion. The Federal Government now borrows roughly \n40 cents out of every $1 it spends.\n  The fact is we do not need more government spending that explodes the \nnational debt. Instead, we need to cut reckless government spending and \ntackle the mounting debt crisis through tax entitlement reform.\n  If we don't take action soon, our country could end up in the kind of \nfinancial disaster that Greece and Spain are now facing. The economic \nsituation in Europe is a clear warning sign for our country that if we \ndon't get on a sustainable fiscal path, we will face a similar fiscal \ncrisis.\n  Our children and grandchildren should not have to pay for \nWashington's inability to stick to a budget. We owe it to the next \ngeneration to leave the country better than we found it. Yet it has now \nbeen over 3 years since the Senate last passed a real budget.\n  In part because of the Senate's failure to pass a balanced budget, we \nface a pending fiscal cliff that must be addressed before the end of \nthe year. Financial markets and job creators are going to react to the \nuncertainty coming out of Washington. We need to act now, rather than \nkick the can down the road to a lameduck session of Congress at a time \nwhen it will be very difficult to make these types of decisions, where \nthings are going to be rushed and Members are not going to have an \nopportunity to focus in a thoughtful way on the right solutions for \nthis country's future.\n  One aspect of the fiscal cliff we are talking about is the pending \n$1.2 trillion sequestration scheduled to go into effect on January 2, \n2013. I, along with Senator Sessions and others, have pushed for more \ntransparency from the administration as to how they plan to implement \nsequestration, a provision that was adopted just last week as part of \nthe farm bill. This information is critical so Congress and the \nAmerican people have a full understanding of sequestration's impact. If \nCongress is going to consider delaying or replacing the defense \nsequester, we need this information in order to make those decisions.\n  House Republicans passed a bill last month that replaces the defense \nsequester scheduled to go into effect next\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\nyear, and it does so by finding savings elsewhere in the Federal \nGovernment. Yet the administration continues to stonewall requests by \nCongress to help us better understand where the planned sequester cuts \nwill take place.\n  On the tax side, a family of four earning $50,000 per year would see \ntheir tax bill increase by $2,200 next year, according to the House \nWays and Means Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation also estimates that nearly 1 million \nbusiness owners would face higher taxes if the top two tax rates \nincrease. Yet not one vote has been scheduled in the Senate to prevent \nthis ``taxmageddon.''\n  In contrast, House Republican leaders have a different view, and it \nis expected the House will consider an extension of the current tax \nrates next month which will then come to the Senate.\n  The economy continues to grow at a very slow rate. Unemployment \nremains above 8 percent. Congress must get to work to jump-start our \neconomy and put this country on a sustainable fiscal path. We need to \nact now rather than to kick the can down the road.\n  To put a fine point on that, we already know the fiscal cliff we will \nrun into at the end of the year is going to have a profound impact on \nthe economy next year because the Congressional Budget Office and other \nanalysts have looked at it and determined it could cost us as much as \n1.3 percent of economic growth in the first half of next year--which, \ntranslated into actual jobs numbers, is about 1.3 million jobs that \nwould be lost--because of this fiscal cliff, if it is not dealt with.\n  But there is also a more immediate concern. That is the uncertainty \ncreated by the fiscal cliff. Decisions that are being made right now by \npeople across this country, by job creators, small businesses, and \ninvestors are shaped by and based upon the fiscal cliff that is going \nto occur at the end of the year. The Congressional Budget Office has \nalso suggested this is not only something that is going to have an \nimpact down the road, but it also could have an impact right now as the \neconomy contracts as a result of that uncertainty and investors and \nsmall businesses and job creators take their capital and keep it on the \nsidelines as opposed to putting it to work creating jobs and growing \ntheir businesses. The Congressional Budget Office has suggested it \ncould cost us one-half percent of economic growth, not next year but \nthis year.\n  That is why it is so important we work together to address the \nfundamental issues that are going to impact this economy before the end \nof this year. As I said, we have to address the rates. The rates that \nare going to expire at the end of the year include the marginal income \ntax rates, the dividend rates, the capital gains rate, estate taxes, \nand all kinds of other provisions in tax law that expire at the end of \nthis year. If one is a small business or an investor and they are \nthinking that starting January 1 of next year they are going to be \nfacing a massive tax increase, obviously, they are going to think long \nand hard about putting their capital to work now to create jobs and \ngrow the economy.\n  In fact, I think for many small businesses, as they look at the \ncircumstances they find themselves in, they are faced not only with the \nfiscal cliff, the potential tax increases, but also a massive amount of \nregulation that makes it more difficult and more expensive for them to \ncreate jobs.\n  Those are the issues we should be focused on because the most \nimportant thing we could be doing right now is getting the economy \ngrowing and expanding again and creating jobs for American workers. \nThat is not going to happen if we don't take steps to avert what is \nclearly a terrible disaster waiting in the future with the fiscal cliff \nand all the tax increases that are going to occur at the end of the \nyear.\n\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has said 53 percent of passthrough \nincome would face higher taxes on January 1 of next year. That is all \nthe S corporations, all the small businesses, all the folks out there \nin our economy, the entrepreneurs, who are the people we rely upon to \nget our economy going again and to put people back to work. They are \nlooking at those types of tax increases, starting January 1 of next \nyear, that are going to make it very difficult for them to make the \ninvestments that are necessary to get this economy growing at a rate \nthat will generate the kind of job creation that will get Americans \nback to work, that will get this unemployment rate back down, and start \ncreating confidence in the American public about the future of our \neconomy.\n  I would close by again saying this is not something we can afford to \nkick down the road. We have done that for way too long. We have a \nmassive problem ahead of us with regard to entitlement spending which \nhas to be addressed in the form of entitlement reform. We need to \nreform our Tax Code to make it more simple, more clear and more fair \nand to create a more competitive Tax Code with the countries around the \nworld with which we have to compete. We need to do something about this \nburden of regulation being placed upon our businesses, which is making \nit more difficult for them to compete in the world marketplace and \ncertainly making it more difficult for them in the near term to do what \nis necessary to get jobs created in this country and get Americans back \nto work.\n  I hope we can do that. It would be my expectation that the Senate, if \nand when the House passes legislation to extend the tax rates--which I \nam told they are going to do sometime next month. I hope the Democratic \nmajority in the Senate will take that up and that we will put a bill on \nthe President's desk that will provide the kind of certainty that is \nnecessary for our small businesses and our job creators as they look at \nthe future that will enable them to move forward with those \ninvestments, put their capital to work, and put American workers back \nto work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I would like to compliment my \ncolleague from South Dakota for his commitment and continuing focus on \njobs and the economy and the impact it has on our Nation and our \nfuture.\n  I come, as I have week after week, with a doctor's second opinion \nabout the health care law--which is, in many ways, directly tied to the \neconomy and the economic situation that my colleague from South Dakota \nwas commenting on.\n  We have seen continual unemployment of over 8 percent--now 8.2 \npercent--with people graduating from college who can't find work are \ngoing back to live with their parents. It is because the President \nfocused on a health care law--and the Supreme Court will rule on it \ntomorrow, but he focused on that instead of focusing on what people at \nhome are concerned about: jobs and the economy, getting the economy \nmoving again and bringing the economy back to health. A healthy economy \nis what people were looking for.\n  I come to the floor to talk a bit about things that have happened \nsince the health care law was passed, because President Obama and \nDemocrats repeatedly promised the health care law would do several \nthings.\n  One, they said it would make health insurance more affordable, and \nthey also said it would help create jobs for millions of Americans--\nmillions of Americans, they said.\n  In fact, after the Senate completed passage of the health care law, \nMajority Leader Reid said: ``This of course is a health bill.'' He \nsaid, ``It's also a jobs bill.'' He went on. He said it was also an \neconomic recovery bill. He said it was a deficit-reduction bill. He \nsaid it was an antidiscrimination bill. He said it was truly a bill of \nrights. He went on to say: ``And now it is the law of the land.'' An \neconomic recovery bill, he said; a jobs bill, he said.\n  Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi added: ``It's about jobs.'' She said: \n``In its life, health care reform would create 4 million jobs--400,000 \njobs almost immediately.'' That has not happened--another broken \npromise to the American people.\n  That is why I have come to the floor week after week to point out \nissues with this health care law, which I continue to believe is bad \nfor patients, bad for the providers, the nurses and the doctors who \ntake care of those patients, and terrible for taxpayers.\n  One of the key components of the health care law that the President\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\npromised would help create jobs was what he referred to as the small \nemployer health insurance tax credit. Back in April of 2010, the \nPresident said: ``This health care tax credit is pro-jobs, it is pro-\nbusiness, and it starts this year.'' In essence, the credit was \nsupposed to offset the cost of health insurance for small businesses so \nthey could provide insurance to their employees.\n  The President's Council of Economic Advisers made some estimates. \nThey estimated that about 4 million--4 million--small businesses, they \nsaid, would be eligible for the credit. The administration was so proud \nof the initiative that they sent out millions of postcards to small \nbusinesses. I believe they actually never read it, didn't understand \nit, didn't understand how it worked, because Susan Collins, the Senator \nfrom Maine, stood on the floor of the Senate and said:\n\n       Look at how it really works. It is not going to work the \n     way you have described it.\n\n  But, no, this administration that knows better than anyone, they were \nso proud of the initiative, they sent out millions of postcards. \nAccording to the IRS, 4.4 million postcards were sent out. Who paid for \nit? The taxpayers. Do you remember them? They are the people at home, \nwhere only one in three of them thinks the country is heading in the \nright direction, and so many of them believe the tax dollars they send \nto Washington are not being used well.\n  The White House ignored them and urged small businesses to look at \nthe tax credit criteria and to take advantage, they said, of the credit \nthat would be available.\n  So what has been the response across the country of the over 4 \nmillion small businesses that received the postcards saying, Hey, look \nwhat we are doing for you.\n  According to the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, only \nabout 170,300 employers were able to claim the credit, not 4 million. \nNo. Of these 4 million that got the postcards, how many were able to \ntake full advantage of the credit? Only 28,000. In other words, the \ncredit only benefited about 4 percent of the businesses that the \nPresident promised to help. Ninety-six percent of the businesses that \nthe President promised to help got nothing. Only 4 percent of the \nbusinesses were able to benefit at all, and even a smaller number than \nthat were able to take full advantage.\n  The Wall Street Journal analyzed this issue in a recent article. The \narticle featured Michael Griffin, the owner of a small advertising \nagency in St. Louis, MO. Michael had this to say about the tax credit \nthe President promised and held up as some wonderful thing he was \ndoing:\n\n       You're penalized for giving people a higher wage and more \n     professional opportunity.\n\n  Is that what the Democrat's believe, that we should penalize \nbusinesses for giving people a higher wage and more professional \nopportunity?\n  Michael went on to say:\n\n       I appreciate any kind of tax reduction, but I can certainly \n     not applaud a reduction that limits growth and the \n     opportunity for employers to pay more to their employees. But \n     that is exactly what this tax credit did. It limits the \n     growth of a company, and it limits the opportunity for \n     employers to pay more to their employees.\n\n  Mr. Griffin is not the only small business owner who has had problems \nwith this tax credit, this big promise by the President. Jeffrey \nBerdahl, an accountant from Allentown, PA, spoke to the Associated \nPress about this very issue. He described the calculations required for \nthe tax credit as ``mind-numbing.''\n  People pass laws here. I wonder if they read them or understand the \nimplications. I believe they do not. He described what this Congress \npassed, what the President touts, as mind-numbing and also pointed out \nthat for many of his clients--this accountant's clients--he said the \nmoney they received from the tax credit was offset by the money they \nhad to pay their accountants to try to figure out if they could receive \nany of these credits.\n  In this same AP article, Terry Gutierrez from Raleigh, NC, stated, \n``In some cases, it's [the tax credit] more hassle than it's worth.''\n  The GAO--the Government Accountability Office--confirmed these \nexperiences in their report. They found that many small businesses are \ndeterred from claiming the credit. Why? Because, like so much that has \ncome out as part of this health care law, it is so complex. The report \nhighlighted the fact that it requires 15 separate calculations. The \nPresident sends out a postcard to 4.4 million people, paid for by the \ntaxpayers, to say: You may get a tax credit. Ninety-six percent of the \npeople who get the postcard end up with nothing. Why? Did anybody look \nat this? There are 15 separate calculations and 7 separate worksheets \njust to calculate the amount of the credit.\n  The GAO was told by tax preparers that it would take their clients \nanywhere from 2 to 8 hours or possibly longer to gather the necessary \ninformation to just start to calculate the credit. On top of this, they \nfound that tax preparers spent in general 3 to 5 hours calculating the \ncredit. This from a postcard from the President that says he is going \nto do things for you? This is not the kind of help from Washington that \nsmall businesses are looking for or want or deserve. The American \npeople deserve better.\n  For all of this trouble, GAO determined that the average amount \nclaimed per small business across the country is less than $3,000--\n$2,700 is the average amount claimed. It is clear that this policy is \njust another broken promise of the President's health care law.\n  Since the President recently said that the private sector is doing \nfine--we remember it; we have seen him from the White House giving a \nspeech saying the private sector is doing fine--the ineffectiveness of \nhis small business tax credits may not bother him one bit but it does \nbother most Americans. As I speak with my neighbors across Wyoming, I \nknow the truth of their lives is very much different from what the \nPresident may believe.\n  Many Americans are also concerned about the fact that bureaucrats at \nthe Internal Revenue Service seem to benefit the most from the tax \nprovisions in the law. According to the Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration, the IRS will need nearly 1,300 new Federal employees in \n2012 to implement the President's health care law. That is what they \nare asking for--1,300 new Federal employees for the IRS.\n  In a report issued on June 14 of this year, just a week or two ago, \nthe inspector general pointed out that enforcing the small business \nhealth insurance tax credit, he said, is one of the reasons why the \nAgency must expand. They need 1,300 new Federal employees so they can \nput forward and deal with this so-called tax credit that only 4 percent \nof the people whom the President said it would help have actually \nreceived any credit. And the amount they received is so very low that \nfor most of them it was not worth even doing the paperwork.\n  While the President and Washington Democrats may believe that adding \nemployees to the IRS is the key to job creation, I respectfully \ndisagree. The private sector is not fine, and the government does not \nneed to get any bigger. This is why I have fought and will continue to \nfight to replace the President's health care law with real reforms that \nwill improve competition, increase consumer choice, and lower the cost \nof care for all Americans. That is what this was all supposed to be \nabout in the first place--patient-centered care; giving people the care \nthey need from a doctor they choose, not that the government chooses, \nnot that the insurance company chooses, but that they choose, at lower \ncost.\n  That is why I come to the floor week after week with a doctor's \nsecond opinion about a health care law at a time that I still believe \nthe health care law that the Supreme Court will rule on tomorrow is one \nthat is bad for patients, bad for providers--the nurses and doctors who \ntake care of those patients--and it is terrible for our taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Measure Read the First Time--S. 3342\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I understand there is a bill at the \ndesk, and I ask for its first reading.\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the title of \nthe bill for the first time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3342) to improve information security, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place \nthe bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to \nmy own request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nbill will be read by title for a second time on the next legislative \nday.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today because we have \nintroduced a new version of the Strengthening and Enhancing \nCybersecurity by Using Research, Education, Information and Technology \nAct of 2012, a bill known as the SECURE IT Act.\n  Senator McCain and I, along with Senators Chambliss, Grassley, \nMurkowski, Coats, Burr, and Johnson, are reintroducing the SECURE IT \nAct after making improvements and clarifications in response to \nconstructive feedback we received from the first bill we introduced.\n  We are employing rule XIV on this bill because it is clear it will \nnot receive the benefit of the traditional committee process, and the \nmajority leader has indicated he intends to debate this issue on the \nSenate floor in July. What those of us who are cosponsors of this bill \nare trying to do is have our version of a cybersecurity bill on the \nfloor, introduced, so that everyone will be able to see it. Then, when \nthe Senate turns to this issue, we will be able to see the differences \nbetween the bills.\n  The sponsors of our bill include eight ranking members of committees \nand subcommittees that have jurisdiction over cybersecurity. We have \ncombined our expertise to develop a balanced piece of legislation that \nwe believe will greatly enhance our country's cybersecurity of the \ninfrastructure that could be affected. We believe it is now time for \nCongress to act. The Nation faces an evolving array of threats from \nhackers, criminal groups, and terrorists who seek to sabotage networks, \ngain access to sensitive government information, and steal valuable \nintellectual property.\n  SECURE IT is centered on consensus items. It sets aside controversial \nprovisions that are of questionable value at this time, and we believe \nour bill can pass both Chambers. It offers a balanced approach that \nwill significantly advance cybersecurity in both the public and private \nsectors by focusing on four issues and areas on which we believe \neveryone can agree: first, to facilitate sharing of cyber-threat \ninformation among private sector entities, and to and from the \ngovernment; second, to better secure Federal networks, including \nrequiring Federal contractors to notify the Federal agencies of cyber \nattacks that would threaten government networks; third, to strengthen \nthe ability to prosecute cyber crime; and fourth, to prioritize \ncybersecurity research and development so that our Nation will continue \nto lead the world in this area.\n  Let me start with No. 1, facilitate sharing of cyber-threat \ninformation.\n  SECURE IT helps the private sector combat cyber attacks by breaking \ndown barriers to sharing information about threats and vulnerabilities. \nCurrently, antitrust laws and liability concerns inhibit private \ncompanies from exchanging information that we believe is necessary to \ndefend against and respond to cyber threats.\n  I was talking to someone last night who is in the high-tech Internet \nfield. There are great concerns about their company calling a \ncompetitor and saying: We are seeing signs of a possible threat here, \nand we wanted to share what the type of red flag we are seeing is so \nthat you would be able to check your networks to see if you are getting \nthe same thing.\n  These are two competitors, but this is not an anticompetitive \nsituation. It is not something that should not be, we believe, subject \nto antitrust. They are still competitors, but everybody wants security \nfor all of our networks in this country against any kind of \nintervention, whether it is criminal or foreign intelligence.\n  Our bill's liability protection and limited antitrust exemptions will \nallow these companies to rapidly respond so that they do not have to go \nto a lawyer and say: Would it be anticompetitive if we called our \ncompetitor and started sharing this information right away?\n  So it needs to be timely, fast, and safe. Those are the criteria.\n  Sharing should be a two-way street. Our bill sets up a framework that \npromotes timely sharing of classified, declassified, and unclassified \ninformation by the Federal Government with trusted private sector \nentities, while allowing private sector companies to share cyber-threat \ninformation with the government.\n  Since the introduction of SECURE IT, we have been working with \nstakeholders in all of the areas of infrastructure and Internet access \nto make a number of improvements and clarifications to the bill. I am \npleased that we introduced the bill early, that we got the feedback \nfrom the different stakeholders and we have now been able to make \nadjustments to provisions that would help the bill but also protect \nprivacy and preserve the issue we are trying to address, which, of \ncourse, is safety and cybersecurity.\n  We tightened the definition of what information is shared. We refined \nthe process for sharing it. This will ensure that only essential \ninformation is shared and that it is handled appropriately. For \nexample, it is vital that Federal agencies be informed if their systems \nare compromised. Our bill requires Federal contractors to coordinate \nwith their supervisory agencies and to notify them of significant cyber \nincidents that would impede their mission. We have added explicit and \nstrong privacy protections and increased oversight throughout our \nrevised bill. At every stage of information sharing, there are \nstatutory safeguards that will ensure cyber-threat information is \nhandled in a manner that will protect the privacy and civil liberties \nof all Americans while preserving the ability to address cyber threats \nthat could affect them as well as other members of the public.\n\n  No. 2, secure Federal networks. The government needs to do a much \nbetter job of securing its own networks. To address this problem, \nSECURE IT provides necessary reforms to the Federal Information \nSecurity Management Act by modernizing the way the government monitors \nand mitigates its own cyber-risks. SECURE IT requires agencies to use \nautomated realtime network monitoring by upgrading their current \nprimarily paper-based reporting. Our revisions also ensure that \nagencies will be continuously updating their technologies to prevent \nand remediate significant cyber incidents.\n  No. 3, we facilitate the prosecution of cyber crime. We update the \nFederal criminal statutes and streamline existing confusing penalties \nto facilitate the prosecution of cyber criminals. No. 4, cybersecurity \nresearch and development is essential to harness innovation and to \ntrain IT professionals to counter future attacks.\n  If we focus on these four areas, we believe we can significantly \nimprove the cybersecurity of our country by facilitating the sharing of \ncyber-threat information in the private sector, securing Federal \nnetworks, strengthening criminal penalties for cyber crimes and \nprioritizing cybersecurity research and development.\n  Equally important is what our bill does not do. Secure IT does not \ngive the Department of Homeland Security open-ended power to regulate \nnetworks for infrastructure that it deems to be critical. It does not \ngive them the power to determine what is critical infrastructure. \nInstead, we take a different approach that is not heavy-handed and \nregulatory. It sets up a true partnership between the public and \nprivate sector to combat these cyber threats.\n  We will not improve this country's cybersecurity by creating an \nadversarial system based on a regulatory compliance structure. We \nbelieve subjecting industry to more regulation from an agency that is \nill-equipped to understand the private sector system will ultimately \nerode the ability of business to provide effective, nimble, and \ninnovative responses to cyber threats.\n  Diverting precious resources from security and innovation to \nregulatory compliance could ultimately harm security, not improve it, \nwhich is why we are taking the different approach from the more heavy-\nhanded regulatory approach of the other bill sponsored by\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\nmy colleagues. We do not want Americans to be fooled into a false sense \nof security by imposing an unproven prescriptive regulatory framework \nthat no agency could effectively implement, and that we do not think \nthat the Department of Homeland Security could implement. I encourage \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in supporting the \nSECURE IT Act of 2012. I will just reiterate again that our bill is \nsponsored by Senator McCain and myself, Senator Chambliss, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Murkowski, Senator Coats, Senator Burr, and Senator \nJohnson of Wisconsin, all of whom are either ranking members of full \ncommittees or subcommittees that have a jurisdiction in this area. We \nhave worked very hard with all of the different interest groups, \nincluding privacy groups, the groups that handle the private sector \nnetworks, and the groups that are Federal contractors to assure we are \ndoing the best balanced approach that can possibly be done to take the \nnext step with a bill we believe we can pass not only in the Senate, \nbut also the House and then to the President. I believe he will sign it \nbecause it is a major first step forward.\n  I thank the chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I want to indicate, while listening to \nthe remarks of the Senator from Texas about the introduction of a bill \napparently on cybersecurity, how critically important that is to the \ncountry. I am a relatively new member of the Intelligence Committee, \nbut if there is anything I have learned, it is what a major threat this \nis to our country and how critically important it is we address it. So \nI commend the Senator from Texas for her leadership and I appreciate \nthat she and her colleagues have taken this step of actually \nintroducing legislation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from North \nDakota. I appreciate very much that the Senator is on the Intelligence \nCommittee and that he knows the sensitivities and all of the \nstakeholders we must work with in order to do the right thing for our \ncountry, both in the private sector as well in our government \ninfrastructure. As always, the Senator from North Dakota is a person \nwho is a visionary and one who looks out for the best interest of our \ncountry, and I hope we come together on this bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. I look forward to reviewing her \nproposal and, hopefully, together we can find a way to get something \npassed that will further protect our country.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe state of our economy, where we have come from, where we are headed, \nand the critical challenges facing our Nation. I want to go back and \nremind people of where we have come from. I think it is very important \nto put in context the circumstances we now confront.\n  First of all, the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 was the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. By the way, this was not the \ncreation of Barack Obama. He inherited this mess, and he has done quite \na good job of getting us moving in a better direction, but more of that \nlater.\n  In the fourth quarter of 2008--that is the last quarter before this \nPresident took office--the economy was actually shrinking at a rate of \nalmost 9 percent. In the first month of 2009, we lost 800,000 jobs. The \nhousing market was in crisis, home building and sales were plummeting, \nwe faced record foreclosures, and the financial market crisis was \nthreatening global economic collapse.\n  In fact, I will never forget being called to a meeting in the Capitol \nin the fall of 2008, and I was the last one to arrive. It was the \nleaders of the House and the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, and \nthere was the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the Secretary of the \nTreasury in the Bush administration telling us they were going to take \nover AIG the next morning. They told us if they did not, there would be \na financial collapse in this country within days. I have to say, that \ngets your attention. But those were the circumstances that were being \nconfronted in late 2008.\n  Since that time, we have seen a dramatic improvement. Here is the \neconomy in the fourth quarter of 2008 before President Obama took \noffice, shrinking at a rate of almost 9 percent. In the subsequent \nquarters it continued to shrink until it began to get better in late \n2009, frankly, because of the stimulus and TARP that helped start to \nturn our country around.\n  Since that time we have had consistent growth in the economy--not as \nrobust as we would like but nonetheless consistent growth. It was a \nrather remarkable turnaround given how serious the economic downturn \nwas. We also see the same pattern with respect to the private sector \njobs picture.\n  Again in January 2009, in 1 month alone we lost more than 800,000 \njobs, and those were private sector jobs--more than 800,000 jobs in a \nmonth. Again, in 2009 things began to turn and we got back to growing \njobs. In fact, we have had over 4\\1/2\\ million jobs in the private \nsector created since the turnaround began. Again, job growth was not as \nrobust as we would like, but nonetheless it was quite a remarkable \nturnaround from where it was.\n  What we have seen in looking at previous crises is that economic \nrecovery is shallower and takes much longer after a financial crisis. \nSo we can't compare this to the garden variety of recessions we faced \nsince World War II. I think we have had nine recessions since World War \nII, but this went far beyond a typical recession. This was enormous \ndamage to the financial sector. In looking back, historically, here is \nwhat Dr. Reinhart of the Peter Peterson Institute for International \nEconomics and Dr. Vincent Reinhart of the American Enterprise Institute \nhave found in their research:\n\n       Real per capita GDP growth rates are significantly lower \n     during the decade following severe financial crises . . . In \n     the ten-year window following severe financial crises, \n     unemployment rates are significantly higher than in the \n     decade that presided the crisis. . . .\n\n  That is the circumstance we are in. That is not the fault of \nPresident Obama. He inherited this mess. The fact is after a financial \ncrisis, if we look back historically, it takes up to 10 years to \nrecover. For those who say, well, the Federal Government response \ndidn't work or that it hasn't made any difference, I don't think that \nis true. I don't think that will stand up to scrutiny.\n  Two of the most distinguished economists in the country, Alan \nBlinder, who was a former Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, and \nMark Zandi, who was actually one of the economic advisers to the John \nMcCain campaign, said:\n\n       We find that its effects--\n\n  Talking about the Federal Government's actions to deal with the \ncrisis--\n\n     on real GDP, jobs, and inflation are huge, and probably \n     averted what could have been called Great Depression 2.0.\n\n  They went on to say:\n\n     . . . When all is said and done, the financial and fiscal \n     policies will have cost taxpayers a substantial sum, but not \n     nearly as much as most had feared and not nearly as much as \n     if policymakers had not acted at all. If the comprehensive \n     policy responses saved the economy from another depression, \n     as we estimate, they were well worth their cost.\n\n  Madam President, here are two of the most distinguished economists in \nthe country telling us that had we not taken the actions that the \nFederal Government did, we would have had a depression. They also \nlooked at what would have happened without the Federal response on the \njobs front.\n  Here is what they found running their econometric models. The green \nline is the response with the Federal response, the red line is what \nthey estimate would have happened without the Federal response. We can \nsee they find a difference of 8 million jobs. In other words, we have 8 \nmillion more jobs than we would have otherwise had had the Federal \nGovernment done nothing.\n  I just say this to my colleagues who say, well, the stimulus and TARP \ndidn't work because we are not growing as rapidly as we would like. \nLet's think back. What was happening when those steps were taken? The \neconomy wasn't growing; the economy was shrinking. We weren't getting \nmore jobs; we were losing jobs at a record rate. So to those who say \nnone of these Federal actions were successful, I say I don't think that \nis what the record shows.\n  I think what the record shows is they didn't accomplish all we would \nlike,\n\n[[Page S4654]]\n\nbut they really led to quite a dramatic turnaround from the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. Here are the positive signs we \nsee now that are facts. They are not projections; they are facts. We \nhave had 27 consecutive months of private sector job growth. We have \nhad 11 consecutive quarters of real GDP growth. The unemployment rate \nis down from the 2009 peak. Manufacturing has expanded for 34 \nconsecutive months. The U.S. auto manufacturers have returned to \nprofitability. And State revenues are now showing signs of improvement.\n\n  So, again, this isn't political talk. These are facts, and facts \nmatter. The facts demonstrate there has been quite a remarkable \nturnaround. Again, these aren't projections; these are facts. These are \nthings that have occurred.\n  If we then compare the U.S. performance to other countries with which \nwe compete, we can see the United States has done the best in terms of \nthe comparisons here. Some developing nations have certainly done \nbetter than we have, but if we look at the developed world, the United \nStates is doing the best. This chart shows our economic performance, \nthe top line, which is far better than the eurozone, all the European \ncountries, which is the green line. Japan is the red line and we are \ndoing much better than them. We are doing much better than the United \nKingdom. If we look at how well we have done compared to the rest of \nthe world, we are doing much better, at least in terms of the developed \nnations.\n  We know Europe has gone in a somewhat different direction. They have \nimposed austerity without regard to growth policies. Here are the \nheadlines from the International Herald Tribune: ``Austerity Is \nStrangling Europe.'' I pulled out a paragraph because I think it speaks \nvery well of what has been the effect of the European strategy:\n\n       The direction of European economic and financial policy \n     must change, away from pure austerity toward growth. Greece, \n     Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain have made substantial \n     progress in stabilizing their finances. But the economic and \n     political situation in these countries shows that austerity \n     alone is not the way to resolve the crisis. On the contrary, \n     there is a danger of half-strangling national economies with \n     a strict policy of austerity. We would therefore be well \n     advised to cushion harsh austerity measures with programs for \n     growth.\n\n  I believe there is a lesson in that for us as well. I am an \nunvarnished deficit hawk. I have been my entire career. I have called \nrepeatedly for us to get our fiscal house in order. I believe it is \nimperative that we do that, but it is also imperative to recognize that \nwe don't impose austerity on a weak and struggling economy. We would \nonly make things worse. Getting back on a more sustainable financial \npath has to be done in a measured way. Absolutely, we need a long-term \nplan to take on our deficits and debt. I have made that speech 500 \ntimes. Absolutely, that has to be done. But that has to be done in a \nphased way, and the austerity should not be imposed until we are on a \nstronger growth path. I think economic history tells us that, and that \nis a lesson we need to learn.\n  What is holding back the U.S. economy from a stronger recovery? Well, \nwe have identified these elements: No. 1, the European debt/financial \ncrisis has thrown a cloud over global markets, and they are still our \nbiggest trading partners. So a chilling of economic activity in Europe \nhas had an adverse effect on our own economic performance.\n  No. 2, the Iran/Middle East situation has threatened to disrupt oil \nsupplies. That creates uncertainty, because we know the Straits of \nHormuz would close, prices would jump, economic activity would weaken, \nand we would be hurting. That has led companies, even though they have \n$2 trillion on their balance sheets, to be very cautious about \nexpanding their investment and expanding their hiring.\n  Federal, State, and local government cutbacks have also created \neconomic drag. I will go to that issue in a moment.\n  The political deadlock on fiscal issues here in Congress has also \ncreated uncertainty, and we face, of course, the threat from the fiscal \ncliff. The fiscal cliff is the fact that at the end of this year, all \nof the Bush tax cuts are going to expire, which means an automatic tax \nincrease for virtually every American. We also face additional spending \ncuts, including $1.2 trillion from the so-called sequester, evenly \nshared between defense and nondefense. That would reduce demand. That \nwould further reduce economic growth. Also, of course, the housing \nmarket continues to pose a threat, at least in many parts of the \ncountry. Certainly in Nevada, Arizona, Florida, and in parts of \nCalifornia, the housing market crisis still leaves an overhang.\n  I thought this article in the New York Times on Saturday, May 5, was \nvery interesting. I think if we gave a quiz to the American people \nlistening to the debates here, they would conclude that government has \ngotten bigger and bigger during the Obama administration, but that is \nnot true. A previous President said ``facts are stubborn things,'' and \nthese are facts. If we take State, local, and Federal Government and we \ncombine them, the government is getting smaller in the United States. \nIn fact, again, I pulled out a paragraph:\n\n       For the first time in 40 years, the government sector of \n     the American economy has shrunk during the first three years \n     of a presidential administration. Spending by the Federal \n     Government, adjusted for inflation, has risen at a slow rate \n     under President Obama. But that increase has been more than \n     offset by a fall in spending by State and local governments, \n     which have been squeezed by weak tax receipts.\n\n  In the first quarter of this year, the real gross domestic product \nfor the government--including State and local governments as well as \nFederal--was 2 percent lower than it was 3 years earlier, when Barack \nObama took office, in early 2009.\n  All the talk we hear on this floor about the exploding size of \ngovernment is bloviation. It is bloviation. Let's get real. The \ngovernment in the United States is shrinking. Facts are stubborn \nthings.\n  This is what is happening to the U.S. Government workforce under this \nPresident. Obama took office in January of 2009. This chart shows \nmillions of Federal, State, and local employees. We had more than 22.5 \nmillion Federal, State, and local employees. Look what has happened. Do \nwe have more employees in government today than when President Obama \ntook office or do we have less? We have less, and we have a lot less. \nThis chart shows very clearly the number of employees has gone down \ndramatically--dramatically--during the years of this administration. \nFacts are stubborn things.\n  What is underlying our current weakness? Well, before the Budget \nCommittee, we had Dr. Joel Prakken, the chairman of Macroeconomic \nAdvisers. This is the testimony he gave earlier this year:\n\n       The No. 1 problem that [small businesses] say they have to \n     deal with right now is lack of demand.\n\n  Are my colleagues paying attention? Can we pass a quiz? What is the \nproblem? The problem is a lack of demand. Further tax increases or \nfurther spending cuts will only weaken demand in the short term. So we \nhave to be paying attention to what we do here.\n  Some of our colleagues say, Let's slash spending some more, make \ngovernment even smaller. Guess what that will do to demand? It will \nweaken it. That will make the economic recovery even more tepid, even \nweaker. That is not the answer. Yes, it is absolutely the case over the \nlonger term. We have to be aggressive at reducing spending \nand reforming entitlements and reforming the tax system. I have been \npart of virtually every effort here to do that. I was part of Bowles-\nSimpson and part of the group of six. I am actually actively engaged in \nthat effort now. We have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same \ntime. What we need to understand is we need a two-step strategy: \nstrengthen growth in the short term, and then pivot and deal with our \ndeficits and debt over the longer term. We cannot get confused about \nthis and think the answer is to impose immediate austerity now. We have \nalready imposed a fair amount of austerity, which I will get into in a \nminute, with the budget cuts that were included in the Budget Control \nAct passed last year.\n\n  I want to repeat the testimony of Dr. Prakken:\n\n       The No. 1 problem that [small businesses] say they have to \n     deal with right now is lack of demand. They do not say access \n     to capital. They do not say burden of regulation. They say \n     their order books are thin.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, let's pay attention to what the problem is: \nweak\n\n[[Page S4655]]\n\ndemand. We have to take steps to strengthen demand in the short term \nwhile at the same time putting in place a longer term plan to get us \nback on track with our Nation's finances.\n  One reason we have a weak demand is we have made weak investments in \ninfrastructure. Look at where we are compared to our global \ncompetitors. China is investing 9 percent of their GDP on \ninfrastructure. Europe is spending 5 percent, and here we are at 2.4 \npercent. One of the reasons we have a weak recovery is we are not \ninvesting sufficiently in roads, bridges, airports, rail, and, as a \nresult, our infrastructure across America is becoming second rate. That \nis about as clear as it can be.\n  I hear my colleagues say: Well, our problem is the Senate has not \npassed a budget in over 1,000 days. Sometimes I wonder if our \ncolleagues pay very close attention to what they are voting on here, \nbecause last year, instead of a budget resolution we passed the Budget \nControl Act--a law. What is the difference between a resolution and a \nlaw? I think any high school student could tell us a resolution is \nweaker than a law. Yet our colleagues continue to come to the floor and \ncomplain and say we have not passed a resolution in more than 1,000 \ndays. That is true. What we did do is pass a law called the Budget \nControl Act. We passed it last year with an overwhelming vote here in \nthe U.S. Senate--a bipartisan vote. It also passed in the House of \nRepresentatives and was signed into law by the President.\n  A budget resolution never even goes to the President. A budget \nresolution is purely a congressional document. So a law is stronger \nthan any resolution, and it is true, we didn't pass a budget resolution \nlast year, we passed a law called the Budget Control Act. That law, in \npart, said:\n\n       The allocations, aggregates, and spending levels set in \n     subsection (b)(1) shall apply in the Senate in the same \n     manner as for a concurrent resolution on the budget.\n\n  That is about as clear as it can be. The Budget Control Act says that \nthe spending levels will apply in the same manner as a budget \nresolution.\n  So all these speeches that have been given--oh, we have not had a \nbudget resolution in a thousand days--is not telling people the rest of \nthe story. Instead of a budget resolution, we passed a budget law \ncalled the Budget Control Act.\n  What did that law do? One of the things it did was cut spending $900 \nbillion over the next 10 years. I can tell you, it put in place 10 \nyears of spending caps--10 years of spending caps. A typical budget \nresolution only deals with 1 year. The Budget Control Act--the law we \npassed last year--put in place 10 years of spending caps, saving $900 \nbillion.\n  In addition, it said: We are going to create a special committee to \ndeal with the entitlement programs and the tax system. We are going to \nsay to that special committee: If you can come to an agreement, you \nwill not face a filibuster. You will not face delays, you will be able \nto bring that proposal right to the floor of the Senate and get a vote.\n  They further said: But if you do not agree, there will be another \n$1.2 trillion of spending cuts imposed. Of course, we all know now the \nspecial committee could not agree. So that additional $1.2 trillion of \nspending cuts is now the law of the land, on top of the $900 billion of \nspending cuts that was in the Budget Control Act as well.\n  So let's do the math: $900 billion of discretionary savings in the \nBudget Control Act, plus this sequester--the $1.2 trillion of \nadditional spending cuts focused on defense and nondefense spending--\nfor a total of $2.1 trillion of spending cuts that were in the Budget \nControl Act passed last year that is now the law of the land. That is \nthe biggest spending cut package in the history of the United States.\n  I think facts are stubborn things, and we need to remind our \ncolleagues of what the facts are.\n  Here is another unfortunate fact: We are borrowing almost 40 cents of \nevery $1 we spend. We can do that for a while. We cannot do it \nendlessly. We are borrowing almost 40 cents of every $1 we spend, so we \nhave to deal with that.\n  What does it mean in terms of our debt? This is what is happening to \nour debt: Gross debt as a percentage of our gross domestic product \nunder what is called the CBO alternative fiscal scenario--that is their \nprediction of what we might do here--shows the gross debt of the United \nStates is going to be 104 percent of our gross domestic product at the \nend of this year--104 percent of our gross domestic product. It shows, \nif we do not do anything, that is going to go up to 119 percent. Our \ngross debt will be 119 percent of the size of our economy by 2022 if we \ndo not do anything.\n  That is not a path we should allow to be followed. Why not? Because \nthe best economic analysis that has been done, by Reinhart and Rogoff, \n``Growth in a Time of Debt,'' found that once we get a gross debt of \nmore than 90 percent of our GDP, our future economic prospects are \ndiminished. It does not happen all at once. It is not like falling off \na cliff when we get to gross debt that is 90 percent of our GDP. It is \nmore like a long, slow decline in terms of our future economic \nprospects.\n  So here is what they concluded after studying 200 years' of economic \nhistory, 44 different countries:\n\n       We examine the experience of 44 countries spanning up to \n     two centuries of data on central government debt, inflation \n     and growth. Our main finding is that across both advanced \n     countries and emerging markets, high debt/GDP levels (90 \n     percent and above)--\n\n  Again, this is gross debt, when we get to a gross debt of 90 percent \nor more.\n\n     are associated with notably lower growth outcomes.\n\n  So this is not just about numbers on a page. This is about future \neconomic prospects, future economic opportunity, future job prospects, \nthat the future wealth of a nation is hurt when they get to a gross \ndebt of more than 90 percent of their GDP.\n  The previous chart I showed is that we will be at 104 percent of GDP \nat the end of this year. So absolutely we have to focus on deficits and \ndebt. But we should not lose sight of the fact that we cannot pivot and \ndo that when the economy is weak or we will make the economy even \nweaker. So the initial steps we need to take are to strengthen growth. \nAt the same time, we ought to put in place a plan that gets us back on \ntrack fiscally that deals with this debt problem for the longer term \nbecause this is not a matter of we get to this point and fall off the \ncliff. It does not work that way.\n  What is critically important is that we adopt the right economic \npolicies now to strengthen the economy, to lift growth, but at the same \ntime to put in place a longer term plan that deals with deficits and \ndebt.\n  As shown on this chart here is where we are headed if we fail to act. \nThis is according to the Congressional Budget Office. It is \nnonpartisan. We have gross debt that I was referencing before: 104 \npercent. Look at this and you will say: Gee, it is not 104 percent on \nthis chart. That is because this is not gross debt. This is debt held \nby the public, which most economists like to talk about. I talk about \nthe gross debt because gross debt includes what we owe to the trust \nfunds, and the work of Reinhart and Rogoff focused on gross debt. So if \nwe are going to compare ourselves to the research they did, we have to \nbe talking about gross debt.\n  This is debt held by the public, and this is what CBO says is going \nto happen to debt held by the public if we fail to act: We are going to \nhave a debt more than 200 percent of GDP. That is the track we are on. \nSo, hey, we have to sober up. We need a plan that gets us back on \ntrack.\n  When we analyze how we got in this situation, what is critical is \nthat we look at spending and revenue because it is that mismatch which \nleads to deficits. It is when we are spending more than we are taking \nin. It is when our outlays are greater than our revenues that we have \ndeficits. It is the accumulation of deficits that is the debt. Right. \nThe debt is adding up all the deficits over all these years.\n  The red line on this chart shows the spending of the United States. \nThe green line shows the revenue. What jumps out at you is that \nspending is near a 60-year high. That is not surprising because we just \nhad the biggest economic downturn since the Great Depression.\n  What happens when we have a strong economic downturn? What we call \nthe automatic stabilizers kick in to prevent us from going into a \ndepression. What are the automatic stabilizers?\n\n[[Page S4656]]\n\nThings such as unemployment insurance, spending on food stamps, other \nthings that are done to prevent going from a recession into a \ndepression. Those things kicked in, and the result is--and, of course, \nwe had TARP and we had stimulus, which I have already demonstrated \nworked actually quite effectively. Without them, the best economists in \nthe country tell us we would have been in a depression.\n  Spending is near a 60-year high. But look at revenue. Revenue is near \na 60-year low. Low revenue, high spending, big deficits, big additions \nto debt. That is what is happening to us. We can see, the spending has \ncome back somewhat now. Revenue has improved somewhat. So things are \nstarting to get better, but we still have a big gap and a deficit of \n$1.2 trillion for this year--staggering. That over time has to be \naddressed.\n  The Budget Control Act we passed last year--the law our friends over \nthere say: Oh, you have not passed a budget resolution for a thousand \ndays. Wow. Did they forget they voted on a law called the Budget \nControl Act that cut spending by the biggest amount in the history of \nthe United States?\n  Look what has happened to discretionary spending. Under the Budget \nControl Act, discretionary spending is going to go to a historic low. \nSo all this talk about the runaway spending around here--yes, spending \nwent up when we had a deep economic decline in order to prevent that \ndecline from becoming even worse and becoming a depression. But do you \nknow what. We have already taken steps to rein that spending back in in \nthe future in the Budget Control Act.\n  Look how it is going to do it. We saw, back in 1968, discretionary \nspending--in Federal spending there are two kinds of spending. There is \nmandatory spending--things such as Social Security, Medicare, that is \nmandatory spending. Then there is discretionary spending; that is \nthings such as education, law enforcement, parks. And back in 1968, \n13.6 percent of budget outlays went to discretionary spending.\n  In 2012, even after this uptick, we are still far below where we were \nin 1968. Only 8.4 percent of budget outlays are going to discretionary \nspending. But look what happens under the Budget Control Act. \nDiscretionary spending, as a share of the total budget, will drop to \nless than 5 percent. We have not been there going way back. That is a \nhistoric low.\n  So those who say, well, we have runaway spending, nothing has been \ndone about it, they have not done their homework, and they, obviously, \nhave not paid attention to the laws that have been passed. The Budget \nControl Act that passed last year is taking us to spending for \ndiscretionary programs that is a historic low.\n  Where is the spending going up? Well, it is those mandatory accounts. \nThat is where the spending is going up. Of course, as shown on this \nchart, this is the picture on Social Security. Again, this goes back to \n1972. Social Security was 3.3 percent of GDP. Here we are in 2012 and \nit is up to well over 5 percent of GDP. It is headed for over 6 percent \nof GDP as the baby boomers retire. That is not a projection. The baby \nboomers have been born. They are alive today. They are going to retire. \nI am a baby boomer. I see a number of others in front of me in the \nChamber. That is not a projection. That is baked in the cake. So we \nknow we have gone in 1972 from Social Security being 3.3 percent of GDP \nto being 6 percent of GDP. That is not because we have had increases in \nthe program; it is because we have increases in the number of people \nwho are eligible for the program.\n  The same is true in other mandatory parts of the budget.\n  Here is Medicare. Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health \nspending--if we added it all up in 1972--was 1.1 percent of GDP. In \n2050, we expect that to increase to 12.4 percent of GDP. So if we are \nlooking for where the spending is really increasing, it is certainly \nnot in the domestic accounts. That has gone down as a share of GDP.\n  For Social Security, we have seen an increase because of increased \npeople eligible because of the baby boom generation. But the big place \nwe have seen an explosion is in the health care accounts.\n  Now, that is not because of the law that was passed--what some people \ncall ObamaCare. That has nothing to do with this. This is long-term \ntrends because of the increase in the cost of medicine and because of \nthe baby boom generation.\n  That is where we see a large increase in Federal spending. We are \nseeing Medicare enrollment soaring. Back in 1970, there were 20 million \npeople eligible for Medicare. In 2085, it is going to be 115 million. \nSo a key reason we are seeing increases in costs in the so-called \nmandatory programs is a dramatic increase in the number of people who \nare eligible. That is no fault of the program. That is a demographic \nreality, and we have to cope with this reality.\n  If we are going to have a Medicare Program that gives an assurance \nthat people in their senior years have medical treatment available to \nthem, we have to deal with this reality of a dramatic increase in the \nnumber of people who are eligible for Medicare.\n  An aging population is the primary driver of Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security cost growth--an aging population. The world is \nchanging. As a population, we have a much bigger group that is eligible \nfor these programs--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. It is \nabsolutely essential that those programs be maintained in order for our \nseniors to have a comfortable retirement and in their aging years to \nhave security.\n  That is the genius of Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. They \nhave transformed lives for people in their senior years. But we also \nhave this reality to confront that because we have a growing number--\nbecause of the baby boom generation the costs to the Federal Government \nare swelling. Again, it is not on discretionary spending. That part of \nthe budget, as I have demonstrated, is going down as a share of the \neconomy. It is in these areas where our budget is sensitive to the \ngrowing number of people eligible for Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid.\n  Interestingly enough, the Medicare trustees say the health care \nreform law passed has reduced long-term Medicare costs. I hear people, \nespecially our friends on the other side, say the law we have passed \nhas increased these costs. That is not what the Medicare trustees have \nfound. The Medicare trustees have said the ``projected Medicare costs \nover 75 years are substantially lower than they otherwise would be \nbecause of provisions in the `Affordable Care Act' or ACA.\n  Our colleagues say they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They \nare talking about making the situation worse, not according to Kent \nConrad but according to the Medicare trustees. The Medicare trustees--I \nwish to repeat this--said the ``projected Medicare costs over 75 years \nare substantially lower than they otherwise would be because of \nprovisions in the Affordable Care Act. . . . ''\n  So our colleagues who are lining up to say they want to repeal the \naffordable care act are lining up to increase Medicare costs. By the \nway, they are lining up to increase the debt because the Congressional \nBudget Office has told us that in the first 10 years of the affordable \ncare act, it saves more than a hundred billion dollars in the deficit, \nbut in the second 10 years, it saves well over $1 trillion on deficits \nand debt.\n  Let me repeat that. The Congressional Budget Office tells us the \naffordable care act, which some of our colleagues are lining up to \nrepeal, will reduce deficits and debt in the second 10 years by well \nover $1 trillion. So my friends who are lining up--they want to repeal \nthe affordable care act--they are lining up to increase Medicare costs. \nThey are lining up to increase the debt of the United States, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office, which is nonpartisan.\n  This is what the Medicare trustees project in terms of reduction in \nMedicare costs. The percent change in average per beneficiary cost from \n2001 to 2011 was up 94 percent. From 2011 to 2021, they predict it will \ngo up 37 percent, a dramatic slowing of the rise in costs because of \nthe affordable care act.\n  We also hear colleagues on the other side say the answer to this \ndeficit and debt situation is to have further tax cuts that primarily \nbenefit the wealthiest among us. Really? I have just shown a chart that \nshowed our revenue is near a 60-year low. So does digging the hole \ndeeper make much sense before we start to fill it in? I do not think \nso.\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\n  We hear our colleagues say: If we look in the last 40 years, revenue \nhas been about 18 percent of GDP. That is true. But you know what, the \nfive times we have balanced the budget since 1969 the revenue has not \nbeen at 18 percent of GDP. The revenue has been at 19.7 percent of GDP, \n19.9 percent, 19.8 percent, 20.6 percent, 19.5 percent of GDP. So these \nfriends who say they want to balance the budget, let's study their \nnumbers. It does not add up. It does not add up.\n  They want to cut the revenue, which already is near a 60-year low--\ncut it some more. They say: Sometimes it is going to get back toward \nhistoric average. That is not going to cut it, because we can see the \ntimes we have balanced the budget, the revenue has not been at 18 \npercent of GDP. Right now, it is at less than 16 percent. Revenue has \nbeen about 20 percent of GDP. I do not know what could be more clear; \nthat we need tax reform in this country. The Tax Code is out of date. \nIt is inefficient. It is hurting U.S. global competitiveness. \nComplexity imposes a significant burden on individuals and businesses. \nThe expiring provisions create uncertainty and confusion. We are \nhemorrhaging revenue to the tax gap, the tax havens, to abusive tax \nshelters.\n  I have shown on this floor many times a picture of a little five-\nstory house called Ugland House. Ugland House--I am going to put it up \nin just 1 minute--claims to be the home to 8,000 companies. They all \nsay they are doing business out of this little five-story building. \nReally? Is that what they are doing? We will talk about that in a \nmoment.\n  But we are hemorrhaging revenue to the tax gap, the tax havens, to \nabusive tax shelters. We need to restore fairness. The current system \nis contributing to growing income inequality. I do not know how anybody \ncan deny this. We have seen a dramatic growth in income inequality in \nour country.\n  One of the reasons is we have a Tax Code which favors those at the \nvery top, at least some of them. Very interesting because not all \npeople at the top pay a lot of taxes. Some people at the top and some \ncompanies pay nothing, even though they are highly profitable. That is \nnot fair. It is not right. It is hurting the country.\n  Our long-term fiscal imbalance must be addressed. Revenue must be \npart of the solution. Martin Feldstein, a distinguished conservative \neconomist--nobody ever accused Martin Feldstein of being a liberal--\nsaid this:\n\n       Cutting tax expenditures is really the best way to reduce \n     government spending. . . . [E]liminating tax expenditures \n     does not increase marginal tax rates or reduce the reward for \n     saving, investment or risk-taking. It would also increase the \n     overall economic efficiency by removing incentives that \n     distort private spending decisions. And eliminating or \n     consolidating the large number of overlapping tax-based \n     subsidies would also greatly simplify tax filing. In short, \n     cutting tax expenditures is not at all like other ways of \n     raising revenue.\n\n  In this case, I think Martin Feldstein has it about right. One way we \ncan raise additional revenue is to reform the current tax system, \nmaking our system more competitive and at the same time raising \nadditional revenue that can be used to help reduce the deficit, along \nwith reform of entitlement programs, along with additional spending \nrestraint.\n\n  These tax expenditures go overwhelmingly to the top 1 percent. Here \nis the increase in aftertax income from tax expenditures. We can see \nthe middle quintile. They get $3,200 a year of value. But look at the \ntop 1 percent. The top 1 percent get over $\\1/4\\ million a year in \nbenefits from tax expenditures. Overwhelmingly, those tax expenditures \nthat are now costing us $1.2 trillion a year are going to the \nwealthiest among us.\n  I have nothing against wealth or people who succeed--all for it. I am \nfor there being a fair distribution of the burden of raising the \nrevenue necessary to support the country, and this is not fair. It is \nnot fair when the top 1 percent get $\\1/4\\ million in value every year \nfrom these tax expenditures. That gets almost no attention.\n  This is the picture I was talking about. This is a little building in \nthe Cayman Islands, a five-story building called Ugland House. Now, \n18,857 companies call this building home. Truly. That is the most \nefficient building in the world. Can you imagine all these companies \ndoing business out of that little building, 18,857 companies? Are they \ntruly doing business out of that little building? The only business \nthey are doing out of there is monkey business, and the monkey business \nthey are doing is to avoid the taxes they legitimately owe in this \ncountry. That is what is going on in this building in the Cayman \nIslands, the avoidance of taxes, legitimate taxes in this country. \nThere is a reason there are some very large companies that even though \nthey are hugely profitable pay absolutely nothing in taxes. That is not \nright. That is not fair. It should be stopped. Our colleagues on the \nother side, they do not want to stop it. They are against it. In fact, \nthey have taken a pledge that they will not increase tax revenues by \nclosing down this kind of tax dodge. They have taken a pledge not to do \nanything about it. Virtually every Republican has taken a pledge that \nthis would be a tax increase to shut down this kind of tax dodge. That \nis not right.\n  When we look at the longer term deficit and debt problem--I have \ntried to be clear--what we need to do is a two-step approach. The first \nstep, we need more economic growth. We need things to support this \neconomic recovery. We need more investment certainly in infrastructure \nwhere we are falling badly behind. But we also need a comprehensive \nlong-term plan to get us back on track, to face up to these deficits \nand debt. What is the best way to do that? Here is what the American \npeople say: We need a balanced approach.\n  Some people say cut spending. That is where 17 percent of the \nAmerican people are. Some say increase taxes. That is where 8 percent \nof the American people are. But 62 percent of the American people say \nwe have to do some of both. We have to cut spending. We have to raise \nrevenue. We ought to have a balanced plan.\n  So that is what the American people are telling us. Interestingly \nenough, that is what the President's fiscal commission concluded, the \nBowles-Simpson Commission. I was a member of it. There were 18 members, \nand 11 supported the recommendations of the commission--5 Democrats, 5 \nRepublicans, and 1 Independent. That is as bipartisan as you can get. \nWe took that balanced approach.\n  We reformed the revenue system to have a more fair tax system and \nshut down abusive tax havens and loopholes but also had further savings \non the spending side of the equation.\n  On this chart is an overview of the budget plan I developed based on \nthe fiscal commission's plan: $5.4 trillion in deficit reduction over \n10 years; lowers deficit to 1.4 percent of GDP in 2022, which is around \n10 percent of GDP; stabilizes gross debt by 2015; reduces discretionary \nspending to 4.8 percent of GDP by 2022, which has already been done; \nbuilds on health care reform savings; calls for Social Security reform, \nwith the savings to be used only to extend the life of Social Security \nitself.\n  Social Security was not part of the deficit reduction plan because \nSocial Security has not been a contributor to building the deficit and \ndebt. We also know Social Security is in trouble. Its solvency is in \nquestion. We recommended that any changes to Social Security be purely \nfor the purpose of extending the life of Social Security itself given \nthe incredibly important role it plays in our country.\n  We also included fundamental tax reform to raise revenue and to go \nafter these tax havens, these abusive tax shelters, and, yes, to ask \nthe wealthiest among us, some of whom--not all--have gotten away with \npaying very little, to pay their fair share.\n  This is what would happen to the deficit as a percentage of GDP under \nthat plan. You can see on this chart that it would be reduced \ndramatically--from 7.6 percent of GDP this year to 1.4 percent of GDP \nby 2021, really dramatic reductions as a percentage of GDP by 2016. \nThis chart is what would happen to the debt. Instead of it continuing \nto grow to more than 119 percent of GDP by 2022, that debt would be at \n93 percent of GDP by 2022. In the near term, debt would go up some \nmore, absolutely, because we have to deal with this economic weakness, \nbut over the full 10 years of the plan, the debt would be brought under \ncontrol and be brought down somewhat.\n  Those are the elements of the plan. I say to my colleagues that we \nhave to find a way to come together. It is important to the country \nthat we do. I am\n\n[[Page S4658]]\n\nretiring at the end of this year, but I hope we can find a way to \nreform the tax system and make it more fair, reform entitlements in \nrecognition that the baby boom generation is upon us. They are going to \nretire, and they are putting stress on these programs. These programs \nare critically important to life in America--certainly the lives of our \nsenior citizens. And we are going to have to do more about the \ndiscretionary accounts because, as I have indicated, they have already \nbeen hit repeatedly, and we are headed for a share of our budget going \nto the discretionary accounts that are a record low. I personally don't \nbelieve going back and cutting them more, beyond what has already been \ndone in the Budget Control Act passed last year, is a winning strategy.\n  I think this is an important and defining moment in this country's \nhistory. These are problems that are real. Certainly, to the millions \nof people who are without a job, we have an absolute obligation to do \neverything we can to strengthen this economy. We also have an absolute \nobligation to take on this debt threat because that hangs over the \ncountry as well.\n  We can do this. We have done it before. In the Clinton \nadministration, we got back to balanced budgets and strong economic \ngrowth, with the creation of more than 20 million jobs, and a country \nthat was prospering and doing better than any competitor on the face of \nthe globe. We can do it. I believe we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, the American people are angry because \nthey are living through the worst recession since the Great Depression. \nUnemployment is not 8.2 percent; real unemployment is closer to 15 \npercent. Young people who are graduating from high school and college \nare going out into the world, and they want to become independent and \ncreate jobs. There are no jobs. There are workers out there--and I am \nsure you know them--who are 50, 55 years old who intended to work out \nthe remainder of their work lives, and suddenly they got pink slips and \ntheir self-esteem was destroyed. They will never have another job \nagain, and they are worried about retirement security.\n  What the American people are angry about is that they understand they \ndid not cause this recession. Teachers did not cause this recession. \nFirefighters and police officers, who are being attacked daily by \nGovernors all over this country, did not cause this recession. \nConstruction workers did not cause this recession. This recession was \ncaused by the greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior of the people \non Wall Street.\n  What these people on Wall Street did was spend billions of dollars \ntrying to deregulate Wall Street, and they got their way. Five billion \ndollars in 10 years is what they spent. And then they were able to \nmerge investment banks with commercial banks with insurance companies, \nand they got everything they wanted. They said: Get the government off \nthe backs of Wall Street. They got it. The end result was that they \nplunged this country into the worst recession since the Great \nDepression.\n  Four years after the financial crisis caused by JPMorgan Chase, Bank \nof America, Goldman Sachs, and the other huge financial institutions, \none might have thought that perhaps they learned something, that maybe \nthe lesson of the great financial crisis was that you cannot continue \nto maintain the largest gambling casino in the history of the world. \nBut apparently they have not learned that lesson. They are back at it \nagain. We have recently seen the $2 billion or $3 billion gambling \nlosses at JPMorgan Chase.\n  What we need from Wall Street if we are going to put people back to \nwork is investment in the productive economy. Small and medium-sized \nbusinesses all over this country need affordable loans, and that is \nwhat financial institutions should be doing. They should be helping us \ncreate jobs, expand businesses, not continuing to engage in their wild \nand exotic gambling schemes.\n  When we talk about why the American people are angry, they are angry \nbecause they understand that Wall Street received the largest taxpayer \nbailout in the history of the world. But it was not just the $700 \nbillion that Congress approved through TARP. As a result of an \nindependent audit that some of us helped to bring about in the Dodd-\nFrank bill, we learned that the Federal Reserve provided a jaw-dropping \n$16 trillion in virtually zero-interest loans to every major financial \ninstitution in this country, the central banks all over the world, to \nlarge corporations in America and, in fact, even wealthy individuals. \nWhat the American people are saying is that if the Fed can provide $16 \ntrillion to large financial institutions, why can't they begin to move \nto protect homeowners, unemployed workers, and the middle class of this \ncountry?\n\n  The American people are looking around them. They are angry not just \nbecause unemployment is high, they are angry not just because millions \nof people have lost their homes and life savings, they are angry \nbecause they understand that the middle class of this country is \ncollapsing, poverty is increasing, while at the same time the people on \ntop are doing phenomenally well. The taxpayers bailed out Wall Street, \nand Wall Street recovers, Wall Street does well, but now we have kids \nin this country graduating college deeply in debt, can't find a job, \nand we have older workers losing their jobs, and people are saying: \nWhat is going on in America?\n  I believe the American people ultimately are angry because they are \nlooking at this great country--a country for which many of our veterans \nfought and died--and what they are seeing is this Nation is losing its \nmiddle class, losing its democratic values, and, in fact, is moving \ntoward an oligarchic form of government, where a handful of \nbillionaires control the economic and political life of this Nation.\n  In the United States today, we have the most unequal distribution of \nwealth and income since the 1920s. You are not going to see what I am \ntalking about now on Fox or NBC or CBS, but it is important that we \ndiscuss this issue because it is one of the most important issues \nfacing America.\n  Today, the wealthiest 400 individuals in America own more wealth than \nthe bottom half of America, 150 million people--400 to 150 million. \nToday--and this is really quite amazing--the six heirs to the Walmart \nfortune--the Walmart company started by Sam Walton, his children--one \nfamily now owns more wealth than do the bottom 30 percent of the \nAmerican people. One family owns more wealth than the bottom 30 percent \nor 90 million Americans. Today, the top 1 percent owns 40 percent of \nall of the wealth in America. The top 1 percent owns 40 percent of all \nthe wealth in America.\n  What do we think the bottom 60 percent of the American people own? I \nask this question a lot around Vermont. I have a lot of meetings. I say \nthat the top 1 percent owns 40 percent, and people say: That is not \ngood, but we understand that.\n  Then I ask: What about the bottom 60 percent?\n  Maybe they own 15 or 20 percent, they say.\n  The answer is that they own less than 2 percent--less than 2 percent. \nSo you have the bottom 60 percent of the American people owning less \nthan 2 percent of the wealth, and the top 1 percent owns 40 percent of \nthe wealth.\n  Here is another astounding fact. We don't see it much in the media \nand many colleagues don't talk about it too often, but, incredibly, the \nbottom 40 percent of the American people own three-tenths of 1 percent \nof the wealth in this country.\n  I know we have some of my colleagues coming up and saying: Look, not \neverybody in America is paying taxes. You have millions of people not \npaying any taxes.\n  No kidding. Well, they don't have any money. All of the money is on \nthe top.\n  According to a new study from the Federal Reserve, the medium net \nworth for middle-class families dropped by nearly 40 percent from 2007 \nto 2010, primarily because of the plummeting value of homes. That is \nthe equivalent of wiping out 18 years of savings for the average \nmiddle-class family.\n  I have talked about distribution of wealth. That is what you \naccumulate in your lifetime. Let me say a word about income, which is \nwhat we earn in a year. The last study that was done on\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\nincome distribution was done recently. This is what it told us, and \nthis is literally quite hard to believe. The last study on income \ndistribution showed us that between the years 2009 and 2010, 93 percent \nof all new income created in the previous year went to the top 1 \npercent. Ninety-three percent of all the new income created between \n2009, 2010--the last information we had--went to the top 1 percent, \nwhile the bottom 99 percent had the privilege of enjoying the remaining \n7 percent. In other words, the wealthiest people in this country are \nbecoming phenomenally wealthier, the middle class is disappearing, and \npoverty is increasing.\n\n  When we talk about an oligarchic form of government, what we are \ntalking about is not just a handful of families owning entire nations, \nwe are also talking about the politics of the nation. As a result of \nthis disastrous Citizens United decision, which is now 2 years of age--\none of the worst decisions ever brought about by the Supreme Court of \nthis country and a decision they just reaffirmed a few days ago with \nregard to Montana--what the Supreme Court has done is to say to the \nwealthiest people in this country: OK. You own almost all the wealth of \nthis Nation. That is great. Now we are going to give you an opportunity \nto own the political life of this Nation, and if you are getting bored \nby just owning coal companies and casinos and manufacturing plants, you \nnow have the opportunity to own the U.S. Government.\n  So we have people such as the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson--the \nKoch brothers are worth $50 billion. That is what they are worth. They \nare worth $50 billion and they have said they are prepared to put $400 \nmillion into this campaign to defeat Obama, to defeat candidates who \nare representing working families. Sheldon Adelson, who is only worth \n$20 billion--he is kind of a pauper--is willing to spend what it takes \nto buy the government. If we look at it, that ain't a bad deal. If \nsomeone is worth $50 billion and they spend $1 billion or $2 billion, \nthey can buy the U.S. Government. That is a pretty good investment, and \nthat is what they are about to do.\n  On the one hand, we have a grossly unequal distribution of wealth in \nincome. These guys control the economy. We have the six largest \nfinancial institutions in this country that have assets equivalent to \ntwo-thirds of the GDP of America--over $9 trillion--and these six \nfinancial institutions write half the mortgages and two-thirds of the \ncredit cards in America. That is a huge impact on the economy. But that \nis not enough for these guys. The top 1 percent own 40 percent of the \nwealth--not enough for these guys. Now they have the opportunity to buy \nthe U.S. Government.\n  So that is where we are. In my view, working families all over this \ncountry are saying enough is enough. They want this Congress to start \nstanding for them and not just the millionaires and the billionaires \nwho are spending unbelievable sums of money in this campaign. It seems \nto me what we have to do is start listening to the needs of working \nfamilies--the vast majority of our people--and not just the people who \nmake campaign contributions.\n  I know that is a very radical idea. I do know that. But it might be a \ngood idea to try a little bit to reaffirm the faith of the American \npeople in their Democratic form of government. We could let them know \njust a little bit that maybe we are hearing their pain--their \nunemployment, their debt, the fact they are losing their houses, the \nfact they do not have any health care, the fact they can't afford to \nsend their kids to college. Maybe, just maybe, we ought to listen to \nthem before we go out running to another fundraising event with \nmillionaires and billionaires.\n  I do know, however, that is a radical idea. So let's talk about what \nwe can actually do for the American people. In the midst of this \nterrible recession, where real unemployment is closer to 15 percent if \nyou include those folks who have given up looking for work and those \npeople working part-time when they want to work full time, we know the \nfastest way to create decent-paying jobs is to rebuild our crumbling \ninfrastructure.\n  I see the Senator from Minnesota has taken the chair and is now \npresiding, and I don't know about Minnesota, but I do know in Vermont \nmany of our bridges are in desperate need of repair, our roads are in \nneed of repair, and our rail system is falling further and further \nbehind Europe and China. We have water systems that desperately need \nrepair, wastewater plants, and we have schools that need repair. We can \nput millions of people back to work making our country more competitive \nand more efficient by addressing our infrastructure crisis. Let's do \nit.\n  It is beyond my comprehension why we can't even get a modest \ntransportation bill. I know Chairwoman Boxer and Senator Inhofe are \nworking on a modest transportation bill, but we can't even get that \nthrough the House. In fact, we have to do a lot more than that, but at \nleast they are making the effort.\n  At a time when we spend some $300 billion a year importing oil from \nSaudi Arabia and other foreign countries, at a time when this planet is \nstruggling with global warming and all the extreme weather disturbances \nwe see, and the billions of dollars we are spending in response to \nthese extreme weather disturbances, we need to move toward energy \nindependence. We need to reverse greenhouse gas emissions. In other \nwords, we need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel \ninto energy efficiency and into sustainable energies, such as wind, \nsolar, geothermal, and biomass. When we do that, we also create a \nsubstantial number of decent-paying jobs.\n  By the way, in the midst of a very competitive global economy, what \nwe should not be doing is laying off teachers and childcare workers. We \nshould be investing in education, not laying off those people who are \neducating our kids.\n  I know there is a lot of discussion on the floor with regard to the \nnational debt--almost $16 trillion--and the deficit--over $1 trillion. \nThat is a serious issue and we have to deal with it. But my view is a \nlittle different than many of my colleagues in terms of how we deal \nwith it.\n  I think most Americans understand the causation of the deficit \ncrisis; that is, President Bush went to war in Iraq and he went to war \nin Afghanistan, and he just forgot something. We all have memory \nlapses, don't we? We go shopping and we forget to buy the milk or the \nbread. He had a memory lapse. He forgot to pay for those wars--a couple \ntrillion dollars' worth. He forgot to pay for them. To all of our \ndeficit hawks out here, all those folks who say we have to cut food \nstamps, we have to cut education, we have to cut health care--oh, two \nwars, $2 trillion, $3 trillion, $4 trillion? Hey, no problem, no \nproblem at all.\n  For the first time, as I understand it, in the history of this \ncountry, we went to war--which is an expensive proposition--and at the \nsame time not only did we not raise the money to pay for the war, we \nwent the other way and decided to give huge tax breaks, including to \nthe wealthiest people in this country. We spent trillions going to war \nand we gave tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country. That \nbegins to add up. That is called creating a deficit.\n\n  Then, on top of that, because of the greed and the recklessness and \nillegal behavior on Wall Street, which drove us into this recession--\nand when you are in a recession and people are unemployed and small \nbusinesses go under, less revenue is coming into the Federal Treasury. \nIf we are spending a whole lot, less revenue is coming in, so you have \na deficit crisis.\n  Some of my Republican friends say--and some Democrats say--maybe we \nshould have paid for the war. Yes, you are right. Maybe we shouldn't \nhave given those tax breaks to the rich. Maybe you are right. But be \nthat as it may, we are where we are and we need deficit reduction and \nwe know how to do it. We are going to cut Social Security.\n  My friends back home, when you hear folks talking about Social \nSecurity reform, hold on to your wallets because they are talking about \ncuts in Social Security--nothing more, nothing less. I don't know about \nMinnesota, Mr. President, but in Vermont no one has heard of the \nconcept of chained CPI. I have asked them, and they do not know what \nchained CPI is, which is what they are trying to pass here. It is this \nbelief--and senior citizens back home will start laughing when I say\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\nthis--that COLAs for Social Security are too high. Seniors back home \nare scratching their heads, saying: Wait. We just went through 2 years \nwhen my prescription drug costs went up, my health care costs went up \nand I got zero in COLA and there are people in Washington--Republicans, \nsome Democrats--who think I got too much in COLA? What world are these \npeople living in? That is the reality.\n  So some of the folks here want to pass something called a chained \nCPI, which, if it were imposed--and I will do everything I can to see \nit does not get imposed--would mean seniors between the ages of 65 and \n75 would lose about $550 a year. Then, when they are 85 and they are \ntrying to get by on $13,000 or $14,000 a year, it will cost them about \n1,000 bucks a year. That is what some of our colleagues want to do--\nvirtually all the Republicans want to do it and some Democrats want to \ndo it as well. I am going to, as chairman of the Defend Social Security \nCaucus, do everything I can to prevent that.\n  They also want to cut Medicare and Medicaid. We have 50 million \npeople without any health insurance at all, we have people paying huge \ndeductibles, Medicaid covering nursing home care, and they want to cut \nMedicare and Medicaid. They have the brilliant idea, some of them, that \nmaybe we should raise the retirement age for Medicare from 65 to 67. \nTell me about somebody in Minnesota who is 66 and is diagnosed with \ncancer, and if we do what the Republicans want us to do in the House, \nwhich is to create a voucher plan for Medicare, we would give that \nperson a check for, I don't know, $7,000, I think, or $8,000, and we \nwould say: Go out to the private insurance market, anyone you want, \nhere is your $7,000 or $8,000--remember, they are suffering with \ncancer--and go get your insurance. I guess that would last them maybe 1 \nor 2 days in the hospital is what it would do. But that is the \nRepublican plan.\n  I agree that deficit reduction is a real issue, and I think we have \nto deal with it. But we are not, if I have anything to say about it, \ngoing to deal with it on the backs of the elderly, the children, the \nsick, the poor, and the hungry. The way we deal with deficit reduction \nin a responsible way, in a fair way, is to look to the billionaires in \nthis country who are doing phenomenally well and make the point that \nWarren Buffett made, that there is something a little absurd about \nmillionaires and billionaires today, in the midst of the deficit \ncrisis, paying the lowest tax rates they have paid in decades. Yes, we \nare going to have to ask the wealthiest people in this country to start \npaying their fair share of taxes.\n  I saw a piece in the paper the other day which was quite incredible. \nRich people, apparently, are giving up their citizenship. They are \nleaving America and going abroad. These great lovers of America who \nmade their money in this country, when we ask them to start paying \ntheir fair share of taxes, start running abroad. We have 19-year-old \nkids who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan who went abroad not to \nescape taxes; they are working-class kids who died in wars. Now the \nbillionaires want to run abroad in order to avoid paying their fair \nshare of taxes. What patriotism; what love of country.\n  We have to deal with deficit reduction, but we don't have to cut \nSocial Security, we don't have to cut Medicare, we don't have to cut \nMedicaid, and we don't have to cut education. We can ask the wealthiest \npeople, the millionaires and billionaires, to start paying their fair \nshare of taxes. We can end these outrageous corporate loopholes Senator \nConrad talked about. He showed a picture of a building in the Cayman \nIslands where there are 18,000 corporations using the same postal \naddress in order to avoid paying their taxes. We are losing about $100 \nbillion a year. We have large corporations making billions, and paying, \nin some cases, nothing in taxes. That is the way to get to deficit \nreduction, not on the backs of people who are already hurting.\n  We are at a very difficult moment in American history. We are in the \nprocess of losing the great middle class. We are seeing more of our \npeople being poor. We are seeing savage attacks being waged against the \nelderly in terms of cuts in Social Security and Medicare, attacks \nagainst those who get sick in terms of going after Medicaid and \nMedicare.\n  I think what the American people are saying is enough is enough. This \ngreat country belongs to all of us. It cannot continue to be controlled \nby a handful of billionaires who apparently want it all.\n  I cannot understand why people who have billions of dollars are \ncompulsively driven for more and more. When is enough enough? How many \nchildren in this country have got to go hungry? How many people have \ngot to die because they don't go to a doctor because you want to avoid \npaying your taxes? That is not what America is about. That is not what \npeople fought and died to create.\n  We have a fight on our hands. The job of the Senate is to represent \nthe middle-class working families of this country, all of the people, \nand not just the superrich. I hope we can begin to do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Western Wildfire Policy\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to make sure that Congress is \naware of what is happening across the American West. Some 32,000 people \nwere just evacuated from their homes in Colorado. In Utah and New \nMexico, hundreds of homes have been destroyed or are under threat. In \nmy State of Montana, five counties are in states of emergency as seven \nmajor fires rage across the State. We have evacuated over 200 homes in \nHelena alone, with plumes of smoke billowing behind the State capitol. \nThe Signal Peak coal mine in eastern Montana has been evacuated and \nfires that threaten it have burned nearly 60,000 acres in less than a \nday. Experts on the ground are saying they have never seen conditions \nlike these so early in the fire season, with wildfires burning through \nbeetle-killed areas with increasing speed. These beetle-killed areas \nare areas that are dead due to pine bark beetle infestations. The trees \nare dead and dry and they explode when they catch on fire.\n  Yesterday, wind gusted up to 55 miles per hour, grounding aircraft \nand preventing them from attacking the fires early. But the conditions \nfor these wildfires did not happen overnight. The problem is the dry \nclimate, the lack of preparation, and lack of resources available to \ncontain these fires.\n  I first want to express my sincerest appreciation to the brave \nfirefighters battling these blazes. On behalf of Montanans and folks \nacross the West, I want to thank you for all you do. Firefighters risk \ntheir lives every day for folks they have never met. We owe you our \nrespect and our gratitude, and my thoughts and prayers are with you.\n  We also owe them the resources they need to efficiently fight these \nfires and we owe them the policies that will best benefit the landscape \nthey are working so hard to protect. Forest Service fire officials say \nthere are three parts to preventing and controlling wildfires. The \nfirst is reducing hazardous fuels, especially in the wildland-urban \ninterface. The second is protecting towns with community wildfire plans \nand implementing defensible space around structures. And the third is \nwe must provide and be ready with the resources to fight fires once \nthey have started.\n  Yet Congress has consistently reduced the resources set aside for the \nForest Service to proactively reduce the risk presented by fires. \nHazardous fuels reduction funding has declined over the past few years, \nand this year the administration proposed to continue reducing these \nfunds. The House of Representatives is also failing to give the Forest \nService the tools it needs to address this growing problem by playing \npolitics that will prevent solutions that will improve the health of \nthe exact forests where these fires are raging in Montana and Colorado.\n  For 4 years I have worked to pass a forest management bill that would \nreduce these trees that are providing\n\n[[Page S4661]]\n\ndangerous fuel for two of these fires in Montana. Additionally, the \nSenate created the FLAME wildfire account to specifically put money \naside for this exact kind of emergency situation. Yet this year the \nPresident's budget reduces the FLAME account by nearly $\\1/2\\ billion.\n  We have been robbing this account to keep the Forest Service afloat, \nbut the Forest Service has still lost nearly 40 percent of its \npurchasing power over the last 20 years as the number, cost, and \nfrequency of these fires increased. Back in 2000, not that long ago, \nthere were more than 40 forest firefighting planes. Today there are 10, \nand 9 of them are from a fleet of planes used during the Korean war.\n  This spring I asked the Chief of the Forest Service if we were ready \nin case of a bad fire season this year. He admitted that the Forest \nService did not have the resources to deal with an above-average fire \nyear.\n  This issue will not go away when the fire season comes to an end. \nWith large parts of the West getting hotter and drier over the past few \ndecades, our efforts to improve forest health and give the firefighters \nthe resources they need cannot stop when the weather gets cold. We need \nto commit to providing proper resources to the firefighters who are \nprotecting our communities, and we also need to provide the Forest \nService and the Bureau of Land Management with the tools and resources \nthey need to prevent catastrophic wildfires in the first place.\n  Some of us have been talking about hazardous fuel reduction in \nwestern forests before today, but it has fallen on deaf ears. Now I ask \nyou to heed the call on you to provide the necessary resources. \nMontanans and folks all across the West are evacuating their homes. \nFirefighters are risking their lives. We need to step up and help them \ntoday and we need to responsibly invest in resources and land \nmanagement policies that will make a difference in the future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                            Flood Insurance\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the National Flood \nInsurance Program and the status of the bill that is in the Senate \ntoday. This is a bill the Banking Committee has been working on, and we \ncertainly appreciate the chairman and ranking member and all of the \nmembers of the Banking Committee for working on this very important \npiece of legislation.\n  I will note that when the bill came through the Banking Committee, \nthe chairman and ranking member asked that no amendments be offered and \nthat these be handled on the Senate floor at a later time. Here we are \ntoday, and it is time for us to handle those amendments and those \nchanges to this very important piece of legislation. Unfortunately, we \nhear rumors that in the House and the various negotiations going on \nwith the Transportation bill--as well as the student loan bill--they \nare trying to include the flood insurance bill with those. I think that \nis a tragic mistake. I think that endangers the very high chances of \nthose two bills passing the Senate.\n  In fact, what endangers the passage is the national flood insurance \nbill needs work. We need to let the Senate work on it. We need to let \nthe Senate be the Senate and offer amendments and debate, and we need \nto bring this bill to a final vote. But we also need the opportunity, \nas Senators, to offer amendments to this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I just want to say the fundamental problem--and it is not only me--\nmany of us have with this very important legislation deals with flood \ninsurance. Insurance is a concept that should be based on risk. Flood \ninsurance has always been based on risk. In fact, if you talk to any \nprivate insurance company, that is what they are doing. They manage \nrisk, they assess risk, and they look at risk. They are looking at the \nchances of something going wrong and some damages occurring, and the \nthird party, the insurance company, pays for those damages and makes \npeople whole.\n  Well, flood insurance is no different. It has never been any \ndifferent. For years and years the private sector offered flood \ninsurance. Now I think the Federal Government is the only one offering \nit in the whole country. There may be a few isolated areas where they \ndo offer it, but I think the private sector has gotten out of the flood \ninsurance business because of the enormous costs when there is a flood. \nThey basically priced themselves out of the market because the premiums \ndon't cover the payouts now. Nonetheless, the risk has always been \nfundamental to the whole concept of insurance.\n  This bill changes that. This bill says if someone lives behind a \nlevee or near a dam or some other flood-control structure, then they \nare going to have a requirement to purchase flood insurance regardless \nof the risk. If they live behind a levee, near a dam, or some other \nflood-control structure and they are in the 100-year floodplain, they \nare going to be required to purchase flood insurance. It is not based \non risk. It is a per se mandatory requirement based on location. I am \nnot sure if we can find anything in the insurance world equivalent to \nthis.\n  Certainly, I think it is bad public policy. There are many reasons it \nis bad public policy. But the most important reason is we are going to \nbe requiring millions and millions of Americans to purchase flood \ninsurance in areas that will never flood. They will never need it. The \nreason they will never need it is because they are protected by levees \nand dams and other flood-control structures. Those structures work.\n  I will give an example in a minute of the Mississippi River and \ntributary system. Before I give that example, let me say those \nstructures work. When floods happen, those areas that would otherwise \nflood don't flood. This bill treats those areas as if there are no \nlevees at all or infrastructure there to protect people.\n  Senator Durbin has told me the story of an area on the St. Louis side \nof Illinois--down in the southern area of Illinois, southwest of where \nthey have had flooding. The people locally raised their taxes so they \ncould build levees and design those levees and maintain those levees so \nthat flooding will never happen again. They have done this. They have \ntaken responsibility.\n  Unfortunately, this bill would say they are going to have to pay \ntwice. They are going to have to pay their taxes to build and maintain \nthose levees, and their people are going to be required to purchase \nflood insurance. This is flood insurance they will never need or ever \nuse. If they live behind a certified levee--and there are ways for \nlevees to be decertified. If a levee is not safe or up to standards, it \nshould be decertified. But when someone lives behind a certified levee \nor dam or some other flood structure that will prevent flooding, the \nCongress should recognize that fact and not require people to purchase \nflood insurance.\n  Let me go to this map. Some people may not realize they have levees \nin their State. This map shows there are levees in basically every \nState of the Union. For our visual purposes, we did not put Hawaii and \nAlaska on this map because it would take up so much space. But they \nhave levees as well. Every dark green area shows counties where there \nare levees. That doesn't mean, obviously, that every single person in \nthat county is protected by that levee, but there are levees in that \ncounty. We can see there are levees coast to coast in this country. I \ndon't know if all 50 States have one. There may be one or two that \ndon't, but basically they are everywhere. They are all over the \ncountry. These levees work.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the Corps of Engineers. Everybody here \nknows I have had occasions where I have criticized the Corps of \nEngineers when I didn't agree with what they did or when they didn't do \nsomething right or they did something I thought was dumb or whatever \nthe case may be. But on this issue, none of us should have any \ncriticism of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers because they know how to \ndo a lot of things, and one of the things they know how to do is how to \ndesign, build, and maintain levees.\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\n  This map shows they have something called the Mississippi River and \ntributary system, and that is up and down the Mississippi with some of \nthe tributaries going up and down the Mississippi. The Corps of \nEngineers, which designs and builds and maintains those MR levees--\nand this is a very important point--have never failed. They have been \naround since 1928 with zero failure. Not one time have they failed.\n  Nonetheless, this legislation that may be included in this package \nthat is coming over from the House is going to require millions and \nmillions of Americans who live behind the safest levees in the world to \nbuy flood insurance for no reason. They are never going to flood. As \nlong as we have the MR and as long as the Corps of Engineers is \ndesigning and maintaining these, we are going to get a big return on \nour investment.\n\n  In fact, the return on our investment for the MR is something like \n$35 to $1. We get a huge return. For every dollar we put in, we save \n$35 based on that investment. The MR has prevented $478 billion--with \na ``b''--worth of property damage in this country. That is $478 billion \nin savings, and we are going to require all those people to buy flood \ninsurance. The Congress is going to enter into a legal fiction. They \nare going to pretend as if those levees are not even there. If people \nare in the 100-mile flood zone, they don't get any benefit from the \nfact that they live behind this levee system.\n  Let me say one more thing about the MR levee; that is, it not only \nis the safest in the world, it is the envy of the world. The Corps of \nEngineers travels around the world, and the world travels to the United \nStates of America to see the levee system and the locks and dams and \nthe other flood-control structures the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has \nbuilt on our rivers. They are the model that other countries are trying \nto follow. Why are they the model? Because they work. They design them \nright, build them right, and maintain them right.\n  Again, we get $35 to $1. For every $1 we put in, we get a $35 return \non that investment. There are over 4.1 million people protected just by \nthe MR That is a small fraction of what the Corps of Engineers does. \nAgain, there are 4.1 million people protected by the MR\n  Over half the U.S. population lives somewhere near a levee. We don't \nknow exactly how FEMA will administer this law because we don't know \nexactly what is going to come out of the House, if it does pass. But I \ncan guarantee what is going to happen is very simple. As soon as this \ntakes effect, we are going to have thousands and thousands of people \ncalling us, e-mailing us, and writing us. They will be saying: Why is \nthe Congress making my mortgage payment go up? Because that is how this \nis going to work. Those lenders and the Federal Government are going to \nrequire that people purchase flood insurance.\n  Again, we don't know the exact numbers because we don't know how this \nis going to be structured or how it is going to be applied just yet. \nOur best guesstimate is the average homeowner in this country is going \nto owe somewhere between $1,000 to $2,000 a year. It is not a one-time \ndeal, but $1,000 to $2,000 a year in flood insurance that they will \nnever need and they will never use. For some people that will be $100 \nor more a month. Of course, it depends on their house and on a lot of \nother circumstances, but that is serious money for people especially if \nwe are requiring them to spend that for no good reason at all.\n  Let me just talk about the Mississippi River and tributary system \nagain for a moment.\n  Everybody remembers that last year we had the potential of \nhorrendously bad flooding in the midsection of the country. There is no \ndoubt that our levees in Arkansas were stressed. Even the Mississippi \nRiver and tributary system levee was stressed last year; there is no \nquestion about it. There is a reason for that. In 2011, we saw the \nflood of record on the Mississippi River. Some people are saying it is \nactually the 500-year flood. These levees can be built to withstand up \nto 500-year floods. Some people are saying this was the 500-year flood. \nThat hasn't been certified yet, but certainly there was a huge amount \nof water flowing through the Mississippi River. It was in every station \non the Mississippi from Cairo, IL, to Natchez, MS. They broke the \nrecord last year--every single station. And here is the key: Not one \nlevee broke. The biggest flood we have ever had, and not one levee \nbroke.\n  The Senate bill will say that even though those levees don't break, \neven though they are the best in the world, even though they can \nwithstand the 500-year flood, we are going to make those people buy \nflood insurance. I don't think that is right. I don't think that is \nfair. I think the people should be outraged if we make that requirement \non them. That infrastructure last year prevented $110 billion in \ndamages--in one flood, in one spring, $110 billion worth of damages. It \nprotected 10 million acres of land up and down the Mississippi River. \nSo 10 million acres and nearly 1 million structures were spared because \nof MR We did not lose one life, no flooding where it was not \nsupposed to flood.\n  My colleagues will remember last year they blew the levee at Birds \nPoint, by design. That is part of the levee system. When the water gets \nso high and so enormous, we start to get these 500-year levels, they \nbuild these safety valves up and down the river. They had to use one \nlast year. They blew the levee at Birds Point in Missouri. It worked \nexactly as it was supposed to work. I know the farmers up there weren't \nreal happy, but they understood the risks of where they live and how \nthat works. That has been the deal up there for a long time. They blew \nthat levee. The water spilled into there. It took pressure off the \nriver and off the levees. That is what happened, and it works.\n  Let me show my colleagues this chart. This is sort of an artist's \nrendering, if you will, of the levee. There is a lot of science and \nengineering that goes into these levees. The flood of 1927 is so famous \nbecause it did change everything in this country. For the first time \never, the Federal Government took responsibility for levees up and down \nthe Mississippi River and took it in a national way and created a \nnational system.\n  By the way, there is a great book by John Barry called ``Rising \nTide.'' If my colleagues haven't read it, it is worth reading. It is a \ngood book about the flooding of 1927. That is the flood everybody talks \nabout because back then we had a very inadequate levee system. There \nwere floods all up and down the whole Mississippi River Valley, the \nwhole watershed. I think it started raining that year on Christmas Eve \nof 1926, or somewhere in there, and it basically rained every day \nthrough Easter. It rained and rained and rained and rained through that \narea, and we didn't have the flood control to protect it. We had some \nlevees, but they weren't scientifically done and they weren't \nengineered properly. They weren't big enough or strong enough. After \nthat flood, the U.S. Government took over. So the levee system on the \nMR goes back to 1928, the year after this 1927 flood.\n  Anyway, the way a levee works is they design most levees--kind of the \nstandard design--for a 100-year flood. That means there is a 1-percent \nchance every year that we are going to get to a certain level. Once \nevery 100 years, that is what it is going to do, a 1-percent chance. We \ncan see the way the MR is built, that isn't the half of it, because \nthey actually built beyond the 500-year flood. In 1937, we saw a much \nbigger flood than the 1927 flood, but guess what. The levee system \nworked. They had it built and completed and it worked. It did great.\n  Levees are very important. We may not think they are very exciting, \nwe may not think they make a lot of headlines, but they work. We can \nsee an example right here. Here is a rural area, a farmland area, \nprotected by a levee, right there. We see a lot of water down here, but \nthere is no water over here, and that is exactly the way they are \nsupposed to work, and they do work.\n  The point is the Senate bill would say even though we have this \nlevee, these people living over here are going to have to buy flood \ninsurance. It is not going to flood. It is never going to flood there. \nWe have it protected. But they are going to have to buy flood \ninsurance. It is generally unfair and it is not right and we should not \ndo that to our people.\n  Let me say a few other words here before I move on. This map right \nhere I think says a lot. This is the one I\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\nstarted with. We really do have levees everywhere, all around the \ncountry. There are 881 counties that have levees. Those counties \ncontain more than 50 percent of the population of the United States. \nSo, again, this legislation that is now trying to be attached to \nwhatever vehicle is coming back through is going to adversely affect \nabout half of the U.S. population in one way or the other.\n  Also, if someone lives in an area that has levees, they can forget \nabout economic development--just forget about it. Once they start doing \nthis and saying everybody has to have flood insurance living in this \nflood plain--even though it is not going to flood, we are still going \nto require that--forget about economic development. It is going to be \nextremely difficult for people to stay there and to have insurance in \nthose areas.\n  This bill that came out of the Banking Committee I think is a good \nbill. I think we need to do it. We need to pass it. I am not trying to \nslow it down at all. In fact, I started this week thinking that we \nwould have a chance to vote on the bill this week, that we would have a \nchance to debate the bill and offer amendments to the bill. I \nunderstand now there are some nongermane, nonrelevant amendments to the \nlegislation. I think that is unfortunate. Hopefully, we can work \nthrough that. But I have an amendment that is very germane. In fact, at \none point we had to change the language because the Senator from \nAlabama wanted to do a substitute, so we have changed our language. We \nstill think we have anywhere from 13 to 15 cosponsors on my amendment. \nSenator Hoeven and many others have joined me--again, about 13 to 15 \nSenators. In addition, after checking with Senate offices, we have \nabout 50 votes that we know of. I am counting 51. We have about 20 \noffices that are looking at it that may be leaning toward voting for \nit, but they haven't committed to saying yes.\n\n  I think it is very likely, if we allow the Senate to be the Senate, \nwe will take care of the problem in this Banking Committee bill. I \nthink we can do that. I think we can have that vote. I think the Pryor-\nHoeven amendment carries the day. I don't know that. We don't know \nuntil we debate and get in here and have a vote and see how it goes. I \nthink right now what we need to do is let the Senate be the Senate and \nlet the Senate debate, let the Senate argue. We fuss with each other \nsometimes, I know that, but let's have a vote on this amendment. I \nthink there are well over 50 votes in this Chamber right now to take \nthese provisions--it is section 107--out of this legislation and leave \nin a couple of studies. We think it is fine to have studies. We think \nwe should study this. That is good. Again, we are not trying to slow \nthis down. We are not trying to bury our head in the sand saying we \ndon't think there is any risk at all. So let's study it, let's look at \nit, and let's see what makes sense.\n  I will tell my colleagues what doesn't make sense. It doesn't make \nsense to ignore the best levee system in the world.\n  Let me also say this: There are several levees around the country \nthat are not done by the Corps of Engineers. They don't have the kind \nof resources and expertise the Corps brings to building levees and \nflood control. We need to acknowledge that. There are levees in this \ncountry that should be decertified; they don't meet the standards; they \nmaybe weren't built correctly and/or they haven't been maintained \ncorrectly. We have to maintain these levees carefully. We have to trim \nthe vegetation. We have to be watching for things such as sand boils \nand structural defects. We need to go in and make adjustments from time \nto time. It is the reality of operating a system of levees. Honestly, \nthere are places around the country where that hasn't been done. Those \nlevees should not be certified unless they are repaired and brought up \nto standards. And the people behind those levees don't have real flood \nprotection, so maybe they should pay for insurance. I am not opposed to \nthat. I think they probably should. I think that is what these studies \nwill help us sort out: How do we draw that line? How do we make that \ndecision? Why don't we take a little time to study this and try to make \nsure we get this policy right so we are not charging the people for \ninsurance they will never need?\n  Let me also say we do have several others here in the Senate who are \nfor this. They have been very supportive from the very beginning. I \nhave several colleagues I wish to thank publicly. I think some do want \nto come over and talk about this development today, where we may not \nget a chance to vote on the amendment. Pretty much everybody, almost \nwithout exception, maybe one or two exceptions, but almost without \nexception, pretty much everybody who was with the original amendment is \ngoing to stick with this amendment, even though it is structured a \nlittle differently because it amends the substitute and it also leaves \nin these two studies, but that is fine. We have never had a problem \nwith the two studies. Again, if we adopt the Senate bill, the Senate \nproposal, if it comes over from the House without us having a chance to \neven offer our amendment, I think we are negating a very wise \ninvestment we have made around the country in the levees that the Corps \nof Engineers has built for us.\n  It is not logical that we would not consider the actual risks \ninvolved and where people live. It is not logical that we would pretend \nthese levees aren't even there. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make \nsense in any way, shape, or form, and that is what we are being denied \ntoday as Senators. We should have a chance to look at this legislation, \nopen it and read it, to pick at it, to find things we don't agree with, \nask questions about it. Certainly I have gone through here. My \ncolleagues can see that I have highlighted this bill and I have written \non it and made notes in the margin and have questions about it. I am \ntrying to do what Senators should do. We should work on legislation, be \nvery constructive, if we have problems with it, try to get it amended, \ntry to convince our colleagues that our arguments should carry the day \nand that we should prevail and that we should amend legislation.\n  We all recognize the Banking Committee has worked very hard on this \nissue. We appreciate the chairman and the ranking member for their hard \nwork and the hard work of all their staff. They have been great. But \nsince the bill did not get amended in the committee, it ought to at \nleast have a chance to be amended on the Senate floor, especially when \nthere is at least one amendment where it looks as though well over 50 \nSenators support that amendment. It would be an injustice if this \nprovision was not included in what is coming over from the House. As I \nsaid before, it also endangers the passage of the surface \ntransportation bill as well as the student loan provisions that are \nvery popular with people. I think we have plenty of votes to pass both \nof those, but if the cost of that means--if the tradeoff for that means \nwe are going to be charging people for flood insurance they don't \nneed--it is mandatory now. This is not an option. It is mandatory. They \nhave to buy flood insurance. I do not think that is a tradeoff we \nshould make.\n\n  Also, I was talking to someone earlier, and they said: We need \nstudent loans. I agree with that. I am all for lowering the rate of \nstudent loans. But I can guarantee it is going to be less money out of \npocket for people on the student loans than it is to be buying this \nflood insurance every year--no doubt about that--because this stuff is \nvery expensive and the difference in the student loans is not going to \nbe $1,000 or $2,000 a year. The difference in student loans is maybe \ngoing to be a few hundred dollars a year. It is significant and it \nhelps and we want people to go to college--and I am all for that--but \nthis is the pocketbook issue: the fact that we are going to be \nrequiring people to purchase insurance they do not need.\n  So what my amendment does is remove the mandatory language in section \n107. It basically says people are not going to be required to purchase \nflood insurance just merely because they live behind a levee or near a \ndam or some other flood control structure.\n  As I said, right now the way the banking bill is drafted, it is a per \nse requirement based on location, not based on risk. It is based on \nlocation.\n  Let me also say something about the Senator from Alabama. He reached \nan agreement with one of the Senators from Mississippi, and I \nappreciate that. That amendment does make the bill a little better--it \ndoes--because the way the bill was originally structured, it\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\ndid not matter if someone lived in a 100-year floodplain or a 500-year \nfloodplain, it did not matter; they were going to buy that insurance.\n  What Senator Cochran of Mississippi was able to work out was to at \nleast restrict it to a 100-year floodplain. That is good. It is an \nimprovement. But the fundamental principle still applies: We are \nrequiring people to purchase insurance they are never going to need \nbecause they are protected by the levees.\n  With that, I know we have some other Members who want to come over \nand speak. I think what I will do right now is yield the floor and \nawait my colleagues to come over.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the bill to reauthorize the National Flood \nInsurance Program may be included in a package we will consider \ntomorrow--the package of bills that might include the Transportation \nbill and the student loan bill as well.\n  The National Flood Insurance Program needs to be addressed, and part \nof the new reauthorization makes significant changes and necessary \nimprovements in the program.\n  I do want to join my colleague Senator Pryor from Arkansas in raising \nconcerns about one particular section in the bill. It creates a burden \nfor many people across the United States--in Illinois, in Arkansas, in \nPennsylvania, in California, and other places. It is called section \n107. It deals with mandatory insurance coverage areas. It redefines \nspecial flood hazard areas.\n  Under section 107(B), everyone in the United States living behind a \nlevee, near a dam or near any other flood control structure--a so-\ncalled residual risk area--will be required to purchase flood \ninsurance--everyone. FEMA estimates that well over 50 percent of \nAmerica's population lives near a levee. Senator Pryor has a very \nrevealing map of the United States. We have a lot of waterways and a \nlot of levees. There are levees in 881 counties throughout the United \nStates. As many as 800,000 people in my State of about 12.5 million \nlive in these areas.\n  Many people living near a levee do not even realize it because the \nlevees work. They have never had a flood. But under this provision, \nthey are still required to buy insurance.\n  The same holds true for people living near dams. There are nearly \n1,400 dams in Illinois alone. Think of how many people live near those \ndams nationwide. Those people would also be required to purchase flood \ninsurance under this provision.\n  Under this section of the bill, the mandatory purchase requirement \nwould apply to people living in residual risk areas regardless of the \nstatus of the flood control structure. That is where I take exception \nto this approach. So even in communities where levees and dams have \nbeen certified safe--in many cases by the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers--the people living behind those levees would have to purchase \nflood insurance.\n  Let me give one specific example that I think is illustrative of the \nunfairness. The people in these so-called residual risk areas already \npay for their flood control structures in one way or another.\n  Take the Metro East area, where I grew up, across the river from St. \nLouis on the Mississippi River--St. Claire, Monroe, and Madison \nCounties. The community agreed in that area to raise taxes on \nthemselves to pay for improvements to the levees. In other words, they \nwere not pointing to Washington, saying: Come in and fix our levees. \nThey said: We will take on the responsibility, and we will pay for it.\n  Thanks to the leadership of the Metro East levee district and people \nsuch as Les Sterman, with the Southwestern Illinois Flood Prevention \nDistrict Council; Alan Dunstan, board chairman of Madison County; Mark \nKern, board chairman of St. Claire County; and, of course, my friend, \nCongressman Jerry Costello in the House of Representatives, Metro East \nraised the money to improve its levees to ensure they would be \nrecertified as safe by FEMA.\n  They are doing the right thing. They are accepting responsibility, \nand they are paying for it. People in communities across the country \nare paying to make sure their levees are sound and they will not have \nto worry about a flood.\n  Yet under this bill's mandatory purchase requirement, as it is \nwritten and as I understand it, they also will be forced to pay for \nflood insurance. If they had done nothing, they would face the flood \ninsurance premium. They did the responsible thing, and they are still \nbeing charged.\n  Not only are they paying higher taxes to strengthen their levees, \nthey will pay for flood insurance for floods that are not likely to \never happen--precisely because of the improvements they are making to \nthose levees which protect them.\n  To add insult to injury, if these areas are mapped into a special \nflood hazard area, the communities will have to pass an ordinance that \nFEMA requires for participation in the flood insurance program. This \nordinance will restrict land use. In many cases, these ordinances \ndiminish property values and reduce the number of jobs in the area.\n  My colleague Senator Cochran of Mississippi worked with Senator \nShelby of Alabama in the Banking Committee to develop a compromise to \nthis section. The compromise is a move in the right direction, I will \nconcede, but it does not go far enough to help the people living near \nflood control structures.\n  The new section 107 strikes the language restricting land use in \nresidual risk areas, but it does not remove the mandatory flood \ninsurance purchase requirement. The new language only delays that \nrequirement until FEMA can develop a new way to measure each levee's \nand dam's strength and efficiency--but then the people who live in \nthese areas will be forced to buy insurance.\n  Adding up to 50 percent of the U.S. population into the National \nFlood Insurance Program, simply because they live near a flood control \nstructure, I think does not take into account the actual reality on the \nground what is being done, what has been done to keep the area safe. I \nsupport my colleague, Senator Pryor of Arkansas. He wanted to strike \nsection 107 to this bill. It is unreasonable to expand flood hazard \nareas to include communities in which people are already paying to \nprevent flooding.\n\n  Chairman Tim Johnson of the Senate Banking Committee and ranking \nRepublican Senator Dick Shelby put together a strong bill with many \nimportant reforms. But the residual risk title is bad for communities \nsuch as Metro East in Illinois, and I hope the committee will either \nmodify or drop this provision.\n  Let me close my remarks by saying that Senator Pryor has been an \nextraordinary leader on this issue. We have talked about it. I have \nbeen happy to join him. I don't know if, when the final bill package \ncomes before us, we will have our chance to vote up or down or offer \nthe Pryor amendment, which I support. But at the end of day, this is \nfundamentally unfair, although it will not take place, if it goes \nunchanged, for several years. In the meantime, if the bill passes with \nthis provision, I can assure my colleagues--and I think Senator Pryor \nwould agree with me--we are not going to quit on this issue. We are \ngoing to demand basic fairness for those people across America who are \nstruggling in this economy and now face the prospect of dramatically \nincreasing flood insurance premiums.\n  I think there is a way to do this that is responsible, that \nrecognizes when people do what is right and families and communities \nstep up to their responsibility, and I do not believe the Shelby-\nCochran amendment does that. I hope we will have a chance to revisit \nthis soon.\n  I thank Senator Pryor for his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. First, let me thank my colleague and friend from Illinois \nfor his comments and his insights. He is fighting hard for his people \nin Illinois. We have similar stories in our State, and my guess is that \nvirtually every\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\nSenator who is a Member of this body has a similar story where the \npeople in these areas with levees are taxing themselves. They are \ntaking on the responsibility to protect their property and their \ncommunities from floods.\n  There is no doubt at all that these folks who live behind levees are \nin a better position than folks who are not behind levees, and the \nFlood Insurance Program should recognize that fact. In listening to \nSenator Durbin a few moments ago, I had a thought, and that is, if we \nare going to do this, if we are going to select the people in these \ndarker areas on this map and we are going to say: Hey, just because you \nlive in an area that has a levee, you are going to have to pay more, is \nnot fair.\n  I would prefer that we just make everybody pay. Why don't we make \nevery mortgage owner in the country pay for this? Why don't we just \nsay: Look, if you have a mortgage, you are going to have to pay $5 a \nmonth, or whatever the number is, just to help subsidize everybody \nelse.\n  That is a fairer way to do it. Why are we singling out people who \nlive behind levees and dams and have other flood-control infrastructure \nthere? It makes no sense. In fact, those people are more protected than \nother people.\n  I know that in the Banking Committee the Presiding Officer had an \namendment he was interested in that dealt with the people who have \nexisting mortgages. In effect, when you sign a mortgage, it is maybe a \n30-year contract, 15-year contract--however long your mortgage is--and \npretty much what you bargain for is what you bargain for. And it \nchanges the equation right now if suddenly, because you live in a \ncertain area, you are going to have to now pay an additional $100, $200 \na month for flood insurance. That totally changes the equation for \npeople. We shouldn't do that.\n  I know the Senator from Oregon offered or talked about an amendment \nin the committee to say that these new laws, these new regs should not \napply to folks with existing mortgages because it is not what they \nbargained for. I think there is value in that. I think we ought to talk \nabout that. But there again, if some of these folks get their way \naround here, we are not going to have a chance to have that discussion \nand offer that amendment.\n  But the Pryor amendment actually covers that situation the Senator \nfrom Oregon has been concerned about because what we do is we say: Do \nthese studies. There are two studies that we include. They are also in \nsection 107 of the bill. Do those two studies. Give this some time. And \nlet's analyze it and look at it and figure out the best way forward. \nBut in the meantime, we are not going to charge people with existing \nmortgages or people who are trying to get mortgages today--we are not \ngoing to charge them unfairly, we are not going to single them out \nmerely because they happen to live in a place that has a levee or a dam \nor some other flood-control structure.\n  I know we have others who are coming over soon to discuss this. I \nyield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to discuss national flood \ninsurance today.\n  Flood insurance is vitally important to our Nation. It is vitally \nimportant to my home State of North Dakota, and I know it is vitally \nimportant to our sister State of Minnesota, which the Presiding Officer \nrepresents.\n  Last year, in 2011, flooding in North Dakota included flooding in the \nRed River Valley, which is the Red River of the north. That included \nboth sides of the border, North Dakota and Minnesota as well.\n  We also had flooding in the James River Valley, in the Cheyenne River \nValley, and in the Missouri River Valley. Also, the Little Missouri \nRiver flooded in the very western part of our State. We had ongoing \nflooding in Devil's Lake, and we had flooding in the Souris River \nValley.\n  In fact, when the Souris River flooded, one of the communities that \nwas flooded was Minot and the surrounding area. Minot is a community of \nabout 40,000 people. It is growing rapidly. I think it is the eighth \nfastest growing community under 50,000 in the country now. So it is a \nrapidly growing, dynamic community of 45,000 people, and last year we \nhad to evacuate 12,000 people from their homes. More than 4,000 homes \nwere destroyed or severely damaged. FEMA, of course, has been in there \nhelping. It is FEMA's third largest housing effort in its history. The \nlargest housing effort was after Hurricane Katrina. The second largest \nhousing effort was after Hurricane Ike. And the third largest housing \neffort for FEMA in history is in response to the flooding in Minot, ND.\n  So in my State we understand flooding, we understand the challenge, \nand we strongly support reauthorizing the national flood insurance \nlegislation. There is no question. However, we need to get it right. We \nneed to get it right, and there are some important policy implications \nin the bill that are being put forward in the package that we likely \nwill be voting on, along with the highway bill, as well as student \nloans.\n  So we are looking at a package that includes reauthorization of \nnational flood insurance, a package that addresses the interest rate on \nstudent loans--something I absolutely believe we need to do--and also a \npackage that includes the highway legislation.\n  But there is policy that is being inserted into the flood insurance \nbill that involves something called residual risk. It is a new policy, \nand we haven't carefully considered it. We haven't voted on it, and we \nneed to. We need to vote on this policy provision.\n  In fact, the flood insurance bill that was passed in the House did \nnot include this residual risk provision. It was not included in the \nHouse package, but now we are looking at a package including all three \nof these large pieces of legislation--the highway bill, student loans, \nand national flood reauthorization--and we have this new residual risk \npolicy in there. That is not the approach we should take, and that is \nwhat I am here to address along with my esteemed colleague Senator \nPryor from Arkansas.\n  I want to thank him for his leadership on this issue. In fact, \nSenator Pryor and myself have an amendment which would specifically \naddress this issue. This issue is in section 107 of the national flood \ninsurance legislation, and that is exactly what we address, and I think \nwe address it the right way. So it is very important that we have an \nopportunity to vote on this important issue.\n  So let me talk about it in just basic, straightforward, commonsense \nterms.\n  The concept is residual risk. What we are saying is we need to have a \nseparate vote on residual risk. That needs to be struck from the flood \ninsurance reauthorization. We can study it and evaluate it. Then once \nwe have had an opportunity to adequately both understand it and debate \nit, we can make a determination about how best to proceed. But it \nshould not be included as part of this comprehensive legislation along \nwith the other legislation in the package.\n  So residual risk. Let's say we have two individual homeowners: one \nwho lives just outside the 100-year flood plain, thanks to natural \ngeography, and a second individual who lives within the flood plain but \nbehind dikes, levees, or other infrastructure that is federally \ncertified and constructed to protect residents against a 100-year flood \nevent. Let me repeat that: That is federally certified by the court and \nconstructed to protect residents against a 100-year flood event.\n  Under the flood insurance legislation as it is currently written, the \nresident behind the certified flood protection will be required by \nFederal law to buy flood insurance. But the one living outside the 100-\nyear flood plain would not, even though they have essentially identical \nrisk. So in short form the individual behind the certified dike or \nlevee is required to buy flood insurance. The other individual, who is \nin essentially the same situation but by natural topography or natural \ngeography rather than certified protection, that individual is not \nrequired to purchase flood insurance. One is protected by the natural \nlandscape, the other is protected by good, solid engineering and an \nunderstanding of the risk involved and what it takes to protect\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\nagainst flooding, but only one of them has to buy flood insurance. That \nis not fair.\n  Homeowners and businesses are already paying for flood protection \nthrough the infrastructure they have elected to build to protect \nthemselves and their property. So they are already paying for it when \nthey build that certified infrastructure. Nobody is more aware of their \nflood risk than individuals in those situations, whether it is their \nhome or their business.\n  Communities that have already invested in flood protection \ninfrastructure now in essence are going to be in a situation where they \nare paying twice for flood protection. Yet the Johnson-Shelby \nsubstitute would force those communities to pay essentially every year \nfor that flood protection. They would first pay for the infrastructure \nthey have already paid for through their local taxes and again, then, \neach year through a government-mandated insurance purchase of flood \ninsurance.\n  Further, Federal, State, and local governments invest billions of \ndollars nationwide in flood protection infrastructure. In my home State \nof North Dakota, communities such as Minot, Fargo, Bismarck, Mandan, \nJamestown, and others are all working with the local, State, and \nFederal Government to build and/or fortify literally hundreds of \nmillions of dollars' worth of flood protection. This substitute \namendment will ignore that. In essence, this is not a good return on \ninvestment for the American taxpayer.\n  The mandatory flood insurance purchase will have a harmful effect \neconomically on communities already contending with flood risk or, \nworse, communities already in a flood recovery mode. A mandate to buy \nflood insurance will discourage businesses from building or rebuilding \nin an area certifiably protected with flood protection. That will \nreduce a community's revenue base and impede new opportunities to \ncreate jobs and economic activity often in a community already \nstruggling to recover its economic base.\n  Additionally, the substitute amendment requires both mandatory \ninsurance purchased for people behind certified flood control \ninfrastructure and, at the same time, a study on the very same policy \nit intends to implement. We shouldn't be enacting a provision into law \nuntil we understand its implications and its consequences.\n  The Pryor-Hoeven amendment allows the study to move forward, but it \nremoves the mandatory insurance purchase requirement. We should \ndetermine more about how it impacts individuals and communities before \nthis new mandate is considered. We have to keep in mind that we are \ntalking about a policy change that affects millions of people across \nthe country.\n  If we look at this chart, all these dark green areas represent \ncounties throughout this country with levees. So we are talking about \nmillions of people who are currently protected with levees. In the case \nthat they have certified levees right now, they are not required to \npurchase flood insurance. But with this vote on the whole package, if \nwe don't address residual risk in the way that I have put forward, that \nchanges. All of them then become subject to purchasing flood insurance.\n  I submit that there are a lot of mayors, city council members, and \ncounty commission members who would like to know if there is going to \nbe a policy change where they are now going to be required to purchase \nflood insurance before that happens. Keep in mind, working with the \nFederal Government at the State and local level, they have built flood \nprotection. That flood protection has been certified. Whether they made \nspecial assessments to do it or whether they have a tax base to do it \nor however they do it, they have gone out and told the people in their \ncommunities: Look, we are going to build this flood protection. You are \ngoing to pay to build that flood protection. And we are going to do \nthat so once constructed, you are, A, protected, and, B, you will not \nhave to buy flood insurance along with your home mortgage.\n  That is what people expected. That is what is in place. My simple \npoint is, before we change that, we better go out and talk to them. We \nbetter go out and tell them. We better go out and say: You know the way \nflood insurance works? It is going to change. When you were told that \nif you built that flood protection, you would not have to buy flood \npolicies, that is now going to change; in fact, you will have to buy a \npolicy under this residual risk, under this new approach.\n  My point is that we have to make sure people understand that, and we \nhave to understand the ramifications and how it is going to work before \nwe make this change. That is why it is so important that we get a \nchance to vote on this amendment and address it. Again, as I have said, \nour amendment makes sure we study the issue. We make sure that FEMA and \nthe Corps are in a position to actually do the analysis and determine \nwhether it works or what the ramifications are, at least, of putting it \ninto place before we put a mandate like that into effect.\n  Again, as we go forward with this package that will include national \nflood insurance, that will include the highway bill, that will include \nreducing the rate on student loans, we have to make sure we have an \nopportunity to address this issue. It is not only basic fairness in \nterms of how the Senate works, but it is also a fundamental issue of \nmaking sure we are letting our constituents know--the mayors out there, \nthe county commissioners, the city commissioners, and the citizens \nthemselves who have counted on flood insurance working a certain way \nand who have built flood protection, certified flood protection, paid \nto build certified flood protection--that there may be a change coming \nand give them a chance to weigh in.\n  We have to make sure what we do is not only something we have \ncommunicated to the citizens we represent but that it is absolutely \nfair, that it makes sense, and that it is consistent, that it treats \nindividual who are in like circumstances, whether it is true natural \ntopography or whether through certified flood protection--if they are \nin a similar or same circumstance, they need to be treated consistently \nin order for the legislation to be fair.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our effort to get a vote on the \nPryor-Hoeven amendment so we can properly address this issue.\n  I yield the floor. I note that my colleague from the great State of \nPennsylvania, Senator Toomey, is here. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise to address the same topic that \nhas been under discussion this afternoon by Senator Pryor, Senator \nHoeven, and others. I strongly share the concern they have registered. \nI believe we have seriously flawed legislation in the form of this \nflood insurance reauthorization bill, and I think we are kind of \ncompounding our problem by apparently inserting this into a \ntransportation conference report rather than doing what we ought to do \nin the Senate, which is to have a debate about flood insurance.\n  This easily qualifies as a sufficiently important and substantive \ntopic that we ought to bring it to the floor under regular order and \nconsider the underlying policy, including the profound change in policy \nthat is contemplated by the underlying bill and a very important \namendment on which Senators Pryor and Hoeven have provided the \nleadership and of which I am a cosponsor, which I think absolutely \ndeserves a vigorous debate and I would like to see passed.\n  One of the many concerns I have about what we are doing now is we are \ntaking this flood insurance bill and apparently some are considering \nthis bill to be at least a partial offset to some of the expenditures \ncontemplated in the Transportation bill. For the life of me, I can't \nunderstand how this could possibly be a legitimate offset for spending. \nIf it is a legitimate offset for spending, then that means it is net \nnew revenue. But we are told this bill is supposed to be actuarially \nsound. It is supposed to be revenue neutral. The premiums being charged \nfor this flood insurance are supposed to just equal out the payments \nthat will have to be made in honoring claims against this fund. So I \ndon't understand how that nets out to a source of net revenue that can \nbe spent somewhere else. How many times can we spend the same money? \nThe insurance premiums that are collected are supposed to be collected \nto honor the liabilities the Federal Government is taking on by virtue\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\nof this program, so how can it also go to pay for transportation \nprojects? I don't understand that.\n  I also think there is a real fundamental problem that Senators Pryor \nand Hoeven have addressed, and that is the huge expansion of this \nmandate. We have in this underlying bill a Federal mandate that forces \npeople to buy homeowner's insurance, and it forces a new category of \npeople to buy homeowner's flood insurance, and the new category is \nthose people who live behind a levee or a dam.\n  A lot of folks have contributed a lot of money over many years to \nbuilding levees and dams precisely so that they would be protected from \nthe risk of floods. In fact, that works every day all across America. \nYet we are going to ask those people to also pay as though there were \nno levee there. This strikes me as a profoundly flawed approach. It \ncompletely ignores the investments these communities have made for \nyears, and in the process it discourages future flood-mitigation \nmeasures. It discourages the maintenance of existing levees and dams. \nIt discourages the building of additional ones. I think this is a bad \nidea. It is bad to create these kinds of incentives.\n  I will say candidly that this disproportionately has an adverse \neffect on States that have over the years a long history of building \nlevees and dams. Pennsylvania would certainly be among those States. If \nyou look at this map, it shows the counties in which there are levees \nand dams, and almost the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is shaded \nin because we have levees and dams all across the Commonwealth. They \nwork and they hold and people have invested to have that security, that \nprotection.\n  Frankly, there are a lot of communities that would like to have \nadditional levees and dams to have more protection than they have \ntoday. What this measure would do is it would say: Don't do that. What \ngood does it do? You are still going to have to pay for flood \ninsurance. I think this is a badly flawed approach.\n  Let me say once again that there is something very wrong with this \nprocess. This is a big deal. To ask 1 million to 2 million additional \nnew Pennsylvanians--not to ask, to force them into a program where they \nwould be forced to buy an insurance product whether they want it or \nnot--by the way, nothing stops them from voluntarily choosing to \npurchase flood insurance, but that is not what this bill is about; the \nbill is about forcing them to buy this product. To think we are going \nto create this huge new mandate on what could be 2 million \nPennsylvanians alone and many more millions across the country, to do \nit without a full debate on the Senate floor, without the opportunity \nto consider this legislation, without the opportunity to consider and \ndebate and vote on amendments, I think is a big mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at this map and to consider \nstrongly insisting that the transportation conference report not \ninclude this legislation and that we proceed under regular order to \ndebate a very important measure, which would be the reauthorization of \nthe Flood Insurance Program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, let me thank all my colleagues who have \ncome here today to talk about this issue. It turns out we have had two \nDemocrats and two Republicans. We may have more on the way. I know of \nat least one or two others who may be on the way.\n  I would like to say thank you to them for their assistance here, but \nalso, more importantly, I thank them for doing a great job representing \ntheir States well. When you look at their States and the number of \nlevees they have in their States, the number of people who will be \nadversely impacted by this, this is a very significant piece of \nlegislation. It deserves debate.\n  I do not like the fact that somewhere in this building, behind closed \ndoors, people are trying to negotiate this legislation into a larger \npackage. We should let the Senate be the Senate. We should bring the \nNational Flood Insurance Program bill to the floor by regular order, we \nshould debate it, we should offer amendments, and we should vote on \nthose amendments and vote on final passage. We should not have any \nfunny business. This is an important piece of legislation, but right \nnow the funny business with this legislation is not the fact that there \nmay be an extraneous amendment or two that are totally unrelated to the \nsubject matter; the funny business right now is that they are trying to \njam this down the throats of other Senators, especially when they know \nthat there is an amendment that is relevant, that is germane, that is \nin order, and that amendment would probably get well over 50 votes. \nThey are thwarting the will of the Senate if they include this in the \nlegislation.\n  I implore my colleagues who are involved in this conference effort to \ntry to bring the surface transportation bill, which I support, and try \nto bring the student loan bill, which I support--try to bring those \nbills to the floor. I implore them to not include the offending \nlanguage of section 107. If they do, I want to state my intention to \nobject to that language when it comes here to the Senate. That is not a \nvery pleasant prospect because that means the House may have to stay \nlonger, and the Senate may have to stay longer. This is completely \navoidable.\n  I think if we have a mechanism in place where we can either take this \nlegislation, the flood insurance legislation, up tomorrow and dispense \nwith it--and pass it, I hope; amend it and pass it, I hope--and/or if \nwe could file cloture if there are problems with extraneous \namendments--we could file cloture more or less, say, tomorrow, and then \nafter the Fourth of July recess where we will be back home in our home \nStates, we could take it up the first day or two when we get back.\n  There are ways to do this. We have to remember that this \nlegislation--excuse me--this law does not expire until the end of July. \nWe have 2 or 3 extra weeks here. It is not going to expire this \nweekend. We have another month that we can do this, and sometimes \nthings in the Congress take time, we understand that. I would rather do \nit sooner rather than later. I would rather get it all done tomorrow. \nBut I do not want this included in some larger package where we do not \nhave a chance to offer the Pryor-Hoeven amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I would like to join with Senator Pryor \nin this objection. He clearly laid out a path to resolve the situation, \nand that is to have a vote on the amendment we put forward. There are \nother ways to resolve it as well. We have made that very clear.\n  Look, this is a clear case where, in order to make a policy change of \nthat magnitude, it needs to be properly discussed, properly debated, \nand certainly voted on.\n  This is a situation where we clearly laid out any number of ways to \nresolve the issue, but this legislation, section 107 that Senator Pryor \nreferred to, should not be included in this legislation. If it is, then \nI will seek to join Senator Pryor in his objection.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, politicians are used to waiting in nervous \nanticipation for certain events; specifically, their own elections and \nthe elections of their friends. But it is an interesting feeling in \nthis town today--in Washington, DC--awaiting the nervous anticipation \nof the Supreme Court decision tomorrow. It is a decision which will \naddress the affordable care act. And this affordable health care act \nmay be one of the most significant measures I have ever been asked to \nvote on as a Member of Congress.\n  Tomorrow the U.S. Supreme Court will hand down its decision on the \naffordable care act. It could be one of the most consequential \ndecisions handed down by the Court in my tenure in Congress, and maybe \neven longer. It is consequential not just because of the politics of \nWashington. No, the decision will have consequences which will affect \nthe lives of millions of Americans across the country.\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\n  First, some basic facts. According to the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office, the affordable care act will reduce the deficit over the \nnext 10 years by over $200 billion; then, another $1 trillion in the \nsecond decade. This is an important measure to reduce health care \ncosts, reduce government outlays, and reduce the deficit. So the \ndecision of the Court will have an impact on that particular element.\n  The law does a number of specific things to reduce health care costs \nwhile saving lives. Because of the affordable care act, preventive \nservices for many Americans are now free. In my home State of Illinois, \nlast year 1.3 million people on Medicare--that is about 10 percent of \nour population--and 2.4 million people with private health insurance \nreceived preventive care at no cost. This is important, because \npreventive services such as mammograms and cholesterol screenings can \nhelp lower costs, prevent illness, and save lives. On the subject of \nprevention, the law provides help for States with their prevention \nprograms--programs, for example, that try to discourage kids from \nsmoking; programs that detect and treat diabetes at an early stage; \nheart disease, arthritis, and so many other areas that can be treated \nsuccessfully if there are preventive efforts.\n  Another reason this law is important is because of lifetime limits. \nBefore this law was enacted, insurance companies routinely told \nfamilies: Sorry, you hit your limit. We are not going to pay for any \nmore of your chemotherapy or your premature baby's illness. People did \nnot know there was a limit until it was too late. The law changed that.\n\n  Because of this law, 4.6 million people in my State, Illinois--4.6 \nmillion--got the care they needed last year without having to worry \nabout the insurance companies cutting them off, saying they reached \ntheir limit.\n  In these tough economic times many young adults are having trouble \nfinding work. Another thing this bill did was to extend the coverage of \nfamily health insurance to cover those through the age of 25. Because \nof the affordable care act, parents can keep their kids under their \npolicy until the young people reach the age of 26. Across the country \n2.5 million young adults, including 102,000 in my State of Illinois, \nhave been able to stay on their parents' insurance plan.\n  The law also requires companies to spend more of their money on \nactual health care. One might think that is obvious, but it turns out \nit is not. The law says insurance companies have to spend at least 85 \npercent of their premiums on health care rather than spend it on \nadvertising, overhead, or executive compensation.\n  Mr. President, $61 million has been returned in my State to over \n300,000 people in the form of rebates because of this ``medical loss \nratio''--85 percent to be spent on health care. That is money that \nflows back to families and individuals and businesses.\n  The affordable care act has had a profound impact on seniors and \nthose living with disabilities. Because of this law, seniors and those \nliving with disabilities on the Medicare Program in Illinois have saved \nmore than $155 million on prescription drugs. Seniors taking their \nmedicine as they are supposed to are likely to stay healthy longer and \nbe less of a cost to the system and lead more independent and stronger \nlives.\n  We have talked and talked in this Senate about how we need to help \nseniors afford to buy prescription drugs. We know this bill that will \nbe decided by the Supreme Court tomorrow has been closing the doughnut \nhole that was created by Medicare Part D. When we passed the affordable \ncare act, we did something about it.\n  Illinois seniors saved $155 million because the affordable care act \nwas signed into law. By 2020--if the Supreme Court does not strike this \nlaw or this provision--the doughnut hole will be fully closed and \nseniors will not have to worry anymore about that gap in coverage that \neats into their savings.\n  I have been working for years to help small businesses find ways to \nafford health care for their employees. I introduced a bill in 2009 \nwith the help of the small business community and the insurance \nindustry that would allow small businesses to work together in a health \ncare exchange. The affordable care act built on that principle and \nimproved it dramatically.\n  The new health care law provides a tax break for small businesses \nthat are doing the right thing and buying health insurance for their \nemployees. So far, across the country, more than 228,000 businesses \nhave taken advantage of this new tax credit and saved $278 million.\n  For those who say the affordable care act really has not helped small \nbusiness, here is proof otherwise.\n  Another 30 million people who have no health care coverage today will \nbe covered when the affordable care act is implemented. By 2019, 15 \nmillion of those will be able to participate in Medicaid, and the \nStates will not be left on the hook. The affordable care act provides \nhelp to the States for the first several years.\n  The affordable care act provides much needed assistance to community \nhealth centers--centers such as the Erie Family Health Center in \nChicago. In fact, because of a $650,000 grant from the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, Erie is going to open a new health center in \nEvanston--one that is desperately needed.\n  So these are but a few of the reasons the Supreme Court, I hope, will \nuphold this law to continue to help move us toward a day when the rate \nof growth in the cost of health care is brought under control. We have \na long way to go, but this bill is a step forward. For those who have \ncampaigned from one side of America to the other, saying they would \neliminate the affordable care act, which they derisively call \nObamaCare, let me tell them: There are real people in Illinois and \nacross the Nation who have benefited from this act and will in the \nfuture.\n  Now is the time for us to work together to improve the act where it \nneeds improvement but to use it as the basis for building a future of \nsecurity and quality health care for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/27/senate-section/article/S4668-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, it is my privilege to honor the \nMontford Point Marines, who today will be collectively decorated with \nthe Congressional Gold Medal.\n  The Montford Point Marines served our country bravely during World \nWar II, despite being segregated from their fellow servicemembers. In \n1942, President Roosevelt directed that African Americans be recruited \ninto the Marine Corps. These men were not sent to the traditional \nMarine recruit depots of Parris Island or San Diego. Instead, they were \nsegregated and trained at Montford Point in Camp Lejeune, NC. \nCollectively, these Marines--who became known as the ``Montford Point \nMarines''--served in the Pacific Theater as part of the 51st and 52nd \nMarine Defense Battalions, and with various Depot and Ammunition \nCompanies.\n  The Defense Battalions saw action against surviving Japanese troops \non the captured island of Guam, while the Depot and Ammunition \nCompanies participated in the fighting at Saipan, Tinian, Guam, \nPeleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Their jobs consisted of loading and \nunloading supplies, resupplying frontline units, and evacuating the \ndead and wounded--sometimes under heavy enemy fire. All together, the \nDepot and Ammunition Companies suffered seven killed and 78 wounded. Of \nthe nearly 20,000 African-American Marines in World War II, about \n13,000 served overseas. In July 1948, President Harry S. Truman issued \nhis executive order ending military segregation. In September 1949, \nMontford Marine Camp was deactivated, ending 7 years of segregation.\n  The commitment and sacrifice of African-American servicemembers \nduring World War II is embodied in the lives of two cousins, Howard and \nKenneth Tibbs. Howard served this Nation as one of the Tuskegee Airmen. \nI had the privilege of honoring him in 2007 when the Congressional Gold \nMedal was awarded to the Tuskegee Airmen. Today, I am able to honor his \ncousin, Kenneth Tibbs, who served as a Montford Point Marine. Kenneth \nwas born on May 30, 1925, in Lancaster, OH, and served from 1943 to \n1944 as part of the 20th Marine Depot Company. Ultimately, PFC Kenneth \nTibbs was killed in action during the invasion of Saipan. He was his \nunit's only fatality.\n  Private Tibbs and all of the Montford Point Marines exemplified the \nqualities for which the Montford Point Marines are so admired. Our \nNation is indebted to him and his fellow Marines for their sacrifice. \nNot only did they contribute to the America's victory in the Pacific, \nbut they did so within a highly segregated military. Many went on to \nserve in Korea and Vietnam, alongside their white counterparts. \nMontford Point Marine Edgar Huff became the first African-American in \nthe United States Marine Corps to be promoted to the rank of Sergeant \nMajor. His brother-in-law, Gilbert ``Hashmark'' Johnson, also served at \nMontford Point and earned the rank of Sergeant Major. Today, Montford \nPoint's Camp Johnson at Camp Lejeune is named after him. I am proud to \nhave been an original cosponsor of the 2006 House Resolution 80 to \nhonor these Marines, and it is my privilege to recount their legacy \ntoday in the United States Senate.\n  I proudly celebrate the life and sacrifice of PFC Kenneth J. Tibbs, \nand all Montford Point Marines, on the occasion of this award of the \nCongressional Gold Medal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/27/senate-section/article/S4669-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MORRILL ACT 150TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this year marks the 150 anniversary of the \nMorrill Act of 1862, which led to the creation of our Nation's land-\ngrant universities. In 1862, there were only six engineering or \nagricultural colleges in the entire United States. By 1880, there were \n85, and by 1917 the total number had grown to 126. Two outstanding \nuniversities from Virginia are the beneficiaries of this legislation \nand carry on important traditions as land-grant universities: Virginia \nTech and Virginia State University.\n  Founded in 1872 as an agricultural and mechanical land-grant college, \nVirginia Tech is the oldest land-grant college in the Commonwealth. \nToday, the school has the largest full-time student population in \nVirginia and the largest number of degree offerings of any Virginia \nuniversity. As a leading research institution, Virginia Tech prepares \nits students to make an impact in the fields of technology and \nagriculture, among many others. Virginia Tech graduates have a positive \nimpact everyday on the Commonwealth and on our country.\n  Virginia State University, founded in 1882, is the country's first \nfully State-supported 4-year historically black college and also a \nVirginia land-grant institution. Throughout the school's history, it \nhas enriched the lives of its students and faculty as well as its \nsurrounding community and indeed the entire Commonwealth. Virginia \nState University's leadership in providing an expansive academic \nprogram, a variety of student organizations, and a devotion to \ncommunity service makes the school a model for historically black \ncolleges across the nation.\n  Both of these superb academic institutions demonstrate exceptional \nleadership in the agricultural and mechanical arts in line with the \noriginal intent of the Morrill Act. As we remember the creation of this \nlandmark legislation, Virginia Tech and Virginia State University stand \nas shining examples of its continued legacy. I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues in celebrating the sesquicentennial of the Morrill Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/27/senate-section/article/S4669-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO POET LAUREATE NATASHA TRETHEWEY\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \naccomplishments of an extraordinary Mississippian. Natasha Trethewey, a \nnative of Gulfport, Mississippi, has been named the United States Poet \nLaureate. I join my fellow Mississippians and fellow Americans in \ncelebrating Ms. Trethewey, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, for receiving \nour country's highest distinction in the field of poetry.\n  This honor is the first of its kind for my State, but literary \nexcellence is not new to Mississippi. Our great State has a rich \nliterary history because of Mississippians like William Faulkner, \nEudora Welty, and Tennessee Williams, who have paved the way for Ms. \nTrethewey's success in literature.\n  At the young age of 46, Ms. Trethewey has proven herself to be a \ntalented and accomplished American writer. A prolific artist, she \nexplored the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in her nonfiction work, \n``Beyond Katrina: A Meditation on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.''\n  Our incoming Poet Laureate has captured the hearts and minds of her \ncolleagues and peers, earning her a fan base across our State and \nNation. Librarian of Congress James Billington is among those \ncaptivated by Ms. Trethewey's brilliance. In 2004, at the National Book \nFestival, Dr. Billington described Ms. Tretheway as an American who is \n``absolutely unique.'' Today, I am proud to repeat Dr. Billington's \npraise for this gifted Mississippian.\n  Natasha Trethewey is not only a leader in her field but also a \nteacher for this Nation's future leaders. She is a professor and \nPhillis Wheatley Distinguished Chair in Poetry at Emory University and \nis the Louis D. Rubin Writer-in-Residence for 2012 at Hollins \nUniversity. She received her Pulitzer Prize in Poetry in 2007 for her \n2006 work, Native Guard. In the past year, Ms. Trethewey was named the \nPoet Laureate of Mississippi, an esteemed position my State is proud \nfor her to hold.\n  Mr. President, I have the highest admiration for this accomplished \npoet, author, and Mississippian. I know that my fellow Mississippians \nshare this pride in Ms. Trethewey's work and national recognition. I am \nhonored to congratulate Natasha Trethewey on her appointment as the \n2012 United States Poet Laureate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/27/senate-section/article/S4669-4", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4669-S4670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO L.L.BEAN\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nmen and\n\n[[Page S4670]]\n\nwomen of L.L.Bean as they celebrate their 100th anniversary. This \nlegendary Maine company is one of America's most inspiring family \nbusiness success stories and one of my State's most cherished \ninstitutions.\n  Many L.L.Bean customers know the story of the company's origin. Leon \nLeonwood Bean was an avid Maine outdoorsman who was tired of cold, wet \nfeet while hunting or fishing. In 1912, he invented the Maine Hunting \nShoe, a boot with leather uppers and a thick rubber sole. His fellow \noutdoorsmen liked the boot and a business was born.\n  The second, less-known part of the story really tells the tale. The \nrubber bottoms of those shoes separated from the leather tops and 90 of \nthe first 100 pairs were returned. Although it nearly put him out of \nbusiness, L.L. kept his word and refunded the purchase price. He \nborrowed more money, corrected the problem and, with undiminished \nconfidence, mailed more brochures. L.L. had learned the value of \npersonally testing his products, of honest advertising based on firm \nconvictions and of keeping the customer satisfied at any cost.\n  Leon Leonwood Bean founded his business on his personal guarantee of \n``100 percent satisfaction in every way.'' In all the years since, that \npromise has been kept. Whether seeking expert advice, making a \npurchase, or exchanging or returning a product, generations of \ncustomers have found L.L.Bean to be a place where that first commitment \nto customer satisfaction still resonates.\n  Today, L.L.Bean is one of the world's most respected retailers, with \nsales exceeding $1.5 billion. From the flagship store in Freeport, ME, \nto dozens of stores and outlets throughout the United States, more than \n11 million people visit L.L.Bean stores each year. The company's famous \ncatalogues are sent to 160 countries, and its Internet presence leads \nthe industry. In its first century, the company has grown from a one-\nroom operation selling a single product to a global enterprise \nproviding some 4,900 year-round jobs, and that figure typically doubles \nduring peak holiday season.\n  In addition to its remarkable retail success, L.L.Bean remains true \nto its origins as a manufacturer. In Brunswick and Lewiston, ME, more \nthan 435 skilled workers craft such iconic products as the Maine \nHunting Shoe, the L.L.Bean Boot and the Boat and Tote Bag. Leon \nLeonwood Bean made 100 pairs of boots in his first production run in \n1912. Last year, Maine workers produced more than 400,000 pairs.\n  When the man TIME magazine called ``The Merchant of the Maine Woods'' \npassed away in 1967, leadership of the company was passed on to his \ngrandson, Leon Gorman.\n  Soon after becoming president, Leon introduced the stakeholder \nconcept, which clearly linked L.L.Bean's success as a business to key \nstakeholders--customers, employees, shareholders, vendors, communities \nand the natural environment. In his 30 years as president, Leon Gorman \nled L.L.Bean from a $4.75 million catalog company to an over-one-\nbillion-dollar multichannel enterprise. Leon firmly established \nL.L.Bean as a leader in the outdoors industry, offering high-quality \nequipment and apparel, backed by world-class service and products \nguaranteed to last.\n  It is fitting that L.L.Bean is celebrating its centennial with \nspecial projects that advance the company's guiding principles. These \ninclude the Million Moment Mission, in which L.L.Bean will contribute \n$1 to the National Park Foundation for every outdoor moment shared by \ncustomers up to a total of $1 million, and a commitment of an \nadditional $1.5 million at the local and State levels to encourage our \nyoung people to discover the outdoors.\n  I am often asked what L.L.Bean means to our State. As one of Maine's \nlargest employers, the company certainly means a great deal to the \nthousands who work there. L.L.Bean offers careers with opportunities \nfor advancement in a respectful, positive environment. The spin-off \nbenefits to other Maine industries, including product vendors and \nbusiness suppliers, are enormous. The continued commitment to Maine-\nmade products--wreaths, maple syrup, mustard, furniture, running shoes, \nslippers, in addition to the company's famous tote bags and boots--\nsustains a great many businesses and households throughout our State.\n  Certainly, the sales, revenue, and growth numbers are impressive. \nEven more impressive is the fact that this family company succeeds in a \nmodern, global economy with the timeless values that foster dedicated \nemployees and loyal customers. It is a pleasure to congratulate the \npeople of L.L.Bean on this centennial and to thank them for their \ncontributions to our Nation and to the great State of Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/27/senate-section/article/S4670-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ALEXANDER PAGOULATOS\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize \nAlexander Pagoulatos, an impressive young New Jerseyan who recently \ngraduated West Point as the class of 2012's valedictorian. Hailing from \nBasking Ridge, NJ and a 2008 graduate of Ridge High School, Alex has \nstrong roots in the Garden State. As a young man, he was well known for \nexcelling on Ridge High's Varsity fencing team, as well as his \ndedicated service to his church and greater community. And when Alex \napplied through my office for a nomination to the United States \nMilitary Academy at West Point during his senior year, his outstanding \nrecord and bright future made it an easy choice.\n  At West Point, Alex continued to make us proud. As an economics \nmajor, he achieved the highest grade point average possible, the result \nof earning numerous A-pluses. This accomplishment is all the more \nimpressive when one considers that he also minored in environmental \nengineering. For his success both in and out of the classroom, Alex \nearned awards of all kinds. This May, Alex graduated at the top of his \nclass academically, physically, and overall, receiving his diploma as \nthe class of 2012's valedictorian.\n  Alex's service to his Nation didn't end that Saturday at Michie \nStadium. Upon graduation, Alex received his commission as a 2nd \nLieutenant in the United States Army. Following his training at Fort \nBenning, he will deploy to Vicenza, Italy as a member of the 173rd \nAirborne Brigade Combat Team.\n  As a former soldier and a veteran of World War II, I commend Alex for \nhis service to our Nation and recognize the sacrifices he is making in \nthe name of that service. He has made my State of New Jersey extremely \nproud and I know he will continue his commitment to excellence in the \nArmy. We all owe Alex an incredible debt of gratitude and I know that \nthe people of New Jersey, and indeed Americans across our country are \nthankful for his dedicated service to our country and look forward to \nhis future achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/27/senate-section/article/S4670-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4670-S4671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING MAINE DAYBOAT SCALLOPS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, throughout the 112th Congress, I \nhave consistently implored my colleagues to remember the value of our \nNation's small businesses. These firms are uniquely equipped to devise \nand implement innovative business plans and strategies that are needed \nto strengthen challenged industries, and do so regularly. Nowhere is \nthis more prevalent than in my home state of Maine. Today I rise to \nrecognize and commend a newly founded small business, Maine Dayboat \nScallops located in Bath, ME, and its owner Togue Brawn.\n  Ms. Brawn has more than two decades of rich and varied experience \nworking in Maine's fishing and service sectors. She has, among other \nthings, sold Bait Cups invented by her father; worked at Portland's \nHarbor fish market; sold space at domestic and international commercial \nfishing trade shows; served at the Portland Old Port's Fore Street and \nJ's Oyster restaurants; worked on a number of fisheries research \nprojects; served at the Maine Department of Marine Resources; and \nfounded her own business.\n  During her tenure with the Department of Marine Resources, Ms. Brawn \ntook a special interest in working to address the serious challenges \nfacing Maine's scallop fisheries, which had become significantly \ndepleted. By virtue of her knowledge, experience, and close ties with \nthose involved in the industry, Ms. Brawn was keenly aware of the \nnature of the challenge facing the State: in order to advance the long-\n\n[[Page S4671]]\n\nterm health of the industry, scallop fishing had to be further \ncurtailed, but doing so would impose significant additional burdens on \nhardworking Maine fishermen. Like many entrepreneurs, Ms. Brawn \ndeveloped a creative plan to help address a serious problem, and acted \nupon it.\n  In order to help smaller scale scallop fishermen support themselves \nand their families as industry output declined, she founded a company \nto sell their scallops at more lucrative prices by leveraging the \nunique quality of their freshly caught product. Many dining \nestablishments purchase scallops harvested by large vessels that spend \nsignificant periods of time at sea before returning to port. These \nscallops are certainly of high quality, but they are not as fresh as \nthose harvested by smaller boats that return to port daily. By \nmarketing the scallops caught by fishermen who conduct day-long trips, \nand delivering them within 24 hours of their being harvested, Maine \nDayboat Scallops has succeeded in providing local establishments with a \nfresher product, and increasing the profit margins of the fishermen \nwith whom it does business.\n  Maine Dayboat Scallops and Ms. Brawn exemplify the unique effects \nthat small businesses have on Maine's economy. At a time when our \nNation faces significant economic challenges, it is inspiring to know \nthat entrepreneurs such as Ms. Brawn continue to draw upon their \nexperience, ingenuity, and energy to develop new businesses that \noperate to increase the profitability of some of our most crucial and \nchallenged industries. I applaud Ms. Brawn and offer Maine Dayboat \nScallops my best regards for their future success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/27/senate-section/article/S4671-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PIERPONT, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Pierpont, SD. The \ntown of Pierpont will commemorate the 125th anniversary of its founding \nthis year.\n  The town was founded in 1887 when the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. \nPaul Railroad Company was persuaded by area farmers to build a side \ntrack to what is now Pierpont. Though much has changed since 1887, \nPierpont still relies heavily on agriculture, and area farmers remain a \ndriving force in the community and economy.\n  Located in Day County, Pierpont has a very proud history and \nheritage. However, Pierpont residents are also always looking forward \nand trying to better their community for future generations. They have \na reputation for organizing new events to draw visitors to the Pierpont \narea. This creative and hard-working spirit is certainly something that \nshould make the entire town proud.\n  The citizens of Pierpont are also incredibly dedicated and devoted to \ntheir families, friends, neighbors, and anyone just passing through. \nThey are always ready to lend a hand, a welcome smile, and help out \nwhenever a need arises. This spirit of stewardship makes it easy to see \nwhy so many will be attending Pierpont's 125th anniversary celebration \nthis July.\n  Pierpont has been a tight-knit community for the past 125 years, and \nI am confident that it will continue to serve as an example of South \nDakota values and traditions. I would like to offer my congratulations \nto the citizens of Pierpont on this landmark occasion and wish them \ncontinued prosperity in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/27/senate-section/article/S4671-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  75TH ANNIVERSARY OF REPTILE GARDENS\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Reptile Gardens in \nRapid City, SD and congratulate the men and women who have educated the \npublic about wildlife in the State for 75 years with the world's \nlargest reptile zoo. Reptile Gardens was founded in 1937 by Earl \nBrockelsby, a man renowned for his love and passion for reptiles.\n  Since its inception, Reptile Gardens has drawn tourists from across \nthe Midwest and the Nation and entertained many with alligator \nwrestling, exotic bird shows, and snake shows. Reptile Gardens houses \nmany rare species of reptiles and amphibians. Through 75 years of \nbusiness, Reptile Gardens has seen its Sky Dome set on fire, a flood in \n1977 and dwindling numbers due to World War II, and has overcome these \nobstacles through the strength and determination of its employees.\n  I would like to commend the men and women at Reptile Gardens for \nproviding the State with 75 years of education and \nentertainment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/27/senate-section/article/S4671-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING MICHAEL P. JOLIN\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, earlier this month the Rhode \nIsland Bar Association honored CPT Michael P. Jolin, Esq., with its \nVictoria M. Almeida Servant Leader Award. I am proud to join in \ncongratulating Mike for this well-deserved distinction.\n  Mike Jolin has served his country and the people of Rhode Island with \ncompetence, courage, and compassion throughout his career. When I was \nRhode Island attorney general, I appointed Mike as special assistant \nattorney general. He went on to serve as the deputy chief of Legal \nServices for the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation. In \nboth roles he performed admirably, upholding the laws of our State and \nprotecting our citizens.\n  Meanwhile, Mike worked with neighbors and local officials in \nPawtucket to maintain standards in the city's rental properties and \nprotect tenants' rights as chair of the Pawtucket Nuisance Task Force, \nand to promote broadly shared economic empowerment for the residents of \nthe Woodlawn neighborhood as a member of the board of the Woodlawn \nCommunity Development Corporation. He also served ably on the board of \nCity Arts, helping to bring art education to the children of \nProvidence.\n  In the U.S. Army Reserve and Rhode Island National Guard, Mike served \nas a judge advocate, performing critical legal, administrative, \nethical, and regulatory operations and analysis. He was responsible for \nthe creation of the Rhode Island National Guard's first full-time legal \nassistance program as well as the Rhode Island Bar Association's U.S. \nArmed Forces Legal Project. These two programs have provided high-\nquality and often free legal services to hundreds of Rhode Island \nservice men and women, veterans and their families.\n  Even after deploying to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring \nFreedom with Combined Joint Interagency Task Force 435, Mike remained \nclosely involved with the Armed Forces Legal Project, working from \nabroad to help address the unmet legal needs of Rhode Island's military \nwomen and men.\n  Now back on American soil, Mike continues to serve Rhode Island, \nconducting outreach to the veteran and military communities in my Rhode \nIsland office and helping constituents connect with resources of the \nfederal government.\n  The creed of one of our Armed Forces' special operations units says, \n``I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my \nactions.'' Mike's work exemplifies this spirit, demonstrating the \nunderstanding that mission success absolutely depends on the individual \nsuccesses of those around him.\n  On behalf of all the staff in my Providence and Washington offices, I \ncommend CPT Michael P. Jolin, Esq.--in the words of the Victoria M. \nAlmeida Servant Leader Award citation--for his clear demonstration of \n``the principles and values of servant leadership'' and for being ``a \nbeacon of light and hope to others by illuminating the path to greater \njustice for all.'' We are lucky to have him as part of our team--as are \nthe people of Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/27/senate-section/article/S4671-4", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/27/senate-section/article/S4671-5", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/27/senate-section/article/S4671-6", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4671-S4672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\nMrs. Cole, one of its clerks, announced that the House agrees to the \namendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2297) to promote the \ndevelopment of the Southwest waterfront in the District of Columbia, \nand for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 4223.

A bill to increase immunization rates; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nDurbin, Tim Johnson, Whitehouse, and Blumenthal in the introduction of \nthe Immunization Improvements Act. This legislation builds on my \nlongstanding work, including several provisions I authored in the \nAffordable Care Act, to improve vaccination rates and population-based \nimmunity.\n  Our introduction of this legislation is particularly timely given a \nrecent report cited in yesterday's Wall Street Journal revealing the \nnumber of deaths globally as a result of the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009 \nand 2010. The analysis found that the number of deaths from H1N1 to be \n15 times the original reports, up from 18,500 to 280,000 cases. In the \nUnited States, the estimates are more than triple the original cases, \nfrom 8,500 to nearly 30,000.\n  Two provisions of the legislation we are introducing today are based \non efforts underway in Rhode Island to improve vaccination rates \nagainst seasonal influenza and pneumonia. Specifically, it would \nauthorize a five-state demonstration project that allows the state to \npurchase certain vaccines and distribute them free of charge to \nphysicians for administration in seniors, who are at the highest risk \nof death from these preventable diseases. In addition to increasing \nvaccination rates, this model has limited the cost and administrative \nburden for providers and reduced the cost of vaccines to the Federal \ngovernment.\n  The legislation would also require hospitals and long-term care \nfacilities to report on influenza vaccination rates of health care \nworkers with direct patient contact, the population most likely to \nspread the flu to ill patients that may be too weak to fight it. In \nRhode Island, simply requiring health care facilities to report on \nhealth care worker influenza vaccinations has resulted in improved \nrates.\n  The Immunization Improvements Act would also update the allowable \nvaccine administration fees to providers\n\n[[Page S4676]]\n\nwho vaccinate uninsured and underinsured children, as well as include a \nrecommendation made by both the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \nand the Government Accountability Office to shift vaccine coverage in \nMedicare from Part D to Part B.\n  While there are many diseases and conditions that we have yet to \nprevent, there are those for which we already have vaccines. We must do \nmore to ensure that these vaccines are available and accessed to \nprotect the health of Americans.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by Every Child By Two, the \nImmunization Action Coalition, Partnership for Prevention, the \nAssociation of State and Territorial Health Officials, the National \nAssociation of County and City Health Officials, and Trust for \nAmerica's Health. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see \nthese provisions enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 3345. A bill to provide for research and education to improve \nscreening, detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Prostate \nCancer Detection Research and Education Act. This important legislation \naddresses the urgent need for the development of new technologies to \ndetect and diagnose prostate cancer, and for the education of our \nfathers, brothers, and sons about the dangers of this deadly disease.\n  Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, and is the \nsecond leading cause of cancer related deaths in men, with 240,000 new \ncases and 28,000 prostate cancer related deaths predicted in 2012.\n  Unfortunately, current screening techniques for prostate cancer \nresult in some false-negative reassurances and false-positive alarms. \nIn addition, the prostate is one of the last organs in a human body \nwhere biopsies are performed blindly, which can miss cancer even when \nmultiple samples are taken.\n  Prostate Cancer Detection Research and Education Act brings together \na Advisory Council of experts to evaluate the current science and \noutline a path forward to the ultimate goal--developing a reliable test \nor tests that can detect prostate cancer and diagnose how severe the \ncancer is.\n  The Prostate Cancer Detection Research and Education Act will mirror \nthe investment the Federal government made in advanced imaging \ntechnologies, which led to life-saving breakthroughs in detection, \ndiagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. This bill directs the \nSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, to use \nthe plan developed by the Advisory Council to coordinate and intensify \nfederal research to develop and validate an accurate test for prostate \ncancer.\n  The Prostate Cancer Detection Research and Education Act would also \ncreate a national campaign conducted through HHS to increase awareness \nabout the need for prostate cancer screening, and the development of \nbetter screening techniques. Since African American men are 56 percent \nmore likely to develop prostate cancer compared with Caucasian men and \nnearly 2.5 times as likely to die from the disease, this campaign will \nwork with the Offices of Minority Health at HHS and the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention to ensure that this effort will reach \nthe men most at risk from this disease.\n  Government investment in coordinating research and education could be \nkey to diagnosing prostate cancer earlier and more accurately. We need \nto strengthen our efforts to bring the tools doctors use to fight this \ndisease into the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this effort, and cosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Heller):\n  S. 3346. A bill to provide for certain land conveyances in the State \nof Nevada, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague Senator \nHeller to introduce the Las Vegas Valley Public Lands and Tule Springs \nFossil Beds National Monument Act of 2012. This legislation will \ndesignate the Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument in southern \nNevada, expand the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, set \naside lands for the expansion of Nevada institutions of higher \neducation, and make thousands of acres available for private \ndevelopment and job creation in the Las Vegas valley.\n  I am proud to lead the introduction of this important bill, which has \nbeen years in the making. The hallmark component of this legislation is \nthe establishment of the Tule Springs Fossil Bed National Monument. The \nproposed monument is supported by the cities of Las Vegas and North Las \nVegas, Clark County, the Governor of Nevada, the State of Nevada's \nDivision of State Parks, the National Parks Conservation Association, \nProtectors of Tule Springs, and thousands of Nevadans.\n  By designating the Tule Springs area a national monument managed by \nthe National Park Service, we will conserve, protect and enhance this \nunique and nationally important resource. Nevadans, tourists, \nscientists, and school children will visit the monument to enjoy its \nscientific, educational, scenic and recreational values for decades to \ncome.\n  The proposed monument is located in the northern part of the Las \nVegas Valley, bounded by the Desert National Wildlife Refuge, the Red \nRock National Conservation Area, and the Spring Mountain National \nRecreation Area. The Tule Springs area is recognized as having the \nlargest assemblage of Ice Age fossils in the Southwest.\n  Over 400 paleontological sites have been discovered, providing a \nrecord of human activity dating back 11,000 years ago. Scientists have \nuncovered fossils of the giant Columbian mammoth, ground sloths the \nsize of small cars, the American lion, and camelops. These great \nprehistoric mammals called North Las Vegas home for thousands of years.\n  Efforts to protect the paleontological treasures contained within the \nLas Vegas Wash began early last century. In 1933, the first fossil \nexpedition in Tule Springs unearthed prehistoric bones that became \nknown as ``Tule the Baby Mammoth.'' In 1962, scientists conducted the \nfamous ``big dig,'' employing radiocarbon dating for the first time in \nthe United States, which in turn dated Ice Age fossils from 23,800 to \n28,000 years old. Despite this significant concentration of important \nfossil resources in the proposed monument, only a fraction of the area \nhas been studied. Many more prehistoric treasures will be found in the \ndecades to come.\n  The proposed Tule Springs Fossil Beds National Monument is the \nproduct of many years of work. Recognizing the threats to the area from \noff-road vehicles, vandalism, and dumping, a coalition of \nenvironmentalists, tribes, academics, and retired Park Service \nemployees formed in the mid-2000s to seek federal protection for Tule \nSprings.\n  The Protectors of Tule Springs collected over 10,000 signatures, and \nlocal and national conservation groups launched a campaign to garner \npublic support for adding the site to the National Parks System. In \n2010, a Park Service reconnaissance report commissioned at the request \nof members of the Nevada congressional delegation found the site \nsuitable for inclusion in the Park System.\n  The monument will also benefit the local economy. Proponents of the \nmonument estimate that it will generate tens of millions of dollars for \nthe regional economy within the early years of operation, bringing \ntourists and researchers from around the world to visit this one-of-a-\nkind place to explore fascinating natural history.\n  The stakeholder agreement to establish the proposed monument includes \nmaking a modest amount of public lands available for private \ndevelopment in the Las Vegas Valley, and the designation of two 640 \nacre job creation zones for the cities of Las Vegas and North Las Vegas \nfor master planned commercial development.\n  Furthermore, the legislation makes land available for the future \nexpansion of campuses within the Nevada System of Higher Education, \nwhile increasing the size of the Red Rock National Conservation Area. \nIt conveys land to Clark County for flood control for the\n\n[[Page S4677]]\n\nfuture Ivanpah Valley Airport, it expands the Metro Police Training \nFacility by 80 acres to enhance public safety and the facility's \nsecurity, and allows the U.S. Forest Service to remedy mistaken \ntrespass situations in the Spring Mountains area. Finally, it conveys \n1,200 acres to Clark County to establish an off-highway vehicle \nrecreation park, and designates public lands surrounding the park as an \noff-highway vehicle recreation area to help keep riders off of \nsensitive lands and habitat.\n  The Las Vegas Valley Lands and Fossil Beds National Monument Act is \nan ambitious piece of legislation, built on years of stakeholder input. \nIt provides for balanced development and job creation within the Las \nVegas Valley, while protecting vital natural and scientific resources \nthat should be made more accessible for the public's enjoyment and \neducation.\n  By making long-term and forward-looking improvements to public land \nmanagement and stewardship in the Las Vegas Valley, I believe we have \ncrafted a bill that will serve the best interests of Nevadans.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this important \nlegislation through the legislative process.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3346\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, and the United \nStates Housing Act of 1937 to enhance and expand the assistance \nprovided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development to homeless veterans and veterans at risk \nof homelessness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Zero Tolerance for \nVeteran Homelessness Act. This bill enhances and expands the assistance \nprovided by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development to homeless veterans and veterans at risk \nof becoming homeless.\n  It is one of our Nation's great tragedies that on any given night, \naccording to estimates by the Department of Veterans Affairs, more than \n67,000 veterans are homeless. The Department further estimates that \nabout 145,000 veterans experience homelessness each year and that \nnearly 1/5th of all homeless people in the United States are veterans. \nThese numbers are expected to climb as our service members who have \nfought in Iraq and Afghanistan return home to face tough economic \nconditions.\n  Indeed, some veterans return from deployments to discover that the \nskills they have honed in their military service can be difficult to \ntransfer to jobs in the private sector. Others struggle with physical \nor mental wounds of war. Still others return to communities that lack \nsafe, affordable housing.\n  Our veterans have made great sacrifices to serve our country, and it \nis especially important to honor our commitment to them. The Department \nof Veterans Affairs is certainly a part of that commitment, providing \nbenefits, medical care, support, and a sense of community to homeless \nveterans. However, a number of other federal agencies provide service \nto veterans, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development, \nand this legislation builds on that existing infrastructure.\n  Many programs through HUD and the VA are already helping homeless \nveterans with transitional housing, health care and rehabilitation \nservices, and employment assistance. However, a more comprehensive and \ncoordinated approach would strengthen these programs and help prevent \nmore at-risk veterans from becoming homeless.\n  First, this legislation would make it easier for non-profits to apply \nfor capital grants through the VA's grants and per diem program to \nbuild transitional housing and other facilities for veterans. This \nwould streamline the process for non-profit organizations to be able to \nuse financing from other sources to break ground on new housing \nconstruction. This is particularly important in the current economy, \nwhen non-profits are stretched and have to be more creative than ever \nto fund new capital projects.\n  Second, the Zero Tolerance for Veterans Homelessness Act would create \na Special Assistant for Veterans Affairs within HUD. The Special \nAssistant would ensure that veterans have access to HUD's existing \nprograms and work to remove any barriers. The Special Assistant would \nalso serve as a liaison between HUD and the VA, helping to connect and \ncoordinate the services the two departments provide.\n  Additionally, this legislation recognizes the need to measure \nprogress of efforts to combat homelessness. The bill would require the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to analyze existing programs and develop \na comprehensive plan with recommendations on how to end homelessness \namong veterans. Establishing a plan with appropriate benchmarks will \nenable the VA to more easily track progress towards this important \ngoal.\n  Only by working together, across the federal government and in \npartnership with non-profits and local housing authorities, will we be \nable to comprehensively help homeless veterans and reach those in \ndanger of becoming homeless. We owe it to our veterans to ensure that \nthey and their families have safe, affordable places to live and to \nprovide the services and benefits they have earned. The nation's brave \nveterans deserve nothing less.\n  I am pleased that provisions from this bill, which follows on \nlegislation I introduced last Congress, have been included in \ncomprehensive legislation that is moving through the Veterans\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n\nAffairs Committee.

(referred to in this preamble as ``Title IX''), \n     which Congress enacted to ensure that gender discrimination \n     did not interfere with educational opportunities;\n       Whereas the passage of Title IX has led to a 574 percent \n     increase in female participation in college sports and a \n     1,000 percent increase in female participation in high school \n     sports;\n       Whereas, before Title IX, only 2 percent of the college \n     students participating in sports were female;\n       Whereas, in 2001, 43 percent of the college students \n     participating in sports were female;\n       Whereas, by a 3-1 ratio, female athletes perform better in \n     school and have higher graduation rates than females who do \n     not participate in sports;\n       Whereas student-athletes have higher annual graduation \n     rates than their classmates who do not participate in sports; \n     and\n       Whereas the success of the 2012 PLU Lutes Softball Team \n     demonstrates the accomplishments that a team can achieve when \n     each player adopts a teamwork mentality: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the Pacific Lutheran University Lutes \n     (referred to in this resolution as the ``PLU Lutes'') \n     Softball Team for winning the 2012 National Collegiate \n     Athletic Association Division III Softball Championship;\n       (2) recognizes the people of Washington State for their \n     support of the PLU Lutes Softball Team;\n       (3) honors the achievements of every player, coach, and \n     support staff who was instrumental in the success of the PLU \n     Lutes Softball Team during the 2012 season; and\n       (4) requests the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution for appropriate display to \n     the PLU Lutes Softball Team.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/27/senate-section/article/S4686-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF RICE UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
