Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will vote on a cloture \nmotion that deals with an amendment that would do away with a tax \nprovision that was enacted many years back by Congress but was extended \njust this last December. In fact, there were a whole series of tax \nextenders that were passed by the Congress in December of last year, \nbut this particular one, the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit, was \nalso extended. It was extended until the end of the year 2011. December \n31 of this year is when it would expire with the amendment we will be \nvoting on tomorrow--or at least the cloture motion we will be voting on \nis with regard to an amendment that would eliminate that and end it \nnow. There are a number of problems associated with that approach, one \nof which is this issue of economic certainty. We have lots of people \nacross this country who have made investments. We have lots of jobs \nthat are impacted by this industry. In fact, if you look, there are 204 \nplants, ethanol plants, in America today, spread across 29 States and \non the order of about half a million jobs--all of which, I might add, \nare American jobs--you have half a million American jobs impacted by \nthis industry. The ironic thing, too, is coming on the heels of an \nannouncement last week that Venezuela, Libya, and Iran will block OPEC \nfrom producing more oil to relieve gasoline prices, we continue to be \nheld more and more hostage every single day by our addiction to foreign \noil.\n\n  We send $1 billion a day outside the United States to purchase \nforeign oil--$1 billion every single day to purchase foreign oil. The \nethanol industry, which now represents about 10 percent of the fuel mix \nin this country, displaces 445 million barrels of oil every single \nyear. That is the equivalent of $34 billion that we don't send \noverseas--445 million barrels of oil displaced every single year, $34 \nbillion that we don't have to spend purchasing foreign oil. So this is \nan issue that has a direct bearing on the issue of energy independence, \nthe issue of continuing what I think is a very dangerous dependence on \nforeign sources of energy, foreign oil, and has a direct bearing as\n\n[[Page S3710]]\n\nwell on the price consumers pay at the pump. Clearly, if you took 10 \npercent of the fuel mix out of production or out of that mix, you would \nput an additional pressure on the price that currently is being paid by \nconsumers.\n  In fact, there was a study done by Iowa State University that said, \nin 2010, if you took away the contribution ethanol makes to the fuel \nmix in the country today, you would see gasoline prices increase by 89 \ncents per gallon. When you are already facing $4 gasoline prices in \nthis country, which I think is having a profound impact on our economy \nand particularly on consumers who, day in and day out, are having to \ndeal with these high prices, it seems ironic that we would be looking \nat legislation and policy that would further drive up the cost of \ngasoline. We ought to look at ways we can reduce it, and this clearly \nwould have the opposite effect.\n  A few weeks ago there was a proposal to put additional taxes on oil \nand gas or at least to change some gas policy with regard to oil and \ngas which many of us argued would add to the cost of gasoline in this \ncountry. It would essentially, in effect, be raising taxes on gasoline.\n  This proposal would have the same effect. It would increase the cost \nof energy and obviously impact many of the jobs to which I just \nalluded. It would also break faith with the commitment made by this \nCongress last December when we extended the VEETC, the volumetric \nethanol excise credit, for another year. We have a lot of folks who \nmade investments, you have people across the country whose livelihoods \nand jobs depend upon this, and I think it makes sense, when we put \npolicy in place and we say it is going to be in place for a certain \nperiod of time, that that be honored.\n  Having said that, I have been working closely with my colleague from \nNebraska and others of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nRepublicans and Democrats, on a proposal that would reform the VEETC \nand move us in a direction that puts us on a pathway or a trajectory \ninto the future that will take greater advantage of this contribution \nthat is being made by biofuels to our country's energy independence and \nalso phase out the VEETC tax credit but that does it in a way that does \nnot impact and disrupt in a way that this would, where you say you are \ngoing to end this today. As I said, you have lots of people who made \ninvestment decisions based on current policy. You would change that \npolicy immediately and abruptly, but that is not the right way or \ncorrect way to go about this. There is a better way. That is what my \ncolleague from Nebraska and I have been working on. I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will vote tomorrow against this attempt to end \nthis abruptly and to disrupt this market and do tremendous harm to an \nindustry that is contributing, in a significant way, to America's move \ntoward energy independence and is helping to keep gas prices lower than \nthey would otherwise be were it not for the 10-percent contribution \nethanol makes year in and year out to our energy.\n  So there are lots of reasons why we think it is a bad idea to move \nforward with the amendment that will be offered tomorrow and the \ncloture motion that would get on that amendment. I hope my colleagues \nwill defeat that cloture motion so we can work on a more responsible, \nreasonable way that phases out the VEETC and, in a responsible way, \nthat would allow those who have made investments to be able to plan \naccordingly.\n  I would simply say, as we get into that debate tomorrow, this is an \nissue which has ramifications for our economy because of the price of \nfuel and the impact ethanol has on the price of fuel in this country. \nIt has an impact on the old issue of energy independence and whether we \nare going to continue to be held hostage and over a barrel by oil we \nhave to import from other places around the world. Of course, it has \nimplications as well for just the jobs that are created here at home, \nAmerican jobs that could very well be lost if we move down a path that, \nin my view, would be very harmful for this industry and its ability to \ncreate jobs.\n  I have my colleague from Nebraska here as well this afternoon and I \nwould welcome his thoughts on this subject and would like to enter into \na dialog with him about the impact this industry has on his State of \nNebraska--and not just the impact it has on Nebraska or South Dakota \nbut the impact it has on this country by creating jobs, by lessening \nthe dependence we have on foreign sources of energy, and by keeping gas \nprices at a more reasonable level than we would otherwise see if it \nwere not for the contribution ethanol makes to our fuel mix.\n  I am going to yield to the Senator from Nebraska for his observations \nabout this subject.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I wish to start out thanking my colleague from South \nDakota. He has been a very reasoned voice on this issue, and he has \nbrought forward some ideas that I believe are the right approach to \ndealing with ethanol. If you think about it, about 50 percent of our \noil is now imported from another part of the world. The more dramatic \npiece of that is that oftentimes the importation of that oil comes from \nparts of the world that do not share our philosophy, do not share our \nview of the world, are not democracies, and do everything they can to, \nin effect, fight against what we believe in. So not only are we \ndependent on foreign oil, we are dependent on a source of foreign oil \nthat oftentimes is contrary to the values and beliefs of American \ncitizens.\n  One of these days, I think we are going to learn the lesson of that \ndependency, and we are going to alter our course. We are going to do a \nwhole host of things that make sense: more drilling, more exploration, \nmore nuclear power plants, as Senator Lamar Alexander has advocated \nfor, and just everything on the list. It is all a piece of the puzzle.\n  A piece of that puzzle is also renewable fuels. It could be \nbiodiesel, it could be ethanol, it could be cellulosic ethanol, which I \nchampioned when I was Secretary of Agriculture. Again, I think it is \ngoing to be a whole host of things.\n  Ten or twenty years ago, if I were on the Senate floor making those \nstatements, many would have looked at me and said: Well, Mike, that is \njust a pipedream. But as the Senator from South Dakota points out, 10 \npercent of our fuel in the United States is now ethanol--10 percent. It \ndid displace 445 million barrels of oil last year. There is nothing \nelse going on out there that has had that kind of impact. We can report \nthat $34 billion was kept in the U.S. economy. We often hear about this \nmassive transfer of wealth that is occurring by us sending our hard-\nearned dollars to other parts of the world--again, parts of the world \nthat do not share our values. In this case, with this product, we kept \n$34 billion here. At least one study indicates the average family saved \n$800 a year because of this. Our gas prices are about 89 cents lower \nper gallon than they otherwise would have been. Those are real savings \nto people who are out there trying to figure out how to pay for filling \nthe tank.\n\n  Many years ago, when I was Governor of Nebraska, we took a long, hard \nlook at our State. We wanted to know how we might best diversify our \neconomy. Some of the things we did worked. I am very pleased to report \nour unemployment rate during this time never got over 5 percent. Today \nit is about 4.2 percent. I am also pleased to tell you we balanced the \nbudget. We did not borrow money to do it. One of the things we did was \nwe said: Look, ethanol is a piece of this puzzle in Nebraska, and so we \nactually created State programs to try to encourage the construction of \nethanol plants.\n  I will tell you, at the time I was Governor, I thought maybe two \nplants would be built. Well, the marketplace responded and we built a \nnumber of plants. Today, Nebraska is the second largest producer of \nethanol. We have 24 plants in the State. Those 24 plants produce 2 \nbillion gallons per year, $4 billion of capital investment. It directly \nemploys 1,300 Nebraskans in high-quality jobs. It also does some great \nthings for our livestock sector because our cattle industry--well, they \nbuy the distiller grains. They have real value if you are feeding \ncattle, which we do a lot in our State.\n  We have recognized in Nebraska, and I think across the country, that \nit is time to move to the next step when it comes to ethanol \nproduction. That is why I was pleased to sign on to Senator\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\nGrassley's bill when he introduced it. I was also pleased to work with \nSenator Thune who has provided such excellent leadership in this area. \nBasically, what this plan does is it says: Let us take a thoughtful, \nmeasured approach. Let's not jeopardize someone's situation and cause \nthem to pay higher fuel prices at the pump because we did something in \na rash and hasty sort of way. It also helps to pay off some of the \ndeficit. We are literally saying: OK, if we are going to make some \nchanges, we will make a contribution to deficit reduction.\n  Well, let me wrap up my comments and say: Senator Thune's approach is \nthe right approach. It is an approach that says: Look, we are not going \nto take this industry, which has become such an important part of our \nenergy strategy, and walk it off the cliff and just see how it lands. \nInstead, what we are going to do is, we are going to take a measured \napproach. We are going to build the infrastructure necessary. We are \ngoing to add some money to reduce the deficit, and we are not going to \njeopardize somebody's price at the pump. It is already expensive \nenough. I am very pleased to support that approach. My hope is that our \ncolleagues will listen to this approach, get behind it, and support it \nbecause it is the right approach. It is the right approach for \nNebraska, but it is the right approach for the country.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his help.\n  I yield the floor to him.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might just say to the Senator from \nNebraska, because I am wondering if perhaps in his discussions with \nfarmers and ranchers in his State--I am sure the issue which he alluded \nto, which I think is an important one, comes out--I wonder if other \npeople around the country realize, when we make a gallon of ethanol, we \ntake a bushel of corn--which is a remarkable thing that we have gotten \nto, where the technology enables us to do that--we produce 2.7 gallons \nof ethanol from a bushel of corn. We have almost 3 gallons of ethanol \nfrom a bushel of corn which goes into our fuel supply and represents \nabout 10 percent of all the fuel we use. I wonder if a lot of people \nrealize that one of the byproducts of that, as the Senator from \nNebraska has mentioned, is something called dried distillers grain. The \nDDGs, as we refer to it, is something that is then used to feed \nlivestock.\n\n  Now, a lot of people think there is this whole corn debate about food \nversus fuel, but I don't think most Americans realize that only about \n12 percent of our corn crop in this country actually ends up in foods. \nIt is either consumed directly, such as corn chips, or indirectly, such \nas high fructose corn syrup. But one-third of the grain that goes into \nethanol production comes out as dried distillers grain, these DDGs, and \nfor each bushel of corn used in the ethanol-making process--as I said, \nthe 2.7 gallons of ethanol--18 pounds of DDGs and 18 pounds of carbon \ndioxide.\n  If we took, let's just say, for example, 5 billion bushels of corn \nused for ethanol production in a year, the feed product equivalent of \nabout 1.7 billion bushels of corn is returned to the livestock food \nchain as an ethanol byproduct. So we take about one-third of all of the \ngrain that is put into the process to make ethanol, and that comes back \nin the form of something we feed to livestock and something that has \nbeen a great source of protein for livestock producers in this country. \nI don't think most Americans even realize we are not just talking about \nthe fuel component; we are not just talking about that liquid we use to \nblend with petroleum products and get ethanol in this country; but \nthere is also this other byproduct which is essential for livestock \nproducers to feed their livestock.\n  I am wondering if, in the conversations the Senator from Nebraska, I \nassume, has with his farmers and ranchers--of course, they are very \nfamiliar with this--the average person around this country understands \nthis.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, that is an excellent point. When I was \nSecretary of Agriculture, this whole debate started about food versus \nfuel. It was almost like there was this impression that you took that \nbushel of corn, you somehow burned it up to create ethanol, and that is \nall you got out of it. Then there was this big debate about whether \nthat was worth it. As the Senator from South Dakota points out, a whole \ndifferent process is occurring.\n  So in our State, it is not just the dried distiller grains because to \ndry them down takes some energy. We have the cattle yards in close \nproximity to the ethanol plants. So they buy the wet mash, which is \nwhat we call it. They ship it over, they feed it immediately, and it is \na wonderful product to feed to cattle.\n  When we think about the approach the Senator from South Dakota has \ncome up with, we realize it hits on all cylinders. It does reform the \nethanol tax credit. Again, I believe the industry has come to the \nconclusion that is a thoughtful, reasonable step.\n  No. 2, it invests in the blender pumps. One of the challenges I had \nfor a long time was with the flex-fuel vehicle. I am in the State that \nis the second largest producer of ethanol. Yet I could not get the E-85 \nunless we really went out and searched for it. What if we had a pump \nwhere I could literally pull up to it and dial it up to E-85 and put \nthat in my vehicle? So it invests in the blender pumps.\n  It extends cellulosic tax credits for the small producers. Here is \nwhat I would say: The next generation is not going to be just corn-\nbased ethanol. That will be a part of the picture, but I believe we \nwill see the day--and we are already seeing the day--where we will have \na cellulosic product converted into ethanol.\n  Then, finally, $1 billion is added to deficit reduction. The ethanol \nindustry is saying: Look, we agree we need to do our share. We agree we \nneed to start on this process of phasing this out.\n  So I think the Senator from South Dakota has hit all the right \npoints. It does not take this industry and drop it off the cliff. It is \na thoughtful, measured approach to dealing with this issue.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his leadership, and \nI yield to him.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in closing, I wish to, first of all, thank \nthe Senator from Nebraska for joining us. He has a great wealth of \nexperience, not only having grown up on a family farm in his early \nyears but representing his State as a mayor, as a Governor, and then \nrepresenting our Nation as the Secretary of Agriculture. I recall \nworking with him when he was the Secretary of Agriculture on a lot of \nthese issues.\n  One of the things that strikes me about where we are today relative \nto where we were then is the prosperity that has returned to the \nagricultural sector in our economy, to rural America. We can't say the \nbiofuels industry has been solely responsible for that, but certainly a \ncontributing factor. We have seen growth in the economy in the Midwest.\n  Again, what I would point out about this, which is so important for \npeople to realize is that these are American jobs. This is our home-\ngrown industry. We are either going to get fuel in the United States or \nwe are going to buy it from some foreign country. That is what we have \nbeen doing, and that is what we continue to do to the tune of $1 \nbillion every single day. So to the degree we can promote domestic \nenergy production in this country and add to the supply in this \ncountry, which is what biofuels does, it is for the American consumer \nand, obviously, good for America's economy and America's dangerous \ndependence we currently have on foreign energy.\n  So the proposal the Senator from Nebraska is a cosponsor of and that \nhe and I have worked together on and that we will file as a bill today \nwill present an alternative to the approach that will be advanced, or \nthat they will attempt to advance tomorrow, which is to just right now, \nin a very disruptive way, abruptly end something that we just voted on \nin December to put in place. We have people who have made investments \nin it, and it has made a tremendous impact on jobs in this country.\n  The approach the Senator from Nebraska and I are advocating I believe \nis a reasoned approach. It is forward looking in the sense that it \npromotes the next generation of biofuels, advanced biofuels, and \ncellulosic ethanol. In the same way the Senator from Nebraska \nmentioned, it gets us to where we have more choices for American \nconsumers when they come into a filling station by investing in some of \nthe\n\n[[Page S3712]]\n\npumps out there and giving consumers more choices.\n  Then, finally, as the Senator from Nebraska said, it also puts money \ntoward the debt, toward deficit reduction, and phases out the tax \ncredit that is available today to ethanol producers in this country. It \nis a reasonable, responsible and, as the Senator said, measured way of \ndealing with this, not the way that is being proposed by the vote we \nare going to have tomorrow.\n  So I hope our colleagues will join us in working in a constructive \nway to continue to grow this industry and do it in a way that creates \njobs for Americans and lessens our dependence on foreign nations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/13/senate-section/article/S3712-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3712-S3713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REVITALIZATION ACT OF 2011\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am going to talk about the basic underlying \nbill we are debating, not the amendment my colleagues have just been \ntalking about. As a way of framing the discussion about this bill, I \nwill cite some statistics that I think will help us understand the \nnature of the problem our country faces right now and why, in my \nopinion, this particular legislation does not solve that problem.\n  According to official statistics, the unemployment rate in the U.S. \nhas risen from 6.8 percent when President Obama was elected in November \nof 2008 to 9.1 percent in May of 2011. Between the end of 2008 and the \nyear 2010, America experienced a net job loss in the nonfarm sector of \nalmost 7 million jobs. So just since the end of 2008 through 2010, 7 \nmillion jobs lost. In that same time, the unemployment rate peaked at \n10.1 percent--that was in October of 2009. It averaged 9.3 percent \nduring 2009, 9.6 percent during 2010, and the 5-month average for 2011 \nso far is 9.1 percent, where we are right now.\n  We are not making progress. In short, since President Obama's \nstimulus was enacted, unemployment has averaged more than 9 percent a \nyear, and that is up from 6.8 percent when he took office. This is not \nprogress.\n  The May unemployment figures show that the U.S. economy added only \n54,000 jobs--far fewer than the 150,000 needed just to keep pace with \npopulation growth, let alone to help dig us out of the recession. So we \nonly had about one-third of the jobs created that we need just to stay \neven. We are getting deeper in the hole. In fact, the number of \nunemployed totals now almost 14 million Americans, and the long-term \nunemployed increased to 6.2 million.\n  Real growth in our economy, the GDP growth from the end of the \nrecession in mid-2009 has been only about half as strong as it was \nduring each of the previous nine recessions since World War II. So \nunlike previous times, we are not recovering as fast as we recovered \nfrom those earlier recessions.\n  On the TV program ``Meet the Press'' this weekend, the host, David \nGregory, asked the chair of the Democratic National Committee, \nRepresentative Debbie Wasserman-Schultz:\n\n       Why should Americans trust Democratic governance right now \n     on the economy, and particularly the president's?\n\n  Amazingly, the head of the Democratic National Committee answered:\n\n       Because we were able to, under President Obama's \n     leadership, turn this economy around.\n\n  Well, the economy has not turned around. The unemployment statistics \nI just cited demonstrate that it is getting worse.\n  Most observers recognize that the steps the President took to try to \nrevive the economy have not worked. I think it is time we admit that \nour massive debt and deficit, which were exacerbated by the 2009 \nstimulus spending bill, have hurt our economy. It has made things \nworse.\n  Republicans are not recommending reductions in government spending \njust for the sake of austerity. We are pushing for the government to \nget its fiscal house in order so that the job creators in the private \nsector will have the confidence to begin hiring and expanding their \noperations. Right now, uncertain of their future tax liability, \nworried about the general fiscal path of this country and the \nincreasing regulatory burdens imposed upon them, job creators are \nsitting on the sidelines. We need to cut government spending to keep \nour tax burden low, approve pending free-trade agreements, and make a \nserious effort to reduce red tape so our economy can begin growing \nagain. In other words, we need to realize that the government does not \ncreate private sector jobs. What we can do in Washington is to create \nthe environment where the private sector is free to grow and create \njobs.\n\n  This bill we are talking about right now, the Economic Development \nRevitalization Act of 2011, is touted by some of its proponents as \nbeing a job creator. The bill is not a jobs bill. Calling it that \ndoesn't make it so. The bill has 21 sections. The truth is, many of \nthese provisions would have zero effect on facilitating the creation of \nAmerican jobs. For example, section 16 moves the State of Montana from \nthe Denver office to the Seattle office. That doesn't create any jobs. \nMost of the provisions of the bill don't have anything to do with \ncreating jobs. There are only four that even mildly could be called \nrelated to job creation.\n  The central component is a reauthorization of the bill's amount of \nspending, and it would reauthorize it at $500 million a year--$\\1/2\\ \nbillion a year. Remember that almost half of that has to be borrowed. \nWe don't have the money to spend $\\1/2\\ billion a year, so we will have \nto go out and borrow the money from someone in order to be able to \nspend it.\n  Given the fiscal constraints facing our Nation today, we can't afford \nthat. Ironically, even the White House is not shy about admitting the \nfact that this EDA bill is too expensive. Specifically, the President's \nbudget for 2012 requested only $324.9 million for EDA, not $500 \nmillion. Additionally, the administration's Statement of Administration \nPolicy declared:\n\n       The bill would authorize spending levels higher than those \n     requested by the President's budget, and the administration \n     believes that the need for smart investments that help \n     America win the future must be balanced with the need to \n     control spending and reduce the deficit.\n\n  Well, this is one thing on which I agree with the administration. \nThis bill would spend too much money. Hopefully, we will get a chance \nto vote on amendments, including one by the ranking Republican on the \ncommittee, Mr. Inhofe, to reduce this level to a more reasonable and \nrealistic one.\n  The rest of the bill includes provisions, as I noted, that are of \nlittle importance. Section 11, for example, creates a $5 million-per-\nyear grant program related to renewable energy and brownfields sites. \nSection 12 relates to energy and water efficiency and decreasing \nforeign oil competition. These are part of a green jobs fad and are not \nreally going to provide significant job creation for our country. If we \nreally want to decrease the consumption of foreign oil, of course, and \ncreate U.S. jobs, we should develop more of our own resources. I \nmentioned another meaningless provision--just moving one State from the \njurisdiction of the Denver office to the Seattle office.\n  Again, these are things that are not going to produce jobs in our \ncountry. So it seems to me, rather than spending time on bills such as \nthis EDA bill, which will not actually create jobs, we should actually \nbe focusing on the big cliff we are heading for and begin preparing for \nthe debt ceiling debate. This is where we can insist on a very large \ndown payment of reduced spending, reform entitlements, and put a \nstraitjacket on future congressional budgets--all of which will give \nbusinesses and markets greater certainty about our fiscal future. As a \nstart, we should have a thorough debate and a vote on a constitutional \nbalanced budget amendment, which would get us on the right path to a \nsound fiscal future.\n  In the long run, the only way for our economy to create jobs is for \nthe government to spend, borrow, and tax less, thus freeing America's \nenterprises to do what they do best. I suggest we not wait any longer. \nIt is time to begin this debate. Let's have a vote on a constitutional \namendment, find ways to reduce spending, ensure we do not increase \ntaxes, and create the climate in which America's businesses can get \nback to work and put their fellow Americans back to work.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S3713]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I wanted to address the issue of patent \nreform--a bill the Senate has already passed by an overwhelming margin. \nIt is my understanding the House of Representatives is expecting to \npass a patent reform bill the House wants, and in the process the House \nwants the Senate to agree very soon thereafter and do it without a \nformal conference.\n  I want my colleagues to understand why I hope the House-passed bill \nwill contain a provision that was not in our Senate bill but passed \nunanimously out of the House Judiciary Committee.\n  The House committee report recognized that the ``need to modernize \npatent laws has found expression in the courts'' but that ``the courts \nare constrained in their decisions by the text of statutes at issue.'' \nThat is from the House committee report.\n  The House Judiciary Committee amendment that passed unanimously \nresulted from a recent Federal court case that had as its genesis the \ndifficulty that the FDA--the Food and Drug Administration--and the \npatent office face when deciding how to calculate Hatch-Waxman \ndeadlines. The Hatch-Waxman law was a compromise between drug patent \nholders and the generic manufacturers. Under the Waxman-Hatch law, once \na patent holder obtains market approval, the patent holder has 60 days \nto request the patent office to restore the patent term--time lost \nbecause of the FDA's long deliberating process eating up valuable \npatent rights.\n  The citation for the case I am talking about is 731 F. Supp 2nd 470. \nThe court case found:\n\n     the FDA treats submissions to the FDA received after its \n     normal business hours differently than it treats \n     communications from the agency after normal hours . . . when \n     notice of FDA approval is sent after normal business hours, \n     the combination of the patent trade office's calendar day \n     interpretation and its new counting method effectively \n     deprives applicants of a portion of the 60-day filing period \n     that Congress expressly granted them . . . an applicant could \n     lose a substantial portion, if not all, of its time for \n     filing a patent trademark extension application as a result \n     of mistakes beyond its control . . . an interpretation that \n     imposes such drastic consequences when the government errs \n     could not be what Congress intended.\n\n  That is the end of the judge's statement on why he ruled as he did in \nthis particular case. Congress did not intend those drastic \nconsequences that happen as a result of a difference between whether \nyou are making an application to or an application from an agency. In \nother words, there should not be any difference. Congress did not \nintend the consequences that come from such a different application of \nthe law. So the court clarified the law so when FDA sends a notice of \napproval after normal business hours, the 60-day period requesting \npatent restoration begins the next business day. The House Judiciary \nCommittee takes the court decision where common sense dictates: to \nprotect all patent holders against losing patent extensions as a result \nof confused counting calculations.\n  I want to quote Ranking Member Conyers of the House Judiciary \nCommittee who sponsored the amendment and committee Chairmen Smith who \nsupported Mr. Conyers. Ranking Member John Conyers stated during markup \nthe amendment is needed to ``remove what amounts to a trap and would \nclarify the term `business day' . . . and so, our attempt here is to \nmake the congressional effort at patent reform more clear, more \nefficient.''\n  Chairman Lamar Smith also advocated passage of this amendment during \nmarkup in the House Judiciary Committee. I will quote him.\n\n       I will recognize myself in support of the amendment. Now, \n     the gentleman's amendment--\n\n  Meaning the Conyers amendment--\n\n     clarifies the counting rules that are imposed on patent \n     holders who must submit documents to the agency within \n     statutory time limits. It has been established that the PTO \n     has inconsistently applied these rules, which is not fair to \n     various patent holders. The gentleman's amendment tracks the \n     recent court case decided in favor of a patent holder that \n     originally applied for an extension 10 years ago. My \n     understanding is that there are not scoring problems with \n     this provision and I support it.\n\n  That is what Chairman Lamar Smith of the House Judiciary Committee \nsaid.\n  This is a commonsense amendment. It improves our patent system \nfairness through certainty and clarity, and I hope the House will leave \nthat in their bill when it sends it over here to the Senate.\n  My interest in this amendment is because I opposed it 2 or 3 years \nago when it was first brought up. Because of the court decision, I am \nconvinced the different application of the 60-day rule is very unfair. \nAs ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I want the House \nJudiciary Committee to know that several Republican and Democratic \nSenators have asked me to support the Conyers language as well.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/13/senate-section/article/S3713-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3713-S3714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, the latest unemployment numbers indicate \nthat nearly 106,000 Arkansans are unemployed. This 7.7 percent \nunemployment rate is higher than when the so-called stimulus passed \nthat President Obama and Majority Leader Reid promised would produce \njobs for hard-working Americans. Although this rate is below the \nnational average, the numbers show that out-of-work Arkansans continue \nto struggle to find gainful employment.\n  What is more alarming is that the President and the majority here in \nthe Senate are resisting real change and insisting on more of the same \nborrow, spend, and tax policies that have given us record unemployment \nand a sluggish economy.\n  In November, Americans gave a clear sign that job creation needs to \nbe a priority. Unfortunately, the Senate majority and President Obama \nhave failed to prove that this is at the top of the agenda. Time and \ntime again, the Senate and our President add to the uncertainty that is \nstifling job creation. Commonsense legislation that would create the \nconditions for job growth is not brought to the floor. It is not \nbecause the Senate has more pressing issues. There is no excuse as to \nwhy the Chamber avoids voting on legislative and policy items that will \nprovide real relief for the unemployed, such as the stalled free-trade \nagreements.\n  As news reports have pointed out over the past several weeks, the \nbusiness in this body is progressing at a historically slow pace. As \nthe Washington Post reported last week, ``Quorum calls have taken up \nabout a third of its time since January, according to the C-SPAN \nstatistics.''\n  Americans are tired of the games. They need jobs, and it is our duty \nto help.\n  Linda from Mountain Home, AR, recently wrote to me asking the same \nthing millions of Americans want to know: ``Where are the jobs?'' She \ncontinued her e-mail asking what legislation Republicans introduced \nthat will stimulate the economy and create jobs. I want to thank Linda \nfor her letter and let her know my colleagues and I are on the side of \nthe American worker, and that is evident by the legislation we have \noffered. These practical free market ideas will put Americans back to \nwork, and, like the millions of Americans who are looking for jobs, we \nare anxious to vote on them and approve these measures.\n  In February, we introduced the REINS Act, of which I am a proud \ncosponsor. Too often, Federal agencies overstep their boundaries and \nenact expensive mandates that strangle investment and job creation \nwithout congressional approval. This commonsense legislation provides a \ncheck and balance between Congress and the executive branch and allows \nbusiness to focus on growth instead of how to comply with burdensome \nregulations.\n\n[[Page S3714]]\n\n  This starts with making changes to unfunded mandates by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. Unnecessary and burdensome regulations \nimposed on our businesses cost money and cost jobs. EPA has put a \ntarget on America's industrial, manufacturing, and agricultural job \ncreators. Clean air, clean water, and conservation are all very \nimportant, but the heavyhanded regulations coming from this EPA have \nlittle or nothing to do with clean air or clean water. We are \nwitnessing a Federal bureaucratic power grab on behalf of a radical, \njob-destroying agenda. These regulations are making food more \nexpensive, energy more expensive, and gasoline more expensive, and they \nare driving jobs out of our country. Our competitors are taking our \njobs and emitting far more pollution into our atmosphere and oceans \nthan we would here in the United States. Again, it is all pain and no \ngain. As the administration works to drive up the cost of energy, they \nseem to forget that a prosperous country is a country that can invest \nin conservation and protect the environment.\n  The President still wants to blame his predecessor for our sluggish \neconomy and lack of jobs. The blame game won't help the President \npolitically, and it won't help turn our economy around. It is true that \nPresident Obama inherited a weak economy, but he made it worse. Before \nPresident Obama took office, the Federal Government was carrying out \nmany policies that distorted the market and contributed to the \nmeltdown. In 2008, we were spending too much money and running severe \ndeficits. Now our deficit is three times as big. Sadly, President Obama \nhas made each of our economic problems worse.\n  I believe it is important to provide American businesses with an \nequal opportunity to compete and succeed while opening new markets for \nAmerican products. I strongly believe that when presented with a level \nplaying field, American businesses and workers can outperform any in \nthe world in terms of quality and value.\n  With three pending trade agreements on the table waiting for \napproval, we are wasting precious time and resources at our disposal to \nopen foreign markets to U.S. products. The lack of action on the \nColombia, Panama, and South Korea agreements is concerning. I believe \nwe need to move forward as quickly as possible to ratify these \npolicies. American companies and their workers are losing market share \nand are being denied valuable business opportunities. That is why one \nof the first pieces of legislation I cosponsored as a Member of the \nSenate was S. Res. 20, legislation that urges this Chamber to consider \nand approve the pending free-trade agreements with these countries.\n  On multiple occasions, President Obama expressed support for the \nimplementation of all of these trade agreements in order to reduce our \nNation's deficit and create American jobs for American workers. So far, \nthere is still a failure to act on any of these agreements.\n  Americans deserve legislation that will promote job growth, but one \nof President Obama's legislative cornerstones, health care reform, \nactually costs jobs. We were told ObamaCare would create 4 million \njobs, but reality tells a different story.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, there will be 750,000 \nfewer jobs. This legislation is bad for business. That is why we voted \nto eliminate the onerous 1099 reporting requirements included in this \nflawed legislation.\n  I will continue to fight for a full repeal of this law as we seek \nmeaningful health care reform that provides quality, affordable access \nfor all citizens based on free market principles.\n  The simple truth is there are 14 million Americans out of work and \nmillions more who have been forced into retirement or gave up looking \nfor a job. These 14 million Americans are calling for our help, yet the \nmajority and the administration continue to ignore their pleas.\n  We have a plan that is ready to move, and the practical free market \nideas it is based upon will put Americans back to work. Let's show \nLinda in Mountain Home and the millions of Americans looking for a job \nthat we are working to change the direction our country is headed and \nbe a job creator.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/13/senate-section/article/S3714-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3714-S3716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I had the opportunity this morning to \ncatch the CNBC program that had Jack Welch, former CEO of GE on, and I \nthought he made a number of valuable points. He is very worried about \nour economy. He believes we are facing serious troubles, and we need to \ntake action to do something about it. As a corporate leader of great \nrenown, one of the more respected corporate leaders in America at this \ntime, he evidenced a real frustration at the lack of leadership this \nadministration is showing with regard to our financial crisis.\n  He said a number of things. One of them was classic leadership, \nclassic thought by a manager, a man who has managed a very large \ncorporation worldwide with many moving parts. He said we have to have a \nstrategy, and we have no strategy. I think that is correct. I do not \nbelieve the American people sense that this country is able to \narticulate a serious strategy to confront the difficulties with which \nwe are now dealing.\n  He said everything needs to go through a screen, and in his opinion \nthe screen should be what our strategy is and our strategy should be, \nin general, to create an economy that is productive, innovative, and \ngrowing; creating jobs, creating wealth, creating prosperity, and \neverything ought to be judged by that.\n  One of the points he mentioned was drilling for oil and gas in \nAmerica. We have all kinds of government agencies here, all kinds of \nregulations and a permitorium, a blocking of the giving of permits, \nthat has substantially reduced the ability of this Nation to produce \noil and gas at home, a critical factor if we are going to be \ncompetitive and economically prosperous.\n  We need to quit buying so much abroad, sending wealth abroad, and \nkeep it at home. He just threw that out as one of the things that would \nnever get through a screen. Instead of helping this country to be more \nprosperous and create jobs and growth, it does just the opposite. Yet \nin this massive government, we take contradictory actions, and as a \nresult we are muddling along at a very unhealthy rate, and the American \npeople are worried about it.\n  Last week was the sixth consecutive week that the stock market fell. \nWe were told in January, when things were progressing, that everything \nwas just doing great and that we are creating a lot of jobs; we are \ncreating jobs, and the market is doing better. But in fact it is not \nmoving very well. If we read the financial pages, we see that the \npeople who spend their lives dealing with the economic threats we face \nare uneasy about our future.\n  Just read those articles in Barron's that just came out over the \nweekend about the roundtable of worldwide economic experts. It was very \ntroubling to me. Many of them had serious concerns about the future. \nWould we have a doubledip? Some seem to say yes. The Presiding Officer, \nMr. Coons, is on the Budget Committee and knows the numbers we are \ndealing with and has heard the testimony that Mr. Bowles, former Chief \nof Staff for President Clinton, and Alan Simpson, in their Fiscal \nCommission Report, said we are facing the most predictable crisis in \nour history, and it could cause economic difficulties for us soon. Mr. \nBowles said 2 years, give or take. Not just for our grandchildren, but \nsoon.\n  This is why the experts say we have a problem. I do not believe we \nhave from the White House any call to the kind of action necessary to \nalter the unsustainable debt trajectory we are on.\n  I do not think the American people fully understand, but they \nunderstood enough to punish the Congress in this last election. I am \nafraid they are going to punish us again because no Congress can defend \nitself from the criticism that we have presided over a government that \nis borrowing 40 cents\n\n[[Page S3715]]\n\nof every dollar and spending $3.7 billion and taking in only $2.2 \nbillion and borrowing the rest. We are on a path that does not alter \nthat. The President's budget is the most irresponsible ever submitted \nand would make our debt path worse rather than better, so I am worried \nabout it. So the majority leader announces: Well, it would be foolish \nto have a budget. Senator Reid said it would be foolish to have a \nbudget, at a time when we have never faced a greater threat to the \nintegrity of our economic system than we face today.\n\n  Let me repeat that. We have never been in a position in which the \neconomy could do as much harm to our Nation as it can today. We are \nheading to the wall at warp speed. It is a dangerous circumstance. But \nwe can get off this path. We have to do some things that are not very \npleasant, but not impossible, that are being done by mayors and county \ncommissioners and Governors all over America and in countries around \nthe world. The British made some very substantial cuts to their overall \nspending program, far more than we are discussing, and some people \npushed back and said, We are cutting too much. That debate will happen \nhere, if we cut spending here.\n  The International Monetary Fund, certainly no bastion of conservative \neconomic thought, said, No, U.K., stay the course. Don't weaken now. \nYou set a good, tough path for constraining and reducing spending, and \nif you stay the course you will be more successful than if you give up \nand quit under the pressure that you might be under today.\n  So how do we get there? How do we get to the point where we deal with \nthese issues? Harvard economist Alberto Alesina, drawing from his and \nothers' research on large fiscal adjustments across multiple nations, \nsaid this:\n\n       Spending cuts are far more effective than tax increases in \n     stabilizing the debt and avoiding economic downturns. In \n     fact, in several episodes, spending cuts adopted to reduce \n     deficits have been associated with government expansions \n     rather than recessions.\n\n  Goldman Sachs has also done a study that indicates that. We have \nempirical evidence that countries that have taken firm steps to get \ntheir financial house in order have found that, maybe almost to their \nsurprise, they have had economic growth quicker than many had \nprojected.\n  So where are we today? Apparently, we are not going to have any kind \nof regular budget process in the Senate, to my great disappointment. I \nbelieve Senator Conrad, the chairman of the Budget Committee--I am the \nranking Republican on that committee--was prepared to have a markup, \nbut the Democratic leadership has decided not to. Senators can't call a \nBudget Committee markup; only the chairman and the leaders can do those \nkinds of things. They have decided not to. Under the Congressional \nBudget Act, the Budget Committee should have marked up and passed a \nbudget resolution by April 1 of this year, and Congress should have \npassed it by April 15. We are now getting close to July 4 and we have \nhad no real public discussion, no national debate, about the challenges \nthis Nation faces.\n  First we had the Gang of Six. They have been meeting in secret, and I \ndon't know who advised them. I don't think average Americans, in their \nstruggles--maybe they have lost their job or haven't seen their pay \nincrease or have seen their overtime eliminated--were in the room with \nthem. They are good people. I was kind of getting anxious for a month \nor so to hear something from them. Maybe it would be a good deal. Maybe \nit would be something to get us moving. I don't know. I had my doubts \nabout it, and I expressed that, but I expressed my support to see what \nthey could produce. Maybe it would be worthwhile. I am withholding \njudgment. So now we are not hearing from them, although they apparently \nhave enough work product--maybe even a plan--that they met with 10 \nother Senators, I understand, to discuss what they are planning on. \nThey haven't let anybody else in on the deal.\n  But now we hear, Don't worry about the Gang of Six. If that doesn't \nwork, we have the Vice President. President Obama has asked him to have \nmeetings with a very small group of Senate and House leaders, and they \nare going to write us a budget. There are some good people meeting in \nthat group, I don't have any doubt about that. But weeks have gone by. \nWe had a week recess and apparently it was over 2 weeks that they \ndidn't even meet.\n  The President is traveling around the world making speeches, raising \nmoney, and this country has not had a budget in 775 days. This Senate \nhas not passed a budget in 775 days. The Budget Act requires us to pass \na budget. It can't be filibustered. It can be passed with a simple \nmajority. If it is going to be a partisan effort--and sometimes it is a \npurely partisan vote--53 Democratic Senators here ought to be able to \npass a budget. We passed a budget when Republicans had a one-vote \nmajority. Sometimes you can get a bipartisan agreement on a budget. \nThat is the best thing. Sometimes it is done with a simple majority. So \nwe have the potential to do that.\n  But, oh, no. Weeks have gone by and we are waiting on these meetings \nat the White House. Nobody knows exactly what is happening there. It is \nsupposed to be secret. Normally a budget is brought up, it is brought \nbefore the Budget Committee, the chairman lays down the chairman's \nmark, everybody gets to offer complete substitutes, gets to offer their \nwhole budget or technical amendments or significant amendments to that \nbudget, and they get voted on, and the matter is discussed. The \nAmerican people can get a copy of the chairman's mark and the \namendments offered by the other members of the committee. That is how \nwe do business in a democracy, the last I heard, and then we are \naccountable, right? By how much do you think we ought to raise taxes on \nthe American people? By how much do you think we are going to cut \nspending? Are you going to dare to make any changes in Medicare? I will \nnot vote for it if you make any change in Medicare. Or: You have to do \nsomething about these entitlements. You didn't do anything about the \nMedicare entitlements? You are going to let them go broke? Those are \nthe kinds of good discussions we would be having, and the American \npeople could see it. Then it comes to the floor of the Senate. It has \nan expedited process, but there is a real opportunity to have \namendments--even hundreds of amendments--to offer to the Budget Act, \nand we then have something that at least is seen by the American people \nand at least they will know if their representatives voted for or \nagainst it. But I think this idea of doing it in some other order, not \nthe regular order, is an unhealthy process, and I hope we can do \nbetter.\n  I wish to conclude by saying that in 775 days, I don't believe we \nhave fulfilled our responsibility. We obviously have not fulfilled our \nstatutory responsibility under the Budget Act, which says we should \nhave a budget by April 15. It also says we should have held a markup by \nApril 1. Well, it is tough business, standing before the American \npeople in this crisis we are in, and proposing the kinds of severe \nactions that are going to be necessary to put our country on the right \npath--not the path to decline, not the path to debt crisis, but the \npath to prosperity. It is going to take some effort. It is going to be \npainful in some ways. But we are not moving in that direction at all.\n  What about the House of Representatives? They passed a budget. They \npassed a bold budget--a budget that goes 10 years and then even \nfurther, and it laid out a historic plan. It confronted the growth in \nentitlement programs that is a threat to their very viability. It \nencouraged economic growth. It reduced spending, which has surged in \nthe last several years. Indeed, in the last two cycles, we have \nincreased nondefense discretionary spending 25 percent. People act as \nthough if we cut spending, we are going to sink in the ocean. That \ngrowth could be eliminated and we would be no worse off than we were 3 \nyears ago.\n  So the House did their duty. And what happened? Our Democratic leader \nover here in the Senate, instead of producing his own budget, calls up \nthe House budget and he wants to talk about how horrible it is and then \nvote on it. It got quite a number of votes in the Senate--certainly not \nenough to pass. We got a lot of votes. So I offered the President's \nbudget, the one he submitted a couple months ago and that I call the \nmost irresponsible budget ever to be presented to this Nation--and I\n\n[[Page S3716]]\n\nstand by that. We are in a systemic crisis that has to be confronted \nwith serious decision making, and the President's budget comes nowhere \nclose to doing that. So I offered it. The President's budget failed 97 \nto 0. Not one Member of this Senate, Republican or Democrat, voted for \nthat budget.\n  I think this is irresponsible. We have seen 775 days pass. We didn't \nhave a budget last year. We didn't pass a single appropriations bill \nlast year. Everything was cobbled together in this monumental CR we \nheard about, the continuing resolution. It is a totally ineffective \nmethod of governing this country and spending money. Congress ought to \ndo its 12 appropriations bills properly every year. First, they should \nhave a budget that tells all the committees how much money they have to \nspend and then they should pass the 12 appropriations bills. Each one \nshould be brought up subject to amendment and voted on.\n\n  We have been in this irresponsible circumstance. My request is to our \ncolleagues who are working either in the White House with the Vice \nPresident or whatever they are doing over there, the Gang of Six or \nFive or whatever--whatever they are doing--how about getting busy. How \nabout let's see some numbers so we can get to work. I don't think it is \ngoing to be well received by Members of the Senate to have plopped down \nin our lap, on the eve of some important matter such as the debt \nceiling, a budget proposal that nobody has had a chance to study and \nthat the American people don't know the details of. I thought that was \none of the things we learned in the last election. I thought we learned \nthe American people want transparency. They want accountability. They \nwant to know what their representatives are doing, and they want to see \nthem working in the light of day, not the dark of night. I think that \nis reasonable. That is the way our Congress was set up to work. That is \nwhat I wish to see.\n  I think it is time for these meetings to start wrapping up. I think \nit is time for us to start seeing some numbers. What are they going to \ndo, wait for the last possible day to raise the debt ceiling and then \nwaltz in here with some sort of agreement we are all supposed to \nrubberstamp in a state of panic? I don't appreciate that. I don't think \nthe American people will either. It is not good government. If they \nhave a plan, let's start seeing what it is. Let's bring it up and let's \nstart having a public discussion on it and vote on it. I think that is \nthe right way to go about our business.\n  I am very concerned that we have gotten away from the regular order. \nI believe we have gotten away from our august responsibility to pass a \nbudget, to decide openly and publicly how much we think we can spend, \nhow much we are going to tax, how much debt we are going to have. We \nought to do that publicly and openly. I believe that will be held \nbefore the public and it will help the American people understand how \ndeep a hole we are in. It is far deeper than most of us realize. I have \nlooked at the numbers. They are very grim indeed. We need to get \nstarted sooner rather than later.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Coburn \nand Feinstein in offering an amendment to repeal the ethanol excise tax \ncredit and the ethanol import tariff. These policies are fiscally \nirresponsible, environmentally unwise, and economically indefensible.\n  Historically, our government has helped a product compete in one of \nthree ways: either we subsidize it, we protect it from competition, or \nwe require its use. Right now, ethanol may be the only product \nreceiving all three forms of support.\n  The ethanol tax break is extraordinarily expensive. The Government \nAccountability Office has found that the tax credit costs American \ntaxpayers a staggering $6 billion annually. This is quite a sum to prop \nup a fuel that is causing land conversion for corn production, \ncommodity and food prices to rise, and is barely putting a dent in our \nNation's dependence on foreign oil.\n  With our amendment, which has an effective date of July 1, we have \nthe opportunity to immediately save American taxpayers nearly $3 \nbillion in just the 6 months remaining in this year.\n  The 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act requires the production \nof at least 36 billion gallons of biofuels in 2022, up from the \noriginal 2005 Energy Policy Act, which required 7.5 billion gallons by \n2012. Collectively, the first generation biofuels industry will receive \ntens of billions in unnecessary subsidies through the year 2022.\n  If the current subsidy were allowed to continue for 5 years, the \nFederal Treasury would pay oil companies at least $31 billion to use 69 \nbillion gallons of corn-based ethanol that the Federal Renewable Fuels \nStandard already requires them to use. We simply cannot afford to pay \nthe oil industry for following the law.\n  The data overwhelmingly demonstrates that the costs of the current \nethanol subsidies and tariffs far outweigh their benefits. The Center \nfor Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University \nestimated that a 1-year extension of the ethanol subsidy and tariff \nwould lead to only 427 additional direct domestic jobs at a cost of \nalmost $6 billion. That is roughly $14 million of taxpayer money per \njob.\n  While expanding our capacity to generate alternative domestic fuel \nsources is an important step toward becoming less dependent on foreign \noil, I have serious concerns about the effects of increased ethanol \nuse. There are other alternative sources of energy that make far more \nsense.\n  The energy, agricultural, and automotive sectors are already \nstruggling to adapt to the existing ethanol mandates. I am disappointed \nthe Environmental Protection Agency has issued a partial waiver for the \nuse of E-15, a blend of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol. Many \nresidents in my State have already experienced difficulties using \ngasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol, finding that it causes \nproblems in older cars, snowmobiles, boats, lawn mowers, and off-the-\nroad vehicles. The EPA's E-15 waiver fails to adequately protect \nagainst misfueling and will add unnecessary confusion at the gas pump \nfor consumers. We simply cannot place so many engines in jeopardy.\n  These first-generation biofuel mandates also present environmental \nconcerns, as they could result in energy efficiency losses and \nincreased emissions of air pollutants because the mechanical failures \ncan jeopardize the effectiveness of mission control devices and systems \ninstalled on engines.\n  In addition, over recent years, we have seen food and feed prices \nincrease as crops have been diverted to first-generation biofuel \nproduction. I think of it this way: We should be raising crops for \nfood, not for fuel.\n  Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Joe Lieberman and I held \na series of hearings in 2008 that examined the impact of corn-based \nethanol on food prices, and we found that it certainly had a negative \nimpact. For one thing, crops that had been grown to support other \ngrains were being converted to produce corn. The land was being \nswitched to corn production, and the corn was no longer available for \nthe products that used corn for food, but instead was being diverted to \nthe production of ethanol.\n  The bottom line is that we can no longer ignore the cost of this \npolicy to our Nation and its taxpayers, particularly given our current \nfiscal crisis. At a time when we are projecting a deficit, this year \nalone, of $1.5 trillion, why in the world are we spending $6 billion \nsubsidizing ethanol? Subsidizing the blending of corn-based ethanol \ninto gasoline is simply fiscally indefensible.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Coburn-Feinstein \namendment to repeal the ethanol excise tax credit and to eliminate the \nethanol import tariff.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S3717]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/13/senate-section/article/S3717-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3717-S3719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                MEDICAID\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in 1964 President Johnson envisioned \nan America that ``rests on abundance and liberty for all.'' It was \nagainst LBJ's backdrop of the Great Society that we reignited a \ntradition of community. This was a little spillover of the 1960s and \nour flight to the Moon and all of that, but the Nation somehow came \ntogether, and we sensed that we were a community and that we had a \nmutual obligation to each other, and that is at the very least \ncharacteristic of the American people, more then than now. Programs \nsuch as VISTA, Peace Corps, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid \nwere born in those few years, 1961 though 1964.\n  Sadly, nearly 50 years after LBJ's war on poverty, we have witnessed \nvicious attempts to roll back government programs designed to give low-\nincome Americans a hand up in life. I do not mean just low-income \nAmericans but disabled Americans, very poor senior Americans who \nqualify for both Medicare and Medicaid--such a difficult journey they \nhave. What we want to do is not to give people a hand up but simply to \nbe a safety net. That is what he said this country owed its people. \nThat is true about defense, and that is true about social policy. We \nhave responsibility, all of us, to do that, to make sure nobody is left \nout.\n  There is no question that we must reduce our deficit, and I have a \nwhole series of ways that can be done in abundance, but we should not \ndo so on the backs of working families still struggling under the \nweight of this recession. Oh, yes, we are in a recession, so everything \nthat was true about people who were having a hard time before is a lot \ntruer now. Yet bill after bill proposed by Republicans seeks to do \nexactly that.\n  The House Republican H.R. 1 was a direct attack on America's working \nfamilies and the successful education, job-training, and community \ndevelopment programs designed to combat poverty.\n  The Republican budget proposal for next year goes even further. It \nattacks Medicare and Medicaid, the health programs on which over 100 \nmillion American people rely--some more than others, but all have to \nhave that as a safety net.\n  At a critical moment in our economic recovery, Republicans are more \nfocused on settling old scores--evidently from health care reform and \nthe bitterness of that fight--than they are on creating jobs or \nprotecting people. The Republican plan for getting our deficit under \ncontrol amounts to an upside-down government. Instead of helping those \nwho depend on government programs to support their families, the \nRepublican plan would guarantee that millionaires, billionaires, and \nlarge corporations continue to receive trillions of dollars--to wit, $4 \ntrillion under the new budget--in government subsidies, subsidies that \nwill grow exponentially over time and substantially increase their \nbenefit. They will do very, very well indeed were we to make the tragic \nmistake of accepting that.\n  Republicans are not for a fair or balanced approach to deficit \nreduction, and it is a great mystery to me. It is a quandary to me. I \nmean, you can say it is theological or whatever, you can make up all \nkinds of nasty political views of it, but nevertheless that is what it \nis. What they are there for is a government that only exists to support \nbig business and wealthy Americans--kind of a perpetual TARP for their \nfriends.\n  Well, I reject that notion, and the American people do too. In my \nestimation, there is no government program that more fully embodies our \nNation's tradition of community than Medicaid, our sense of mutual \nobligation. Some people are born wealthy. Some people are born very \npoor. Some people are born in between. Some people are born wealthy and \nthen become poor. Some people are born poor and then become wealthy. \nBut while they are down, they have a safety net, and it is called \nMedicaid. You don't hear people talking about it very much, \nparticularly, frankly--somewhat disappointedly--from my side of the \naisle.\n  After almost 50 years, Medicaid is still a lifesaving part of what we \ndo as a government, what we are meant to do as a government. Medicaid \nis simply too important to millions of people.\n  Nationally, there were 68 million people enrolled in Medicaid in \n2010--68 million children, seniors, people with disabilities, pregnant \nwomen. These are families who are living on the edge and barely making \nit. They now have a safety net, more efficient than any private \ninsurance program in existence. They have that.\n  In West Virginia, there were over 402,000 people enrolled in 2008, \n152,000 of those aged and disabled and 191,000 children--children. So \nalmost 50 years later, Medicaid is still a lifesaving part of our \nNation's health care system. In West Virginia, Medicaid covers 50 \npercent of all births. That tells you something.\n  In our country, 40 percent of all births are taken care of by \nMedicaid. That says a lot.\n  Sixty-two percent of long-term care is Medicaid and, along with the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program it covers 34 percent of the \nchildren in our country. There are a lot of people who fought very hard \nover a number of years to get the Children's Health Insurance Program \nthat would insure more children who were not at that point eligible. \nWell, they are still getting it, but the House wants to get rid of that \nprogram altogether. That is 34 percent of the children in our country.\n  Medicaid provides an essential lifeline to families during difficult \neconomic times, when people lose jobs that have provided them health \ninsurance.\n  Medicaid is the health care program that helps States during crises--\nnot just people but States--including, obviously, the September 11 \nattacks, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the recent floods and tornadoes \nin the South and the Midwest--all being helped by Medicaid.\n  Medicaid is part of the fabric of our great Nation, and to be clear \nat this point, I need to say that the House bill that was passed by the \nHouse--and who voted for it and who did not obviously is very much on \nrecord--would devastate Medicaid and government in general out of \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Anyway, people who are covered by Medicaid do matter. They are \npeople. They are families. They have their needs, their wants, their \nambitions, their dreams, their sadnesses, their depressions, whatever.\n  Darren Hale, from Princeton, WV, wrote me.\n\n       I am a disabled West Virginian whose family relies on \n     Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n  That may be a dual-eligible--you know, poor enough to be on Medicaid, \nold enough to be on Medicare, not able to survive simply on just one or \nthe other.\n\n       I hope and pray that these health programs won't be ended \n     or totally changed. Please do not support Republican changes \n     to these programs as a way of cutting costs to the taxpayer. \n     The poor of West Virginia and elsewhere should not and cannot \n     bear the burden of the deficit reduction that Republicans \n     want.\n\n  We need to think very seriously about our priorities. That is what \nthis conversation really leads me to.\n  Let's say I am a 10-year-old boy, and I am being brought up in West \nVirginia. My means are meager. I step out into a road, and I am hit by \na car. I don't die, but perhaps my spine is fractured--probably--legs \nbroken, and I am condemned to a life in a wheelchair.\n  Now, that child is not protected by the private enterprise system. \nThat child, unless they are an unusual child from a fairly wealthy \nfamily who then can provide insurance--but they will spend themselves \ndown, with that insurance being so incredibly important, and they will \neventually qualify for Medicaid.\n  You know, when you are hit by a car, that is not something you plan \non. It is not something you failed to do because you did not have a \nwork ethic or whatever the common wisdom would be about that. It is \njust something that happened. But the fact remains that your health \ncare is cut, your life is changed, and it grows more miserable because \nyou have nothing in the way of a safety net if the Republican budget is \npassed, if we get too aggressive about cutting Medicaid.\n  I am troubled. Members of Congress and senior advocates have \nrightfully rallied in staunch defense of Medicare. You can find \nwonderful groups here in Washington who rise up in anger when people \ntalk about cutting Medicare. They are for Medicare. They know\n\n[[Page S3718]]\n\nwhat it is. They know what it was intended to do. They know what it \ndoes. They know what a difference it makes. But aside from an \noccasional editorial or story, there has been an unsettling silence \nabout Medicaid, even from members of my own party. This is despite the \nfact that the five main arguments made in support of Medicare, which \nseem to have had a rebirth recently, are also true of Medicaid.\n  No. 1, the public strongly supports Medicaid, just as they do \nMedicare. Sixty percent of people say they would prefer to keep \nMedicaid as it is now. That surprises me. I would have thought the \nfigure would have been much lower. I will get into that in a moment.\n  No. 2, Medicaid also creates jobs, unlike tax cuts for oil companies \nand rich people, et cetera. Every $1 million in Federal Medicaid \nspending results in 17.1 new jobs. Sounds boring. Maybe it is, but not \nto the people who get those jobs. That is at hospitals, that is at \nnursing homes, community health centers, and doctors' offices because \nthat is what Medicaid covers.\n  No. 3, a Medicaid block grant or a spending cap, which is proposed by \nsome--the cap is proposed by some to get away from the words ``block \ngrant,'' but the effect--don't be fooled by that--is the same. They \nwould both reduce the Medicaid benefits and increase cost sharing for \nseniors--for all of the recipients on Medicaid from day one. Understand \nthat clearly, I would say to my colleagues. Much has been said about a \nMedicare voucher system, but capping Medicaid spending would be just as \nbad for the 5.5 million seniors and 11 million individuals with \ndisabilities enrolled in Medicaid.\n  No. 4, instead of reducing the deficit, the savings achieved by \ndrastically cutting Medicaid would also be used to pay for more tax \nbreaks for wealthy Americans and large corporations.\n  Here is where I come to what I just don't understand about what is \ngoing on in this body.\n  Evidently, it is not going on outside in America. Sixty percent don't \nwant Medicaid touched. The fact that it is a majority in Medicaid is \namazing and wonderful to me. I just don't understand, Mr. President. I \nthink it is political. I think people know that poor people and the \ndisabled--I run into them often and seek them out sometimes, the \ndisabled. They gather in clusters of 30, 50, or 75 people in \nwheelchairs. They depend upon Medicaid. That is what they depend on. We \nsee them in the Capitol. Do people stop to see them? Not particularly, \nno. They know that. They are not very good lobbyists. They cannot be \nbecause it is hard for them to get around. So is it political?\n  The Ryan budget cuts taxes on the wealthy, on big deal people and big \ndeal corporations, by $4 trillion. But it cuts Medicaid. Is that an act \nof social conscience or budget wisdom, or is that a thought-through \nvalue system? Is it just political, basically because they know that \npoor people don't vote? That is what I think the answer is.\n  You get worried about Medicare real fast.\n  We saw the results. We saw the House back off from that. But \nMedicaid? Not so. And it won't be so unless people stand up for \nMedicaid because they don't have lobbyists; they cannot afford them. \nThey don't even speak that much for themselves. I don't get as many \nletters from them as from others, by a factor of 10. They have a sense \nthat life has it in for them. That is partly an Appalachian \ncharacteristic, and I think many other parts of the country. There is a \ncertain fatalism in life--that God has a plan for you, and it is not \nnecessarily very good. If people accept that--which I don't--as a \ntheory, then they are not going to fight for what Lyndon Johnson gave \nto the Nation and passed overwhelmingly in 1965.\n  Cuts to Medicaid will also, to the pleasure of some, undermine the \nhealth care reform law that we just passed--which is still law. \nMedicaid is the underpinning of the entire coverage expansion of \nreform. We talk about 32 million people that we are going to cover. \nThat goes way down, Mr. President, if these Medicaid cuts are made.\n  So I ask my colleagues, why is Medicaid so often treated like a \nsecond-class program? More to the point, why are people who are on \nMedicaid treated so often as second-class people? How does that work \nout? Is that a product of the American sense of justice, or is that a \nthoughtful America looking around them? We all have friends who have \nbeen on Medicaid, or are on it, and have made it out.\n  Unfortunately, sometimes those people forget their Medicaid \nbackground and turn away from it because they are on to a new and \nbetter life. Somebody has to fight for these people.\n  Is it the feeling that maybe they are an unwanted burden on society? \nWe have a tendency in America to say if you don't work, it is because \nyou don't want to. If you don't have a decent job and you have a shabby \nhome, it is because that is what you sought, not what was given to you \nin your, at least, destiny of the moment.\n  Again, I think, is it because most of the people enrolled are low-\nincome people and many do not vote? I think that sums it up pretty \nwell. But it is more than that. You can't go into the hollows of \nAppalachia or Nebraska or many other places and organize poor people to \nvote because their sense is, why? What does it get me?\n  Decade after decade, a little bit--is there a little disdain on the \npart of the American people for those on Medicaid? It is a glorious \nprogram, but sometimes it is an inglorious word because it implies they \ndon't want to better themselves.\n  I won't go through my experiences in West Virginia for the 58th time \non this floor. But I have seen so many examples of people who are \nbeaten down--not with a cudgel but because all economic opportunity \nvanished from their lives. The coal mines shut down, or there weren't \nany other jobs around. They didn't get to go to school because no \nschoolbus would come because they were too far away and county law said \nthey don't have to be picked up.\n  So is the deck stacked against them? Yes, it is. Out of that group, \nthere is one--I guess a guy who is about 40; I will not mention his \nname. He has a terrific job. He works with the CSX System as one of \ntheir railroad maintenance people. He has a good family and is a \nwonderful person. But his parents were killed in a vehicle crash, and \nhis brothers have been fighting all kinds of problems. So it really \ntakes something special to fight your way out of that self-defined \nposition and make your move forward.\n  I must say to my colleagues, the point of a representative democracy \nis not to serve the few, not even to serve the many, but to serve all \nas best we can. Does that mean we don't touch anything in Medicaid? No, \nbut does it mean that we keep Medicaid as a safety net? Yes, it does.\n  We are not here elected by some people with incomes above X amount of \ndollars. We are here for all people--even the people who didn't vote \nfor us or didn't vote at all. I take that very seriously, and I take my \nexperience in West Virginia very seriously.\n  Sixty-eight million people are enrolled in Medicaid. They deserve a \nvoice in this debate, and I, for one, will speak out for them. It is \nbecause somehow we feel that Medicaid recipients are not worthy--and I \nhave expressed that in different words--simply because they have fallen \non hard times or were born in hard times.\n  How do you help the fact that your father or mother didn't work \nbecause there wasn't any work available? What do you do about that \nsituation? Or you were born in the ghetto. Oh, you just rise above \nthat. Barack Obama did, therefore, anybody can. Life doesn't work like \nthat, and the Presiding Officer knows that very well.\n  Then I must ask of my colleagues, how could this be? We all have \nneighbors, friends, and family who have or do benefit from Medicaid--\neven perhaps in their distant past. In fact, nearly half of all \nAmericans have a friend or a family member that has received Medicaid \nassistance at some point, and they are absolutely worthy of our \nsupport.\n  Is it because we believe Medicaid spending is truly out of control? \nThen I remind colleagues that Medicaid costs per beneficiary grew much \nlower over the past decade than costs for any private health insurance \ncoverage. The administrative costs in Medicaid are between 1 and 2 \npercent. An average health insurance company is probably 10, 15, or 20 \npercent--and all of this despite the fact that Medicaid has more \ncomprehensive benefits. They are much\n\n[[Page S3719]]\n\nlarger benefits that cover more. They do more for people, and \nsignificantly lower cost sharing.\n  I fervently believe the American tradition of shared responsibility--\neverybody working together for the greater good--is a tradition worth \nupholding and that a government has an ongoing role to play in its \npreservation. It cannot play that role perfectly, but it can do it as \nbest and most fairly as possible.\n  Instead of shortchanging Medicaid, we must have the courage to rein \nin tax breaks for corporate America and for people of great wealth. \nMedicaid does exactly what it was designed to do all those years ago: \nprovide a safety net for low-income Americans. There are lots of \nworthwhile and positive ways we can improve the program, I grant you \nthat. But trashing Medicaid, gutting Medicaid--especially if it is sort \nof flipping it aside for political gain--cannot be an option.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow afternoon we will vote on \nSenator Coburn's amendment dealing with ethanol.\n  I come to the floor at this time to express my strong opposition to \nthat amendment. Senator Coburn's amendment would raise the tax on \ndomestic energy production. It would do this by repealing an incentive \nfor the use of a home-grown renewable fuel called ethanol.\n  With conflicts in the Middle East and crude oil priced at $100 a \nbarrel or more, we should be on the same side. Let me make that clear. \nWe have Middle East problems. We have crude oil priced at over $100 a \nbarrel. Oil interests and biofuels interests, if both are domestically \nproduced, should be on the same side of the energy issue.\n  Why would anyone prefer less domestic energy production? In other \nwords, why would anyone prefer importing more oil over domestically \nproduced energy, whether it is fossil fuel or renewable? We should all \nbe on the same side of more domestically produced energy.\n  The tremendous cost of America's dependence upon foreign oil has \nnever been more clear. I support drilling here and drilling now. I \nsupport renewable energy. I support conservation. I support nuclear \nenergy. The reason I support different forms of energy and why we have \nto support more energy is that if we are going to have an expanding \neconomy and create more jobs, we are obviously going to use more \nenergy.\n  Remember, I included conservation in my energy program. So the \nattacks on domestic energy are quite a remarkable thing happening right \nnow, when gasoline is $4 a gallon. We are spending $835 million a day \nimported oil. So whether it is oil or renewable energy, we should not \nbe fighting each other over any source of domestic energy. We should be \nfighting together against OPEC and these foreign dictators and oil \nsheiks--some of them hate the United States--from holding our economy \nhostage.\n  The author of the amendment has argued that the production of clean, \nhome-grown ethanol is fiscally irresponsible. It is important to \nremember that the incentive exists to help producers of ethanol to \ncompete with the oil industry--in other words, to have a level playing \nfield for all forms of energy.\n  Remember, the oil industry has been well supported by the Federal \nTreasury for more than a century. The Senator from Oklahoma, the \nsponsor of the amendment, has touted with much fanfare a letter from \noil companies that says they don't need or want the credit. It is my \nunderstanding that many of the oil refineries are no longer in the \nbusiness of downstream ethanol blending and, subsequently, do not pay \nthe excise tax on gasoline and do not benefit from the credit.\n  Now, isn't it easy to be advocating repeal of something when you \ndon't benefit from it? It is even easier to advocate for repeal when \ndoing so would undercut your competition.\n  It shouldn't surprise anyone that the oil refiners and Big Oil are \nadvocating a position that would reduce the competitiveness of \nrenewable ethanol. Refineries enjoy a cozy monopoly on our Nation's \ntransportation fuel. They opposed the Renewable Fuels Standard because \nit cuts into their monopoly.\n  Alternatively, if the members of the National Petrochemical and \nRefiners Association say they don't want or don't need the credit, then \nit is pretty simple: Don't take it. It is a tax credit which they must \napply for to the Internal Revenue Service. If they don't want it and \nthey don't need it, they shouldn't file for that credit with the \nInternal Revenue Service. I would be glad to work with the Senator from \nOklahoma in getting the members of the National Petrochemical and \nRefiners Association to return the credit to the Federal Treasury. No \none is forcing them to take the credit. Since they seem eager to return \nit, perhaps Senator Coburn and I can work together to get them to \nreturn it.\n  If you like tight gasoline supplies and if you like $4 gasoline, join \nthe campaign led by Big Oil and the National Petrochemical and Refiners \nAssociation. If you want less dependence on foreign oil and more use of \nhomegrown, renewable fuels, support ethanol producers.\n  The fact is, the portion of the industry that blends ethanol and \nsells it to the consumers supports maintaining this credit. The Society \nfor Independent Gasoline Marketers of America, or SIGMA, recently wrote \nto the Senate majority leader and minority leader opposing efforts to \nprematurely and abruptly eliminate the blender's credit:\n\n       On behalf of our client, the Society of Independent \n     Gasoline Marketers of America, I write to you to oppose \n     efforts in Congress to prematurely and abruptly eliminate the \n     VEETC--that is the ethanol blenders credit.\n       Increasing the tax paid on ethanol-blended gasoline makes \n     no sense at a time when consumer fuel prices are already high \n     and the need to maximize domestic energy sources is so very \n     critical.\n\n  Very true at the time when gasoline is $4 a gallon.\n  SIGMA's members account for 37 percent of the petroleum retail \nmarket. SIGMA works to promote competition in the marketplace to help \nkeep consumer fuel costs down. This is contrary to the position of oil \nrefiners who prefer no competition.\n  I have further words from that letter.\n\n       This incentive has been an extremely useful tool in helping \n     the Nation's fuel marketers and chain retailers deliver fuels \n     to the market at a competitive price.\n       By providing long-term price competitiveness for ethanol-\n     blended fuels, VEETC also helps provide assurances to \n     marketers and retailers that important infrastructure \n     investments necessary to deliver these fuels will continue to \n     provide returns, and not result in wasted improvements.\n       Simply put, SIGMA opposes recent moves to prematurely or \n     abruptly end the subsidies without any consideration for \n     future fuel and fuel-delivery costs.\n       To end this incentive immediately would no doubt result in \n     an immediate spike in consumers' fuel costs.\n       SIGMA believes that a policy that provides an effective \n     transition for the industry from the current tax structure is \n     a better alternative to the slash and cut budget strategy \n     being promoted by some Members of Congress.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Oklahoma also mentioned the total cost \nof the blender's credit as a reason for supporting repeal of VEETC. He \nclaimed the American people will have spent $32 billion on this credit \nover the past 30 years. That may be the case.\n  Again, I don't believe we should be debating ethanol incentives by \nthemselves or in a vacuum. For comparison's sake, I wish to inform my \ncolleagues of the cost and duration of a few oil subsidies.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has derided the 30-year-old ethanol \nblender's credit, arguing that the industry is mature. Well, what about \nour century-old oil industry? Don't forget, oil was discovered in \nPennsylvania in 1859. We haven't had the incentives for that long, but \naccording to the Government Accountability Office, the tax break \nallowing for the expensing of intangible drilling costs began in 1916, \nmore than 95 years ago, and continues today. The percentage depletion \nallowance was enacted in 1926, 85 years ago, and it still exists today. \nAfter 95 years, is the domestic oil industry not mature?\n  I know my colleagues will be interested in how much these two \nsubsidies\n\n[[Page S3720]]\n\nhave cost the American people. A report issued by the General \nAccounting Office in the year 2000 looked at the subsidies for oil \nproduction. It reviewed the 32-year period between 1968 to 2000. During \nthat timeframe, the intangible drilling subsidy cost the American \npeople as much as $52 billion. The percentage depletion subsidy cost \nthe American people $82 billion. So these two provisions, enacted \nnearly a century ago, cost the American people as much as $114 billion \nfrom 1968 through 2000. And this doesn't even include the subsidies \nduring the past 11 years.\n  Last month, we had a vote here in the Senate to repeal a number of \nthese oil and gas tax provisions. Opponents of repealing oil and gas \nsubsidies argued then, and I presume would argue today, that doing so \nwould reduce domestic energy production and drive up our dependence on \nforeign oil. Opponents at that time also argued it would cost U.S. \njobs, and increase prices at the pump for consumers.\n  I happen to agree with those arguments. But if those arguments are \ngood for oil, then they are good not just for ethanol but they are good \nfor all sorts of green energy as well.\n  Prices at the pump are nearly $4 a gallon. All of our constituents \nare crying out for action to lower these prices, so it makes sense that \nCongress would consider steps to address the rising energy costs and \nwork to drive down the cost to consumers at the pump.\n  That is not what the Coburn amendment would do. It would not drive \ndown the cost at the pump at all. It would very likely lead to higher \nprices for consumers. It won't lead to the production of anymore \nenergy. It won't create anymore jobs. It very well could lead to less \ndomestic energy production and less employment in the U.S. energy \nsector; in other words, more unemployment and more dependence on \nforeign sources of energy.\n  At a time of $4 gas and 9.1 percent unemployment, why would we in \nthis body consider an amendment that will increase the cost of energy \nproduction, reduce domestic energy supply, and lead to job losses?\n  Ethanol is reducing prices at the pump. A recent study by the Center \nfor Agriculture and Rural Development found that ethanol is reducing \nthe price at the pump by an average of 89 cents a gallon.\n  The fact is, this amendment is not about reducing prices at the pump. \nThe amendment before us is not about reducing our dependence on foreign \noil. This amendment is about raising taxes. And one thing is for \ncertain: If you raise taxes on any activity, you get less of it. That \nis a common economic principle.\n  A taxpayer watchdog group considers a repeal of this tax incentive to \nbe what it is, a tax hike. Americans for Tax Reform said, ``Repealing \nthe ethanol credit is a corporate income tax increase.'' I agree.\n  Now is not the time to impose a gas tax hike on the American people. \nNow is not the time to send pink slips to ethanol-related jobs.\n  I know we all agree that we cannot and should not allow job-killing \ntax hikes during this time of economic uncertainty. What this Congress \nshould be doing is increasing the domestic production of energy as a \nway to increase jobs, increase domestic investment, and lower prices at \nthe pump. This amendment does none of those things, and actually it \ndoes exactly the opposite. A repeal of the ethanol tax incentive is a \ntax increase that will surely be passed on to the American consumers. \nRepealing incentives for ethanol would have the same exact result as a \nrepeal of the oil and gas subsidies. We will get less domestically \nproduced energy. It will cost U.S. jobs. It will increase our \ndependence upon foreign oil. It will increase prices at the pump for \nthe American consumer.\n  So why do my colleagues want to increase our foreign energy \nindependence when we can produce it right here at home? I wish to ask \nmy colleagues who voted against repealing the oil and gas subsidies but \nsupport repealing incentives on renewable fuels, why the inconsistency?\n  Interestingly, the same oil and gas association that is lobbying for \nrepeal of the ethanol incentive led the charge against raising taxes on \nthe oil and gas industry. The president of the National Petrochemical \nand Refiners Association stated:\n\n       Targeting a specific industry or even a segment of that \n     industry is what we would consider punitive and unfair tax \n     policy, and it is not going to get us increased energy \n     security, increased employment and certainly not going to \n     lower the price of gasoline.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from the president of the National \nPetrochemical and Refiners Association.\n  The fact is, it is intellectually inconsistent to say that increasing \ntaxes on ethanol is justified but that it is irresponsible to do so on \noil and gas production. If tax incentives lead to more domestic energy \nproduction and to good-paying jobs, why are only incentives for oil and \ngas important? It is even more ridiculous to claim that the 30-year-old \nethanol industry is mature but the oil and gas industry, now over 100 \nyears old, is not. Regardless, I don't think we should be raising taxes \non any type of energy production or on any individual, particularly \nwhen we have a very weak economy. This amendment is a tax increase.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma also insists that because the renewable \nfuel is required to be used, it does not need an incentive. But with \noil prices at $100 a barrel, oil companies are doing everything they \ncan to extract more oil from the ground. There is not a mandate to use \noil but oil already has a 100-year-old monopoly on our transportation \ninfrastructure. They want to maintain as much of that 100-year-old \nmonopoly as they can right now. Right now, because 10 percent of the \nenergy used in cars is ethanol, they may only have a 90-percent \nmonopoly, but they sure have a lot to say about what goes into your gas \ntank without competition.\n  When there is little competition to oil and it is enormously \nprofitable, wouldn't that industry argue that the necessary incentives \nexist to produce it without additional taxpayer support? Oil \nessentially has a mandate today, and the economics of oil production \nare clearly in favor of producers.\n  It is still unclear to me why we are having this debate on this bill. \nThis is not an energy bill. It is not a tax bill. Its prospects in the \nSenate are uncertain. Maybe most important, if this amendment were \nattached to this bill, the entire bill would be blue-slipped by the \nHouse because revenue bills under our Constitution must originate in \nthe House of Representatives, and this is not a House revenue bill we \nare working on.\n  If we send it to the other body with this amendment, they will send \nit right back to us. It will be dead on arrival in the other body. So \nwhy are we having this debate on this bill? We should be debating this \namendment in the context of a comprehensive energy plan. This debate \nshould include a review of the subsidies for all energy production, not \njust for one of many renewable resources.\n  I could ask: Why are we talking about this subsidy on ethanol when we \nare not talking about the subsidies on oil? Why should we be talking \nabout this subsidy on one alternative energy, which is ethanol, but not \ntalking about the subsidies for wind and solar and biomass and \ngeothermal and I suppose a dozen other alternative energy sources that \nwe have? It boils down to the fact that we should not be singling out \nethanol. Nearly every type of energy gets some sort of market-\ndistorting subsidy from the Federal Government. I have indicated that \nat least for 95 years on one oil subsidy.\n  An honest energy debate should include ethanol, oil, natural gas, \nnuclear, hydropower, wind, solar, biomass, and probably a lot of others \nthat do not come to my mind at this particular time. In December, 2010, \nCongress enacted a 1-year extension of the volumetric ethanol excise \ntax credit--that, for short, goes by the acronym VEETC--but this is \nalso known as the blenders' credit.\n  This 1-year extension has allowed Congress and the domestic biofuels \nindustry to determine the best path forward for Federal support of \nbiofuels.\n  As a result of these discussions, Senator Conrad and I introduced \nbipartisan legislation on May 4 that is a serious, responsible first \nstep to reducing and redirecting Federal tax incentives for ethanol. \nOur bill will reduce VEETC to a fixed rate of 20 cents in 2012, and 15 \ncents in 2013. It will then convert to a variable tax incentive for the \nremaining 3 years based upon the price of crude oil. When crude oil is \nmore than $90 a barrel, there will be no blenders credit. When crude \noil is $50 a barrel or\n\n[[Page S3721]]\n\nless, the blenders credit would be 30 cents. The rate will vary when \nthe price of crude is between $50 and $90 a barrel.\n  When oil prices are high, a natural incentive should exist in the \nmarket to drive ethanol use. The bill also would extend through the \nyear 2016 the alternative fuel refueling property credit, the \ncellulosic producers tax credit, and the special depreciation allowance \nfor cellulosic biofuel plant property.\n  Today, Senator Thune and Senator Klobuchar are introducing another \nbipartisan bill to immediately reduce and reform the ethanol tax \nincentive. It includes many of the same features as the bill I \nintroduced last month, but it enacts the reforms this year. The \napproach of Senator Thune also leads to significant deficit reduction.\n  The legislation we have introduced is a responsible approach that \nwill reduce the existing blenders credit and put those valuable \nresources into investing in alternative fuel infrastructure, including \nalternative fuel pumps.\n  It would responsibly and predictably reduce the existing tax \nincentive and help get alternative fuel infrastructure in place so \nconsumers can decide at the pump which fuel they would prefer. I know \nthat when the American consumers have their choice, they will choose \ndomestic, clean, affordable renewable fuel. They will choose fuel from \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers rather than from oil sheiks and foreign \ndictators. Both of the ethanol reform bills I mentioned are supported \nby the ethanol advocacy groups. In an almost unprecedented move, the \nethanol industry is advocating for a reduction in their Federal \nincentives. No other energy industry, whether it is fossil fuels or \nrenewables, has come to the table to reduce their subsidies. No other \nenergy advocate has come to me with a plan to reduce their Federal \nsupport.\n  In conclusion, I would like to address two points that ethanol \nopponents continue to make, despite facts to the contrary. First, \nethanol and ethanol incentives are not a major factor in rising food \nand corn prices. The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, \nrecently stated:\n\n       During the great run-up in food and commodity prices in \n     2007 and 2008, biofuel production played only a minor role, \n     accounting for about 10 percent of the total increase in \n     global prices.\n\n  But going back to that time or even more recently, listening to the \nbig food manufacturers that are part of this coalition attacking \nethanol, you would think the entire blame for the increase in the price \nof food is because of ethanol, even though ethanol consumes only 3 \npercent of the coarse grain produced in the entire world. A recent \nreport by the Center for Agriculture and Rural Development concluded \nthat only 8 percent of the increase in corn prices from 2006 to 2009 \nwas due to ethanol subsidies. Further, they concluded that because of \nthis small impact, it \n``. . . necessarily implies that the contribution of ethanol subsidies \nto food inflation is largely imperceptible in the United States.''\n  Second, ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions significantly \ncompared to gasoline. The fact is, under the renewable fuels standard \ncreated in 2007, corn ethanol was required to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions compared to gasoline by at least 20 percent. The fact is, \ncorn ethanol exceeded that threshold. If you remove EPA's use of the \nmurky science surrounding emissions from indirect land use changes, \nethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 48 percent compared to \ngasoline.\n  A recent peer-review study published in the Yale Journal of \nIndustrial Ecology found that ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions \nby up to 59 percent compared to gasoline. Ethanol currently accounts \nfor 10 percent of our gasoline fuel pool. A study found that the \nethanol industry contributed $8.4 billion to the Federal Treasury in \n2009. That happens to be $3.4 billion more than the ethanol incentive. \nToday, the industry supports 400,000 U.S. jobs. That is why I support \nhomegrown, renewable, reliable biofuels.\n  I would rather our Nation be dependent upon renewable fuel producers \nacross this country rather than relying on Middle Eastern oil sheiks or \nHugo Chavez in Venezuela. None of those people like us, and some of \nthem are using our own money to train terrorists to kill us. Instead, I \nwould prefer we support our renewable fuel producers based right here \nin the continental United States. I would prefer we decrease our \ndependence on Hugo Chavez and not increase it. I certainly don't \nsupport raising the tax on gasoline during a weak economy.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote no on the motion to invoke cloture \non the Coburn amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                        Steptoe & Johnson LLP,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 2011.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell: On behalf of our client, \n     the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America, \n     SIGMA, I write to urge you to oppose efforts in Congress to \n     prematurely or abruptly eliminate the Volumetric Ethanol \n     Excise Tax Credit or VEETC. Increasing the tax paid on \n     ethanol blended gasoline makes no sense at a time when \n     consumer fuel prices are already high and the need to \n     maximize domestic energy sources is so critical.\n       As the national trade association representing America's \n     independent fuel marketers and chain retailers, SIGMA \n     represents an important and innovative part of the America's \n     fuel marketing industry. SIGMA's approximately 270 corporate \n     members command some 37 percent of the petroleum retail \n     market, selling 64 billion gallons of motor fuel each year. \n     For more than 50 years, SIGMA has supported the nation's fuel \n     marketers by encouraging policies that promote growth, \n     innovation, and fairness in the industry, and competition in \n     the marketplace to help keep consumer fuel costs down.\n       As the leading marketers of ethanol-blended fuel at the \n     retail level, SIGMA's members and customers are the \n     beneficiaries of VEETC. This incentive has been an extremely \n     useful tool in helping the nation's fuel marketers and chain \n     retailers deliver fuels to the market at a competitive price. \n     By providing long term price competitiveness for ethanol \n     blended fuels, VEETC also helps provide assurances to \n     marketers and retailers that important infrastructure \n     investments necessary to deliver these fuels will continue to \n     provide returns, and not result in wasted improvements.\n       Simply put, SIGMA opposes recent moves to prematurely or \n     abruptly end the subsidies without any consideration for \n     future fuel and fuel-delivery costs. To end this incentive \n     immediately would no doubt result in an immediate spike in \n     consumers' fuel costs. SIGMA believes that a policy that \n     provides an effective transition for the industry from the \n     current tax structure, is a better alternative to the slash \n     and cut budget strategy being promoted by some Members of \n     Congress.\n       I thank you in advance for your support in this regard. If \n     you have any questions or wish to discuss this matter \n     further, please feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              R. Timothy Columbus,\n           General Counsel to the Society of Independent Gasoline \n                                             Marketers of America.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, to the millions of Americans who are \nstruggling to find jobs or make ends meet, this is simply stating the \nobvious, but I rise, a decade after we were told the Bush tax cuts for \nthe wealthy would stimulate the economy and create jobs, to say they \nhave done neither. A decade of the Bush tax cuts have proven what we \nknew from the beginning; that they disproportionately benefited the \nwealthy, shifted wealth, did nothing for the middle class, and nothing \ntrickled down.\n  The tax cuts exploded the debt and continue to be an economic burden \nthat has been twisted into a Republican mantra, an ironic rallying cry \nfor what clearly is a failed economic policy. Yet adherence to the tax \ncuts for the wealthy is a Republican political litmus test, no matter \nhow clear the evidence is that they have failed to deliver on the \npromise.\n\n[[Page S3722]]\n\n  We again hear our colleagues on the other side of the aisle pursuing \ntheir ``my way or the highway'' approach to legislating. This time they \nare protecting these failed tax policies in the current debt limit \nnegotiations, and they are putting tax cuts for millionaires ahead of \npoor seniors in nursing homes.\n  These are the very same tax cuts for millionaires that helped get us \ninto this fiscal mess, and they should most certainly be on the table \nto help us get out. It is like my Republican colleagues have thrown a \nlavish dinner party for the past decade and now they want us to pick up \nthe check. What we are saying is: Let's go dutch and share the tab.\n  Ten years later, it is abundantly clear that tax cuts for the wealthy \nare nothing more than an ideological and political pivot point, not a \nsustainable economic policy. Our Republican colleagues use this failed \nnotion as a one-size-fits-all for political sleight of hand for all \neconomic circumstances: tax cuts in bad times, tax cuts in good times, \ntax cuts in all types of economic circumstances. That is not policy, it \nis a convenient bumper sticker slogan.\n  Our Republican friends on the other side come to the floor prepared \nto end Medicare as we know it. They come to the floor prepared to slash \ngovernment to the bone. But they are unwilling to even entertain \nrevisiting this failed economic policy, unwilling to consider adding a \nsingle penny to the revenue side of the equation by limiting this blind \ngiveaway to those who need it the least. They will not entertain asking \nthe wealthiest to be part of the solution for America, and I believe if \nasked, they would be. They would not put tax cuts on the table but have \nmade ending Medicare, as we know it, the centerpiece. They told us from \nthe beginning that wealth will trickle down, tax cuts will lift all \nboats, those who get the benefit of the cuts will do what is right for \nAmerica and its people and create American jobs for American families. \nWell, the facts do not suggest such an altruistic outcome. Tax cuts for \nthe wealthy have turned out to be the greatest failed jobs program in \nAmerican history. All of the grand promises aside, all of the rhetoric \nabout job growth and economic stimulus, all of that lofty rhetoric \naside, just 3 years after the Bush tax cuts in June of 2004, we lost \nalmost 1 million jobs, more than 300,000 jobs a year for each year of 3 \nyears.\n\n  The fact is this economic policy did not stimulate job growth at \nhome, but it did create job transfers abroad. Factories closed, jobs \nwent overseas, services were outsourced. The rich got richer and tax \ncuts produced no jobs in America for 3 years. None. In April of 2003, \nalmost 2 years after the tax cuts were passed, President Bush stood \nbefore the American people and said:\n\n       These tax reductions will bring real and immediate benefits \n     to middle income Americans. By speeding up the income tax \n     cuts, we will speed up economic recovery and the pace of job \n     creation.\n\n  He called the tax cuts ``a victory for fairness and a vote for \neconomic growth.''\n  The fact is the Bush tax cuts coincided with the most anemic economic \nexpansion of the postwar period. It exploded the deficit and the debt \nand concentrated wealth at the top unlike any concentration of wealth \nsince the Gilded Age of the late 19th century. This, in addition to two \nwars unpaid for in Iraq and Afghanistan, a new entitlement program \npassed by Republicans unpaid for, and a marketplace that instead of \nbeing a free market was a free-for-all market created the excesses that \nbrought us to the culmination of 2008's incredible economic challenge \nto this country on the verge of a potential new depression and drove so \nmuch of the debt the Nation faces today.\n  For all the rhetoric from the right, the Bush tax cuts have been the \ngreatest failed jobs program and the most ineffective economic stimulus \neffort in our history, succeeding only in creating a new class of \nsuper-rich in America.\n  Let's talk about this shift in wealth from the last decade. As much \nas my Republican colleagues tried to twist themselves into knots and \njump through elaborate hoops to disprove the obvious, the facts are \nclear. Ten years later and the Bush tax cuts have disproportionately \nwidened the income gap to a point today where the wealthiest 1 percent \nof households in this country owns almost 40 percent of all private \nwealth in this country, more wealth than the bottom 90 percent of all \nAmericans combined. Think about it. The wealthiest 1 percent of \nhouseholds in this country owns 40 percent of all private wealth, more \nthan almost all of the rest of us combined. That is an extraordinary \nshift in wealth in the 10 years since the tax cuts were enacted that \nhas cost this Nation $2.5 trillion in revenue with about 40 percent of \nthe benefits going to households with incomes over $380,000. Yet our \nfriends on the other side say no to a single mother who sits up in the \nmiddle of the night with a sick child wondering if she can afford to \ntake that child to the doctor, praying she can afford the medicine that \nchild needs and still put food on the table, hoping she will be able to \nkeep her job and her health care plan.\n  All that wealth at the top and Republicans have said no to a young \nstudent who needs a Pell grant so he or she can get the education they \nneed to succeed. All that wealth at the top and Republicans have said \nno to a mom-and-pop grocery store owner who cannot get the capital they \nneed to make repairs or expand. Our friends on the other side have \nlooked into the eyes of that mother, that student, that store owner and \nsaid, no; no to health care, no to education, no to small business \ncapital. They even said no to extending unemployment benefits, but \nasking the wealthy to pay their fair share is off the table. The one \nthing they have said yes to is ending Medicare as we know it and \nleaving seniors to fend for themselves.\n  I have been visiting senior centers in my home State of New Jersey. I \njust came from, earlier today, to hear thoughts on the current budget \ndiscussions of Medicare. A typical 65-year-old at these meetings under \nthe Republican budget proposal would pay an additional $7,000 by the \nyear 2022. Right now over 140,000 seniors in New Jersey are paying more \nfor their medications because they fall into that doughnut hole.\n  Under the Republican plan, those New Jersey seniors will pay an \nadditional $80 million for prescription drugs next year, and by 2020 \nseniors currently in the doughnut hole will pay an additional $1.6 \nbillion. Nationwide nearly 4 million seniors will pay $2.2 billion more \nfor prescription drugs in 2012 alone under the Republican plan, a plan \nthat would end Medicare and would also force at least 1 million seniors \nto pay over $110 million more for annual wellness visits in 2012. Then \nturning to Medicaid, looking to turn that into a block grant program, \nthe Republican plan could cost America more than 2 million private \nsector jobs over the next 5 years and threaten our economic recovery.\n  That is not all. Nationwide the Republican plan could cut more than \n$503 billion in Medicaid funding for seniors, for the disabled, \nincluding lifesaving nursing home care, leaving us with the \nuncomfortable and unanswerable question I pose to my Republican \nfriends: What will those fellow Americans do? Where will they go? What \nhappens to them under the Republican budget plan? These are people, not \nbudget numbers. What happens to them?\n  Something is wrong with that picture of America. It is not the \nAmerica I know. Something is fundamentally wrong when we let seniors \nfend for themselves and enact policies that lead to inequalities in \nincome and wealth that are the most skewed since the Gilded Age and the \nGreat Depression. How many years are we going to buy into the failed \nnegotiation of trickle-down voodoo economics that reward the winners \nand leave the middle class behind?\n  We all know we need to cut wasteful spending, we all know we need to \nbalance the budget, and we have done it before. It wasn't that long ago \nthat, in fact, during another Democratic administration we had budget \nsurpluses as far out as the eye could see. How quickly we forget the \nday Bill Clinton left office he handed the incoming President a $236 \nbillion surplus with a projected surplus of $5.6 trillion over the next \n10 years. When President Bush left office, he turned a $236 billion \nsurplus into a $1.3 trillion budget deficit with projected shortfalls \nof over $8 trillion over the next decade and handed the new President, \nPresident Obama, an economy headed off the cliff.\n\n[[Page S3723]]\n\n  Now our Republican colleagues want to go back to the same failed \npolicies. They want to give more tax cuts to millionaires and \nbillionaires, continue subsidies to Big Oil while they end Medicare as \nwe know it and gut Pell grants and all that they mean to our economic \nfuture. They insist on tax cuts that will cost $700 billion on the \nrevenue side over the next 10 years and trillions more by slashing tax \nrates for the wealthy and the powerful.\n  Those making more than $1 million a year will see a windfall of \n$125,000 each from the tax cuts and tens of thousands of dollars more \nfor proposed tax rate cuts while people in my home State lose $34 \nbillion in health benefits and 400,000 New Jerseyans end up without \nhealth coverage at all. They want to shift the balance to millionaires \nand billionaires while making Draconian cuts to health care benefits \nfor seniors.\n  Cuts do not reflect our value as a people or as a nation. Even a \nmajority of tea partiers think it is a bad idea according to recent \npolls. I am reminded that our distinguished Republican colleagues are \nsymbolized in their party by an elephant, a large animal that never \nforgets. Our Republican colleagues have forgotten what Vice President \nCheney told America on national television as he was waging two wars, \nboth unpaid for. He said, ``Deficits don't matter.'' Vice President \nCheney: ``Deficits don't matter.''\n  Well, Republicans have apparently forgotten President Bush's own \nwords on April 16, 2001, about the benefits of favoring the wealthiest \nAmericans:\n\n       Tax relief will create new jobs. Tax relief will generate \n     new wealth, and tax relief will open new opportunities.\n\n  He was right about one thing; it created new wealth and new \nopportunities--all of them at the top. But show me the jobs. Show me \nthe new opportunities for middle-class families. Show me what it did to \nkeep our economy on track and protect hard-working families from losing \ntheir homes in mortgage schemes and hedge fund gambles that stole the \nwealth of middle-class families taking us to the brink of economic \nruin.\n  Let's look at the simple facts about the Bush tax cuts 10 years \nlater. The top one-tenth of 1 percent of American wage earners, those \nearning more than $3 million a year, received an average tax cut of \n$520,000 each--far more than most American families dream of making--a \ntax cut more than 450 times larger than the meager tax cut of an \naverage middle-class wage earner. Those earning over $3 million \nbenefited from lower tax rates on capital gains; lower tax rates on \ndividends, and lower marginal rates for the top two tax brackets.\n  From 2002 to 2007, the top 1 percent of American wage earners enjoyed \n65 percent of the total income gains during that 5-year period. In \nthose 5 years nothing trickled down. In fact, real hourly earnings fell \nby almost 2 percent for men in the bottom 10 percent of wage earners. \nIt fell one-half of 1 percent for men in the middle of the 50th \npercentile but increased almost 3 percent for men in the top 10 \npercent. Nothing trickled down.\n  If the Bush tax cuts were designed as a stimulus, they failed again. \nMoody's has said making the cuts permanent would generate only 35 cents \nin economic activity per dollar they cost.\n  Under the American Recovery Act, the payback would be $1.17 for every \ndollar of the Making Work Pay credit and $1.38 for the child tax \ncredit. Clearly, the stimulus effect of the Bush cuts was not a \nstimulus at all. As far as the debt is concerned, from 2001 to 2010 the \ncuts added $2.6 trillion to the debt, 50 percent of the total accrued \nduring that 10-year period. The fact is the Bush cuts averaged out to \nlower revenue levels as a share of the economy than any previous decade \nsince the 1950s, even as we have America's sons and daughters in two \nwars waging abroad, unpaid for. The extension of the cuts in the \nDecember tax bill is projected to decrease revenues by $432 billion, \nfrom 2012 to 2021, making the total costs more than $5 trillion over \nthe next decade. Yet Republicans will not put any of that $5 trillion \non the table, not even the tax cuts for millionaires, but they will \nhappily end Medicare as we know it and kick poor seniors out of their \nnursing homes. This is something we cannot let happen.\n  So, Mr. President, as I have said before on the floor of the Senate, \nin their ideological haze they seem to have lost sight of the real \npeople whose lives would be affected by the choices we make. The \nRepublican vision of America is about the bottom line. It seems to me \nthey failed to realize that budgets are not just about numbers, budgets \nare about people, their hopes, their dreams, their expectations for a \nbetter life for themselves and their children. They are about the \npromise of this country and the dream we have come to expect, the \nvision we have of safe, clean, vibrant communities in which to raise \nour families.\n  Budgets are a reflection of our values, not a faceless calculation of \npluses and minuses just to reach an arbitrary number regardless of the \nimpact on middle-class families looking to get back to work and pay the \nbills. All of us have a budget. Maybe it is not a formal budget, but we \nall have one. On the revenue side we have what we earn from gainful \nemployment, investments, interest on savings. On the flip side we have \nour expenses, mortgage payments, groceries, utilities, and we have our \ncontributions perhaps to our church or synagogue or donations to a \nfavorite charity or a worthy cause. These are expressions of our \npersonal values, just as the Nation's budget is an expression of its \ncollective values.\n  We may not always think of the budget in those terms, but we should. \nIt is about our values. The Bush tax cuts enacted a decade ago are \nantithetical to the values that we as a people and nation have. Middle-\nclass families and seniors should not be left to pay the tab for a \ndecade of lavish tax cuts that did nothing but make millionaires \nricher. Those tax breaks helped us to get into this mess, and they \ncertainly should be on the table to help us get out of it. If we do \nthat, then we have the wherewithal to do what we did once again under \nPresident Clinton: Balance the budget for the first time in a \ngeneration, create record surpluses, low unemployment, low interest \nrates, low inflation, and the greatest peacetime economy in over a \ngeneration. Those are the choices before the Senate and the country, \nand I hope we can get our colleagues to understand the right choice on \nbehalf of the Nation's progress and prosperity.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/13/senate-section/article/S3723-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3723-S3724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COBURN AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to the amendment offered by my colleague from Oklahoma which \nwe will be voting on tomorrow. Before I talk about the substance of the \namendment, I wish to comment on the procedure through which it was \noffered. There was no warning to Senate leadership or to any of our \ncolleagues. And while technically it wasn't in violation of Senate \nrules, it undermines the basic comity that makes this body work. It is \na disservice to do business this way--to our colleagues, to \nbipartisanship, and to the American people who sent us in Washington to \nget work done by working together. So I am disappointed in the way this \nwas handled.\n  Now let me talk about the amendment itself. Today, families in \nMinnesota and around the country are paying painfully high prices at \nthe pump as oil still hovers around $100 a barrel. What this amendment \ndoes is cut the legs out from under the most viable alternative to \nforeign oil we have. Despite decade after decade of rhetoric about \nweaning our country off foreign oil, we are still dependent on it. And \nwhile about a third of our oil imports comes from Canada and Mexico, \nclose to half come from the Persian Gulf, Africa, or Venezuela.\n  Last year at this time we were dealing with the gulf oilspill, the \nworst environmental catastrophe we have ever had. That was maybe the \nmost jarring reminder of what has been clear for decades--that we have \nto kick our addiction to oil. While that is not something we can do \novernight, we need to do everything in our power to transition to \nalternatives.\n  There is no more viable alternative than biofuels. Today, the \nindustry that has been most successful in displacing oil is under \nattack. We are talking about an industry using homegrown American \nresources, an industry that has created thousands of jobs and catalyzed \neconomic development across\n\n[[Page S3724]]\n\nrural America. The first generation of biofuels has paved the way for \nthe next generation of advanced biofuels. The first commercial-scale \ncellulosic ethanol plant is being built this year in Emmetsburg, IA, \nwhere it will be making ethanol from corncobs.\n  According to a recent study done by the researchers at Iowa State \nUniversity and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the growth in \nethanol production reduced wholesale gas prices by an average of 89 \ncents per gallon in 2010. In the Midwest, that number was higher: $1.37 \nper gallon. Let me repeat that. At a time when so many American \nfamilies are struggling to pay their bills and make ends meet, they \nwould have paid an average of 89 cents more per gallon of gas last year \nhad we not had ethanol.\n  But instead of giving this industry the tools it needs to grow and \nreduce our oil dependence even more, this amendment hangs the ethanol \nindustry out to dry. It makes no sense.\n  I share the concern of my colleague from Oklahoma about the deficit \nand our national debt. To cut our deficit, everyone in America will \nhave to make some sacrifices, and that includes the ethanol industry. \nThe easy part here is that the ethanol industry agrees. Ethanol \nproducers stand ready to phase out the ethanol blenders credit. But we \nneed to be consistent. If the ethanol industry is being asked to make \nsome sacrifices, other fuel industries need to be willing to do the \nsame. Yet, just a month ago, many of my colleagues, including my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, voted against repealing billions of dollars in \nsubsidies we pay every year to the biggest five oil companies. We are \ntalking about companies that have made almost $1 trillion in profit \nover the last decade. My colleagues chose to leave those tax breaks in \nplace, amounting to 21 billion in taxpayer dollars to oil companies \nover the next 10 years. Expert after expert has basically concluded \nthese subsidies are not lowering the cost of gas and would not cause it \nto increase if they were eliminated. But we do not need experts to tell \nus that. Subsidies for oil and gas are on the books right now, and some \nhave been on the books since as far back as 1916, but they have done \nnothing to stem the skyrocketing gas prices that are squeezing the \nbudgets of American families. Yet when we are talking about ethanol--a \nhomegrown alternative to foreign oil that lowers prices at the pump--my \ncolleagues seem to think it is absolutely imperative to repeal this tax \ncredit now.\n  When it is repealing subsidies for oil and gas companies operating in \noil-producing States such as Oklahoma, that somehow is a tax hike. But \ncutting a tax credit that supports an American renewable fuel, that is \n``fiscal responsibility.'' The hypocrisy here is stunning.\n  Regardless, America's ethanol producers are ready and willing to \nphase out this credit. But there is a right way and a wrong way to do \nit. The Coburn amendment, which abruptly ends the credit at the end of \nthis month, is the wrong way. The right way is to responsibly phase out \nthe tax credit in a manner that allows the industry to build out the \ninfrastructure it needs to bring advanced biofuels into the U.S. \nmarket.\n  Today my colleagues and I are introducing legislation that does it \nthe right way, and I urge every Member of this body to support it. \nRight now, our biofuels industry is hitting a wall because of the \nnational 10-percent ethanol blend limit we have had on the books. It \nalso is hamstrung by the inability of most cars and gas pumps to use \nblends higher than 10 percent ethanol. That means cellulosic ethanol \nand other advanced biofuels have no market access or market to grow \ninto. This isn't an industry problem, it is a public policy problem.\n  The EPA's E15 waiver was a step in the right direction to address \nthis very problem. But without pumps that can deliver higher ethanol \nblends, American consumers have no way to access additional ethanol \nthat would and should be on the market. What our legislation does is \nreform our ethanol tax policy by ending the ethanol tax credit in its \ncurrent form at the end of the month. It then invests part of the \nsavings into biofuels infrastructure, part toward extending the \ncellulosic ethanol credit, and puts $1 billion toward reducing our \ndeficit.\n  Reducing America's dependence on oil is going to require a national \nstrategy, and biofuels are just one part of that strategy. We also need \nto do things such as deploy more electric vehicles and make our entire \neconomy more energy efficient. We have to recognize that if we don't \nfix our national policies to allow the biofuels industry to grow, we \nare actively choosing foreign oil and dirty fossil fuels over domestic, \nhomegrown, renewable fuels.\n  Let me tell my colleagues something: We are never going to see a \nmassive ethanol spill in the Gulf of Mexico that kills 11 workers, \ndestroys thousands and thousands of livelihoods, and does irreparable \nharm to vital ecosystems. We are never going to see foreign countries \ncollude to restrict the supply of ethanol and drive up gas prices for \nAmerican families. As we transition to advanced biofuels and expand \nthis industry, we are not going to see these jobs go overseas. This is \nan American industry, it is American jobs, and it is American energy \nindependence. I urge my colleagues to make the responsible choice--one \nthat will keep this industry moving forward.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Mr. President, I had a good time this afternoon listening \nto the debate on the amendment I have offered and visiting with \nSenators. I think there is an important distinction that needs to be \nmade in the arguments that have been brought forward.\n  The first is we have a mandated level of ethanol that has to be \nproduced and blended into gasoline, and it grows from now on. There \nwill be zero job losses if this amendment is approved.\n  The second thing is, my colleague--and I love him to death--from \nSouth Dakota says we are going to save $1 billion. We can save $3 \nbillion if we eliminate the VEETC blending subsidy.\n  Now, why should we do that? Here is a subsidy that goes to all the \nblenders of gasoline in the United States--all of them--and they all \nhave called and written and said: We do not want the $3 billion for the \nrest of the year. We do not want it.\n  We actually have a letter from the National Petrochemical and \nRefiners Association, which they are all members of, saying: We do not \nwant this money. So the best way to get money against the deficit is to \nnot give money to people who do not want it on something that is \nalready mandated anyway.\n  I spent a great deal of time listening to my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley, and his figures were very good. But they were only up \nthrough 2008.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 40 percent of last \nyear's corn crop was utilized, converted to ethanol. Why would the \nAmerican Bakers Association, the American Frozen Food Institute, the \nAmerican Meat Institute, California Dairies, the Grocery Manufacturers \nAssociation, the International Dairy Foods Association, the Milk \nProducers Council, the National Chicken Council, the National Council \nof Chain Restaurants, the National Meat Association, the National \nRestaurant Association, the National Turkey Federation, the National \nWildlife Federation--which is just about one-third of the people who \nare endorsing this--why would they be for this?\n  Because it is not just less than 3 percent of the cost of food, it \nhas been, this last year, the significant driver. Corn prices are at \n$7.65 a bushel. They are 2\\1/2\\ times what they were 3\\1/2\\ years ago. \nAnd I am not against the farmers. I am for ethanol. I do not want to do \naway with ethanol blending. I do not want to do away with ethanol as a \nsubstitute. But we have a way to get the same amount of ethanol \nproduced and put into our cars without spending $3 billion between now \nand the end of the year--$5.8 billion is what it has averaged over the \nlast few years.\n  We spent $34 billion of money we didn't have subsidizing something \nthat\n\n[[Page S3725]]\n\nis mandated. I mean, it even goes beyond the Reagan quote, which was \nthat the government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few \nshort phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. If \nit stops moving, subsidize it.\n  We have the incentive to blend the ethanol, and that incentive is you \nby law have to blend it. They do not have a choice. So we are going to \nuse ethanol in this country.\n  Another factor the American people ought to take into consideration \nwhen they go buy a gallon of fuel today--you already have $1.72 worth \nof subsidy in there. That does not have anything to do with oil and gas \ndrilling; that has to do with the subsidies that go to this program for \nethanol. And I am for using cellulosic. I am actually for using corn \nethanol. I just do not think we ought to pay twice for it. I think we \nought to pay once.\n  The number the Senator from Minnesota talked about in terms of \nsubsidy, there are--I have worked on the President's commission on \ndebt. I have worked with the Gang of 6. You cannot be for changing the \nTax Code to get rid of tax expenditures and vote against this \namendment. I mean, how do you explain? Here is one we do not need the \nincentive for and we are going to pay for, and yet you say you want to \nsolve the problems of the country. But the first time we have a vote to \nreally eliminate one that will make no difference in terms of the \namount of ethanol that is produced in this country--it will just save \nus $3 billion--you can't be on both sides of that issue.\n  Let me address the oil and gas industries for a minute. They get \naccelerated depreciation and writeoff. That is true. And that amounts \nto taking legitimate business expenses and saying: You can write them \noff sooner. Why did we do that?\n  It started in 1903, by the way. That is when we started. We started \nit because it is a capital-intensive business in terms of the \nexploration. It is associated with a lot of dry holes.\n  Now, the very companies that we say we want to take some of their \n``subsidies''--there is a big difference between a subsidy that is a \ntax credit and allowing someone to advance depreciation because they \nare going to get to write it off anyhow. The net effect to the Federal \nGovernment's revenue, if you take all of those away, is still zero. The \nFederal Government does not get any additional money because under \naccounting standards they get to write off those expenses anyway; they \njust do not get to write them off fast.\n  So the body has already chosen to not do that because they are \nlegitimate business expenses. We are not saying: Take away legitimate \nbusiness expenses from the ethanol distilleries or the blenders. We are \njust saying: Do not pay them money for something that they are going to \nhave to do anyhow that they have already said to us they do not want.\n  Tomorrow during the debate, I will add to the Record the statement \nfrom the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association.\n  The other point I would make: There is no question we are not energy \nindependent, and there is no question that biofuels and cellulosic \nethanol can contribute to what our results can be in terms of \nmaintaining that independence. But we are the only Nation in the world \nwhere we as citizens own more oil and gas than Canada, China, and Saudi \nArabia combined, and our Government will not let us have it. Think \nabout that for a minute. According to the Congressional Research \nService, there is more oil, gas, and gas liquids untapped in the United \nStates than is known in all of Canada, all of China, and all of Saudi \nArabia combined. So the reason we are in trouble and importing oil is \nbecause our own government will not let us have our own resources. Why \nwould we continue that? That is a debate for another time.\n  No matter what we believe in terms of green energy, what we do know \nis that we are 30 years away from getting away from carbon-based \nfuels--at the earliest. So we can either pay a price or we can buy from \nthe Saudis or buy from other Middle Eastern countries or we can develop \nour own. Talk about jobs. The estimate is that if we would truly go \nafter our own energy, we would generate over 100,000 jobs a year the \nnext 10 years in the oil and gas industry in this country--cleanly.\n  The other comment I have heard is that this amendment was not brought \nup properly. Well, let me talk about something for a minute. When the \nSenator from South Dakota and I came to the Senate, the first 2 years \nyou could offer an amendment on anything, on any bill at any time \nbecause that is the way the Senate was intended to operate. As a \nSenator, a Member of this body, you had the right to offer an \namendment. Now, you may lose it or it may get tabled, but you had to \nright to do it. That is not a majority leader's prerogative; it is a \nprerogative of every individual Senator that you ought to cherish and \nprotect because if the majority leader is the only one who will decide \nwhat amendments get offered and when they get offered, this is no \nlonger the Senate. There is no longer an ability to offer what is in \nthe best interests of our country or our constituency.\n  The very fact that we do not want to have controversial amendments \nthat we have much disagreement on coming to the floor because we do not \nwant to have to go home and defend them or we do not want to vote on \nthem because we might lose--the Senate ought to be a free place to \noffer ideas and get them voted down.\n  In my first 2 years in the Senate, I had tons--in fact, I had every \namendment voted down. There was not an amendment I won. But I had the \nfreedom to offer the amendments. And do you know what. We passed 10 \ntimes as much legislation in that Congress than we have the last two. \nSo limiting amendments is not the prerogative of the majority leader. \nDeciding what bills come to the floor is the prerogative of the \nmajority leader.\n  If we want to go home and tell our constituents that we have voted \nagainst saving $3 billion, that we are going to borrow 40 percent of it \nfrom outside of this country because we do not like the way an \namendment was brought up--how else do you bring up an amendment if you \ncannot in the Senate?\n  Every true and proper procedure was followed in bringing up this \namendment, and had this amendment been allowed to come up, if other \nMembers had not objected to it, we would have never used cloture to \nbring up an amendment. You should not have to use cloture to bring up \nan amendment. You should be able to bring up any amendment you want and \nlet Senators have the courage to vote the way they want on it rather \nthan to say: I am going to hide behind not having to vote, so I am \ngoing to object to having a vote on an amendment.\n  Well, if we start down that process, we are never going to have any \namendments and every amendment is going to end up having 60 votes just \nto be brought up. If we are going to move to that procedure--and I know \nprocedure in this body pretty well--then I will insist that we do it \nall the time. That will dead stop the Senate.\n  So the idea that you can hide behind the excuse that even though you \nwant to save the $3 billion but you do not like the way the amendment \nwas brought up is a pretty flimsy excuse to go home and explain to your \npublic that you think we should not ever have cloture motions on \namendments. We ought to be able to bring any amendment up at any time.\n  I see the majority leader coming to the floor. He is a dear friend of \nmine. He has the hardest job in Washington, there is no question. But \nthe privilege to bring an amendment to the floor ought to be protected \nfor both sides of this aisle, and you vote it down, you table it, but \nyou do something with it.\n  Let me just finish by saying that I agree this is supposed to expire \nat the end of this year. I hope it does because we do not need it. Our \ncorn farmers do not need it. The worldwide demand for corn is high. We \nare going to continue to produce ethanol. We have a federally mandated \nrequirement that we produce ethanol. This amendment does not touch \nthat, never intended to touch that.\n  But ethanol as a fuel should be processed to the next stage, which is \nmethanol, because methanol is not water soluble and it has the same \noctane rating as gasoline. Ethanol is not a great fuel. It is not an \neconomical fuel. But we can take that same carbon atom and add to it \nand create methanol from corn and get a much better fuel that can be \ntransported much easier and\n\n[[Page S3726]]\n\nhave much greater effect on our economy and have much better gas \nmileage and less effect on the engines and drivetrains and all of the \nother--the smog prevention we have on automobiles today.\n  So let me say it again. I am not against using biocrops. I am for \nbiocrops. I am not against cellulosic-based. I am not against ethanol. \nI am not against algae. But ExxonMobil has spent a couple of billion of \ntheir own money on algae-based biofuels without the government's help, \nwhich is one of the points with this amendment. We no longer need to \nhelp. We no longer need to spend the money.\n  So I look forward to the debate tomorrow.

A bill to authorize the President to confiscate and vest \ncertain property of the Government of Libya and to authorize the use of \nthat property to provide humanitarian relief to and for the benefit of \nthe people of\n\n[[Page S3729]]\n\nLibya, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I join Senator \nShelby and other senior Senators to introduce the Libyan Assets for \nHumanitarian Relief Act of 2011, designed to explicitly authorize the \nPresident to confiscate and distribute some of the assets of Muammar \nQaddafi's government to be used to provide urgent humanitarian relief \nfor the people of Libya. This issue lies within the jurisdiction of the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs because it involves \nfrozen assets being held by U.S. banks and other financial \ninstitutions. We are joined by Chairman Kerry of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, Armed Services Committee Chairman Levin and \nRanking Minority Member John McCain, and Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs Committee Chairman Lieberman as original cosponsors \nof this measure.\n  A few weeks ago the President's senior advisors from the Treasury \nDepartment, the State Department, and the White House came to Congress \nand provided draft legislation to explicitly authorize the President to \nseize and vest the Qaddafi government's assets to be used to benefit \nthe Libyan people. This measure is an updated version of that \nlegislation, imposing certain conditions on that authority, and \nproviding for certain reporting, tracking and auditing requirements on \nthe use of the funds.\n  Currently, there are approximately $36 billion in Libyan Government \nassets in banks and other financial institutions subject to the \njurisdiction of the United States, both here and abroad. According to \nthe Treasury Department, a little over $8.1 billion is physically \npresent in the U.S.--and of that, a little over $200 million is in cash \nand available for immediate seizure and use to support humanitarian \nefforts in Libya. This measure would allow for confiscation of up to $8 \nbillion of the Qaddafi government's assets--plus an additional $2 \nbillion if necessary to avert an imminent humanitarian emergency.\n  The bill provides for the confiscation and distribution of the funds \nin two batches--the first $4 billion could be seized, vested and \ndistributed upon the bill's enactment, and a second $4 billion could be \nconfiscated and released after a 30-day notification period designed to \ngive Congress an opportunity to deny the seizure of the funds via \nenactment of a joint resolution of disapproval. The additional $2 \nbillion could be released upon certification of a humanitarian \nemergency.\n  Notwithstanding how my colleagues feel about the current military \nsituation, or U.S. involvement in Libya--and I know there is a wide \nrange of opinions in Congress on that issue, which we'll likely debate \non the Senate floor soon--one thing is clear: in the wake of continuing \nviolence perpetrated by the Libyan regime against its own people, there \nis a real, urgent and growing need for humanitarian relief and \nassistance.\n  The U.S. has already provided tens of millions of dollars of its own \nfunds in relief aid for Libya's citizens, and last week pledged \nadditional aid. This bill would simply authorize the confiscation of \ncertain assets of the Government of Libya, already frozen by the U.S. \ngovernment under existing legal authorities, to be used to provide \nadditional humanitarian relief to meet urgent needs there. It would \neffectively give the true owners of these assets--the Libyan people--\naccess to some of their own money to provide relief for Libya's \ncitizens.\n  The bill authorizes the President to seize and distribute these \nassets. I understand the Administration intends the funds to be \noverseen by the State Department, and to go mainly through non-\ngovernmental humanitarian relief and development organizations \ncurrently active in Libya; this measure ultimately allows the President \nto decide who the recipients are, with some limitations. It also \nrequires that the funds be used only for purposes related to \nhumanitarian relief, consistent with UN Security Council resolutions on \nthis matter, and imposes a set of accounting, recordkeeping and \nCongressional reporting requirements on the funds.\n  It requires that the funds not go to anyone or any organization whose \nassets are blocked under U.S. law, or those identified as terrorists or \naffiliated with terrorist organizations, or those complicit in human \nrights abuses. It also provides the President with powerful \ninvestigative and penalty authorities, to ensure appropriate \ndistribution of the funding and to combat any potential fraud in the \ndistribution of aid. The Administration has made clear that such assets \nwould be disbursed only through partners that meet U.S. legal and \npolicy standards that the United States generally applies to the \nprovision of assistance, including those relating to human rights and \ntransparent oversight of the disbursements. While these are not U.S. \ntaxpayer funds, I believe we still have a fiduciary responsibility for \nits efficient and effective distribution, and that's why we have \nimposed these important accountability measures.\n  Such seizure of another government's assets is not unprecedented. In \nthe past, the U.S. government has seized and frozen the assets of other \ngovernments with whom we were involved in a conflict, going all the way \nback to World War I. The latest example is when we seized and used a \nportion of Iraqi government assets in 2003 to provide urgent \nreconstruction assistance and other forms of support for the people of \nIraq.\n  I hope we can move quickly on this legislation to authorize the \nrelease of these funds and show that Congress and the Executive branch \nare working together on this issue and that despite our differences on \nU.S. military action there we can act promptly and decisively to \nprovide needed humanitarian assistance to the people of Libya. I urge \nmy colleagues to join us in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1180\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Libyan Assets for \n     Humanitarian Relief Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On February 26, 2011, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 1970, which imposed an asset \n     freeze on Colonel Muammar Qaddafi and members of his family.\n       (2) On March 17, 2011, the United Nations Security Council \n     adopted Resolution 1973, which expanded the asset freeze to \n     include the Central Bank of Libya, the Libyan Investment \n     Authority, the Libyan Foreign Bank, the Libyan Africa \n     Investment Portfolio, and the Libyan National Oil \n     Corporation.\n       (3) The United Nations Security Council stated in \n     Resolution 1973 that the assets frozen would ``at a later \n     stage, as soon as possible, be made available to and for the \n     benefit of the people of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya''.\n       (4) On March 3, 2011, the President of the United States \n     stated that ``Muammar Qaddafi has lost the legitimacy to \n     lead, and he must leave''.\n       (5) On March 29, 2011, the Transitional National Council of \n     the Libyan Republic issued ``A Vision of a Democratic \n     Libya'', which stated that its goal is ``building a free and \n     democratic society and ensuring the supremacy of \n     international humanitarian law and human rights \n     declarations'', and that ``[t]his can only be achieved \n     through dialogue, tolerance, co-operation, national \n     cohesiveness and the active participation of all citizens''. \n     In that statement, the Transitional National Council pledged \n     itself, without reservation, to the establishment of ``a \n     constitutional civil and free state'' that upholds \n     intellectual and political pluralism and the peaceful \n     transfer of power and guarantees full citizenship rights to \n     all Libyans.\n       (6) On April 7, 2011, Ali Aujali, the Official \n     Representative to the United States of the Transitional \n     National Council of the Libyan Republic, wrote to the United \n     States Secretary of the Treasury and requested ``immediate \n     access to some of the frozen Qaddafi regime funds to purchase \n     needed humanitarian supplies and to support critical services \n     such as hospitals, water distribution and sanitation''.\n       (7) On May 19, 2011, the President of the United States, \n     referring to the Transitional National Council of the Libyan \n     Republic, stated that ``the opposition has organized a \n     legitimate and credible interim council''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The \n     Government of Libya is defined to include Libya's Central \n     Bank.\n       Account Established for Confiscated Funds: The bill \n     requires the President to establish a U.S. government account \n     to hold confiscated funds and the proceeds from any asset or \n     property sales. The Secretary of the Treasury may hold in \n     escrow funds that are not needed immediately to meet urgent \n     humanitarian needs.\n       Use of Confiscated Funds for Humanitarian Purposes to \n     Benefit the Libyan People: Libyan Government funds \n     confiscated may only be used for humanitarian purposes to \n     benefit the Libyan people, consistent with United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions. None may be used to purchase \n     weapons or military equipment. The President must designate \n     recipients of funds and impose appropriate terms and \n     conditions, which may include detailed recordkeeping \n     requirements, on recipients. The measure prohibits the \n     knowing transfer of funds to: 1) foreign terrorist \n     organizations; 2) supporters of acts of terrorism or of \n     terrorist organizations; 3) a person whose assets are blocked \n     by the International Emergency Economics Powers Act (IEEPA); \n     or 4) a person the President determines to be responsible for \n     violations of internationally recognized human rights.\n       Framework for Confiscation of Funds: The bill authorizes an \n     initial confiscation and distribution of $4 billion; if \n     additional funds are needed, the President may notify \n     Congress of his intent to confiscate an additional $4 \n     billion, to be released within 30 days unless Congress \n     objects via enactment of a Joint Resolution of Disapproval. \n     The President's request for the additional funds must include \n     information about how prior confiscated funds were disbursed, \n     a description of the need for additional funds, a plan of how \n     the additional funds will be used, and other information. In \n     the event of a humanitarian emergency, the measure also \n     authorizes the President to notify Congress of his intent to \n     confiscate, on an expedited basis and upon certification of \n     need, an additional $2 billion to meet emergency needs.\n       Investigations and Recordkeeping: The President may conduct \n     appropriate investigations of recipients as necessary, and \n     require recordkeeping from recipients of these funds, which \n     could include books of account, records, contracts, letters, \n     memoranda, or other papers related to distributions under the \n     Act.\n       Audit and Reporting Requirements: The President must \n     provide detailed reports to Congress every 90 days describing \n     the amount of funds confiscated and transferred\n\n[[Page S3732]]\n\n     to designated recipients, the recipients of these funds, and \n     the manner in which these funds were used. If the President \n     notifies Congress of an additional confiscation in the middle \n     of a 90-day period, the President must only include any new \n     information on fund distribution. GAO is required to conduct \n     and provide to Congress periodic audits of the program.\n       Penalties: Substantial penalties apply to persons who \n     violate provisions of the Act, including huge fines provided \n     for under section 206 of IEEPA.\n       Legal Protections/Judicial Review: Decisions made with \n     respect to confiscated assets are not subject to judicial \n     review; a ``good faith'' exception is provided for those \n     acting consistent with the requirements of the Act; and any \n     funds or property confiscated under the Act are immune from \n     any legal process or attachment.\n       Termination: The authorities provided for in the bill \n     terminate once the existing emergency determination of the \n     President under IEEPA with respect to Libya expires. Upon \n     termination, the President must submit to Congress a report \n     describing a plan for use of any remaining unspent funds, \n     including return of such funds to a successor government of \n     Libya.\n       Regulations: The bill requires the President to prescribe \n     regulations as necessary under the Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 1183. A bill to establish a national mercury monitoring program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today along with Senator Carper, I am \nintroducing the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act. This \nbill would ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has \naccurate information about the extent of mercury pollution.\n  A comprehensive national mercury monitoring network is needed to \nprotect human health, safeguard fisheries, and track the impact of \nemissions reductions. By accurately quantifying regional and national \nchanges in atmospheric deposition, ecosystem contamination, and \nbioaccumulation of mercury in fish and wildlife in response to changes \nin mercury emissions, this monitoring network would help policy makers, \nscientists, and the public to better understand the sources, \nconsequences, and trends in United States mercury pollution.\n  Mercury is a potent neurotoxin of significant ecological and public \nhealth concern, especially for children and pregnant women. It is \nestimated that approximately 410,000 children born in the U.S. were \nexposed to levels of mercury in the womb that are high enough to impair \nneurological development. Mercury exposure has gone down as U.S. \nmercury emissions have declined; however, levels remain unacceptably \nhigh.\n  Each new scientific study seems to find higher levels of mercury in \nmore ecosystems and in more species than we had previously thought. For \nexample, as of 2008, every state in the country has issued mercury \nadvisories for human fish consumption. These advisories cover 57 \npercent of the Nation's total lake acreage, and 68 percent of our total \nriver miles. This is 19 percent more lake acreage and 42 percent more \nriver area than in 2006.\n  At present, scientists must rely on limited information to understand \nthe critical linkages between mercury emissions and environmental \nresponse and human health. Successful design, implementation, and \nassessment of solutions to the mercury pollution problem require \ncomprehensive long-term information--information that is currently not \navailable. We must have more comprehensive information and we must have \nit soon; otherwise, we risk making misguided policy decisions.\n  Specifically, the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act would \ndirect EPA, in conjunction with the Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. \nGeological Survey, National Park Service, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, and other appropriate Federal agencies, to \nestablish a national mercury monitoring program to measure and monitor \nmercury levels in the air and watersheds, water and soil chemistry, and \nin aquatic and terrestrial organisms at multiple sites across the \nNation.\n  The act would establish a scientific advisory committee to advise on \nthe establishment, site selection, measurement, recording protocols, \nand operations of the monitoring program; establish a centralized \ndatabase for existing and newly collected environmental mercury data \nthat can be freely accessed on the Internet; and require a report to \nCongress every 2 years on the program, including trend data, and an \nassessment of the reduction in mercury deposition rates that are \nrequired to be achieved in order to prevent adverse human and \necological effects every 4 years.\n  We must establish a comprehensive, robust national mercury monitoring \nnetwork to provide EPA the data it needs to make decisions that protect \nthe people and environment of Maine and the entire Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Johanns, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Franken, Mr. Moran, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n        Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, \n        Mr. Kirk, Mr. Coats, Mr. Durbin, and Mrs. McCaskill):\n  S. 1185. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a variable VEETC rate based on the price of crude oil, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I first wish to thank my colleague from \nMinnesota who spoke before me for his strong words. Also, I am here \nwith the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune, to speak about the \nlegislation we are introducing today, along with several other \nSenators, to find a good way to handle this--not the way it thus far \nhas been handled.\n  My colleague from Minnesota talked about Senator Coburn's amendment, \nwhich we will be voting on tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthis amendment. First of all, I believe we need to invest in homegrown \nenergy. The Coburn amendment would abruptly eliminate the VEETC--the \nVolumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit--without any kind of a glidepath \nduring this year. Consequently, the 450,000 people who are directly or \nindirectly employed in this industry--when we think about all of the \njobs we work on every single day, just because jobs are in States that \nmaybe some people don't live in, including North Dakota, South Dakota, \nMinnesota, and Iowa, these are very important jobs throughout the \ncountry.\n  The other piece of this I think we can't neglect is the effect this \nwould have on gas prices. That being said, both Senator Thune and I \nunderstand this is a situation that needs to change. We are in a \ndifficult budget situation in the Senate, and that is why we are \nintroducing legislation today and working with stakeholders and Members \nfrom both sides of the aisle to find a reasonable solution that offers \na responsible and cost-effective approach to reforming our biofuels \npolicy.\n  This bill would transition to a more sustainable model of support for \nrenewable fuel production in America instead of pulling the rug out \nfrom under an industry, with 4 days' notice, that employs hundreds of \nthousands of people in this country, as well as provides an alternative \nto oil. Senator Thune is here, and maybe he wishes to address this a \nbit. We will go back and forth.\n  But I think one thing people need to understand is that this biofuels \nindustry has become a major component of our fuel supply. One statistic \nis that the gasoline that is made from the oil we import from Canada--\npeople know Canada is our biggest trading partner for oil. We literally \nproduce as much biofuels as we produce gas from the oil we import from \nCanada, so it is a major part of our fuel supply. So we shouldn't just \ndecide with 4 days' notice to change the rules of the game. In fact, as \na recent vote showed us, oil is keeping every single cent of its \nsubsidy.\n  Senator Thune and I have a bill which basically gives away the \nsubsidies for the rest of the year that the biofuels industry has and \nputs $1 billion toward deficit reduction--$1 billion toward deficit \nreduction--as well as making some investment with the remaining money \nin the infrastructure that this industry needs to be able to compete on \nany kind of an even playing field with oil.\n  So I know Senator Thune has some thoughts on this as well, and I \nwould like to come back and talk a little bit about what has been going \non with oil versus ethanol in this country. But I think it is important \nto understand the\n\n[[Page S3733]]\n\nbill we are introducing today could be a major help with $1 billion in \ndeficit reduction.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might just say to my colleague from \nMinnesota, I appreciate her good work and advocacy on this subject. \nThis is something we have been working on for some time, along with \nsome of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, for a lot of \nreasons; one of which, of course, is because, as the Senator from \nMinnesota mentioned, these are difficult fiscal times.\n  Obviously, every area in our budget needs to be reviewed and \nscrutinized and looked at to see where we might be able to achieve some \nsavings. But, as my colleague noted, there is a right way and a wrong \nway to do this. The way that has been proposed in the amendment that \nwas offered, and on which the cloture vote will occur tomorrow, is the \nwrong way. We cannot tell an industry in December we are going to give \nthem a set of policies that are going to be in effect for the year, \nthat they are going to be able to make investment decisions, they are \ngoing to be able to go to their lenders, they are going to be able to \ngo secure financing based upon this set of policies--we do that around \nhere all the time. We make policy, and we try to do it in a way, \nhopefully, that gives those who are investing their dollars some \ncertainty about what those policies are going to be. Well, how can we \nthen, in the middle of the year, come back and say we are just going to \npull the rug right out from under them? We are sorry, that is just the \nway it is. This is gone.\n  Well, frankly, there is a much better way to go about doing this, and \nwhat the Senator from Minnesota and I have proposed does just that and, \nin my view, does this in a responsible, measured, thoughtful, \nreasonable way. We get to the same ultimate result, which is that for \nthose who are really interested in doing away with the volumetric \nethanol excise tax credit, it does phase it out, but it does it in a \nway that does not create disruption and harm and allows people to plan \nfor the future. It also invests some of those resources in areas that \nare important to the future of that industry; namely, blender pumps, \nwhich is the one thing that does not exist out there today, at least \nnot in any great numbers. If those pumps were more available, I believe \nwe would see a lot higher usage of the fuel than we already have seen. \nBut we already know it is 10 percent of our fuel supply.\n  Whether the opponents of this like it or not--and I know they do \nnot--there are 13 billion gallons of ethanol produced in this country. \nAt least that is what it was in 2010. We assume it will be that number, \nmaybe a little higher, this year. That displaces 445 million barrels of \nimported crude oil. That is 55 million barrels more than the total \ncrude oil imports from Saudi Arabia last year.\n  Now, think about that: a fuel that is produced from a kernel of corn \nnow displaces more than the entire imports of Saudi foreign oil into \nthis country. That is what we ought to be looking at. We ought to be \nlooking at more ways to produce domestic energy, home-grown energy, \nadding that to our fuel supply rather than taking it out.\n  What the amendment our colleagues are trying to get a vote on \ntomorrow would do is basically to say to this industry: Yes, we are \ngoing to take away this particular tax incentive, and we are going to \ndo it right in the middle of the year. We are going to do it, and we do \nnot like this industry--which is probably what animates a lot of the \nopposition to this because if people look at the facts, if they look at \nthe contribution that biofuels have made to our fuel supply in this \ncountry, it is significant.\n  Ten percent of our entire fuel now is biofuels. In fact, if we look \nat the other byproduct of biofuels--once we take the starch out of that \nkernel of corn and convert it into liquid form, we can get, for every \nbushel of corn, almost 3 gallons of ethanol. But we also get dry \ndistillers grain, which is something that has been used extensively now \nfor feed for livestock.\n  So if we take 5 billion bushels of corn, for example, that are used \nfor ethanol production in any given year, the feed product equivalent \nis about 1.7 billion bushels of corn that is returned to the livestock \nfood chain as this ethanol byproduct called dry distillers grain. So we \nare adding additional protein that is fed to livestock in addition to \nthe almost 3 gallons of ethanol we get from every single bushel of \ncorn.\n  So I do believe there is an approach that makes sense. What the \nSenator from Minnesota and I and many of our colleagues on both sides \nhave come together around is a way in which we can move forward, and do \nit in a way that not only makes it reasonable for the industry to plan \nfor the future but also in a way that returns dollars to the Treasury \nof this country because there is $1 billion in here for debt \nretirement. I think that is something the industry recognizes, we all \nrecognize, and we need to address. It is addressed as part of this \nbill.\n  So I appreciate the good work of the Senator from Minnesota in \nworking with me, along with other colleagues of ours, to introduce the \nbill we introduce today.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, if I may continue, I thank Senator \nThune for his work.\n  One point I think he made that is incredibly important: I think not \nall of our colleagues understand that the way it is under the current \nrules is VEETC, which has been in place to make sure we have an \nalternative to oil in this country, ends at the end of this year. The \none piece of it that continues for another year is the cellulosic \nresearch, the cellulosic credit. But the rest of it ends at the end of \nthis year.\n  So instead of looking at a glidepath, as suggested in our bill, where \nwe could take $1 billion and put it into deficit reduction, and take \nanother $1 billion or so--which would be going right now as a credit--\nand put that into the infrastructure, the alternative that is suggested \nby the amendment offered by our colleague from Oklahoma is just to cut \nit off today, basically, with a few days' notice.\n  What I have heard time and time again from businesses--whether it is \nin the energy area or in the medical device area--is they want \ncertainty. They do not want Washington just coming in with one day's \nnotice and changing things. That is why I ask my colleagues to look at \nthis bill as an alternative. We are glad to discuss details with them.\n  One of the things we have tried to do with this bill is to \nacknowledge the emerging field of cellulosic with algae and other forms \nof research into biofuels. That would continue into next year. But, \nbasically, the proposal Senator Thune and I have put forward would end \nVEETC as we know it.\n  We look at the comparisons here. Over the last few decades more than \n$360 billion worth of subsidies have gone to the oil companies. That is \nnearly 10 times greater than the investments we have made in home-grown \nbiofuels. Now they are set up in a different way, but those are the \nnumbers. We have to remember the jobs with biofuels are jobs that are \nmade in America. We are basically investing in the farmers and the \nworkers of the Midwest instead of the oil cartels in the Mideast.\n  I have seen the boom in oil drilling in North Dakota. That has been a \ngood thing. So I am not just a one-size fuel person. But I think to \ndisrupt an industry like this, with no notice, is the wrong way to go. \nI hope our colleagues will look at our bill seriously, talk to us about \nthis, think about the gas prices which have now topped $3.75 per \ngallon. While they are high now, look at the fact that the Chicago \nTribune looked at the fact that if we ceased to produce the 13 billion \ngallons of ethanol we make every year, as Senator Thune has pointed \nout, it would drive up prices at the pump by as much as $1.40 per \ngallon. I do not think that is something we can afford right now.\n  We have put together a good-faith proposal that basically even those \nwho have a lot of questions about biofuels right now, about ethanol, \nwill have to admit is a dramatic change. It ends VEETC as we know it. \nIt puts a big chunk of change, $1 billion--that otherwise would \nbe going to subsidies this year, right now--toward deficit reduction \nwhile still allowing for that infrastructure investment, and then \nlooking into next year for just some of the key pieces but severely \nchanging any kind of subsidy for this industry.\n\n  So with that, I thank Senator Thune. I do not know if the Senator has \nsomething else to add.\n\n[[Page S3734]]\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might add one point.\n  I think the Senator from Minnesota did point out that there are a \nsignificant number of jobs that are associated with this industry--in \nfact, one-half million jobs. They are American jobs. They are jobs in \nthe heartland of this country. They are jobs that help grow the \neconomy, make it more prosperous. It strikes me, at least, that what we \nought to be looking at is more jobs in this country and less investment \nin foreign regimes, where we get a lot of our energy today.\n  Mr. President, $1 billion a day is what we send outside the United \nStates because of our addiction to foreign oil. We have a dangerous \ndependence upon foreign energy, and we have a fuel that, as I said, \ndisplaces 445 million barrels of oil every single year--more than we \nimport from Saudi Arabia. That is a pretty remarkable number when you \nthink about it.\n  We had a debate here a few weeks ago on the floor of the Senate about \nwhether we ought to change tax policy with regard to oil companies. The \ndecision was reached that we should not do that; that it would be \npunitive, directed at oil companies. We decided, too, that it would \nraise taxes on gas for people in this country.\n  I would make the same argument today. We are talking about a tax \nincrease--a large tax increase--which we know is going to get passed \non. So we are talking about raising taxes on consumers at a time when \nthey can least afford it.\n  We have today 3\\1/2\\ to $4-a-gallon gasoline. The last thing \nconsumers in this country need is something that would actually push \nthat gas price higher. In fact, if we did away with biofuels \naltogether--which some people would like to do--there was a study out \nlast year, in 2010, that said the price per gallon of gasoline would go \nup by 89 cents a gallon. So we have a proposal here that would have an \nadverse impact on energy prices, fuel prices for people in this \ncountry, which, frankly, again, because of the commitment that was made \nlast December, strikes at the very heart of economic certainty, which \nso many of us come down here and talk about: the importance of having \npolicies in place that are reliable, that people who are investing in \nparticular areas of our economy can know they are going to be there, at \nleast when Congress makes a commitment.\n  This completely undermines the commitment Congress made back in \nDecember that this particular tax credit would be in place until the \nend of the year. So what the Senator from Minnesota and I have done is \npropose a path forward that we believe makes sense and that is a \nthoughtful, measured, reasonable, responsible way in which to get to \nthe goal that many of the proponents of the amendment that will be \nvoted on tomorrow want to get to; that is, to phase down the volumetric \nethanol excise tax credit. But it does it in a way that makes sense for \nAmerican consumers and those who have investments in the industry \ntoday.\n  So I hope my colleagues will take a look at this legislation. We \nthink we can get it moving this year. It does, as was noted by my \ncolleague from Minnesota, put a significant amount toward reducing the \ndebt, which I think is something all of our colleagues are very \ninterested in doing. So we will present this legislation, obviously, to \nour colleagues and hope there will be many who will choose to support \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor back to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, again, we just hope our colleagues will \nlook at this bill. It is a serious bill and very different than other \nbills that have been proposed in the past, and it actually takes \nexisting money that was set out for the end of this year and puts a big \nnumber--$1 billion--into debt reduction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/13/senate-section/article/S3734-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 207--SUPPORTING NATIONAL MEN'S HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. CRAPO submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

CLOSURE OF BIG OIL TAX LOOPHOLES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) gas prices have risen significantly largely in response \n     to unrest in north Africa and the Middle East, unrest that \n     speculators are capitalizing on to increase oil futures \n     prices and make huge profits;\n       (2) high gas prices are hurting the quality of life of \n     people of the United States, cutting into savings, and \n     jeopardizing jobs and the economic recovery of the United \n     States;\n       (3) implementation of the regulatory reforms enacted by \n     Congress in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \n     Protection Act (Public Law 111-203; 124 Stat. 1376) to \n     prevent energy market manipulation and control excessive \n     speculation has been delayed and has been threatened with \n     funding reductions in the House of Representatives;\n       (4) the United States is producing more oil than any time \n     in the last 13 years and companies hold abundant inventories \n     of oil, but the United States is still importing more than \n     11,000,000 barrels of oil per day and the Energy Information \n     Administration projects that full production in all onshore \n     and offshore areas would reduce gas prices by only 3 cents \n     per gallon by 2030;\n       (5) domestic refining capacity now exceeds United States \n     demand for refined petroleum products, resulting in increased \n     idle refinery capacity;\n       (6) oil companies are sitting idly on approximately \n     60,000,000 acres of leased Federal lands and waters \n     containing more than 11,000,000,000 barrels of oil and \n     59,000,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas;\n       (7) the United States possesses less than 2 percent of the \n     proven oil reserves of the world, yet consumes an \n     unsustainable 25 percent of the oil production of the world;\n       (8) the economy of the United States suffers huge net \n     losses in jobs and productivity from the growing annual trade \n     deficit in energy, due mainly to the outflow of \n     $250,000,000,000 or more to pay for foreign oil;\n       (9) world oil prices have risen steadily since the slow \n     beginning of the global economic recovery and, absent major \n     efficiency or conservation improvements or deployment of \n     alternative fuels, those oil prices are projected to remain \n     well above $100 per barrel or higher as world demand grows as \n     China, India and other countries industrialize;\n       (10) the oil production policies of cartel of the \n     Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are \n     a large determinant of the world price of oil, so the economy \n     of the United States will be affected by decisions of OPEC as \n     long as the United States depends on oil for a significant \n     portion of the energy consumption of the United States;\n       (11) the major oil companies have accumulated more than \n     $1,000,000,000,000 in net profits over the last 10 years and \n     collected more than $40,000,000,000 in tax breaks during the \n     same period, but have invested negligible amounts of those \n     funds into research and development of the production of \n     clean and renewable fuels made in the United States, leaving \n     consumers with few if any choices at the pump; and\n       (12) in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 \n     (42 U.S.C. 17001 et seq.), Congress increased fuel economy \n     standards for the first time in 30 years and established \n     ambitious requirements for domestic biofuels, actions that \n     have reduced oil consumption and reduced upward pressure on \n     gas prices.\n       (b) Sense of Senate on High Gas Prices.--It is the sense of \n     the Senate that--\n       (1) the President and Administration should be commended \n     for recognizing the severity of high gas prices and for \n     taking appropriate actions to help reduce gas prices, \n     including actions--\n       (A) to move forward with expeditious and responsible \n     domestic production in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere;\n       (B) to form a Task Force led by the Department of Justice \n     to investigate and eliminate oil and gas price gouging and \n     market manipulation;\n       (C) to establish a national oil savings goal to cut imports \n     by 33 percent by 2025;\n       (D) to call for 1,000,000 electric vehicles to be on the \n     road by 2015;\n       (E) to harmonize corporate average fuel standards under \n     section 32902 of title 49, United States Code, (CAFE) and \n     carbon pollution standards to achieve 1,800,000,000 barrels \n     in oil savings from new vehicles built before 2017, and \n     working with stakeholders to increase those savings from \n     future year vehicles;\n       (F) to establish the National Clean Fleets Partnership and \n     Green Fleet Initiative to reduce diesel and gasoline use in \n     fleets by incorporating electric vehicles, alternative fuels \n     like natural gas, and efficiency measures; and\n       (G) to clarify and expand the use of E-15 fuel for new \n     motor vehicles;\n       (2) Congress should take additional actions to complement \n     the efforts of the President, including enacting provisions--\n       (A) to encourage diligent and responsible development of \n     domestic oil and gas resources onshore and off-shore;\n       (B) to eliminate subsidies for major oil and gas companies \n     and use the savings to promote research, development, and \n     deployment of affordable alternative fuels and vehicles;\n       (C) to give consumers more choices at the pump and \n     incentives for buying vehicles that displace petroleum \n     consumption; and\n       (D) to direct and fund the Commodity Futures Trading \n     Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to rapidly \n     implement the energy consumer protection requirements of the \n     Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \n     (Public Law 111-203; 124 Stat. 1376);\n       (3) the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries \n     (OPEC) should contribute to the stabilization of world oil \n     markets and prices and reduce the burden of high gasoline \n     prices borne by the consumers in the United States by using \n     existing idle oil production capacity to compensate for any \n     supply shortages experienced in member countries; and\n       (4) the economic, environmental, and national security of \n     the United States depend on a sustained effort to drastically \n     reduce and eventually eliminate the dependency of the United \n     States on oil.\n       (c) Modifications of Foreign Tax Credit Rules Applicable to \n     Major Integrated Oil Companies Which Are Dual Capacity \n     Taxpayers.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 901 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is amended by redesignating subsection (n) as \n     subsection (o) and by inserting after subsection (m) the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(n) Special Rules Relating to Major Integrated Oil \n     Companies Which Are Dual Capacity Taxpayers.--\n       ``(1) General rule.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this chapter, any amount paid or

of the United States.\n       (d) Limitation on Section 199 Deduction Attributable to \n     Oil, Natural Gas, or Primary Products Thereof.--\n       (1) Denial of deduction.--Paragraph (4) of section

Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma has a strongly \nheld view about ethanol, particularly on this issue, on the VEETC, and \nI understand that. I understand there are\n\n[[Page S3739]]\n\nMembers who would like to see that particular tax credit go away. I \nunderstand that.\n  What the Senator from Minnesota and I have come up with is a way for \nthem to achieve that objective, but it does it in a way that is \nreasonable, measured, and which doesn't totally, in the middle of the \nyear, abruptly disrupt an industry and all of the investment that has \nbeen made.\n  The question I ask my colleague is, does our word mean anything \naround here? We passed this in December. There were 81 Senators who \nvoted for a package of tax extenders, one of which was the volumetric \nethanol excise tax credit. Eighty-one Senators are on record. If you \nwant to do away with it, there are lots of ways you can do that. But \nthe way the Senator from Oklahoma is proposing to do that is to say, \ntomorrow let's pass this and end it. It is $2.5 billion we can save the \ntaxpayers. Well, about $500 million a month is about what this is going \nto cost. With every month that goes by, there is a little less \navailable to the taxpayer.\n  What we are saying is that we put in a billion dollars today into \nthis proposal that would go toward debt retirement, and we phase out \nthe tax credit to which the Senator from Oklahoma refers, and we take a \nvery forward-looking, futuristic-type view toward ethanol production in \nthis country, biofuel production in this country. We are going to be \ncapped out at 15 billion gallons, which is the RFS, the renewable fuel \nstandard to which the Senator from Oklahoma referred. We are going to \nhit that. Then we have to get to the next generation of biofuels.\n  With all due respect to my colleague from Oklahoma, methanol is not a \nrealistic option. You would have to retool every plant in this country. \nWe have 204 plants in America today that, directly or indirectly, \nemploy 500,000 Americans. Those are the jobs that are impacted. We have \nhad policy on the books now for nearly 30 years that has encouraged the \ninvestment in these plants on the belief that we need to get beyond \ndependence on foreign sources of energy. That ought to be our energy \npolicy, and we ought to be looking to producing more.\n  I am for oil and gas. The reason I voted against the proposals \nleveled a couple weeks ago that would have targeted the oil and gas \nindustry is because I think we need all forms of energy--oil and gas, \nclean coal, biofuels, nuclear, and we need any form of energy we can \ngenerate and produce in the United States. I am for it. That is why I \nthink the future of this industry is still very bright, because I think \nthere is an advanced biofuels future out there, and a cellulosic \nethanol, next-generation ethanol, whatever you want to call it, where \nwe can make it from switch grass, from blue stem grass, from corn \nstover, and these types of products. That is out there. But you don't \nget there unless you have a corn-based platform to start with.\n  The Senator talked about a renewable fuel standard and talked about \nthis being redundant public policy. One of our colleagues from South \nCarolina introduced an amendment to this bill that would end that. I \nassume--I don't know this for a fact--that my colleague from Oklahoma \nwould support that amendment, which would do away with the renewable \nfuel standard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THUNE. Certainly.\n  Mr. COBURN. The Senator obviously didn't hear what I said. I said I \nsupport ethanol, and I would not support that. I have been upfront with \nthe Senator in the past, and you know my position on that.\n  So the question here--and I ask him a question: How do you fit what \nthe people who would get this $3 billion, who the Senator says they \ndon't want--why would they say that if it is going to have a negative \nimpact on their industry?\n  Mr. THUNE. Well, I say to my colleague from Oklahoma that I was not \naware he said he supports ethanol. I was not aware he supports the RFS. \nIf there is an amendment offered to strike the RFS, which there will \nbe--am I wrong in saying the Senator would oppose that amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will oppose that amendment. My worry is because of the \nprocess of the Senate, we may not get that amendment to vote on. My \ncolleague, as part of our leadership, would recognize that we have a \nproblem with amendments.\n  Mr. THUNE. I don't disagree with that. There is an issue I have not \nargued. It is your prerogative to bring this up and file cloture, which \nyou have done in this circumstance. I think the renewable fuels \nstandard that creates the sort of policy construct we are talking about \nhere today is one aspect of the biofuels policy going forward. The \nother aspect, going back for long time, historically, is the blenders \ncredit.\n  I will tell you--because the statement you made is all the people who \nget this don't want it--well, that is not true. The large integrated \noil companies, which are also refiners and, in many cases, retailers of \nrefined gasoline, don't want it, maybe. I understand you have a letter \nto that effect. But there are lots of smaller refiners who do want it.\n  There are also an awful lot of--the blenders credit gets passed on to \nthe retailer, which gets passed on to the consumer, hopefully. The \npeople who will be impacted by this are not just the large integrated \noil companies. If you talk about the large integrated oil companies, \nsaying they don't want this--they said in hearings before congressional \ncommittees a few years ago they didn't want the oil subsidies they get \nin the Tax Code today. They are on the record saying that. Yet we voted \nto keep those in place just a few weeks ago.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THUNE. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Would the Senator define what a subsidy is to him, \nbecause part of the problem with the debate is that we keep saying \n``subsidies.'' We don't have subsidies--not in the Senator's State or \nin Oklahoma. We have accelerated depreciation, which even if you took \nthat away, the dollars to the Federal Government would not increase. \nHow is there a subsidy to the oil and gas industry?\n  Mr. THUNE. When we characterize what you called tax expenditures, \nthere are a bunch that fall into that category. I know the Senator is \nfamiliar with that as he served on the President's debt commission. It \nis about $1.1 trillion a year. In some way or another, we reduce the \ntax liability of various individuals and businesses around the country. \nI don't disagree with you. In fact, I will work with the Senator on a \nproposal that would address this and look at all those types of tax \nexpenditures.\n  I think it is punitive to single out one and say we are going to kill \nthis one, after we committed in December, with 81 votes, that we are \nfor this. I don't know how we can, in good faith, go to this industry, \nwhich employs 500,000 Americans, and say we are going to pull the rug \nout from under you after 6 months.\n  That being said, I would characterize it as anything that reduces the \ntax liability that is public policy. I think it is characterized as tax \nexpenditures. The oil depletion allowance and the intangible drilling \ncosts--those are all things that are unique to the oil industry.\n  Mr. COBURN. Does it include charitable contributions--a subsidy, the \nsame category?\n  Mr. THUNE. If it is under the definition of tax expenditure, sure. \nOil depletion allowances and intangible drilling costs are \ncharacterized, for subsidy purposes, the same way as the ethanol tax \ncredit. We have lots of what we would characterize as tax credits and \nearned income tax credits in the Tax Code. We have lots of what is \ncharacterized as tax expenditures. You may characterize it differently, \nand that is accelerated depreciation, but in fact for the purposes of \ndescription, as we describe things here, it fits into that category.\n  The oil industry came in front of congressional committees and said \nthey didn't want those. So for them to say they don't want this \nparticular blenders credit--and my view certainly isn't determinative, \nbut I think the large integrated oil companies that get the blenders \ncredit also view ethanol as a threat. Like it or not, today the only \nviable alternative to petroleum--the only one we have--is 10 percent of \nour fuel supply in this country.\n  I am not debating the Senator from Oklahoma about whether the merits \nof this particular policy--at least in its current form--should not be \ntransformed and should be reformed; I am\n\n[[Page S3740]]\n\nsaying that we should. I have come to the Senator with a proposal to do \nthat. That is not something, obviously, that he agrees to. That is \nfine. He is entitled to not support that. But I believe we ought to \nreform it. I think the way we reform it is do it in a reasonable way \nthat doesn't cut it off tomorrow but, rather, phases it out.\n  I think that for the Senator from Oklahoma, to me, it is something \nthat is a win for him as well. He gets what he wants. He gets the \nphaseout, plus $1 billion in debt reduction, and if this thing goes to \nthe end of the year, we get zero. We get goose-egged.\n  This thing expires at the end of the year. Whether it gets extended \nor not remains to be seen. But one thing we know with certainty is that \nI am putting a proposal on the table today that gets $1 billion in \nreduction, that provides some certainty at least in phasing out the \nVEETC and also makes an investment in blender pumps, which is something \nthat is very important to the future of the industry.\n  So I think it is a reasonable way to deal with this issue.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma and I have a disagreement, and that is \nprobably not going to change. But I am offering what I think is a \nreasonable proposal that gets you where you want to end up and I think \nalso is a way in which we can keep this industry from having the rug \npulled out from under them after we made a commitment to them in \nDecember of last year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, let me make a couple of points.\n  When the Federal Government writes a tax credit, that means we take \nmoney from our Treasury, which is empty; therefore, we borrow it, and \nwe write a check to people. When we have an ``accelerated \nappreciation,'' what we do is allow people to pay less back in, a big \ndifference.\n  How many of the ethanol refineries and blenders are not represented \nby this group? It is about 11 percent. They all reside in the upper \nMidwest. That is why there is such a resistance to it.\n  When I met with the representatives of the ethanol industry, the \nreason they don't want the credit to go away is because they are afraid \nthat they won't be able to drive as hard a bargain with the large \nblenders of gasoline, that they will actually be able to determine what \ntheir grind cost is--in other words, what their true cost is.\n  The difference between what the Senator from Minnesota and the \nSenator from South Dakota offer is $2 billion. That is the only \ndifference. Theirs is just denial and spend $1 billion on pumps and \ninfrastructure--money we don't have--and mine is to say quit doing it \nbecause we are going to blend the ethanol anyway. That is the only \ndifference in the two programs. One continues to subsidize noneconomic \nblenders, obviously, because they want it--a very small portion. But \nthe vast majority of people are producing ethanol-blended gasoline. And \nthey say: How did they ever get to the point in our country where the \nFederal Government is going to tell you that you have to buy a gasoline \nthat is only 65 percent as efficient as the gasoline you were buying? \nAnd, oh, by the way, because it is only 65 percent efficient, it \nactually pollutes more. That is why in this list of people supporting \nthis are all the environmental groups, because they know it is bad \npolicy.\n  The reason I support a mandated level of ethanol is that until we \nhave a cogent drilling policy in this country that says we are going to \nactually utilize our own resources, we need to keep ethanol. But what \nreally ought to happen is we ought to let markets determine it. We will \nall be better off. We will have less government regulation, we will \nhave less Tax Code expenditure and the markets will determine what the \nmost efficient product is by what people will buy--what people will \nbuy, what they want to buy. It is called freedom.\n  We have gotten ourselves in this mix where, actually, what people \ndon't realize is we are down to only 47 percent of our oil coming into \nthis country is coming from outside now. We have moved from 62 down to \n47 percent, and the reason is because the oil and gas industry has \nactually gone out there and found an environmentally smart way to \nproduce tons of gas liquids, which are easier to convert into fuel than \nanything--easier than oil, easier than any other product we have.\n  So the Senator didn't really answer why the people who are getting \nthe money don't want it and yet we should continue sending it to them.\n  Ask yourself the question. We are broke, we are going to run a $1.4 \nor $1.5 or $1.6 trillion deficit this year and here is a way to save $3 \nbillion, and the people we are going to send the money to--and borrow \nthe money to be able to send it to them--don't want it. Yet they cannot \nanswer why they do not want it. This represents 97 percent of all the \nblending in the country. They don't want the money and we are going to \nsit here as a body and continue to send them money they do not want? Go \nhome and explain that to your constituents.\n  From which child are we going to take opportunity because we do not \nhave the courage to do the smart thing? We have a mandate. They have to \nblend it. They are making a ton of money.\n  One final point, and I will let the Senate staff go home. Every time \nyou go home to buy a gallon of gasoline today, the price you pay at the \npump is not the price you pay. If you look at all the subsidies that \nare going to ethanol, when you go look at that $3.75--or that $4 around \nhere, $3.50 in Oklahoma and Colorado--add $1.72 per gallon to it \nbecause that is what you paid in terms of the government support for \nthe ethanol program in terms of subsidies, $1.72 a gallon. You buy it \nfor $3.50, add $1.72, and you are paying $5.22 a gallon. You just don't \nknow that we have picked your pocket through the government \nexpenditures. Out of your taxes you paid, we pay them $1.72 per gallon. \nIt makes no sense. What this does is eliminate 45 cents of that. It \ndoesn't take it all away, the grants and the loans, the low-interest \nloans.\n  The other thing people do not recognize is most of the ethanol \nplants, even with this subsidy, have been bought out because they were \nnot economical because they did not know how to run them. That is why \nmost of them ended up with the large companies, because they did not \nknow how to run them, they were not efficient, and now they are \nprofitable even without the blenders credit.\n  It is a simple question: Do we save $3 billion or save $1 billion? I \ntell you, with what is in front of us as a Nation with our $14.3 \ntrillion debt, I am going to opt for the kids who follow us and the \ngrandkids. I am going for the $3 billion, not $1 billion.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/13/senate-section/article/S3740-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
